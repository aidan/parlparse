                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </font></b><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the sitting of the Assembly on Tuesday 10
                April 2001, a number of Members raised concerns about the
                procedure in respect of the opportunities for Members to reply
                when they have been referred to in a debate. I previously ruled
                on this matter on Monday 18 December 2000 — Hansard, Volume 8,
                No 3, page 79 refers. However, since there still seems to be
                some lack of clarity in the minds of Members, let me make one or
                two remarks on this issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A Member making a personal statement usually
                conveys matters of a personal nature to the House. An
                opportunity to reply may arise when a Member has been referred
                to in a particular way in a debate. The arrangements for
                personal statements are described in detail on page 312 of the
                twenty-second edition of ‘Erskine May’. Personal statements
                with regard to matters of a personal nature are taken before the
                start of public business and require the leave of the Speaker.
                These statements are not subject to intervention or debate, and
                I require that the text of such a statement be made available to
                me in advance.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members may not depart from the agreed text,
                and no debate or other comments should subsequently ensue.
                However, when the matter referred to in the statement relates to
                another Member, he or she will be allowed to give a further
                brief view on the matter and to say whether the statement is
                accepted. I expect Members to restrict their comments to the
                issues raised in the statement, and I will not in any
                circumstances permit prolonged or repeated verbal exchanges on
                matters raised in a personal statement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members know that other avenues of recourse
                are available to them in respect of differences between Members.
                They can be dealt with through the Committee on Standards and
                Privileges, formally by way of a private Member’s motion or
                through contact with the relevant Whip’s offices.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In respect of an opportunity to reply to
                accusations made of them by another Member, Members have sought
                advice on how they may respond in situations where they are
                referred to by name in a debate. Page 386 of the twenty-second
                edition of ‘Erskine May’ advises that Members must conduct
                business in a spirit of &quot;good temper and moderation&quot;.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It also provides that Members should</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;guard against all appearance of
                personality in debate&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While that may come as a substantial
                disappointment to some Members, the maintenance of good order
                and parliamentary decorum requires the application of this
                principle to the proceedings of the Assembly. However, I regret
                that some Members have on occasions alleged that other Members
                have been involved in unlawful activity when the Member has not
                been convicted of the named offence.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If it is requested and seems appropriate, I
                will, on occasion, permit an opportunity of reply to those of
                whom specific reference has been made in relation to breaches of
                the law and where there has been no conviction. However, I will
                not permit an opportunity of reply in other circumstances, and
                certainly not when accusations of a purely political nature are
                made. An opportunity to reply will be made available at a
                suitable time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I note from Hansard that a number of points
                of order were raised regarding unparliamentary language. I have
                studied those, and while I am clear that none of the comments
                were any ornament to the debate or to the Official Report, they
                do not seem to be unparliamentary. However, it is hoped that
                they do not become habitual language in the Chamber.</p>

                in its tourism sectoral format held on 30 March 2001 in
                Letterkenny.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and
                Investment (Sir Reg Empey):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Following nomination by the First Minister
                and the Deputy First Minister, Dr Seán Farren and I represented
                the Northern Ireland Administration at the tourism sector
                meeting of the North/South Ministerial Council. The Irish
                Government were represented by Dr James McDaid TD, Minister for
                Tourism, Sport and Recreation. This report has been approved by
                Dr Farren and is also made on his behalf.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council noted a formal progress report on
                the establishment of the new tourism company and also received
                an update from Ms Ann Riordan, vice-chairperson of Tourism
                Ireland Ltd and Mr Felix Mooney, a member of the board. Work is
                progressing on the further development of Tourism Brand Ireland,
                marketing programmes for 2002, staffing structures and proposals
                for the company’s Dublin and Coleraine offices. The Council
                considered and approved the draft codes of conduct for board
                members and for the staff of Tourism Ireland Ltd.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council also discussed a paper jointly
                produced by the Department of Higher and Further Education,
                Training and Employment and the Department of Tourism, Sport and
                Recreation in conjunction with the Council for Education,
                Recruitment and Training (CERT), the Irish tourism and
                hospitality training authority. The paper outlined the support
                mechanisms and training arrangements for the tourism and
                hospitality sector in both parts of this island and referred to
                joint initiatives already undertaken. The paper also identified
                key areas where joint activities in both jurisdictions would be
                beneficial. It put forward possible future initiatives for
                consideration by the appropriate Departments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ministers discussed the serious implications
                of the foot-and-mouth crisis for the tourism industry North and
                South. They reiterated the determination of both Administrations
                to combat the crisis in every way possible. Ministers also
                expressed their determination to ensure that the future of
                tourism in both parts of this island is positive and that its
                potential is realised to the full. The council also approved the
                provision of IR£1,500 per annum to Ms Ni Fheargusa as the board
                member nominated to assist the chairperson of Foras na Gaeilge.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy Chairperson of the Enterprise,
                Trade and Investment Committee (Mr&nbsp;Neeson):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In view of the adverse publicity that
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland, Ireland and the British Isles are getting
                due to the foot-and-mouth outbreak, does the Minister have any
                special plans to promote Northern&nbsp;Ireland, particularly in
                North America? His counterpart is currently visiting the United
                States to deal with that issue. What involvement did
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland have in the recent visit of international
                tour operators to the United Kingdom?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the Member will know, I recently launched
                a substantial recovery plan that had been prepared by the
                Tourist Board in consultation with the industry. That will
                involve a series of activities spread over the next couple of
                months in North&nbsp;America — both in Canada and the United
                States. I am currently looking at whether, and when, I should
                attend. A programme has already been prepared and is under
                active consideration.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am aware that Dr&nbsp;McDaid is currently
                in the United States. We were not consulted by the British
                Tourist Authority (BTA) about the arrangements. As Northern
                Ireland was almost clear of the disease at that stage, the
                authority hoped that we would be able to market ourselves as a
                completely disease-free area. Therefore, we were not included in
                that visit. It was also argued that the time required to
                transport people to Northern Ireland would have been prohibitive
                in view of the very strict timetable.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McClarty:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is my belief that the Irish Minister, Dr
                James McDaid, has gone to the United States of America on a tour
                promoting Ireland as a whole, and it is my understanding that
                tourism in Ireland is to be promoted as a whole. Did the
                Minister approach Dr&nbsp;McDaid to find out whether there was a
                possibility of a joint promotion between Northern&nbsp;Ireland
                and the Republic of Ireland?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That was mooted at a press conference
                following the Council’s meeting in Letterkenny, and I stated
                my willingness to participate in such a promotion. However,
                Dr&nbsp;McDaid has proceeded with his own promotion. Tomorrow I
                will attend a meeting in Glasgow of all four United Kingdom
                tourism Ministers. I hope to find out what joint promotion
                activities we can undertake. I also hope to examine the
                experiences of other tourism Ministers to see what we can learn
                from them and what advice we can translate into practical action
                to help many of our struggling businesses.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr McDonnell:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister for his statement. I
                strongly welcome it and the details about the new all-island
                tourist company. I have a fear, a suspicion, a worry that
                perhaps there is a risk that we will abandon our
                responsibilities and leave everything to this new company in the
                hope that it will solve our problems. Even before foot-and-mouth
                disease we badly needed to refocus and restructure our
                responsibilities to make the Northern Ireland Tourist Board (NITB)
                more effective to carry out the responsibilities not contained
                in the new all-island tourist company.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Can the Minister tell us if there is anything
                moving on that front? If not, perhaps he could tell us when
                something will be moving? Those responsibilities are every bit
                as vital. If we do not have our act together, the all-island
                tourist company will not function for us as well as it should.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Member for his comment. He used
                the words &quot;a fear, a suspicion, a worry&quot; that we are
                leaving everything to the new company. I assure him that that is
                not the case. This is primarily a marketing company the main
                function of which is to create a brand and market it
                internationally, and the creative nature of that work is
                proceeding. Consultants are already at work. We have not yet
                seen the draft proposals for 2002, but we must nevertheless
                remember its main function.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Tourist Board is currently preparing a
                three-year plan. Action is therefore underway with regard to
                refocusing its activities. That is necessary because of the
                changed circumstances. As the Member will know, the NITB gives
                grants similar to those given by the IDB and other
                organisations. The administrative part of that is being
                transferred to the new Economic Development Agency, but the
                primary function of the NITB will continue to be promotion, and
                it will have regulatory functions. The board is part-owner of
                the company, and its chairperson and chief executive are
                directors, so there is no way in which we are going to see a
                situation develop in which the NITB does not have — any more
                than Bord Fáilte does not have — an overview of tourism as a
                whole in Northern Ireland. I can assure the Member that we do
                not intend to leave everything to this new company.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While I welcome the Minister’s statement,
                it was somewhat bland in character. It was similar to those
                issued after the meetings of many North/South bodies —
                &quot;We had a meeting, made a couple of decisions, doled out a
                bit of money, issued a press statement and then went home&quot;.
                Members would like more detail about what exactly happened. For
                example, have the minutes of these meetings been made available
                to anyone? Perhaps they could be made available to the
                appropriate Assembly Committee so that they could be probed in
                detail, we would know what was going on, and there could be a
                more standard consultation process.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Minister accept my view that the BTA
                initiative was extremely unfortunate? While we accept that it
                might have been difficult to bring all the incoming tour
                operators to Northern Ireland, at the very least the Minister or
                a leading NITB official should have been invited to address
                them, give them an insight into Northern Ireland and tell them
                that Northern Ireland is still open for tourist business.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a much more serious matter, the Northern
                Ireland tourist industry is facing a crisis on a par with that
                faced by the agriculture industry — particularly in South
                Down. In any of his recent negotiations, has the Minister made
                any proposals to the Executive on a consequential loss package
                to make up for the millions of pounds already lost by the
                tourist industry?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are a number of matters there. The
                Member will know that a synopsis of the proceedings of these
                bodies is sent on a regular basis to the Enterprise, Trade and
                Investment Committee. That is now done routinely following a
                request from the Committee. After each meeting I make a
                statement to the Assembly, and we have questions, as is
                happening at the moment. All the matters discussed at the
                meeting are contained in the statement. In the synopsis, items
                such as the agenda for the meeting are made available to the
                Committee. Everyone can therefore see the matters that we are
                discussing, except perhaps personnel issues that it would not be
                appropriate to detail. Nothing is being discussed which does not
                appear in the synopsis.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I accept, and agree with, what the Member
                said about the BTA. I was annoyed that the situation happened
                the way it did. The explanation which was forthcoming was also
                unfortunate. Officials from the BTA will be present at the
                meeting in Glasgow tomorrow of UK Tourism Ministers, and I hope
                to have the opportunity to pursue the matter directly with those
                officials.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the broader point about consequential
                loss, my Department is currently dealing with 36 cases of
                businesses that are showing signs of distress. These vary from
                companies that have sustained losses of 10% to 25% to those that
                have had their income taken away from them entirely. I am aware
                that that affects the Member’s constituency and, indeed, the
                constituencies of other Members.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I must make a point here. The Minister of
                Agriculture and Rural Development made it clear yesterday that
                some people were still defying the advice given by her
                Department from the outset of this foot-and-mouth disease
                outbreak in relation to the movement of animals. Unlicensed
                movements of animals are still taking place. The people involved
                in these movements — although they may be a tiny minority of
                the agriculture community — are putting in jeopardy the
                livelihoods of thousands of people in the Province. People have
                tried to build up businesses over the years, and these are being
                put in jeopardy by a handful of people who are behaving in an
                irresponsible and selfish manner.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This House can send out the message that
                people must not move animals without a licence. Irresponsible
                people have brought the disease in and are spreading it in the
                Province. Such actions are grossly irresponsible, and that is
                why the Executive are urgently studying what steps to take. I
                will also be asking tomorrow about what steps are to be taken
                nationally and what help is to be provided from the contingency
                reserve. These are matters that we cannot be expected to handle
                on our own.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Courtney:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I too welcome the Minister’s statement and
                the fact that attention is being given to the impact of the
                foot-and-mouth disease outbreak on the tourism industry,
                particularly rural tourism.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Republic is currently having a major
                drive in the USA and is using the services of high-profile
                performers such as U2 to get the message across that the
                Republic is a place to visit. Has the Minister any plans to use
                a similar strategy for Northern Ireland? In his statement the
                Minister said that key areas had been identified where joint
                activities in both jurisdictions would be beneficial. Can he
                outline some of the initiatives that could be taken?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The latter point relates to actions that my
                Colleague Dr Seán Farren could be taking in his Department with
                regard to training and identifying common areas. As the Member
                will be aware, there has been co-operation for some considerable
                time, and a representative of CERT — the Irish Government’s
                hospitality training body — was present at the meeting
                alongside representatives from Dr Farren’s Department. They
                are looking at proposals which I hope will be brought to the
                next meeting. I will, of course, report to the House on the
                detail.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am very conscious of the need to get the
                message across, and we are looking at what we can do in overseas
                markets. I made it clear that I was prepared to do joint work
                with other UK Ministers or with Dr McDaid, but it takes two to
                tango, and it is up to them to make up their own minds.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As far as we are concerned, we have launched
                our own campaign in all the European and North American markets
                where the bulk of our overseas visitors come from. However, as
                the Member understands, we are dealing with a very deep-seated
                misconception, particularly on the part of people from North
                America. They start from the assumption that, in some cases,
                your hands and feet fall off as a result of the disease. That is
                what some people truly believe. We have to get more exposure to
                make people realise the facts. Last year there were outbreaks of
                anthrax in the United States, and that is a far more serious
                disease than foot-and-mouth, by any stretch of the imagination.
                Nevertheless, Americans still expect us to visit North America.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have an extremely difficult task, one that
                will require consistent effort over the next few months to save
                next year’s business at least.</p>
                <b>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Minister have any plans to give
                financial aid to hotels and to bed-and-breakfast establishments
                to help them over this crisis? Was this discussed at the meeting
                on 30 March?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The subject of compensation for businesses in
                Northern Ireland would not have been discussed at the meeting in
                March. The matter is being examined by a special working party
                set up by the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister. They
                have asked each of the relevant Departments for input on how its
                sector is being affected. My Department has responded. I have
                indicated to the House that we are currently dealing with 36
                cases of people in difficulty. As Members know, some interim
                steps have been taken with regard to short-term assistance for
                companies to alleviate some of the problems — for example, the
                Inland Revenue and the Customs and Excise have helplines and are
                offering deferments regarding PAYE and VAT. The Rate Collection
                Agency has a helpline and is offering deferment. We accept that
                these measures merely put off having to pay a bill, but in the
                short term that can be very significant.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is also a more long-term benefit in the
                small firms loan guarantee scheme. This is a UK-wide scheme,
                which has now been amended to include the hospitality sector. I
                have written to the banks; I have pointed out that this loan
                guarantee scheme is available, and I have asked them to exercise
                sensitivity and discretion in their dealings with people from
                this sector. We await the report form the working party to see
                what is available. I repeat that I will also be waiting to see
                what will be done nationally. The Prime Minister and the
                Government have made it clear that they have got to help
                businesses and industries to get back on their feet. However, so
                far, as the saying goes, the Chancellor’s two arms are
                &quot;the one length&quot;.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dallat:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister for his endeavours to
                deal with the crisis in the tourist industry. Will he confirm
                that the next meeting of the North/South Ministerial Council
                will be held in Coleraine? As the new tourism company is to be
                based in that town, does he agree that this will be a highly
                significant occasion, given the importance of the tourism
                company to the Causeway coast? Finally, does he agree that the
                new tourism company has a critical role to play, given the
                present crisis in the tourist industry caused by foot-and-mouth
                disease and the important lessons to be learned from that sad
                experience?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The next tourism meeting of the NSMC will be
                held in Northern Ireland. The precise location has not been
                determined, but the Member has put an idea into my head. The
                Coleraine office is one of the matters that we regularly refer
                to, in both correspondence and discussions between us. I am
                looking forward to its establishment. It will have a very
                significant role to play.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Moyle and Coleraine areas have suffered
                major blows to tourism in the last few weeks, particularly with
                the cancellation of the North West 200. We are anxiously waiting
                for an announcement on the suspected case of foot-and-mouth
                disease in Ballintoy, and we hope for good news there. However,
                there has been a major hit to one of our most important tourism
                areas. There is no disguising that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The primary function of the tourism company
                is to increase the market of international visitors to both
                jurisdictions. As the Member is aware, more than 70% of our
                international visitors come to Northern Ireland via the
                Republic. We must increase that number, however, and get more
                people who visit the Republic to come to Northern Ireland.
                Indeed, parts of the Republic are very anxious to get people to
                visit their areas — Donegal and other places feel even more
                isolated than Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is not simply a Northern Irish issue —
                it is a geographical issue. To get more people who visit areas
                such as Cork, Kerry and Dublin to come up north is a major
                exercise, the success of which the company will be judged upon.
                We will at least be able to measure what it achieves, even
                though the particular circumstances of this year will make it
                extremely difficult to use that as a benchmark.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Hay:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a perception that the whole emphasis
                of the foot-and-mouth epidemic seems to be on the farming
                industry and on the financial package available for farmers.
                There is nothing at all wrong with that. The Minister has
                commented on the tourism industry, but, given the serious nature
                of the issue, can he tell the House when decisions will be made
                to try to help the tourism industry across Northern Ireland?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a feeling abroad in Northern Ireland
                that the longer the disease goes on and the longer it takes for
                decisions to be made on how aid goes to the tourism industry,
                the worse the problem will become. The quicker those decisions
                are made, the better. Does the Minister have a timescale for
                that?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We all sympathise with those in the
                agriculture community, some of whom have seen a life’s work
                literally go up in smoke before them. There is no way that
                anyone cannot be deeply affected by that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is also a misconception that a farmer
                who loses his or her animals is compensated for the loss of the
                capital asset — the animals. They are not compensated for a
                future loss of income, nor are they compensated for the years,
                and indeed generations, that it would take to rebuild a herd,
                particularly a pedigree herd. Farmers are not getting a bonanza
                from this — their livelihoods have stopped. They cannot put
                animals back on their land for months, and their income is, of
                course, nil.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have previously made it clear that I regard
                people in the tourism sector as often being the forgotten
                victims of this crisis. The income of people who own
                guesthouses, for instance a husband and wife, has not just
                dropped — in some cases it has stopped, but the costs
                continue. I cannot emphasise enough that we are very conscious
                of that. That is why I expressed anger at the irresponsible
                actions of a very tiny minority who are giving the agriculture
                sector a bad name that it does not deserve.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In so far as timescale is concerned the
                matter is critical. I cannot be precise, but I expect that it
                will be possible to identify what we can do in the next two
                weeks. However, that is subject to what happens nationally, and
                we must understand that we cannot assume that it is appropriate
                for us to take the entire burden here. The contingency reserve
                is there to help in a national emergency — this is a national
                emergency. I am looking to the Chancellor to divvy up the
                contingency reserve and help, bearing in mind that
                foot-and-mouth disease was imported to the Province; it did not
                start here.</p>

                condemnation of those who imported the foot-and- mouth plague.
                Mavericks spread it, and it is threatening the community. We
                have been trying to create farm diversification in west Tyrone
                for six years. We have encouraged many farm businesses that were
                finding it difficult to survive to try to diversify. Many of
                those businesses have been singularly hit, not only by the
                agriculture crisis, but also by their dependence on a
                diversification that was also agriculturally related or
                dependent. The situation is beginning to have a serious impact
                in west Tyrone. Sperrins Tourism Ltd launched the
                &quot;kick-start&quot; initiative on a Thursday, and on the
                Friday it was struck in the teeth by the outbreak at Ardboe.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I appeal to the Minister to consider this
                matter nationally and, as soon as he can, to give us a
                timetable. Survival in west Tyrone is critical for our
                agriculture community and for those who depend on it.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member is right that, for some time now,
                we have been encouraging people in rural areas to add another
                string to their bow. The reason for that is that agriculture has
                been suffering for several years for a wide variety of reasons
                that are structural and will not go away. Even if we get over
                the foot-and-mouth crisis — when we get over the crisis —
                those problems will remain.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have encouraged and grant-aided people. We
                have put public funds into physical diversification, whether in
                the form of conversions, the erection of chalets, or whatever.
                Marketing assistance is offered, and, indeed, computer bookings
                are also available. There is no doubt that in encouraging people
                to move from an industry that was under enormous pressure, they
                have been encouraged to move into another industry that is also
                under enormous pressure. The Member is perfectly right to draw
                attention to the matter.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The consequential effects of foot-and-mouth
                disease are far reaching. It is almost impossible to draw a
                clean line around the sectors that are affected; they go far and
                wide. A comment by Mr Bell of the Institute of Directors in the
                business section of the ‘News Letter’ today draws attention
                to these issues. I sympathise with the Member.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I notice that some people in the north-west
                are considering proposals to run a festival as opposed to the
                North West 200. If those people have a proposal and draw it to
                the Tourist Board’s attention, it will be looked at as
                sympathetically as possible. It may be that that example could
                be followed in other areas. I am sure that Sperrins Tourism Ltd
                will not be behind the door in coming forward with ideas.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister has rightly recognised the
                effects of the foot-and-mouth disease on the tourist industry.
                It has been confirmed in today’s papers that the Balmoral Show
                will be cancelled this year, resulting in the loss of some £6
                million of income and revenue to the area. What steps will be
                taken to compensate people who have lost bed spaces as a result
                of the cancellation of the show? What study will be done into
                the impact of this on the capitalist structures —</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order. The Minister has been fairly generous
                in his preparedness to respond to matters broadly within his
                remit, even though they did not arise from the North/South
                Ministerial Council statement. The question that the Member is
                asking falls somewhat outside, not only the issues covered in
                the statement, but issues covered by the Assembly. Perhaps the
                Member does not recognise that, as he was not in the House to
                hear the statement. If that is the case, it would be wrong to
                press further on the Minister’s generosity by asking him to
                respond to a question that deals with a matter well outside his
                area of responsibility.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Shannon:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I read the Minister’s statement prior to
                entering the Chamber, so I am aware of its contents.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will ask two other questions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first relates to consequential loss. Can
                the Minister look at how that is going to affect the country’s
                sports and leisure activities in relation to the North/South
                body and the relationship that the Tourist Board has with local
                councils? In my own area, the local council has been very active
                in promoting tourism across Northern Ireland and further afield
                in the Republic of Ireland, the United Kingdom and Europe. What
                relationship does the Tourist Board have with local councils in
                trying to help promote those areas specifically, and others
                further afield?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not know quite where to begin. The
                Member for Strangford is always creative in these matters.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We all deeply regret yesterday’s
                announcement. The Balmoral Show is one of the highlights of
                Northern Ireland’s year, not only for the tourism and
                agriculture sector, but beyond that, because it attracts people
                who otherwise would have no connection with agriculture
                whatsoever. It is a huge blow.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We do not want to see people lose out as a
                result of this crisis. However, we would be naïve in the
                extreme to believe that, even if there were no financial
                constraints upon us, everybody is going to come out of this as
                if nothing has happened. That is just not the case, and the
                Member knows that. Certainly, we are looking at the financial
                and economic impact of this crisis on all sectors. Within a week
                or two we should have a report, and the Executive will be able
                to make recommendations at that stage.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Regional tourism organisations are supported
                by the Tourist Board and will continue to be supported by the
                Tourist Board. They will have a role to play in the recovery
                programme, as it will be necessary for those organisations to do
                some of their own marketing work. The Tourist Board will look at
                any proposals that may be advanced by those organisations. Of
                course, not every local authority is in a regional tourism
                organisation, but where there are proposals and suggestions from
                the local authorities, they should be brought to the Tourist
                Board as quickly as possible, while we are considering this.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The whole issue comes down to cash. At the
                moment, the Tourist Board is spending money that, strictly
                speaking, it does not have. I have made it clear to the board
                that it is to take whatever steps it feels are necessary and
                appropriate. It will be my task in the months ahead to find the
                resources for that. However, local authorities have a
                contribution to make, and I have little doubt that those
                directly affected will be generous in their resource
                allocations.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That the Private Streets (Construction)
                (Amendment) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2001 be approved.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Regulations amend the Private Streets
                (Construction) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 1994, which set
                out the standards and detailed requirements for the construction
                of private streets in new housing developments. The 1994
                Regulations provided for the deposit and approval of plans and
                for the giving of notice for the commencement and completion of
                various stages of work. They also provided for the inspection of
                work, carrying out of investigations and tests and the taking of
                samples to ensure that work was in conformity with the
                regulations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The proposed changes are necessary to
                implement the provisions of the primary legislation — the
                Private Streets (Amendment) (Northern Ireland) Order 1992 —
                which placed responsibility for the provision of street lighting
                in new developments on the developers. The effect of the
                proposed amendments to the Regulations will be to introduce
                changes in two distinct areas. First, regulation 15(a) and
                schedule 8 prescribe standards for the provision of street
                lighting in private streets. Secondly, they amend regulation 20
                of the 1994 Regulations to extend the specified expenses to
                include the cost of inspection of street works during
                construction and to provide for the bearing of such costs by
                developers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Consequential amendments relating to the
                deposit and approval of plans — regulation 3(8) — the notice
                of commencement of stages of work — regulation 3(9) — and
                detailed requirements for goods and materials to be used in the
                construction of streets — regulation 3(13) — have been made.
                In addition, references in the 1994 Regulations to various
                technical publications have been updated.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The proposed Regulations were circulated for
                comment to the Construction Employers’ Federation, Northern
                Ireland Electricity, the Northern Ireland Housing Executive and
                other public bodies. The comments received by my Department
                during the consultation period have been taken into account in
                the Regulations now before the Assembly.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Regional Development
                Committee (Mr A Maginness):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Minister’s statement. Because
                of the legislation, developers will not only have to comply with
                prescribed standards, but they will have to meet the cost of
                inspections. That is not an unfair burden. It is important that
                we note that, and I welcome that move. It is also fair to say
                that, following widespread public consultation, there was a
                general welcome for the measures. The Minister has made a
                progressive step that the public will welcome.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall not detain the House unduly on such
                straightforward Regulations, but I ask the Minister to ensure
                that the Department for Regional Development puts in place
                stringent inspection standards for street lighting before it
                adopts a road as a public road. I am sure that my fellow members
                of the Regional Development Committee will agree. It is all very
                well for the Minister to introduce the Regulations and put the
                burden on developers, but developers will take short cuts and
                will not comply properly with the standards that have been laid
                down by the House.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The anticipated saving of £1·5 million is
                to be welcomed. I ask the Minister to ensure that the money that
                is saved as a result of the implementation of these regulations
                and the carrying of the burden by the developers will be used
                for further road development by the Department. It would be the
                best use of these savings if the money were ploughed back into
                the road network, which is sorely in need of additional funding,
                as the Minister and the House will recognise. Small amount
                though it may be, £1·5 million would be very welcome.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also have a concern, which I am sure is
                reflected by other members of the Committee, that developers may
                seek to pass on the additional costs to house purchasers. I ask
                the Minister to assure the House that these costs will not be
                added on to house prices and that developers will bear them. It
                would be unfair if house buyers were to be further burdened with
                additional costs that rightly should be borne by the developers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee in its consideration of these
                Regulations was supportive, and I reiterate my welcome, as
                Chairperson, and that of the Committee for them.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I too welcome the Regulations and support the
                Chairperson’s remarks. Will the Minister clarify the timing
                factor? In many developments we see houses completed but the
                infrastructure, the roads and the lighting have been left in an
                extremely rough state. How long will a developer be allowed to
                leave an estate like that before he is obliged to comply with
                the Regulations? This often happens where a developer has built
                one group of houses and is hoping to move on to a second group.
                He will try to leave the infrastructure unfinished until he has
                built his second batch. We need to have a clear idea of how long
                a builder will be allowed before he must fulfil his obligations
                under these Regulations. I welcome them again.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Hay:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I too very much welcome the Minister’s
                statement this morning. The Deputy Chairperson of the Committee
                asked a very important question. We have all seen, especially as
                council representatives, that it can take many years for roads
                to be adopted. It has taken over 20 years for some roads in my
                constituency to be adopted.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need to be very clear on this, because
                developers can take quite a while to finish anything. My fear is
                that they might also throw street lighting into that. We need
                clear assurances from the Minister that contractors will not be
                able to treat street lighting in the same way as they treat the
                finishing of roads. Is there a developer who is creating
                problems with the finishing of street lighting? What penalty
                points will be given to him? With regard to roads and adopted
                roads, a bond exists at the moment, but that bond can be taken
                away if the Department feels that it must finish a road itself.
                Will this also apply to street lighting?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Byrne:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the proposals as the Regulations in
                Northern Ireland are now in line with other regions of the UK.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important that the £1·5&nbsp;million
                savings be retained within the Department. It could be used for
                improvement to roads in either small capital works programmes,
                or in road maintenance schemes. The developer is being asked to
                incur only a marginal extra cost to a development, and that
                should not cause any undue extra financial burden.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Hay made reference to many unadopted
                roads. There are roads throughout Northern Ireland —
                particularly in urban areas — that have never been adopted,
                causing pain to many householders. Will the Minister look at
                this issue soon?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Wells:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is the Minister aware that one of the losses
                incurred by this decision is that his Department for Regional
                Development has decided to move the design consultancy street
                lighting service from Downpatrick to Lisburn? That means the
                loss of three jobs in Downpatrick, and those staff will be moved
                to Lisburn. Does the Minister accept that I have made numerous
                representations to his Department to move the new unit to
                Downpatrick, thus creating 12 new jobs? Will he agree to discuss
                this issue with me? It is a matter of great concern that we are
                losing jobs from south Down to the greater Belfast area.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr O’Connor:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the announcement, and, on a
                constituency note, I would like to see the £1·5 million being
                diverted to East Antrim.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The onus is now going to be placed on the
                developer. Mr McFarland said that developers build small
                clusters of houses as phase 1, phase 2 and phase 3, and when
                they get to phase 5 or 6, the roads in phase 1 are still not
                adopted. My concern is that the same thing will happen with
                street lighting. It will be left to the end, and the limited
                company will suddenly go out of business — having made its
                profit from the houses — without having had the financial
                implications of having to provide street lighting and other
                facilities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Once a certain number of houses have been
                built, could the street lighting be provided for those houses
                prior to starting the next phase? If a developer were to go
                under, the Department would not be left with the financial
                responsibility for a developer who has already made quite a
                hefty profit.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Hay mentioned that a large number of roads
                have remained unadopted for 20 years. That seems to happen
                throughout Northern Ireland. Is there any way that the
                Department can put the ball firmly in the developer’s court so
                that if one developer defaults in his obligations, he cannot
                create a new company and repeat the process? Cowboy builders
                have set up companies and sub-companies in the past without any
                overall responsibility.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They all seem to have the same structure —
                all the profits go back to the same person, but the company is
                actually split into four or five different parts for
                convenience.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister for his initiative.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am going to take advantage of this occasion
                to ask the Minister a question posed to me yesterday by a
                constituent living in Robinson Road in Bangor. The census
                enumerator noticed that she did not have street lights, and my
                constituent asked me to ask the Minister what she should do
                about that. She lives in a new development, and in the context
                of these Regulations, I would like to know to whom my
                constituent can turn to get street lighting put in. With the
                onus being on the developer under these new Regulations, if
                there are not enough street lights, will constituents be able to
                go to the developer and ask for street lights to be put in?
                Also, who will be responsible for the upkeep of this lighting?
                Obviously, the more serious question is the huge importance of
                street lighting for safety in these areas, especially for women.
                Finally, what about trees? Will there be any onus on developers
                to plant trees as well?</p>

                becoming apparent that Members believe this to be a statement on
                which they can ask questions. It is, in fact, legislation, and
                speeches can be made. I have only just discovered this after
                asking my question. I could have gone on for half an hour about
                the plight of the street lighting section in Downpatrick, but

                is somewhat surprising that the Member has not read the Order
                Paper, which makes it clear that this is a motion for the
                passage of Regulations — that is secondary legislation, as he
                has said. It is not a statement by the Minister; it is a motion
                for the passage of secondary legislation. The Member is correct
                that speeches are appropriate. Whether the Chair would have been
                content for him to go on for half an hour is another matter, but
                this does give Members an opportunity to speak. However, I
                should point out that it is the passage of a piece of

                of a constituency question on the passage of a piece of primary

                this legislation is going to kick in? In other words, precisely
                when will this legislation start?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My second point is in relation to the bond,
                which has already been mentioned by Cllr Hay. In Omagh we have a
                no-man’s-land —</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order. I really wonder how much Members have
                prepared themselves for this debate. One Member has just said
                that he did not realise that it was a motion rather than a
                statement. A second has now raised the profoundly important
                question — he says — of when this will come into effect. I
                point the Member to the first paragraph of the Regulations,
                where it says that they shall come into operation on 1 May 2001.
                It is not in order for Members to waste the time of the Minister
                or the House by asking questions on things that they have not
                looked up, which are not only relevant, but are, indeed, the
                matters on which the House will be voting.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I stand corrected, Mr Speaker.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My last question is the most important of
                all. Will this not add to the cost of houses? After all, who
                pays for all of this? I wish to be assured by the Minister that
                for those people who wish to purchase property, there will not
                be an added bill that prohibits them from doing so.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will certainly not be asking any questions
                about the Balmoral Show or anything else. I will be specific to
                the issue. I am glad that the street lighting legislation will
                bring us into line with the UK mainland, and I welcome the
                Minister’s statement. However, at the same time it is
                important that the responsibility falls upon the shoulders of
                the developers. We all hope to see that, and this legislation
                will enable that to happen.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have a couple of questions, and they are
                not to do with my constituency; they are specific to the
                legislation. Is there a deadline by which a developer must
                provide street lights, and who will ensure that this is adhered
                to and that people have sufficient street lighting?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In relation to the development itself, again
                it comes down to monitoring the street lighting that is
                installed. Who will ensure that a developer has the expertise to
                install street lighting to meet the standards of the Department,
                and who will ensure that it is brought up to the standard that
                will enable the Department to adopt and look after it?</p>

                will try to respond to Members in very generic terms.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A number of Members raised the issue of the
                savings that will result from the legislation. There will be a
                saving of £1·5 million, and I assure Members that I will look
                at how that can be utilised and what benefit it can bring.
                Obviously, there are people who have campaigned on rural street
                lighting and other issues, and those issues will have to be
                looked at in the light of this saving.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Wells raised the design unit. I responded
                previously, and I will respond again on a separate occasion. On
                the commencement of the onus being on the developer, all those
                matters will be raised in the Roads Service, and it will ensure
                that the bond that any developer takes out to construct private
                streets includes an element which has street lighting as an
                essential part of it. If there is any failure on the part of a
                developer, that section of the bond can be used to ensure that
                the work continues.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We will also use best practice from the rest
                of the UK and other parts of Europe to ensure that the best
                parts of legislation elsewhere are contained in our legislation
                and that the pitfalls that have been experienced elsewhere are
                avoided in Northern Ireland.</p>

                the House today.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">School funding is a very important matter.
                Formula funding to schools in the current financial year will
                total almost £750,000 million, which will be used to deliver
                education to 340,000 pupils, employ 23,000 teachers and 20,000
                other staff in schools, including administrative staff,
                caretakers, classroom assistants and technicians, purchase books
                and equipment and heat and maintain 1,200 schools.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The level of funding and the way in which it
                is spent have a direct influence on the quality of education
                that schools can provide. It affects the number of teachers that
                can be employed, the level of support staff, the learning
                materials available and the quality of the school environment.
                Finance is on the agenda of almost every meeting I have with
                school representatives, and it forms a large part of the
                correspondence received by my Department. It may not generate as
                much interest among the public as the review of post-primary
                education, but rest assured that it does command the attention
                of schools.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The main concern is about lack of funding. I
                share that concern. Our primary and post-primary schools are
                underfunded compared to similar schools in England, Scotland and
                Wales, and I have consistently argued the case in the Executive
                and the Assembly for additional funding. That has met with some
                success, as the record shows. During the last year I obtained
                additional funds to assist schools with energy costs, reading
                schemes and maintenance. I also secured an additional £20·4
                million for direct allocation to school budgets. Those extra
                resources will make a difference to the quality of education
                that our schools can provide. However, our children deserve
                better, and I will continue to press for further resources to
                ensure that schools are properly funded to meet pupils’ needs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The other concern regularly raised by schools
                is that the distribution of funding is unfair. Some school
                representatives feel that if their school were in a different
                area or sector, it would receive more money. There are seven
                local management of schools (LMS) formulae used to allocate
                funds; one administered by each of the five boards and two run
                by the Department in respect of the grant-maintained integrated
                schools and voluntary grammar schools. Each of them is
                different, so it is hardly surprising that schools and others
                find the system of funding complex, confusing, inconsistent and
                unfair. I agree with that view.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The present system has become inequitable.
                With just over 1,200 schools to fund, I cannot see why seven
                different LMS formulae for the allocation of resources are
                required. Therefore, I am committed to the development of a
                single common funding formula. The objective is relatively
                simple — to ensure that schools with similar characteristics
                receive similar levels of funding, regardless of the area or
                sector in which they are located.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, the realisation of that objective is
                more complex because of the differences across boards in funding
                levels and in the make-up of funding formulae. Although useful
                progress has been made over the last few years in harmonising
                the current LMS formulae in preparation for the introduction of
                a common formula, significant differences still remain. Those
                differences must be tackled if schools are to be funded fairly.
                Therefore, the publication of the Department of Education’s
                consultation document represents a major milestone in the
                achievement of equitable funding for all schools.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The document proposes some significant
                changes. The appropriate balance of resources between the
                primary and secondary sectors is a difficult issue, but one
                which must be addressed. Representatives of the primary sector
                have presented a robust case that they should have a larger
                share of the available resources. They have pointed to the fact
                that under current formulae a primary school pupil here
                generates about 65% of the amount generated by a post-primary
                pupil. That differential is much wider than in England and
                Wales, where an investigation by the House of Commons Education
                Committee concluded that primary schools should get a larger
                share of resources.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While there are different needs in the two
                sectors — particularly in the scope of the curriculum and its
                mode of delivery — the current differential is too wide.
                Intervention and additional support in the early years of
                primary education can reduce or prevent the development of many
                learning difficulties experienced by children at post-primary
                level, where remedial measures are not only more costly but also
                less effective. Investment in the early years of education,
                therefore, is a sound one.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Despite a reduction in the funding
                differential between primary and post-primary schools in recent
                years, an increasing number of primary schools are encountering
                difficulty in containing expenditure within budget. That is also
                reflected in rising primary pupil/teacher ratios. Taking those
                factors into account, I am satisfied that there is a case for
                further narrowing the resource gaps. I propose to increase
                primary sector funding by around 4%, or approximately £12
                million, on the basis of the 2000-01 budgets.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This would mean that a primary school pupil
                would attract 67% of the funding attracted by a post-primary
                pupil, compared to 65% at present. This will help considerably
                to ease the pressures in the primary sector.</p>

                allocated under TSN from 5% to 5·5% of the total schools’
                recurrent funding. This represents a 10% increase in TSN funding
                in LMS. On the basis of the 2000-01 budget it would have the
                effect of increasing expenditure in TSN from £40&nbsp;million
                to £44&nbsp;million. This additional investment of
                £4&nbsp;million underscores my commitment to tackling social
                need and disadvantage in education.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">LMS is only one of a number of means by which
                the Department of Education seeks to fulfil its TSN role. The
                substantial range of other TSN-related education activities will
                continue. These include the school support programme, the group
                1 schools initiative, the targeting of pre-school education, the
                code of practice in special needs and initiatives to help
                marginalised groups such as travellers and those educated under
                the EOTAS (education otherwise than at school) programme.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One factor at the heart of the current
                disparities in funding levels is the variation in the levels of
                funding delegated by education and library boards to schools.
                One board delegates 74%, whereas another delegates 67%. I accept
                that these variations reflect in part the different
                characteristics of board areas. For example, more rural boards
                will have higher transport costs, and more disadvantaged boards
                will have more free school meals. However, they also reflect
                differences in the level of service provided by boards and the
                manner in which they are delivered.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am determined to bring levels of funding
                delegation to schools across boards on to a more consistent and
                higher level, and in doing so, to increase the size of school
                budgets. The Department has already urged boards to take
                positive action this year to increase allocations to schools. In
                introducing a common funding formula I will seek to realign
                existing budgets and will work to increase funding delegated to
                schools by up to £15&nbsp;million or 2%. This is the high
                aggregated schools budget (ASB) model presented in the document.
                Priority must be given to the classroom, and my officials will
                work closely with boards between now and the end of the year to
                determine how this can best be achieved.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am anxious to ensure that the debate on the
                common formula is founded on educational principles and
                arguments on what is best for pupils rather than whether an
                individual school is a winner or a loser. However, schools and
                other education bodies will, of course, want to know what effect
                the proposals will have on their particular circumstances. To
                assist these considerations, the document contains extensive
                tables and graphs setting out the potential impact of a common
                formula on school phases, sectors and management types. It also
                contains funding outcomes for a wide range of hypothetical
                schools of different types chosen to reflect variations across
                the key characteristics which affect the level of funding, that
                is, enrolment, premises and social disadvantage. These funding
                outcomes give as clear an indication as possible of the likely
                impact of the formula. However, it must be recognised that they
                rely on assumption and will be affected by any changes to the
                key factors between 2000-01, the year on which the data is
                based, and 2002-03, when commonality will be implemented.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some people may have wanted the document to
                spell out the implications for individual schools. However, for
                the reasons just mentioned, such spurious precision would run
                the real risk of misleading schools. I am satisfied that the
                funding outcomes presented give all schools and sectors a good
                idea of how they are likely to be affected by commonality.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is not to seek in any way to minimise
                the importance to schools of a change in their level of funding.
                In an exercise of this kind it is inevitable that there will be
                winners and losers, and the implementation of the new funding
                formula will need to be managed very carefully. The document
                proposes transitional protection arrangements to limit the
                annual change in individual school budgets and to assist an
                orderly and smooth adjustment to new levels of resourcing over a
                three-year period.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The consultation period will extend to 29
                June, and the common formula will be implemented in April 2002.
                I will wish to make final decisions on the formula in September,
                following consultation with the Education Committee and
                discussions with the Executive Committee. This timescale is
                required to provide sufficient time for the new operational
                arrangements, including any new IT systems, to be developed and
                tested, so that schools can be provided with their budget
                outcomes early in the new year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The proposals in the consultation document
                have been developed through extensive — albeit informal —
                discussion and debate with our key partners such as officials
                from education and library boards and CCMS, and representatives
                of the Governing Bodies Association and the Northern Ireland
                Council for Integrated Education. I thank everyone who has
                contributed to this process, and I acknowledge in particular the
                contribution made by the various board officers and school staff
                members who sat on working groups in the early stages. Their
                input has been very helpful in framing the current proposals. I
                also take this opportunity to pay tribute to the Education
                Committee for its constructive approach in the discussion of
                these proposals. The Committee made a number of helpful
                suggestions which I have been able to reflect in the document.
                This is yet another example of the very constructive and
                positive relationship between the Committee and my Department,
                and I am most anxious that it should continue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I cannot emphasise enough that this is a
                genuine consultation exercise. No decisions have yet been made,
                and I encourage everyone who has an interest to participate
                fully in the wider debate so that all views and suggestions can
                be carefully considered before the new formula is finalised. It
                is important that schools fully understand and respond to the
                proposals. My Department, together with the boards, has arranged
                two briefing conferences for all schools in each board area.
                Invitations have been issued to the principal and to the
                chairman of the board of governors of each school. The
                conferences are designed to give officials an opportunity to
                explain the proposals and to clarify any issues raised by school
                representatives. The first conference was held today, and others
                will be held between now and next Tuesday.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to emphasise again the importance of
                this issue. The introduction of a common funding formula forms a
                key part of my Department’s contribution to the Programme for
                Government. It is a major lever in relation to the quality of
                education delivered by each of our schools, and it is therefore
                vital that we get it right. The current system cannot continue.
                It is manifestly wrong that the level of funding received by a
                school and the quality of education it can provide for its
                pupils can depend on the area or sector in which it is located.
                Our objective is to resolve this inequity through the
                introduction of a fairer system of funding, common across all
                areas and school sectors. I believe that this is good news for
                schools and will be widely welcomed. I trust that Members will
                also support the concept and principles of a common funding
                formula.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I look forward to hearing Members’ views
                during the debate, and I assure them that these will be
                considered very carefully over the coming months before any
                final decisions are taken.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Committee for
                Education (Mr Kennedy):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the opportunity to speak in this
                important debate on this vital issue. I will address the
                Assembly as Chairman of the Education Committee and then in my
                role as Ulster Unionist Assembly spokesperson.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Education Committee welcomes the
                publication of the consultation document. The issue of how
                schools are funded has generated the greatest number of requests
                for meetings with the Education Committee, and representatives
                from all sectors and all sizes of schools have expressed their
                concerns on this matter. As the Minister has indicated, there
                are a large number of formulae used to fund schools under the
                current LMS system.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a result of this complex method, schools
                with the same characteristics receive entirely different
                allocations based on their location or sector. That needs to be
                addressed. The situation is neither satisfactory nor equitable.
                The Committee welcomes the key objective of ensuring that
                schools with similar characteristics receive similar levels of
                funding, regardless of which sector or area they are in.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The proposals comprise a number of welcome
                initiatives. The Education Committee strongly believes that
                investment in early intervention is an investment in the future
                and that it must be a priority. Funding for the early stages of
                the education process can result in long-term savings through a
                reduction in or prevention of learning difficulties and low
                achievement, which often lead to children becoming disaffected
                with education, subsequent problems with attendance and other
                difficulties. The proposed increase in primary-sector funding
                is, therefore, very appropriate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also welcome the intention to increase the
                proportion of the budget to be delegated to classrooms to help
                provide our young people with the best possible education. I
                support the proposal to revise the balance of funding based on
                the factors of social deprivation and special educational need.
                There should be a fifty-fifty funding distribution, which would
                provide greater support for tackling low educational
                achievement. All pupils who perform below the expected level
                need additional support, regardless of their social background.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The cost of teachers’ salaries is the most
                significant element of a school budget, and it often accounts
                for 80% of the total expenditure. I welcome the fact that this
                document seeks views on whether the formula should reflect
                actual teacher costs or whether teachers’ salaries should be
                excluded. The Ulster Unionist Party and myself favour a system
                that will take account of actual teacher costs rather than
                average teacher costs, as under the current system. This would
                be a fairer system and, in my view, a more realistic one. I have
                some concern that, in general, LMS funding has not encouraged
                long-term planning by schools and has led to a short-term
                management style. There is evidence that the current
                arrangements have contributed to the dramatic fall in numbers of
                newly qualified teachers who gain permanent contracts. I hope
                that this consultation exercise will highlight such issues and
                the implications of LMS funding generally.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Education Committee encourages as many
                schools, education bodies and other interested organisations and
                individuals as possible to participate in the consultation
                exercise and to contribute their views to inform Members in
                their consideration of this most important issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have expressed concern to the Minister
                about the length of the consultation period. Given the detailed
                and complicated nature of the issues, and the fact that there
                will be winners and losers if these proposals are implemented,
                it is most important that an adequate consultation period be
                provided. The Committee, noting the consultation document was
                due to be launched early in the new year, has proposed that the
                consultation period should be extended until the end of June to
                allow schools to submit their views. The Minister accepted this
                point of view. However, the publication of the document did not
                take place until April, and that period has now been
                considerably reduced.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I call on the Minister to address this matter
                immediately. In developing these proposals, we will need to take
                account of the review of post-primary education, the curriculum
                review and other consultative issues that prevail in the
                education sector.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.00</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the Ulster Unionist Party spokesperson on
                education in the Assembly, and on a personal note, I have to
                express serious concerns about the proposal in this consultative
                document to introduce a provision relating to Irish- medium
                units. The proposal is to provide Irish-medium primary schools
                in units with an extra £100 per pupil and Irish-medium
                post-primary schools with an additional £25 per pupil. I do not
                agree that pupils in specific sectors, such as Irish-medium
                schools, should receive more funding than pupils in other
                sectors. The proposal is unfair to the majority of pupils. The
                current arrangements under which Irish-medium schools are funded
                on exactly the same basis as other schools are appropriate and
                should be continued. I therefore serve notice to the Minister
                that the Ulster Unionist Party will oppose this clause if it is
                included in any subsequent legislation. The clause is
                inequitable, and I stress that this is an education issue, not a
                political one. It is important that this debate be conducted on
                the basis of educational need and that other issues should not
                cloud this need or be allowed to interfere.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This consultative document is important. It
                comes in a long line of other important documents that have been
                mentioned, including the post-primary curriculum review. Many
                teachers, and others in the field of education, are weary of the
                weight of advice that is being sought from them from on high.
                That is another argument in favour of the Minister’s
                considering an extension of the period involved. The Ulster
                Unionist Party will be making a formal request for an extension
                to this period. The issue is very important — perhaps the most
                important issue — to primary school principals, boards of
                governors, secondary schools and all schools, regardless of the
                sector they are in. It is a major concern to anyone with an
                interest in education.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important that we address the issue
                quickly; we must also address it properly, and we must move to a
                situation where sensible legislation can be introduced, which
                can be supported by those at the coalface of education, as well
                as Assembly party members. Therefore, I hope that the Minister
                will hear my plea for additional time to be given to this
                consultative body. I encourage schools, individuals and other
                interested parties to make submissions to it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Schools and boards of governors will study
                the proposals to see how their school will fare under the new
                arrangements. That is an understandable reaction and one that
                will bear heavily on the representations that they will make.
                The current system is unfair, and we want to move to a more
                equitable one. The assessment of actual teacher costs, rather
                than average teacher costs, is one way of ensuring that all
                schools can feel that they are being fairly treated. I look
                forward to the Minister’s comments on the extension of the
                time period and on my views about the Irish-medium factor.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Gallagher:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion offers us a useful opportunity to
                have some discussion from the outset of the consultation period.
                Everyone must agree that the document is complex and detailed.
                If it is implemented, almost all schools will experience changes
                in the way that their budgets are allocated. Changes will be
                favourable for some, and while others will see no significant
                gain, some will have their school budgets reduced.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The proposed changes are set against a
                backdrop of radical curriculum changes and the resultant
                pressures on all schools over the last decade. Changes must also
                take account of current population trends, which see school
                enrolments, at both primary and secondary level, falling. Many
                schools are already experiencing severe financial pressures.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The founding principles of the document are
                very sound. We hope to achieve a system that will be easy to
                operate and understand, will be transparent and will reinforce
                wider education policy. The other changes, which I believe will
                be welcomed, include basing school budgets on the preceding year’s
                census. That is a sensible suggestion that most schools will
                welcome. The extension of teacher salary protection will
                particularly facilitate smaller schools.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Funding will be increased for children from
                the travelling community and for those children for whom English
                is an additional language. Some tests on targeting social need (TSN)
                have been carried out. Social need factors are clearly defined
                in the document and are based on the twin criteria of social
                deprivation and special educational needs. TSN funding will be
                divided fairly on a fifty-fifty basis.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, that will all happen without any
                extra money being available. We are commencing a new exercise by
                moving money around schools in a different way. As the Minister
                said, how that is managed will be a key factor. If all goes well
                we will have an efficient system that will give the Department
                of Education increased bargaining power with the Executive. If,
                on the other hand, it does not go well, that will present
                different problems.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the Minister launched the document he
                said that the proposal would ensure that similar schools would
                be treated in a similar way. While nobody would disagree with
                that, careful consideration must still be given.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A number of questions immediately spring to
                mind. How are similar schools to be defined? For example, a
                300-pupil school in one of the County Fermanagh sectors may look
                similar to a 300-pupil school in the same sector in Ballymena,
                yet they may not have much in common. One is urban while the
                other is rural. One relies heavily on the school transport
                service, whereas the other does not depend on it as much. One
                relies heavily on an adequate school meals service, whereas it
                may not be as important for the other because of its location.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The terminology must be clarified. The
                definition of a &quot;similar&quot; school needs to be looked at
                in greater depth. Before anything is changed we need clear
                information on how the Department proposes to arrive at the
                definition of &quot;similar&quot; when using the phrase
                &quot;schools with similar characteristics&quot;. Every school,
                as we know, must be looked at from its social context, its
                position in the community and what access it has to services
                such as leisure facilities. The surrounding infrastructure and
                how that assists or has an adverse effect on school transport
                must be taken into account. All these elements must be
                considered before we can identify schools with
                &quot;similar&quot; characteristics.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another aspect to consider is the shifts and
                changes that there will be in the school system and the
                education and library boards. The boards receive an allocation;
                they hold some of the money centrally for transport, support
                services and school meals, but they send the greater part of it
                to the schools. If we implement all the proposals, some boards
                will find that they are able to hold more money centrally, so
                the services that are centrally controlled by those boards will
                gain, whereas other boards may be required to give more money to
                schools and will have less to hold centrally. The result of that
                will be that their centrally held services may be under
                pressure.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am speaking as a representative of a large
                rural constituency that depends heavily on what is, at present,
                an unsatisfactory school transport service. I do not want, as a
                result of this exercise, to end up with a situation that leaves
                school transport or the school meals services under greater
                financial pressure. The paper does not deal with how the funding
                will be allocated, under a relative needs exercise, to the
                boards. In the interests of equality and the overall good of the
                education system, we need to be fair to those who administer
                education as well as to those who benefit from it in the
                classroom. Together with the review of the local management of
                schools we must review how the money is allocated to the boards.
                If we do that, we will end up with a better system.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Gibson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the opportunity to speak. I will
                focus, particularly, on pages 27 and 28 that deal with the key
                principles for common formula funding. These are the fundamental
                principles that underpin the direction and the objectives
                involved.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first point that I want to make, not just
                to the Minister but to everyone in the Assembly, was made
                yesterday afternoon when many of us on these Benches pressed the
                Minister of Finance and Personnel to consider the idea of
                equality. We tried to persuade him to ensure equality by
                ring-fencing. He quickly retreated, on three or four occasions
                at least, to the wording of the criteria. I am therefore asking
                that all schools and all boards of governors keenly participate
                in the exercise. I ask the Minister, as the discussions
                progress, to reveal the criteria that underpin the key
                principles to the Committee and all the relevant bodies, because
                the thinking is emerging that they are involved.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We can have a very nice sounding term such as
                the &quot;common funding formula&quot;, but if the criteria
                involved do not support that, it can be totally misleading. I
                want everyone involved in the delivery of education to
                scrutinise carefully and objectively what is going to be
                involved.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Point 3.1 indicates a vision. Point 3.2 says
                that &quot;schools should be funded according to their relative
                need.&quot; Why did the Minister not use the term
                &quot;educational need&quot;? Is the word &quot;relative&quot;
                an escape route to try to manipulate the criteria, and could
                that mean that the funding is not common but skewed for a
                variety of reasons that are not to do with educational needs? I
                would alert everyone to that point.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What does he mean by &quot;objective
                measures&quot;? How does the Minister intend to spell those out?
                What are those measures? How can we study the criteria and
                benchmark them against objective measures that have not yet been
                revealed? Then the Minister uses very nice words like
                &quot;underpin&quot;, &quot;reinforce wider education policy and
                objectives&quot;, &quot;transparent&quot; and
                &quot;comprehensible&quot;. None of these principles is
                transparent or comprehensible, and they cannot be reinforced
                unless we know exactly what the Minister wishes to achieve.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That the formula is easy to administer, I
                would have thought, is a very sensible and important point. I
                know that my words will be used against me. I have yet to be
                convinced that there is a great correlation between social need
                and educational need, because most of the large body of
                educational information supporting that here and in America is
                outdated. However, there is much newer evidence coming forward.
                The old debate over environment versus innateness that has raged
                for a century is now history in educational terms and thinking.
                The ideas of how we measure intelligence is now past history. We
                are looking at new systems and methods of measuring
                intelligence. A whole new raft of educational thinking has
                emerged. There is an idea, still current with many people, that
                somehow you can use social engineering to achieve a predictable
                outcome. Again, history is littered with a host of failures in
                that field. One of the great experimenters was dear old Adolf
                himself, who was so sorely tempted into social engineering that
                it led him to the idea of genetic engineering. History has dealt
                and dispensed with many of those ideas, so the Minister had
                better be very careful about what the real objectives of this
                exercise are.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sometimes when I listen to people talking in
                social jargon I am convinced that they have developed a disease
                called &quot;socialitis&quot;. I myself have a very strong
                social conscience, a very strong sense of fairness and a very
                strong sense of justice. However, that idea can be carried to
                the extreme where it so dominates one’s thinking that one
                loses sight of the real issues.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What is the real object of the exercise? I
                put it to the Minister that it is to equip our generations with
                the education to enable them to compete in a competitive world.
                We can no longer risk experimenting with the education of our
                young people. Common funding should be fundamental to the idea
                that we need to continually improve our educational outcomes and
                standards. However, as another Member has mentioned, common
                funding should not be used for anything other than producing the
                best educational outcomes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We do not want to reinvent ghettos. I can
                already see this prospect creeping into the thinking of those in
                my own constituency who feel beleaguered. At times they feel it
                is worthless and a waste of time to participate in an exercise
                the outcomes of which seem predestined. I am asking everyone,
                including the Minister of Education and his Department, to start
                to exercise their minds on the outcome of a common funding
                formula.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are all too well aware of the inequalities
                of the last system. A lobby group from north Armagh compared two
                secondary schools, one of which was receiving about £50,000 a
                year more than the other. The group was also able to point to
                gross disparities in funding between primary schools of a
                similar size. I must stress that in my experience the
                educational performance of a pupil was never affected by whether
                he or she could pay for school meals. Many of us could quote
                similar glowing instances.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act
                1998 becomes an enforceable issue, the whole idea of equality
                will now be of paramount concern to those of us whose interest
                lies in the controlled sector. We are going to be thinking of
                fairness and justice. We will be looking critically at European
                legislation; I hope that this will be proofed by European
                legislation against ideas of unfairness or injustice. I wish
                this discussion well. I hope that everyone involved in our
                education system will take a vigorous, healthy and wholesome
                interest. This is important; its outcome is critical to our
                future generations.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I
                welcome the opportunity to speak as a Committee member on this
                subject. I welcome the consultation and the statement by the
                Minister.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is one of the current educational
                objectives of both the Minister and the Department. It is one of
                the milestones in the educational calendar, along with capital
                investment in schools and the abolition of the school
                performance tables.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Irish-medium promotional body has already
                been mentioned. Irish is a growing language, and it should be
                cherished as part of the national heritage of the people of
                Ireland. The need for Irish-medium education has been proven,
                and it is a growing need. That should be welcomed, rather than
                considered to be an unnecessary expense.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are three reviews that are currently
                running together. The post-primary review is probably the most
                important review for a long time. There is also the review of
                the curriculum and the local management of schools consultation
                on a common funding formula for grant- aided schools. I welcome
                the consultation, and in particular the Minister’s assurances
                that no decisions have yet been made. That is important for all
                those in schools and anyone who might want to have input into
                the consultation. I appeal to all the partners in the education
                system to submit their views by 30 June, or, if that is changed,
                whatever date is decided.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The need to simplify the budget allocation
                must not take precedence over the need to allocate funding
                fairly to where it is most needed, even if complex calculations
                are required in order to ensure that all the relevant factors
                are considered. These calculations are part of the Department’s
                work, and it has expertise in that area. It is important to
                decide whether we feel that the principles of justice, equality
                and support for the disadvantaged are appropriately dealt with
                and acted on.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I draw attention to the issue of the
                maintenance of school buildings. I have visited schools where
                windows do not close properly and where there is a lack of
                insulation. Those schools have higher heating bills than schools
                that have been recently updated. That particularly affects
                schools in rural areas and small schools, where there are
                already difficulties and costs to deal with as a result of the
                drop in the number of teachers. There is also a health and
                safety issue when schools become old and dilapidated. In some
                cases, windows are nailed shut.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The sum allocated to schools for maintenance
                must take into consideration the age of the premises and the
                time since the school’s last refurbishment. Small schools,
                especially small primary schools, need to be protected, as they
                are an essential part of the life of local communities,
                especially rural communities. Any new funding formula must
                ensure investment in high-quality, locally accessible primary
                education and full-time early-years education which have an
                effect on the future achievement of pupils.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee for Education has said that
                schools with similar characteristics but in different areas or
                sectors receive varying budgets. That is not acceptable,
                satisfactory or equitable. The Committee welcomes the key
                objectives of ensuring that schools with similar characteristics
                receive similar levels of funding, regardless of the area or
                sector in which they are situated. Therefore, we ask everyone in
                the education sector — individuals, schools and others — to
                take part in the consultation and make their views known. That
                is more than important at this time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One difficulty is that there is quite a short
                time for consultation at what is a very busy time for those in
                the educational field who want to make their input. We will have
                to see how that goes along. It is vital that everybody make
                their views known. Go raibh maith agat.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I, like many others, have many concerns about
                the current system, and I am also very aware that a review is
                necessary.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Any Member who is also a member of a school
                board of governors will know the problems that the current
                formula has produced for teacher provision, teachers’
                salaries, pupil numbers, implementation of the current
                curriculum, and so on.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister’s key objective in introducing
                a common local management of schools (LMS) formula — which was
                to ensure that schools with similar characteristics receive
                similar levels of funding, regardless of the areas or sectors in
                which they are located — has to be welcomed. We must work to
                achieve this objective which, if successfully implemented, will
                improve the situation in schools for teachers and all pupils.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is vital, however, that consultation on
                this process is thorough and relevant. The consultation document
                should prove very useful. My party will be looking at this
                document and at the proposals very seriously, on the basic
                premise that a common funding formula must achieve its objective
                to benefit all schools and all pupils.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will outline a few concerns that I have. I
                am aware that the main factor in funding procedures is the age-
                weighted pupil unit (AWPU). That should still be the main
                determining factor, as pupil enrolment numbers determine the
                number of teachers, support staff, type of equipment, and so on.
                The present formula for calculating the AWPU is complicated. I
                will be looking closely at the more simplified proposals
                contained in the document, and I broadly welcome the skewing of
                resources towards primary schools. However, the AWPU must be
                reviewed continually to allow for evolving situations in pupil
                numbers, classroom conditions, et cetera, especially when the
                proposals in the Burns review are implemented.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The consultation document states that the
                funding of individual schools should be in accordance with the
                relevant need, and I am concerned about what that means. It is
                down as the first criterion for ensuring needs are met with
                clear responsibility to all types of pupils. That need must be
                obvious, and it must be relative to the educational needs in
                each school. That term will need to be made clear to boards of
                governors, and they will need proper training with regard to
                central expenditure. It is clear from the current LMS formula
                that there is potential for widespread inefficiency with moneys
                given to them. Guidance must be provided to maintain the
                efficient and economic provision of services.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Best value initiatives — as mentioned in
                the document as a mechanism for best practice — may not be as
                familiar to individual governors as they are to the Department
                of Education. They must clearly understand their
                responsibilities and the procedures so that effective
                implementation can occur.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I must also express my concerns about
                depending on free school meals or targeting social need (TSN)
                figures as the basis for funding figures, as they do not always
                present the correct picture across the schools. I welcome the
                increase in the TSN funding. However, a closer look needs to be
                taken at schools which may not be obvious contenders for free
                school meals or TSN applications but which have low achievers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also welcome the introduction of the
                special education needs factor. Again, I need to be confident
                that this will be implemented properly, as I have already
                expressed concerns about the current statementing process, never
                mind the situation with those children who are difficult to deal
                with but who are not statemented.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is encouraging that the document comments
                on the fact that there are winners and losers under this new
                formula. I hope that the transitional protection offered will
                avoid undue and unacceptable turbulence in the funding levels.
                We must also ensure that the transitional arrangements are
                effective in helping schools to adjust to the new resource
                allocation. It would be useful to be told how the
                &quot;cushioning&quot; method that is mentioned will be
                implemented. Who will assist that? Will it be the Department or
                the education and library boards? It must be made known what
                will happen after the three-year period of adjustment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree that it is vital that we assist and
                support our primary schools, but we must not do so at the
                expense of either nursery or post-primary schools. If we are to
                prepare all our children for future life in a meaningful way, we
                cannot replace one inequitable system with another. The
                priority, as the Minister states, must be in the school. Factors
                such as small school support, the extension of the teacher
                salary protection factor, funding for the new sports factor and
                the continued inclusion of other factors mentioned this morning
                — for example, special unit funding, travellers, English as an
                additional language, Irish-medium schools and, I hope,
                integrated education schools, and children of service personnel
                — must be welcomed. It is essential that the inclusion of all
                children, whatever their background, be encouraged.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Alliance Party fully supports a common
                formula to replace the seven that are currently used to allocate
                resources to schools. We welcome the consultation document and
                the helpful response document, in which some of the questions
                and concerns are highlighted for easy response. I hope that will
                in some way go towards addressing the concerns that we all have
                about the timetable for this consultation process. We hope that
                the consultation, whatever the timetable, is a success. It must
                be remembered, however — as we in the Assembly know only too
                well, and sometimes to our cost — that devolving decision
                making to the local level does not always result in an efficient
                and effective response, either in financial or people-power
                terms. I can only hope that the current tensions and problems
                that are present in schools because of funding difficulties will
                be eased by these proposals.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To achieve a successful outcome to this
                process we must ensure that all pupils will have improved
                facilities and conditions, that teachers will feel better valued
                and protected and that education overall will be the winner. I
                hope that everyone interested in those goals will use this
                process. I support the motion.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr B Hutchinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, I declare an interest as a member of
                the Belfast Education and Library Board. As a city councillor I
                represent the council on that board. I am also on the board of
                governors of two primary schools in north Belfast.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have previously been in contact with the
                Minister and have discussed the issue of local management of
                schools and the funding element in particular. Having read the
                document, there seems to be quite a lot of good things in it. On
                reading it a second time, I have to say that I have concerns,
                particularly about the Belfast area and the schools that have to
                exist there. I know from local Protestant primary schools,
                especially those in north Belfast — and I am sure that it is
                the same across Belfast — that we have a shrinking population.
                There are a number of reasons for that, quite a few of which are
                down to successive Governments and to planners who badly planned
                the whole notion of Belfast and its dormitory towns. As a
                result, we have a shrinking population.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of my difficulties in this is that we
                have not looked at teachers’ wages, which are paid out under
                the local management of schools. While that continues, those
                sorts of schools will suffer. The reason is that they have
                teachers who have served more than seven years and who have to
                be paid on the top line — there is nothing we can do about
                that. If a school with 104 pupils or less tries to employ all of
                those teachers, year on year the board of governors will be
                faced with having to make people redundant. It is not a very
                nice choice to have to make, particularly if there is no
                voluntary redundancy. One has to decide who is going to leave
                the school. Those are always going to be the difficulties until
                we decide that wages should be taken out and paid centrally.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some of the issues that stem from that are
                long-term sick and maternity leave, particularly if subs are
                brought in. A top-line sub costs £132·86 a day. Usually, all
                of that must come out of the budget unless the relevant
                education board pays for that centrally, in which case it pays
                £100 a day leaving the added cost of £32·86 in statutory sick
                pay. Those are issues we need to get to grips with.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In my opinion, the Minister has developed
                many other relevant matters. The changes he has made to the
                curriculum reserve fund will probably benefit some of the
                schools that I represent; recognising that there must be
                redundancies, he has tweaked to cover for that. I can verify
                that, until now, a number of schools in Belfast that have had to
                do that have not benefited in any way from the curriculum
                reserve fund and have been left out for several reasons.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We continue to view school meals as
                indicative of social need, as indeed they are. However, we also
                need to remember that a number of these schools are based in
                socially deprived areas and that education has to be a
                fundamental right for everybody. That must be considered in the
                review of post-primary education.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the beginning of this debate, the Minister
                expressed the view that investment in early years has to be
                welcomed. Most of us recognise that that is where investment is
                needed, so that by the time pupils get to post-primary education
                they should have the ability to achieve in those particular
                schools.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Concerning the budget, I want to discuss the
                whole system of schools having to pay out for maintenance
                following vandalism. In Belfast both Protestant and Catholic
                schools are often vandalised. I am not differentiating here, but
                quite a lot of schools in peace line areas are damaged due to
                sectarianism. When schools re-open after a break, whether after
                Easter, when the Easter Rising is commemorated, or when
                returning in September after the Twelfth of July, the damage
                caused by vandalism must be paid for out of the budget, and no
                one wants to take up that issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I recall having to fight hard for a school
                that had been subject to a sectarian attack. Intercom systems
                that had been put in place because of the tragic massacre in
                Dunblane in Scotland were destroyed. Still and all, the
                education board would not pay out. Rather, it told the school to
                pay it out of its own budget. Consider how many books that money
                could have bought for that school.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am also concerned about LMS demands that
                schools have composite P6 and P7 classes. In the deprived areas
                where these schools are situated, that policy does not give
                pupils the opportunity for a proper education and proper
                preparation for secondary school.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As regards the document’s proposal for
                sport, I am concerned that the money might be put into equipment
                rather than expertise. If we seriously want to do something
                about sport, we should ensure that we have PE teachers in
                primary schools and that we invest in teachers rather than in
                equipment. Equipment will not make a difference to the pupils;
                we need expertise if we really want to produce quality pupils in
                sport.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I ask the Minister to consider the whole of
                Belfast and how this would have an impact on it. Unless we
                remove the budget for teachers’ salaries, then schools in
                Belfast are going to suffer. Someone spoke earlier about the
                different sectors. I believe that parents should be allowed to
                choose which sector they send their child to.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One case that I want to make today is for the
                integrated schools. I believe that over the last 20 years,
                parents have come together to make a choice. We are all told
                about the choice that we have in education. I believe that
                choice, not only in education but in other walks of life such as
                employment, is a weasel concept.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sometimes we are told that we can have one or
                the other rather than having a choice of more than one. It must
                be recognised that some parents in our sectarian society have
                decided that they would like their children to be educated
                together, and Members should seriously examine how that can be
                facilitated. Parents who would like their children to be taught
                in an integrated school should not be prevented from doing so
                and should not be discriminated against.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unless the wage bill is removed from LMS, not
                even a dent will be made in the problem. I welcome the vast
                majority of the Minister’s document, but the fundamental flaw
                is the wage bill.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms McWilliams:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I commend the Minister for the reception he
                received at the recent teachers’ union conferences. I am
                delighted that he did not have to run the same gauntlet as his
                counterpart in the Republic, the Minister of Education and
                Science, who has not received quite the same welcome when
                attending similar conferences. However, here comes the sting.
                Although I welcome the consultation document it falls far short
                of what the education system needs. It tinkers at the edges,
                whereas what is needed is an entire overview of the education
                system.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given the proliferation of expensive bodies
                and administrative systems in the Department of Education, would
                it not have been better to have asked for consultation on how
                Members would like to see the education system administered? The
                management of schools and the formula could then have been
                examined in the light of that consultation. We are looking at
                only one aspect of the issue. Sometimes it appears as if we are
                starting at the wrong end, and we may not get it right.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Gerry McHugh mentioned the Burns review on
                post- primary education. If recommendations emerge from the
                review, this could all be a temporary expedient, because Members
                may be back here shortly re-examining this issue, especially
                since it addresses the primary and post-primary sectors. I am
                concerned that Members are seeking responses now when
                recommendations that will impact on the Minister’s decision
                will shortly be available.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given the number of bodies in the Department
                of Education, I was surprised that it used a private consultancy
                firm, Coopers &amp; Lybrand, to carry out this exercise. Is the
                education system so bitty that the Department could not have
                looked at the issue in a co-ordinated way rather than handing
                over the job to someone else? It does not speak well for
                devolution if those jobs have to be given to private
                consultancies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am also concerned about the evidence for
                increasing the formula for TSN. I welcome TSN, but how was the
                percentage of 5·5% arrived at? Members will need evidence to
                convince them that that increase was all that was required. I
                take issue with Oliver Gibson, who argued that TSN should not be
                based on issues such as whether children are entitled to free
                school meals. Social policy research states that where there is
                deprivation and many children require free school meals, there
                are parents on benefits or very low incomes. However, the
                parents may not be on low incomes because that factor has been
                taken out of the system. But from what we know about
                deprivation, the children of parents who are on benefits have
                particular needs, and special resources should be targeted at
                those children in schools.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Billy Hutchinson said, the central part of
                this dilemma is teachers’ salaries. Some 80% of funding goes
                towards paying the wage bill, which creates enormous insecurity
                in schools every year as to whether they will have to make
                teachers redundant.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Surely it would be more sensible to adopt a
                central funding system, which excludes salaries, to avoid the
                apparent increasing lack of morale. We do not want to reach a
                situation similar to that in the Republic of Ireland where
                teachers are on strike. That is having a huge impact on young
                people’s education. Northern&nbsp;Ireland may face that
                situation unless we seriously address the issue of giving
                teachers permanency and security. Continuity is the most
                important factor when teachers are educating our children. They
                will know the children better if they have been in the school
                for some time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am also very concerned about private
                finance initiatives. The consultation document does not ask for
                responses on this, and the public/private partnerships may lead
                to problems in the future. If the projected enrolments in
                new-build schools are not meeting the targets, will money have
                to be allocated to cover the cost of the rebuild and
                redundancies? I am still concerned that opportunities are missed
                when documents such as this, particularly those relating to the
                long-term funding and management of schools, go out for
                consultation without the views of teachers and others having
                been sought.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Counting, particularly the age-weighted pupil
                units, is a very difficult issue. On the one hand, we do not
                want to prejudice the system against schools that are trying to
                expand. In the past, Mr Billy&nbsp;Hutchinson, Mrs Bell, myself
                and others have raised the matter of new schools, especially
                those in the integrated sector. We do not want to prejudice
                opportunities for them, but we would be doing that if we were to
                detract from funding for smaller schools. On the other hand, we
                do not want to put larger schools at a disadvantage.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I received a letter from the principals of
                five primary schools who argue that the recent round of funding
                disadvantaged them, and I am sure that the Minister received the
                same correspondence. Extra funding was given to smaller schools,
                and the creation of a maximum for larger primary schools meant
                that they received less funding per pupil. It is not impossible
                for us to get around that problem. There should never be large
                numbers of losers in this system.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Skewing resources to the primary and early
                years sector is an important target. However, given the recent
                demographic trends that point to the need to sustain
                post-primary schools, how will the Minister meet both sectors if
                we are not to have losers? In other words, the numbers are going
                to fall in early years in primary schools, but we have always
                agreed that we should target that and set an aim for our
                education system to improve, particularly where there is
                disadvantage, the education of very young children. In doing
                that, I hope that secondary schools are not put at a
                disadvantage.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need more research on equity and
                effectiveness. Clear equity issues exist with regard to
                provision for post-16 and vocational students and allocations to
                sixth form grammar school students. Equity between the school
                systems is also an issue — the integrated sector versus the
                controlled, maintained and voluntary sectors. Not all integrated
                schools are permitted to establish sixth forms, and not all
                existing sixth form provision is cost-effective. The entry and
                exit rules must be examined. I hope that those rules will be
                examined in detail at the end of the consultation process. If
                the research is falling down anywhere it is that we are lacking
                in accurate information.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, I agree with Mr
                Billy&nbsp;Hutchinson’s point about pupils who have special
                social needs — disruptive children. I am sure that other
                Members have received many letters from parents whose children
                have been expelled or suspended from school.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They have attempted to get them into other
                schools, which are reluctant to take those children unless they
                receive extra resources. The frequently disruptive child has an
                impact on the receiving school, and extra resources may be
                needed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must ensure additional resources per
                pupil. If we do not examine the formulae, many of those children
                may go into what were, in the past, considered to be schools
                that no one wanted to touch. The schools that accept those
                children should be given extra resources. In that way, we can
                continue to give the children some incentives, rather than
                having them in a system in which their behaviour is reciprocated
                by their peers. If those children mix with other children who
                are settled, the receiving schools and their teachers should
                have their needs addressed accordingly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That said, this is an important document in
                relation to the current consultations. I hope that the Minister
                has allowed considerable flexibility. I hope that he will
                respond to some of those issues, because my major concern is
                that we are putting the cart before the horse.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr S Wilson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not sure why this debate has been called
                in this form. I did not hear the Minister’s explanation this
                morning, because the debate started earlier than anticipated.
                The Assembly should note that it is most unusual for a Minister
                to announce a consultation document in that way. Given the
                Minister’s background and the way in which he has abused his
                portfolio for party political ends, I can only assume that there
                are one or two explanations for that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We all — especially those of us who have
                been directly involved in the Committee for Education — have
                received considerable representation, from some sectors in
                particular, concerning the funding of schools. There is a belief
                that small schools and primary schools have been disadvantaged.
                I suppose it is hoped that the general impression given by the
                consultation will be that all those problems will be magically
                sorted out. However, on reading the small print, and given that
                it is unlikely that sufficient resources will be made available
                to bring us up to the high aggregated schools budget (ASB)
                scenario, there will be losers. That, of course, is in the fine
                print and for later.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Perhaps another reason for bringing this
                forward at this stage is that when the Department’s initial
                document was produced, there were some elements from whom the
                Minister would have been very unhappy to have had criticism,
                especially those more sympathetic towards the maintained sector.
                Those people were jumping up and down before the Committee for
                Education, because there was a suggestion that there would be
                some loss to the maintained sector as a result of the proposed
                changes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I note — and perhaps this is the Minister’s
                reason for bringing the motion forward in this form — that
                without any explanation, using exactly the same arguments and
                without even having the ingenuity to change the words around,
                the Minister has changed the formula. In doing so, he was able
                to satisfy both the strident complaints of the SDLP and the more
                restrained voice — because they could not do anything about it
                — of his own party about the results of the initial document.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.30 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister is using his position to
                manipulate his portfolio to please a particular constituency and
                calm fears that may have arisen before an election campaign.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He has blatantly directed half of this year’s
                capital funding towards the Sinn Féin target constituencies of
                West Tyrone, Mid Ulster and Foyle and totally ignored the
                criteria set down, even by the Council for Catholic Maintained
                Schools (CCMS). When a Minister abuses his position like that, I
                can be forgiven for my interpretation of the exercise.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Before people jump up and down in support of
                the matter, one should note the conclusions reached at the start
                of the consultation document. It states that some schools will
                lose more than 5% — some nearly 10% — of their budget. Those
                schools are likely to be from the Belfast Education and Library
                Board area and in the controlled sector. I will spell it out for
                some Members. For a secondary school of around 1,000 pupils, the
                loss in its budget could be in the region of £150,000 to
                £170,000 a year. Even if a third of that can be absorbed by
                cutting back on books, heating and lighting, et cetera, that is
                the equivalent of losing four teachers, which would put average
                class sizes up by two pupils per class. That is the bad news
                contained in the document. It admits that a large part of the
                budget loss is directed at the controlled sector. Therefore we
                can see why totally unjustified changes have been made to the
                original document presented to the Committee for Education.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It would be unrealistic for anyone to expect
                that if you are going to cut the cake up in a different way,
                some sectors will not lose out. Some good arguments have been
                advanced by the primary school sector. The whole thrust of the
                current education debate has been to devote resources early on
                in the primary school year to ensure that problems that arise
                later are nipped in the bud. That requires making more resources
                available, especially at the lower primary level — hence some
                of the changes in the age-weighted pupil unit (AWPU) and some
                other suggested changes. That will be a long-term exercise, but
                if it eradicates some of the difficulties that lead to extra
                expenditure in the post-primary sector, that will be a
                worthwhile investment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to discuss other aspects of the
                document. The main difference between the original document
                presented to the Committee for Education and the consultation
                document is on the aspect of targeting social need (TSN) and
                particularly the emphasis placed on free school meals. That is
                why there is a skewing of resources away from the controlled
                sector and towards the maintained sector.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That was the sop that the Minister gave to
                those who nearly blew a gasket when it was first suggested and
                who made it clear that they would not support the measure if
                that outcome was retained in the exercise.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Targeting social need will now be divided
                into two sections — the social deprivation section and the
                special educational needs section. An arbitrary amount of
                additional money was to be poured in, increasing the top slice
                from 5% to 5·5%, without any rationale. Initially, the
                available sum — £44 million — was to have been divided
                equally between the social deprivation factor, which was to be
                based entirely on free school meals, and the special educational
                needs factor. I would have thought that special educational need
                would be based on some educational factor. It was suggested that
                it should be based on the Key Stage 2 tests. Thirty-five per
                cent of the money would be allocated on that basis, and the
                allocation of another 15% would be based on free school meals.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The argument in the consultation document is
                — word-for-word — the same as that in the original document,
                which was sent to the Committee for Education: not even a comma
                has been changed. Yet the percentages in the formula have
                magically changed, giving approximately £5 million extra to
                people on free school meals.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The argument is that free school meals are a
                good indicator of educational need. However, according to the
                Department’s own statistics, that is not the case. I do not
                care what anyone in the Assembly has said about the correlation
                between free school meals and educational disadvantage. The
                Department has produced statistics on absence rates and on
                achievement at GCSE level. According to those statistics, 60% of
                results fall outside a range of 5% above or below the suggested
                trend line. There is no correlation. The scatter diagram shows
                that the correlation that people talk about so glibly does not
                exist. Somehow, the Minister, without changing his argument, has
                changed the formula in the consultation document. The result is
                that one section of the school population, concentrated in
                Belfast, is going to find itself disadvantaged by up to 10% of
                the school budget.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the Member looked at educational
                achievement in those schools, he would see that if money were to
                be allocated on the basis of achievement, funds would still be
                skewed towards many of the schools in working-class areas. The
                best measure of what a school needs to deliver the curriculum
                and achieve a certain output is the educational achievement of
                the youngsters. As Mrs Bell said, low educational achievement is
                not confined to people from low-income families.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When you allocate most of the targeting
                social need money on the basis of free school meals, you
                disadvantage those youngsters. More importantly, the Minister
                has changed the figure arbitrarily, because that gets around a
                particular difficulty he was having with some of the SDLP
                Members — a difficulty that he would also have had with his
                own constituents eventually. That is where the unfairness lies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the Minister talks about the principles
                that he is adhering to, he says that the formula should be
                transparent and as comprehensive as possible. He has got off to
                a very poor start. On one hand his officials present the
                Committee with a certain formula, and then without any
                explanation, other than it gives a different outcome as to which
                schools win and which schools lose, he changes that formula
                totally. That is hardly transparency or fairness. Perhaps that
                is what we have come to expect from the current Minister of
                Education.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister stated in the list of principles
                that the formula should support schools in delivering the
                curriculum. It should also underpin and reinforce wider
                educational policy and objectives. If the Minister is abiding by
                those principles then why is the money that is being top-sliced
                and the money that is available for special educational needs
                not being targeted at educational measures as opposed to social
                measures? That is an important question.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Billy Hutchinson and Monica McWilliams
                mentioned something that worries me also. There is a certain
                amount of sympathy for removing the wage bill from school
                budgets and determining it centrally. I thought that the whole
                idea of local management of schools, of which this is part, was
                designed to allow them to make their own decisions about how
                they wish to deliver the service to youngsters. It may well be
                that some schools will decide that that can be best achieved by
                promoting teachers and retaining experienced teachers. It may
                well be that other schools are happy to allow experienced
                teachers to leave and have lower paid, less experienced teachers
                just to keep pupil/teacher ratios down.</p>

                recruit new teachers — obviously at a lower pay level, at
                spine point six.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The problem is that teachers might have been
                at the same schools for a long time. Therefore those schools
                would not have any choice and would have to pay wages at spine
                point nine. Consequently, they would have to make new teachers
                redundant or amalgamate classes, and it often happens that two
                classes of 23 pupils end up in a single class of more than 35
                pupils. Those are the choices that schools are facing. It is
                argued that it is unfair for teachers and local school
                management to face such choices and that it would be much better

                exercised, and the Department will ultimately determine the
                number of teachers at each level and the total number of
                teachers in each school. That is where the flexibility will be
                taken away.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issue of how teacher salaries are dealt
                with needs to be very carefully addressed. It is not as simple
                as taking money from the Budget and giving it to the Department.
                If you do that, you will lose flexibility.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members must look closely at the conclusions
                reached in this document. We must look closely at the changes
                that have occurred in the document since the original version
                was presented. The Minister, if he wants to be transparent, must
                explain why he has produced a different formula when using the
                same arguments. He must show whether those changes have been
                designed to ensure that the outcome favours one particular
                sector of education that, of course, he is prone to lobbying
                for.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr K Robinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am sure that the Minister, by this stage,
                feels like the man who asked for directions and received the
                answer, &quot;If I were you, I would not start from here&quot;.
                Many conflicting statements have been made.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Minister, has this document been produced in
                Irish and Ulster-Scots as well as in English?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Like Billy Hutchinson, who has now left, I
                wish to declare an interest. I too am a member of two boards of
                governors, and, therefore, I come to this with some background
                in education.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I preface my comments on this long-overdue
                but nonetheless welcome consultation document by reminding the
                Minister of his Department’s key objective as stated on page
                five. If that principle is firmly adhered to and all schools,
                regardless of the sector or area in which they are located,
                receive similar levels of funding, such an equitable and
                transparent system will be welcomed by all in the House. In that
                vein, the matter of actual teacher costs rather than average
                teacher costs must be resolved. That could make a fundamental
                difference to small schools, rural schools and schools in TSN
                areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although the teachers’ salary protection
                mechanism has been in place and has lessened the financial
                difficulties experienced by schools, the Minister must revisit
                and refocus on that area. Teaching costs have also been referred
                to; they often reflect the length of service of staff. Therefore
                boards of governors, in an effort to balance the books, may on
                occasion be tempted, for financial reasons, to seek less
                experienced and, therefore, less expensive staff. That can often
                happen at a TSN school that most needs the expertise of an
                experienced teacher but finds that the financial implications
                unfortunately outweigh the educational necessities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The common funding formula would also ensure
                that these schools could skew more of their budgets internally
                towards the provision of books and materials. It is frightening
                to look at the few pounds that are spent on books and materials.
                The figure of 80% for teachers’ salary costs has been referred
                to; I suggest that 90% is, perhaps, a more accurate figure.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The efficient delivery of the curriculum via
                the most proficient teachers available should outweigh any
                consideration of the sanctity of the current LMS model. I refer
                the Minister and his officials to page 75 of the consultation
                document. In an attempt to justify the LMS model, the Department
                is frightened that it might be seriously weakened if the actual
                teacher costs were taken back into the Department. Sammy Wilson
                referred to teacher and principal flexibility. I welcomed LMS
                when I was a principal; I looked forward to creating a nest egg
                from which my school could benefit and to producing all those
                things that the education and library board could not give me.
                Unfortunately, that was not how the system worked. Most teachers
                and principals now find that there is little real flexibility in
                the system.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The proposed introduction of the most recent
                enrolment figures will be helpful for schools in their pursuit
                of local management of resources. It will diminish the prospect
                of a future clawback scenario, which is currently a
                consideration in many schools that have seriously fluctuating
                populations. We have seen that par excellence in Belfast during
                the summer months, with school populations disappearing almost
                overnight.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The premises factor presented the Minister
                with the opportunity to be as radical as possible. It was a
                chance to integrate the voluntary grammar schools and the
                grant-maintained integrated schools under the umbrella of the
                education and library boards. Surely that would have led to a
                reduction in the duplication of services, a simpler formula and
                the opportunity to use the undoubted expertise that resides in
                the education and library boards.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the small percentage increase in
                TSN, which will enable schools to tackle social deprivation and
                special educational needs — the core problems long associated
                with low achievement. Despite reference to local and
                international research — and the uptake of free school meals
                has been referred to in the Chamber as a very good indicator of
                social need — I am still not totally convinced. However, the
                task is about tackling educational underachievement, wherever it
                is found, and I am pleased that extra resources will be made
                available to tackle the problem.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I note the working party’s concern that
                there might be some local difficulties as Key Stage 2 results,
                which are essentially school-based, could also be used as
                performance indicators. However, if the Department puts proper
                safeguards into place, Key Stage 2 results will prove to be a
                step in the right direction, especially if they can be linked
                with a robust, baseline assessment at year 1.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I remind the Minister of my previous request
                for a review of the current early-years arrangements so that we
                can be totally sure that we are building our primary and
                post-primary sectors on an educationally sound foundation. Other
                Members have expressed the same concern in their comments today.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As regards small school support, being the
                former principal of a two-teacher school west of the Bann, I
                fully appreciate the benefits that small rural schools can
                accrue, now that their problems have been identified. It has
                taken many years, but I am glad that the document has at least
                identified the problems faced by principals who teach in that
                scenario. I fully support the mechanism that would release those
                principals from the classroom situation for at least one day per
                week, so that they could attend to their increasing
                administrative and management duties.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not fully convinced about the Department’s
                reference to teachers’ salary costs and the role that boards
                of governors may have had in the past as having led to financial
                difficulties for some schools today. I am sure it is not beyond
                the ingenuity of the Department to introduce stricter guidelines
                to curb the enthusiasm of some boards of governors — the
                situation will slowly resolve itself via teacher retirements and
                movements to other posts and other schools. Again, I refer to
                the actual, as opposed to the average, teacher costs. While the
                teacher salary protection factor is welcome, it is only a safety
                net and should be used only in the interim.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the new sports factor, and I
                congratulate the authors of the consultation document for
                including it. It is, at least, a realisation that there has not
                been equality of provision and of opportunity in sport across
                our educational sectors. The sports factor is to be welcomed, as
                it will ensure that the equal and efficient delivery of that
                part of the school curriculum is a fact and not just a fiction.
                It is also welcome on general public health grounds, as it will
                enable schools to properly introduce all pupils to the joys and
                benefits of a wide variety of physical activities and team
                sports — surely something that will help build habits of
                personal endeavour and community co-operation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the emergence of the document, and
                I encourage all who have an interest in our children, and in the
                future welfare of our society, to look at it in detail, to study
                its contents, to reflect upon its many implications and to
                respond with positive suggestions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, the proof of its effectiveness will
                be evident when schools in TSN areas feel that they are
                operating on a level playing field and schools in non-TSN areas
                are confident that they have not suffered any diminution in
                their resources as a result. That is an objective we should all
                be working towards. I commend the document.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dallat:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several Members have declared an interest.
                The only interest I can declare is 30 years in the teaching
                profession in which it was obvious that there were serious
                inequalities. Now there is an opportunity to address those
                inequalities for all children, not just Protestant or Catholic
                children.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have read the document carefully, and I may
                have made some mistakes and picked up some things incorrectly.
                However, even Sammy Wilson makes mistakes, if one is to judge by
                his latest press statement on the DUP website, in which he
                attacks the SDLP’s policy on education. The Member really
                ought to use a spellchecker on it and rejig the grammar.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Agreeing a common funding formula for
                grant-aided schools has to be one of the greatest challenges
                ever faced by the Department of Education. Yet it is an absolute
                necessity, given that there are seven formulae in use at
                present, some with different emphases and with little to do with
                education, targeting social need or addressing basic equality
                factors.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The consultation document is well-presented
                and sets out what appears to be some very simple options. Yet,
                as the Minister freely acknowledges, children are more complex
                than that. The existing inequalities are much more fundamental.
                There has to be some degree of apprehension that in order to
                reach agreement, please the majority of people and win approval,
                key factors could be missed. That would be a tragedy. We have to
                ask: is the funding adequate?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given that one in four people leave school
                with serious problems with literacy and numeracy — and I am
                not really including Mr Sammy Wilson in that — and that there
                are worrying differences in levels of attainment across the five
                education and library boards, one has to ask if the proposals in
                this document will improve the situation or make it worse in
                some cases. Will disparity between boards continue to exist?
                Does the reaching of a common formula divert the focus, at least
                temporarily, from serious issues that are making children
                different, causing them to under-achieve or, indeed, fail? What
                is in a common formula for those schools that are faced with
                serious challenges, which at times seem almost insurmountable?
                Will children who start out in life with horrendous
                disadvantages, such as broken homes, family upheaval, social
                disadvantage and other problems, be adequately accounted for by
                the new formula? It is critical, surely, that they are.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If economies have to be made, where will that
                happen? Term workers are all too often the victims of cutbacks.
                Their position must be ring-fenced, because they play a
                fundamental part, whether as classroom assistants or in other
                parts of the school, in ensuring that children receive personal
                attention. It is not clear what happens if substitute teachers
                are required. Will enforced economies mean that classes are
                doubled-up to make savings? The point I am making is that where
                reductions occur, soft targets must not be picked on, and the
                needs of children must not come second. Ideally, it would be
                much better to have no losers, but that is not possible, given
                all that must be done with the block grant.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is to be welcomed that those schools
                qualifying for an increased budget will have access to it as
                soon as possible. That is critical if the reasons for inequality
                are to be addressed in the shortest possible time. We need to be
                clear about what is meant by relative need, and the principles
                of equality and targeting social need must apply to that
                definition. The delivery of the school curriculum must be
                clearly enhanced rather than diminished by changes in the
                funding formula, and the formula must underpin and reinforce the
                wider educational policy and objectives.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The success of this exercise will be judged
                by the degree of transparency that exists in the new policy. It
                is essential that it be logical, easy to administer and capable
                of being applied fairly. We need to be satisfied that children
                in every part of Northern Ireland, and in every kind of school,
                have an equal opportunity to achieve. Children who are
                disadvantaged through no fault of their own must have their
                needs ring-fenced so that the injustices that existed in the
                past are consigned to history. Is there sufficient scope to
                protect small rural schools in both primary and secondary
                sectors? How will the proposed changes fit into the challenge of
                regenerating the rural communities that are so important to life
                on this island?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I can assure the Minister that this is one
                document that will not gather dust. It will be scrutinised from
                cover to cover to ensure that the changes are in the best
                interests of the people who matter most; our children and their
                children’s children.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.
                Ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an díospóireacht seo. De
                réir mo bharúla, is ábhar fíorthábhachtach é seo. Is é an
                rud atá faoi chaibidil againn ná an dóigh a leithroinneann an
                Roinn Oideachais airgead ar ár gcuid scoileanna.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the consultation. This subject has
                taken up a good deal of the Education Committee’s time to date
                and will continue to do so in the coming weeks and months.
                Similar to Mr Dallat, I enjoyed Mr Sammy Wilson’s contribution
                — he displayed tremendous ingenuity and imagination. I will
                never know how he managed to embroider Sinn Féin’s electoral
                strategy west of the Bann on to this document. He also used
                phrases such as &quot;jumping up and down&quot; and
                &quot;blowing gaskets&quot;. That terminology is perhaps more
                fitting to his behaviour than to that of those to whom he
                attributes it. He might deserve a gold star for his imagination,
                but there is room for improvement in his punctuality. He arrived
                late for an education debate today, not for the first time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the reassurance that this is to be
                a genuine consultation exercise and that decisions have not yet
                been made. I also welcome the opportunity to contribute to the
                debate. The way in which money is channelled to classrooms is a
                very important aspect of the education system. There is
                widespread concern among different schools that the seven
                different formulae used at present to determine budgets
                delegated to schools have led to discrepancies between board
                areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with the Chairman of the Education
                Committee, Mr Kennedy, about asking the Minister to consider an
                extension to the consultation period. Schools, especially
                post-primary ones, are currently busy with final exam
                preparations. Thousands of pieces of coursework are being marked
                and parcelled away. Far from winding down, teachers are now on
                an upward curve of workload and stress. For many in education,
                the second half of June might be the first real opportunity to
                give this consultation document the serious thought that it
                merits. As one of the Education Committee members who asked for
                the deadline to be moved to the end of June, I would like the
                Minister to consider moving the deadline forward in the light of
                its delayed start. That point was adequately covered by Mr
                Kennedy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with the Minister that there is a
                need to standardise how delegated school budgets are calculated.
                That need for standardisation should not obscure the fact that
                we are dealing with a society riven with disadvantage. In
                particular, it is important to realise that disadvantage is not
                only due to the circumstances of a particular child and his or
                her parent’s income. A child can also be disadvantaged by the
                area in which he or she lives. In a seminal piece of research
                carried out in Scotland in 1991 by Garner and Raudenbush
                entitled ‘Neighbourhood Effects on Educational Attainment: A
                Multi-level Analysis’, it was said that psychological studies
                have shown that some types of residential environments are
                associated with particular personality characteristics. These
                predispose individuals to respond differently to education. The
                nature of the residential environment can facilitate or
                constrain interaction among individuals. Restricted contact with
                adults has been shown to influence young children’s language
                development, and some young adults may be more susceptible to
                peer group pressures in such an environment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are other socio-economic factors in
                areas in which people live to suggest that there is a
                substantial variation in educational attainment between
                neighbourhoods. That is an important factor that should be added
                to the overall equation. The effect of area or neighbourhood
                deprivation is additional to the effect of individual and family
                background influences. When translated into employment
                prospects, that may be of real significance in determining the
                future life chances of young people. To put it simply, a child
                carries with him or her disadvantage from the area in which he
                or she lives. Two academics from Queen’s University, Daly and
                Shuttleworth, confirmed this trend — where one lives is as
                important as who one is or what one’s characteristics are.
                There is a compounding effect of disadvantage; this has an
                impact on a school in terms of the number of children there who
                suffer from social disadvantage.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Research has clearly established the link
                between socio-economic status and positive attitudes to
                schooling. Therefore if a group of 10 pupils includes three from
                disadvantaged backgrounds and seven from better-off backgrounds,
                it is likely that the attitudes of the seven will influence the
                three. The reverse is also true.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I suggest that in targeting social need in
                schools the degree of social need of the whole catchment area or
                school population, and not just of individual pupils, should be
                included as a factor.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I express caution about the inclusion of Key
                Stage 2 results in the calculation of TSN funding, particularly
                in the case of primary schools. There is a lack of
                standardisation, and it is financially unsound, because it
                channels funding to a school on the basis of the results of its
                outgoing pupils, not the needs of its intake. That is unfair,
                because it penalises those schools that achieve better results
                against all odds.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the fact that Mr Tommy Gallagher
                and my Colleague Mr Gerry McHugh emphasised rurality. Reference
                was made to schools with similar characteristics. School
                transport pressures are enormous in rural areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would be interested to hear views on the
                premises factor and the grounds factor — the sports factor —
                to which some Members have referred. Similar to other Members, I
                very much welcome the proposals that lead to an increase in
                full-time early years education. Over the long haul it will be a
                wise investment and economy. It is obvious that that needs to be
                better co-ordinated and financed than previously.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to make a few disparate points now —
                disparate as opposed to desperate; there is an &quot;i&quot; in
                there as opposed to an &quot;e&quot;. I read an article recently
                in which a senior official from one of the teachers’ unions
                referred to a demographic time bomb of dwindling numbers in
                secondary schools. We have that problem at present with our
                primary schools. Is the Minister looking at that trend?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another area, which is often referred to by
                educationalists, is the duplication of services in relation to
                the five education and library boards and the Department. There
                is a need to direct more money into the classroom, rather than
                top-slicing the money for administration. We are talking about a
                review of educational administration and an increase in the
                overall pot.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Monica McWilliams asked a very sensible
                question in relation to the marginal increase in TSN money from
                5% to 5·5%. How was that figure arrived at? The free school
                meals entitlement is as good a mechanism as any currently in
                existence for arriving at an analysis of deprivation. However,
                perhaps the incorporation of the neighbourhood effect into the
                calculations would further equalise opportunities for
                individuals presently suffering deprivation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, I raise a discordant note in
                relation to what some Members have said about support for Irish-
                medium education. It is only discordant for some Members,
                because I know that others support my view. I believe strongly
                that &quot;a comparatively small factor&quot; in the
                calculations should be the inclusion of support for Irish-medium
                schools and units. The Department proposes to bring this on to a
                consistent footing and to continue its inclusion in the future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I record my party’s support, and I express
                disappointment and surprise that the pro-agreement Ulster
                Unionist Party is attempting to see this aspect eradicated from
                the formula calculation. It is as if the Good Friday Agreement
                and the bounden duty on the Minister and Ministers and on the
                Department and Departments to take resolute action to promote
                Irish-medium education did not exist. Quite clearly it does
                exist. There is plenty of room for support for catch-up on the
                part of Irish- medium education and other sectors where there
                has been underinvestment in the past. Go raibh maith agat.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Carson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this
                motion. I should declare an interest as a former teacher, the
                principal of a rural primary school and a member of some boards
                of governors.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We all wish to see education money going to
                where it is needed and wanted — to the classrooms and the
                pupils, and not to administration. Money that is well spent in
                the classrooms will have results for future generations.
                Northern Ireland has a small population of only 1·7 million,
                but we have a plethora of administrative bodies. Has the time
                not come for the House to look at some consolidation? Do we
                really need them all? Could savings not be made by reducing the
                duplication of administration and the plethora of education
                sectors?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The key principles listed on page 7 of the
                consultation document are laudable, but I am concerned with some
                of the wording. For example, in paragraph v.i at the first
                bullet point it says:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;schools should be funded according to
                relative need&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Who is going to decide what is relative? At
                the second bullet point it says:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;unavoidable and significant additional
                expenditure&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Who is going to deal with that? It seems a
                bit wavery. Then it says at the third bullet point that</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;the formula should support schools in
                delivering the curriculum&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If schools are inspected only every seven
                years or more, who knows which school is doing what or what
                curriculum is being delivered?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some rural schools are under intense pressure
                from a falling enrolment, and I welcome the additional funding
                that is to be found to enable those schools to employ an extra
                teacher to enable principals to spend one day a week on
                management and administrative duties. I was never afforded that
                luxury.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I note that the pupil count will exclude
                nursery and special classes and Irish-medium units. Children in
                those schools have a higher financial rating. How encouraging to
                have an Irish-medium unit to boost funding, but what about an
                Ulster-Scots unit? Can rural schools in Antrim and Down have
                parity of treatment and an Ulster-Scots unit?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Continuing on the theme of equality, I cannot
                understand why Irish-language schools need preferential
                treatment. I read with great amusement that these schools have
                been given an extra £100 per head in a lump sum — £31,000,
                almost £32,000, per school — for administration and
                management. On page 105 of the consultation document it states
                that this extra £100 is to meet the cost of teacher time spent
                on preparing materials and delivering an extra subject at Key
                Stage 2. If equality is to prevail in schools, should extra
                money not also be made available for a European language? That
                too could be considered as an extra and vital subject, given our
                developing European links. That should be considered carefully.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One group of children is not being treated
                equally, and that is the children in some of the preparatory
                schools. They have hardly even been mentioned in the document,
                and they gained funding set at only 30% of the approved teaching
                costs. Their parents have made a choice, exactly the same choice
                that is given to parents who wish to have their children taught
                through the medium of Irish. Why is there no equality of
                treatment for those children whose parents have made their
                choice? That must also be looked at carefully.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Boards of governors have a great
                responsibility in the appointment of staff, and they have the
                added concern of ascertaining how new appointments and salaries
                can affect the school budgets. More research should be done into
                the possibility of removing teachers’ salaries from the LMS.
                Boards of governors are unpaid and should not have to undertake
                problems of school finance that should be, or perhaps could be,
                better dealt with by a central administrative body.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Schools of similar size have great variations
                in the salaries paid to staff, and some schools have principals
                and vice-principals holding protected salaries, even though
                their enrolments have fallen. This is an unreasonable burden on
                school budgets and another reason for removing teachers’
                salaries from the LMS.</p>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the chapter ‘Funding Outcomes’ such
                woolly terms as &quot;assumptions&quot;, &quot;reasonably
                accurate&quot; and &quot;may be considerably less&quot; are
                used. These words are vague and could lead to abuse.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I urge all interested persons — parents,
                teachers, boards of governors, retired teachers, people with
                interests in children — to read the consultation in the
                interests of our children, and to try to ensure that all
                children have equal treatment with regard to school funding.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr ONeill:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Everybody is in the humour for declaring
                interests, so I had better declare mine. I sit on a board of
                governors, and I have been a teacher for many years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion, and I welcome the
                opportunity to deal with this serious problem. It is not a new
                problem; it has been a source of longstanding concern for many
                involved in the profession, and others. As Members are aware, it
                is also an important and significant part of the Programme for
                Government, which set out to create a single funding formula
                with regard for equality and the New TSN.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, who could disagree with an
                investigation into how available resources should be more
                equitably distributed? One of the outcomes of the document is
                that there will be an increase — and a considerable increase,
                in some cases — of funding for smaller schools, particularly
                rural primary schools. That emphasis by the Minister of
                Education and the Department is to be welcomed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members have listened to, watched and lived
                through too many instances in which local rural schools were
                closed down, thus causing great distress to the community. Once
                the school goes, that community begins to lose its identity —
                it is like taking the heart of a rural community. However, it is
                good to see that efforts are being made to ensure small schools’
                survival because those schools can provide a competent
                curriculum — that is particularly important, and that is where
                resources are so important.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, if the corollary of that is to try
                to reduce funding in the secondary sector, which is already
                hard-pressed, I fear that educationalists in both sectors will
                be unhappy. Robbing Peter to pay Paul will not work and will not
                be accepted.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also looked with some interest at the
                effects on the education and library boards when a reduction of
                £15 million was suggested in the higher options. I noticed that
                the Belfast Education and Library Board managed to save some
                money in the funding arrangements, but other boards will have to
                pay for that reduction. The South Eastern Education and Library
                Board will have to pay £1·5 million, and the other boards will
                have to pay roughly £3 million, £4 million and £5 million.
                The £15 million received from that will be used to help with
                some of the proposals. I wonder if that has been rationalised.
                When the proposals are being examined it is hoped that
                sufficient time is given to examining how the boards will deal
                with that reduction.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Do we wait to see how the review of local
                services pans out? My own preference is that we proceed now with
                funding and the establishment of principles rather than wait for
                the outcome of the review. Perhaps the outcome is relevant to
                boards and what will happen to them, but the significant point
                to be addressed is how they are to achieve that saving. The
                Minister referred to TSN’s providing some assistance through
                the Curriculum Advisory and Support Service (CASS) and other
                mechanisms. My fear is that the first thing to be cut will be
                the CASS provision that boards provide, which could result in
                redundancies. What will happen to substitute cover? The
                situation may arise in which a primary school head teacher
                cannot take a day away from school because substitute cover is
                unavailable.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Commonality of funding requires some detailed
                examination. Why should centrally held resources, which involve
                many schemes that schools welcome and readily participate in, be
                included in the general schools budget? Should that not come as
                an initiative from the Department? Does it not create an
                imbalance to have it included in the general schools budget?
                Perhaps separate funding is the answer.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are told that the implementation of a
                common LMS formula will bring greater fairness, consistency and
                transparency to school funding. Members have already spoken
                about LMS, and I do not think I am alone in thinking that LMS is
                a con job carried out on educationalists and a secure basis on
                which to build a budgetary regime.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several Members have already stated that on
                average, 80% of the schools’ budget is spent on salaries. I
                agree with Ken Robinson’s point, because my experience has
                been that the percentage is often 90% of the schools’ budget.
                Some Members are not paying due regard to the awful situation
                that that can produce. As each year passes and the age profile
                of the teaching staff increases, a significant economic scissors
                exercise is initiated. That cuts into the non-salary part of the
                budget to such an extent that head teachers carry an enormous
                burden trying to make ends meet and provide additional
                resources. The Department has given some support, but
                essentially it is not a good system for debasing a budgetary
                profile, and it must not be tolerated.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Management committees are faced with the
                possibility of making staff redundant to undo the scissors
                effect. And who will be made redundant? Experienced teachers,
                the most valuable resource, will be made redundant, because they
                earn the highest salaries. Is that fair to our profession? Is
                this what we want to do — remove the best teachers? More
                importantly, is it fair to our children to remove their best
                resource — professional, experienced teachers? That is what
                has happened. Nobody in the Chamber today can put their hand on
                their heart and say that that has not happened. I am sure that
                Members know of examples, and I can give them to you if you need
                them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that the inquiry into the local
                management of schools, which I understand is in tandem with this
                consultation, will ensure that this Thatcherite policy is got
                rid of. That policy was about trying to make schools more
                businesslike. We cannot make businesses out of our schools. We
                have learned that it cannot be done — mostly with regret. In
                any new proposals, the Department of Education should meet
                teaching costs in full.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a former history teacher, I would like to
                be permitted to give the Minister and my good friend, Sammy
                Wilson, a brief history lesson in TSN. In the early 1990s, the
                former Department of Education for Northern Ireland set aside 5%
                of the schools’ budget for social need. That was meant to
                ensure that schools with deprived children would receive extra
                funding. The money was then allocated on the basis of the number
                of children who were entitled to free school meals, which was
                the indicator that was used at the time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The setting aside of only 5% was criticised
                in 1997 by the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee in its report
                ‘Underachievement in Northern Ireland Secondary Schools’. It
                concluded that</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;it is quite clear that the figure of 5%
                is simply based on previous expenditure.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There was no rationale; the figure was based
                only on previous expenditure.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">TSN funding is money that should have been
                spent on educational projects, but in a new money scenario. In
                other words, it should not have been done in the same way as
                before.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee looked at the identified needs
                of TSN in 1997.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The 5% does not seem to have been
                arrived at by a process which recognised TSN as a
                priority.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That 5% was also criticised by the Standing
                Advisory Commission on Human Rights (SACHR), who agreed with the
                Northern Ireland Affairs Committee that the allocation of TSN
                was merely old money with a new name. SACHR said:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;a 5% top slicing does not begin to
                address the disparity between, for example, the notional ‘costs’
                of a student from the highest and lowest social class, public
                spending on the former …&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is important, particularly for those
                interested in the private or preparatory school agenda. I
                repeat:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">— &quot;public spending on the former&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">— that is, the higher —</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;being about 64% higher than on their
                poorer counterpart.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is some disparity. Do not challenge me
                on those statistics — challenge the Standing Advisory
                Commission on Human Rights.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister’s proposals are before us. He
                suggests raising the figure to 5·5%, and, as he indicated, that
                means an extra £4 million for schools with many disadvantaged
                children. Plainly, this does not constitute a significant
                skewing of resources towards those most in need, especially when
                one considers that the 5% never represented new money in the
                first place. I find this aspect of the document disappointing.
                The Minister needs to review the notional cost of educating
                children from poor and rich backgrounds and then make a
                realistic inroad towards equalising it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is clear that an extra £4 million will
                not do that.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.30 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We heard comments about the number of
                disruptive children being on the increase. All the educational
                research that I ever came across linked disruption in the
                classroom with social disadvantage of one sort or another. There
                is an increasing need to provide resources to help deal with
                those problem children.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is not all the responsibility of the
                Minister of Education. There is also a responsibility on the
                Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety to
                provide additional resources in many areas to help with
                disruptive children. The Minister will recall that the last time
                I spoke on this subject in the House, disruptive children were
                the problem that I was endeavouring to identify, but other
                people were talking about different kinds of political
                disruption. It is an issue that needs to be addressed. Under the
                heading of social need, a great deal could be done.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should welcome this document as a first
                step, but we need to cautiously await the outcome of the
                consultation period with the individual schools. Only then will
                we get a real picture of how we should proceed, and from that we
                will get our recommendations.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am trying to squeeze in a couple more
                Members before the Minister responds.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr ONeill:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How very perceptive of you, Mr Deputy
                Speaker, to detect that I have just finished my speech.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs I Robinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the opportunity to speak about this
                document, and I have to declare an interest as I am also on a
                board of governors.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While it is laudable to desire a common
                formula, we must not blind ourselves to a number of crucial
                points. Too often since the Minister came to power we have seen
                wholesale discrimination in a number of areas. Education is now,
                in my opinion, the most discriminatory Department in Northern
                Ireland. There is a very real concern that this common formula
                is a mask to encourage yet more discrimination against the
                controlled sector.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Devising a new methodology for funding
                education is a bureaucrat’s delight. If we read the spin,
                everyone is a winner. We heard the same thing when the
                student-powered unit of resources (SPURs) formula was introduced
                into higher education, although no one in the Department is
                capable of explaining why some colleges have been losing out.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, any common formula must not simply be
                a matter of robbing Peter to pay Paul. If it is a matter of
                removing money from the secondary/grammar sector for the primary
                sector, that will not be acceptable. Any legal challenges that
                they might bring forth because of any losses would be right and
                proper.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, the primary sector has not been
                receiving its proper and legitimate share of the funding. There
                is no doubt that the primary sector will be the biggest gainer
                from this new formula. That will not, however, address the
                underinvestment that is only too readily apparent. No common
                formula will address that. The real question for the primary
                sector is what steps will be taken to deal with the
                underinvestment. The debate over a common formula must not be
                used as a foil to cover up this crucial issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thirdly, no common formula will address the
                obvious gravy-train effect that some elements bring to some
                schools. If we take TSN, for example, in the form of free school
                meals, there is overwhelming evidence that there is a lower
                take-up in the controlled sector than in other sectors. As a
                result, controlled schools are losing out, because Protestants
                traditionally do not seek Government handouts. There is
                absolutely nothing in this document that will address that
                issue, nor any indication that either the Minister or his
                Department has any interest in dealing with it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fourthly, there is an imperative that per
                capita weighting actually reflects what it costs to deliver the
                core curriculum in the classroom. So far, that has not been
                reflected in primary funding. It cannot be overlooked in favour
                of the more popular add-ins that are so favoured by the
                Department, such as social deprivation. Those elements have been
                milked to good effect in some schools.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, there is the obvious point that the
                single greatest gainer by far in every section is the
                grant-maintained integrated (GMI) school. Is it not amazing that
                that sector is the one favoured by the Minister? Is it not also
                amazing that the new common formula helps those that the
                Minister is biased towards? For example, if you take large
                primary schools with low free school meals (FSM) the grant
                maintained integrated school is a massive £100,000 better off.
                If you take large secondary schools with low FSM, some of the
                most efficient will be worse off, but the one that gains most is
                the GMI — by a massive £300,000. That tells us everything.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The long-term impact of this new proposal
                will be to compound the state that education is now in. Any
                common base that exists soon loses its commonality once you
                start to add in a whole host of other data. The result will be
                that those elements that attract extra funding will, in time, be
                used by schools to get extra funding. That will inevitably mean
                that schools that cannot use those elements are discriminated
                against. Therefore instead of being reversed, the current trend
                will be enhanced.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are witnessing the impact of a policy for
                which one child is worth more than another. It is therefore in a
                school’s interest to concentrate on those who are worth more
                financially than the rest. That is grossly unfair, yet it is the
                policy now favoured by the Minister.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While the debate on funding will be taken up
                by many, it is essential that all those matters are given
                exposure, otherwise we will have a result where only the
                favoured ideas get mentioned. I implore all those involved in
                education to study this document very carefully. The
                implications are far-reaching. Equally, I would expect the
                Department to be flexible if the time limit has to be extended
                to facilitate a full response.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Beggs:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to register an interest in this
                subject, first, as a parent of primary-school-age children, and
                secondly, as a parent-governor of my local primary school. As
                others have stated, there are severe pressures on the primary
                school sector. Many are concerned that they currently have an
                inadequate budget, and that needs to be addressed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of particular concern to me, as a member of
                the Higher and Further Education, Training and Employment
                Committee, is the large number of adults who have been through
                primary and secondary school but who still do not have basic
                educational skills. Some were failed at primary school; they
                struggled through the secondary school system, and eventually
                they came out without the education that we all would like them
                to have. It is important that these failings are picked up and
                addressed at the earliest possible level so that people’s
                formative years in education are to their best advantage and to
                the best advantage of the entire community and the economy of
                Northern Ireland. Therefore I support additional funding for the
                primary school sector.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another issue that I feel strongly about is
                equality. In this document we see the Irish language being set
                out for special treatment. That is not equality. That is
                creating inequality in our society. Current figures are
                proposing a sum of £100 per pupil to assist the development of
                the curriculum and an additional £25 per pupil. In a classroom
                of 30 pupils, that could mean an additional £3,750. The reality
                in existing primary schools is that they are running at a
                deficit or are on the breadline, through no fault of their own.
                They find that they are struggling to survive; they have no
                money whatsoever for the purchase of additional books and
                equipment. It is essential that this sort of thing does not
                happen, for it creates inequalities in society.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important that people have a choice in
                how and where they are educated. Let that be reflected in a fair
                system that is applied to everyone equally. Inequalities should
                be removed, not created.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In smaller schools in the primary school
                sector, and in the smaller rural schools, teaching salaries make
                up a vast proportion of the budget given over for local
                administration. However, through no fault of the school or the
                governors, as teachers move up the scale — through age,
                experience, additional training or points — their wages
                increase. As a result of a teacher’s simply remaining at a
                school for a longer period, less of a budget is available for
                books and equipment. Surely that is wrong and needs to be
                addressed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Carson asked about how we can improve the
                educational system in Northern Ireland, how we need to address
                the bureaucracy created over the years as well as the amount of
                money spent and the amount of duplication that occurs in the
                various structures developed. We have education and library
                boards, the Northern Ireland Council for Integrated Education (NICIE)
                and the CCMS. Do we really need such duplication of services? An
                integrated approach to managing all schools would be better as
                it would ensure that the maximum amount of funding reaches our
                pupils.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The money should be spent on our children so
                that they receive the maximum amount of funding and benefit
                during the formative years of their education, both at primary
                and secondary school. We should not, for political or other
                reasons, allow money to be wasted, duplicated or spent through
                bureaucratic structures, which result in a degree of social
                engineering and which inhibit integration in our society.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I endorse the concept of equality and a
                single system of ensuring equality of funding to our schools,
                but I do not see that in the report. There may be some good
                things in the report, but work still needs to be done. My
                colleagues in the Committee will continue to press those points
                so that a fair system of equality can develop in Northern
                Ireland.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Education (Mr M McGuinness):&nbsp;</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> </b>A
                LeasCheann Comhairle, I apologise to Mr Beggs for leaving the
                Chamber during his speech.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am grateful to all Members who contributed
                to the debate. It has been important and has served to reinforce
                the importance attached by the Assembly to the commonality of
                school funding. A large number of substantive matters were
                raised in the debate. Given the time constraints, I will deal
                with as many points as possible.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Kennedy raised the issue of the
                consultation period. The deadline of 29 June effectively allows
                schools three months to respond, which is substantially in
                excess of the standard eight-week period for consultations.
                Briefing conferences are being held at the end of April in each
                board area to explain and clarify the proposals to schools and
                chairmen of boards of governors and to assist them in framing
                responses.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Response forms, allowing for tick-box
                responses and further written comments if desired, have been
                sent to all recipients of the document to facilitate matters.
                Four schools have already responded.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those measures should help ensure that
                schools can meet the timescale. The school summer break dictates
                the end of June deadline, as does the need to allow sufficient
                time to consider the responses to consultation and to discuss
                any revised proposals with the Education Committee and the
                Executive before they are finalised. Adequate time must also be
                allowed for making the necessary changes to operational
                arrangements in the Department and the boards to ensure the
                smooth implementation of a common formula in April 2002.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Schools are the key constituents. At a
                meeting of around 250 principals from the South Eastern
                Education Library Board area today no mention was made of the
                consultation period’s being too short. The consultation period
                is manageable if we work at it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Danny Kennedy, Barry McElduff, Joan Carson
                and some other Members raised the matter of the Irish- medium
                schools and units. I am satisfied that the proposals in the
                document are fair and equitable. Irish-medium schools and units
                have significant additional costs associated with their
                particular type of provision, and the formula must take them
                into account. The approach is in full accord with the principles
                under which the formula was developed that provide for funding
                according to relative need. Irish-medium schools and units do
                not have access to the same range of curriculum materials as
                other schools. At Key Stage 2, Irish-medium primary schools and
                units must teach English, so they carry an additional curricular
                requirement to English-medium schools. To fulfil this demand it
                is proposed that Irish-medium schools and units will receive
                additional help to meet the cost of teachers’ time spent on
                developing curriculum materials and delivering an additional
                subject at Key Stage 2.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Irish-medium units are small; they have an
                intake of around nine to 10 pupils a year. They operate as
                discrete units under the management arrangements of host
                English-medium schools. They face the same problems as small
                schools in that they must provide the full curriculum for pupils
                within the limited budget generated by their small enrolment.
                The help proposed for Irish-medium schools is along similar
                lines to that proposed for small schools. The help is, however,
                slightly less generous in recognition of the fact that the units
                operate under the management framework of host schools.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Monica McWilliams, Danny Kennedy, Tommy
                Gallagher, Billy Hutchinson, Sammy Wilson and Joan Carson raised
                the question of teachers’ salaries. The problem of
                above-average salary costs is most evident in small schools —
                mainly primary schools. All LMS formulae contain a teacher’s
                salary protection factor that helps to compensate schools for
                these extra costs. Above-average teaching costs are unavoidable
                in some schools. However, there is evidence that, in some cases,
                variations are due in part to the decisions of boards of
                governors in determining the structure of the schools through
                the awarding of responsibility points for teachers and increased
                salaries for principals and vice-principals. Removing teachers’
                salaries from the LMS would bring its future into question, as
                teacher costs comprise 80% of a school’s budget. A centralised
                model for determining and allocating staff would be required,
                and flexibility to determine staffing at school level would be
                lost.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Minister accept that if the document
                is to be truly consultative and issues are to be dealt with in a
                proper manner, he and his Department should leave themselves
                open to the suggestion that actual teacher costs rather than
                average teacher costs should be met? He seems to be dismissing
                that out of hand from the Dispatch Box at the very outset of the
                consultative process.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr M McGuinness:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The document proposes an extension to the
                teacher’s salary protection factor so that more schools are
                included; that will alleviate the problem for schools that are
                most affected. Views have been invited on all of these matters
                and on whether teachers’ salaries should remain with the LMS.
                This is an opportunity for people to make an impact on the
                proposals that have been made, and it is vital that people
                contribute in a positive way. The opportunity for that is there.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Tommy Gallagher asked what is meant by
                similar funding for similar schools when all schools are
                different.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The formula allocates funding for those
                factors that significantly increase the need for expenditure in
                schools. For example, the factors could be the number and age of
                pupils, the premises or educational and social needs. Similar
                schools would be those that share similar circumstances under
                these factors. Under the common formula such schools will
                receive similar funding.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Tommy Gallagher also raised the matter of the
                aggregated schools budget (ASB). Our current policy is to
                maximise the level of funding to the classroom. If the resources
                to be distributed by the common formula were to be derived from
                a simple summing of the current ASBs for the education and
                library boards, the grant-maintained integrated sector and the
                voluntary grammar sector, it would not achieve the key
                educational objective of maximising the delivery of resources to
                the classroom.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It would also be unfair to those education
                and library boards that have made the greatest efforts to
                increase delegation, as it would redistribute the additional
                funding they have made available across all boards. As a result,
                schools in those board areas that currently have high levels of
                delegation would lose funding, while those in board areas with
                lower levels of delegation would gain.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Therefore I intend to discuss with boards how
                to bring levels of delegation to a more consistently higher
                level. This will require a realignment of budgets within boards
                and may involve some hard decisions. If the level of funding in
                all boards were raised to the level of the highest funding
                board, the ASB would increase by around £15 million. This
                represents the high ASB option set out in the consultation
                document.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Under the high ASB option, 88% of all schools
                would gain – the nursery, primary, post-primary sectors, as
                well as school sectors of all management types. The high ASB
                option will benefit all parts of the education system and will
                deliver substantially more resources to the classroom. I will be
                working with the boards and our other education partners towards
                this outcome.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Gerry McHugh raised the issue of the
                condition of school buildings and energy costs. The data
                required to construct such an element in the premises factor is
                not available, although it may be provided by the schools estate
                database when it is operational. There is also the difficulty
                that the inclusion of such elements in the premises factor could
                actually serve as a disincentive to schools to maintain property
                or adopt energy efficient practices. However, we have sought the
                views of schools on this important issue, and we will consider
                it again when the schools estate database is fully operational.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Oliver Gibson, Eileen Bell, Billy Hutchinson
                and Sammy Wilson raised, in varying degrees, the whole issue of
                free school meals as a TSN indicator. There is extensive
                research, both local and international, which demonstrates a
                link between entitlement to free school meals and social
                disadvantage. The free-school-meals entitlement is a good
                measure of social disadvantage, and the research is readily
                available, easily updated and effectively avoids the
                postcode-related problems associated with population census
                indicators such as the Robson index.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Research has also clearly demonstrated that
                children from socially disadvantaged circumstances are more
                likely to lack motivation to learn; they exhibit behavioural and
                attendance problems, have low educational attainment, leave
                school early, and become unemployed. Schools incur additional
                costs in meeting the needs of those pupils through pastoral care
                programmes, liasing with external agencies, additional teacher
                support, and so on. Therefore I am satisfied that free school
                meals should continue to be used as an indicator of social
                disadvantage and that schools should receive an element of
                funding to reflect the incidence of such pupils.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The proposals in the document are to include
                educational indicators — Key Stage 2 results — alongside
                entitlement to free school meals in a TSN indicator. That will
                direct TSN resources more accurately to schools with pupils in
                need. In particular, the revised indicator will target more
                effectively schools with pupils who are not socially
                disadvantaged but are, nevertheless, performing below the
                expected level for their age. That will address a long-standing
                criticism of the current TSN arrangements in the LMS and will be
                widely welcomed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Oliver Gibson talked about responses from the
                boards. I am happy to copy responses from the boards — the
                Council for Catholic Maintained Schools, the Governing Bodies
                Association, the Northern Ireland Council for Integrated
                Education, Comhairle na Gaelscolaíochta — to the Education
                Committee and also to education associations and unions. I am
                happy to provide analyses of responses.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Eileen Bell asked about the targeting
                social need proposals in the document. Those proposals will pick
                up pupils who do not currently attract specific funding,
                including pupils who are not socially disadvantaged but are low
                achievers. Such pupils will attract funding under the revised
                special educational needs proposals in the TSN factor.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Transitional funding arrangements will be an
                integral part of the formula. The Department of Education will
                ensure that boards are allocated sufficient funding to meet
                transitional funding needs. Mrs Bell also spoke about the need
                for training. The introduction of the common formula has no
                implications for the role of boards of governors, and no
                specific training is required. There are mechanisms involving
                the boards and the Department for the training of governors in
                financial management, which will continue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Eileen Bell and Ms Monica McWilliams
                raised the issue of age-weighted pupil units (AWPU) and the need
                for a regular review. I can confirm that the AWPU factor — and
                other factors in the formula — will be subject to regular
                review.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Billy Hutchinson mentioned vandalism. The
                cost of vandalism is normally met through additional funding
                from the boards’ contingency funds. I share the Member’s
                concerns at the cost of vandalism and agree that those resources
                could be put to good use elsewhere in schools. Mr Hutchinson
                also referred to sport. There is a proposal for specific funding
                for sport, and the schools themselves will decide how to spend
                the money. That will give all pupils the opportunity to benefit
                from access to the sports curriculum.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several Members were concerned that the
                consultation coincided with the post-primary and curriculum
                reviews. The common formula will have to take account of any
                changes arising from those reviews. The fact that schools will
                be funded on a common basis should assist in the implementation
                of any further changes that may arise from those reviews, as
                changes will be required to just one common formula, rather than
                to seven formulae, as at present.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Monica McWilliams and Mrs Joan Carson
                raised the issue of a review of education administration. That
                can be taken forward properly only in the context of a wider
                review of local administration, and we have all heard much about
                that recently. The Executive are dealing with that issue, and,
                no doubt, that review will have implications not just for
                education, but for many other Departments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Monica McWilliams asked about the involvement
                of Coopers &amp; Lybrand. It was part of a wider process of
                identifying and analysing the key issues, and we were able to
                get access to consultants with extensive experience of school
                funding in England, Scotland, Wales and beyond. That was more
                cost-effective than having the Department of Education undertake
                the research in-house. Ms McWilliams also spoke about the views
                of teachers, which, of course, should be taken into account. The
                views of teachers and boards of governors are absolutely
                critical, and they will be carefully considered. As I said,
                briefing conferences are being held in each board area to
                explain the proposals to principals and chairs of boards of
                governors. One took place today, and it was very successful.
                Those conferences will help teachers to understand the proposals
                and make their responses.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms McWilliams also raised the issue of
                private finance initiative schools. With regard to recurrent
                funding under the local management of schools formula, there is
                no difference between a PFI school and one provided under
                traditional arrangements. Each type of school will have to meet
                expenditure on running costs — the PFI schools by means of a
                unitary payment, and others through meeting the cost of
                individual items. Both must meet that cost from their LMS
                allocation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Sammy Wilson asked why the LMS issue was
                brought to the House in this matter. We considered that it was
                important to give Members an early opportunity to discuss such
                an important issue. Mr Wilson also asked why proposals were
                changed after a meeting with the Education Committee.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We were very anxious to meet with the
                Education Committee and to listen to its views. We were pleased
                to be able to take many of the views expressed by the Committee
                on board in the final consultation document.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Billy Hutchinson and Sammy Wilson also raised
                the issue of the impact of all of that on the Belfast Education
                and Library Board if, for example, the aggregated schools budget
                were low, and we were dealing with the low model. I sometimes
                thought that Mr S Wilson was talking about that. My clear
                objective is to move towards the high ASB model, which is based
                on all boards moving to the highest level of funding. That
                highlights the need to increase the size of the ASB to ensure
                that as many schools and sectors as possible can win.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sammy Wilson also raised a number of other
                issues about the Education Committee. He talked about giving
                more money to the maintained sector. Proposals are designed to
                meet educational need in all schools without fear or favour,
                regardless of the sector in which they may be located. The
                import of the proposals on the high or low ASB option is to move
                more resources into the controlled sector — around 2·3% —
                than into the maintained sector — 2·1%.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In terms of TSN changes, the change in the
                balance of funding between social deprivation and special
                education need (SEN) in the document, compared to the current
                position in the LMS formula, is to allocate more money under SEN
                and less under social deprivation. The proposals will, for the
                first time, direct funding to children performing below the
                expected level for their age and who are not disadvantaged, as
                well as those who are.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ken Robinson mentioned the publications that
                were produced. The document was produced in Irish to meet the
                needs of Irish-medium schools. There are currently 10
                grant-aided Irish-medium schools, nine of which are primary, one
                post-primary, and five Irish-medium units. There are currently
                no Ulster-Scots schools in the North, hence it was not
                considered necessary to produce the document in the Ulster-Scots
                language.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People should not be under any illusions
                about where I am coming from. I am only too willing, and I will
                be glad, if the demand is there, to give whatever possible
                support my Department can to people who are involved in
                Ulster-Scots and who wish to promote the language educationally.
                The document is also available in large print and on audio
                cassette on request. It can be accessed on the Department’s
                Internet site.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ken Robinson also said that not enough is
                being spent on books. I secured £1·5 million last year for
                reading materials for primary schools. I secured £14·7 million
                last year and £20·4 million this year that went directly to
                schools for whatever they chose to spend it on, including books.
                Of course, we will continue to seek additional funding for
                schools. That has always been my objective.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dallat asked from where the £15 million
                is coming, and whether it will mean cutbacks in the boards. The
                document envisages a sum of up to £15 million being added to
                delegated budgets. Under current arrangements, boards are
                allowed to reflect their own policies and priorities in
                determining their various budgets. That has led to variations in
                the level of school funding between boards. Commonality in
                delegated funding will also require greater commonality among
                boards and other areas of school funding. The means by which
                that realignment is to be implemented and the implications for
                each board will be the subject of further discussions between my
                Department and the boards over the next few months. Hard
                decisions may have to be taken, but it is vital that priority be
                given to directing funds to the classroom.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Carson raised the issue of funding for
                preparatory departments. Those schools have always been funded
                at a lower rate. Admission to a preparatory department is based
                on the ability of parents to pay the fees. The lower rate of
                grant reflects that feature.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member also raised the issue of the
                exclusion of pupils in Irish-medium and special units from the
                pupil count in relation to the small schools factor. That serves
                to put more money into the small schools, because the lower the
                pupil count, the greater the amount received under the small
                schools factor.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr ONeill mentioned LMS. It is not intended
                that schools should run as a business, and the Assembly accepts
                that. The intention is that resources should be delegated to a
                lower level, to those with power to make local decisions.
                Research conducted by the University of Ulster in 1997 revealed
                that most school principals welcomed the freedom to determine
                their own priorities, and only a few wanted the LMS to be
                abolished. Mr ONeill also talked about the £15&nbsp;million
                reduction, and we have dealt with that matter.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At present, 5% of the total schools’
                recurrent budget is top-sliced to target social need, and I
                intend to increase that amount. Moreover, it is important to
                understand that that 5% under the LMS formula is only one
                element among a wide range of TSN-related programmes supported
                by my Department. These include the school support programme;
                the group 1 schools initiative; the special educational needs
                code of practice; education outside school; support for
                travellers and children with English as an additional language;
                and the targeting of pre-school education expansion programme.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With school budgets under continued pressure,
                the additional £4 million that is being put into TSN — which
                represents a 10% increase — is significant. I am committed to
                allocating more resources to target social need if that is
                necessary, or if the Executive make additional resources
                available. I have not made a final decision about that or any of
                the other matters dealt with in the consultation document. I
                will listen carefully to any proposal on any of those matters.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In closing, a LeasCheann Comhairle, I commend
                the House on the quality of the debate. It demonstrates that
                locally elected politicians are capable of debating the issues
                that concern us in a rational and informed manner. The
                introduction of a common LMS funding formula for schools is
                about equity of funding, greater delegation of funding, and
                giving priority to the classroom. Above all, it is about helping
                to raise educational standards for all our children by ensuring
                that resources are directed where they are needed most — to
                the classroom. The proposals in the consultation document will
                achieve this.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I stress that I am willing to consider
                alternative suggestions or approaches. I encourage everyone to
                respond to the consultation document. This is a genuine
                consultation, and everyone’s view will be carefully considered
                before final decisions are taken on a common funding formula. Go
                raibh maith agat.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I appreciate the opportunity to address the
                issue of provision — or lack of provision — of an integrated
                medical and health facility in the Kilkeel and Mourne area.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The people of the Mournes have waited an
                unacceptably long time for the provision of a new integrated
                modern health facility to replace the old Mourne Hospital. That
                hospital was closed five years ago, in October 1996, by the then
                Minister of Health, Malcom Moss. Mr Moss stated that the
                hospital would be replaced by a</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;comprehensive range of services&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">and that the hospital would not close until
                such a package of measures was in place. A few months later the
                Southern Health Board, at one of its meetings, appointed — and
                I read from their minutes —</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;a short life project team…to ensure
                the smooth transition from the current service pattern to that
                which the board wishes to purchase.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That short-life team has now existed for five
                to six years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So far, the services that were to be provided
                have been provided partially, in a scattered locality, and
                certainly not in a new integrated health facility as was
                envisaged. Those who followed the problem realised that
                procrastination had reigned on this issue in the Newry and
                Mourne Health &amp; Social Services Trust, which presented
                various business cases to the Department of Health only to be
                told that further amendments would be required before the
                outline business case could be approved. That was in the context
                of the old Mourne Hospital’s not being closed until all the
                new provisions were in place. So much for ministerial edicts.
                However, I hope to exclude the current Minister from such
                criticism.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Madam Deputy Speaker [Ms Morrice] in the

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The constituent parts of the business case
                for the integrated health facility in Kilkeel have also varied
                over the years. There is a long and difficult history to the
                provision of these facilities in a new-build, all-purpose
                facility. As far back as 1988, the old Mourne Hospital was
                threatened with closure. That was vociferously opposed by the
                local community, culminating in a very strong and representative
                campaign in the five-year period from 1991 to 1996. The
                ministerial death sentence was passed on 25 October 1996. That
                older committee did not survive that decision, not because of a
                lack of enthusiasm or commitment, but because certain other
                extraneous legal matters brought it to an abrupt and unfortunate
                end.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since then, the people of the Mournes have
                been without access to a proper integrated medical facility. The
                ministerial statement of 25 October 1996, which is the base from
                which I start, included provision for £700,000 in additional
                funding for community services. However, I have found it
                extremely difficult to identify where that £700,000 additional
                funding was spent on community services.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Health Minister at that time also gave a
                commitment that</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;the board will continue discussions
                with the interested parties on potential for a new integrated
                primary health care centre in Kilkeel and will invite interested
                parties to develop and submit proposals for the provision of
                nursing and specialised services for the elderly and the
                mentally infirm&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister, in the same letter, also stated
                that the trust</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;can now proceed with the implementation
                of the package of services for the area without further
                delay&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That was five years ago.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Southern Health and Social Services Board
                continues to have discussions with the trust and the trust with
                the GPs and with the Department, yet we still have no sense of
                the original intent being implemented — of the integrated care
                centre.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the campaign for the provision of the
                centre, many meetings were held. There were meetings with the
                Newry and Mourne Health &amp; Social Services Trust, the
                Southern Health and Social Services Board and various Ministers
                of Health and Social Services. In fact, I cannot but reflect on
                the number of meetings, letters, and delegations with various
                Ministers — Richard Needham, Jeremy Hanley, the late Baroness
                Denton, Malcolm Moss, Tony Worthington, John McFall and George
                Howarth. They are all possessors of part of this history without
                any real delivery. I am hoping that that is the end of the
                Ministers who will not deliver on this issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During that whole campaign the minimum
                requirement was that which was agreed by the Department, the
                board, the trust, Newry and Mourne District Council, the
                community representatives and the public elected
                representatives.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will rehearse the details briefly, because
                I want to compare them with the position today. The integrated
                proposal included the following: a 28-bed in-patient hospital in
                Kilkeel on a new site; access to 26 private nursing beds; the
                provision of 20 statutory nursing beds, which, presumably, were
                to be at Slieve Roe House or thereabouts; the provision of 30
                day-care places at the same venue or elsewhere; the retention of
                the casualty unit, which was to be combined with the treatment
                room in the new facility; the retention of the health centre
                with out-patient services and other services such as chiropody
                and speech therapy; and an enhanced physiotherapy unit with a
                brand new occupational therapy unit, including out-patient
                facilities. There was also a commitment to retain the ambulance
                station.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All those services, apart from the last, were
                to be provided on a newly built integrated primary care
                facility. However, five years on, I do not see any sign of that
                happening. Where is the commitment, and where is the plan that
                was submitted by the trust? I know that it has submitted an
                outline business plan, and I am now aware of its contents. I
                want to measure the contents of that plan against the
                undertakings and agreements that were made about all those
                facilities. The proposals were also formally agreed with a
                delegation from Newry and Mourne District Council that I took to
                meet the Minister in February 1997.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have wondered whether I should proceed with
                the Adjournment debate. Only last week, I convened a meeting
                with Kilkeel Community Association, Newry and Mourne Health and
                Social Services Trust and Newry and Mourne District Council to
                try to understand their positions. There have been so many
                changes to the proposals and in people’s attitudes to them
                that I wanted to pin everything down carefully. Kilkeel
                Community Association recently made a valiant attempt to provide
                a neutral venue based on the same campus as the integrated
                primary care health clinic, which, in fact, could have been one
                of the anchor tenants.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The trust, the boards and the Department of
                Health, Social Services and Public Safety are going ahead with
                the business case, which, I hope, will deliver the primary
                necessities that I listed. I also hope that a site will be made
                available to the Kilkeel Community Association to provide a
                venue for community activities on that site or adjacent to it. I
                hope that the negotiations will be successful and that the
                funding for both aspects will be taken into account.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Newry and Mourne Health and Social Services
                Trust submitted another revised outline business case to the
                Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety on 30
                March 2001. I do not expect the Minister to comment on an
                outline business case that has been so recently submitted, but
                many other business cases were submitted before that. I would
                like to know the broad content of the outline business case and
                how it compares with the benchmarks that were laid down by the
                public representatives, the communities, the boards, the trust
                and the Department in October 1996.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The outline business plan is supported fully
                by the five general practitioners in the area. There was a
                difficulty in agreeing requirements with them, as these changed
                from time to time depending on whom one was talking to. The
                business plan also has the support of Mourne councillors.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The need for an integrated primary healthcare
                facility is crucially important to people in the Mourne area.
                That is especially the case when one considers that five years
                ago that community was promised such an accessible primary
                healthcare facility.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The community is the most important aspect.
                However, there is a huge influx of visitors to the Mourne area
                — up until now anyway. A quarter of a million people walk from
                peak to peak each year, if they are active. If they are not,
                they lie on the sunny beaches in south Down absorbing the
                &quot;Costa del Sol&quot; atmosphere of Ireland. They enjoy the
                highlands, woodlands, lakes and seaside. It is important for
                those facilities to be available if we are to have credibility
                as an area that takes care of its visitors.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The population of Newry and Mourne is
                projected to increase by 12%, which is the second highest
                population increase in Northern&nbsp;Ireland. That increase is
                forecast for the years 1998 to 2013. Although there are 15 years
                in which to achieve this, it is a very high population increase
                nonetheless. Those are not my figures; they are the official
                October&nbsp;2000 statistics from the Northern Ireland
                Statistics and Research Agency. We have a very healthy
                population in the Mournes as far as creating a new generation is
                concerned. The matter of add-on facilities over and above those
                envisaged five or six years ago must also be addressed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those things can only be addressed by good
                partnership and if there is a good outcome from the negotiations
                between the trust, the board, the Department and the Minister. I
                hope that that will be done very quickly and very well. I have
                dozens of quotes from dozens of letters from dozens of Ministers
                as far back as August 1997. However, one quote from the
                management executive was that</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;significant progress could be made in
                developing what will undoubtedly be a first-class facility to
                support the local primary care services&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are at the negotiation stage once again,
                but I hope that in those negotiations the benchmarks laid down
                and agreed by all concerned some years ago will now be part of
                the outline business plan.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not know what is in the business plan. I
                hope that the Minister will tell us or make some reference to it
                today, because a decision is needed urgently. The people of the
                Mourne and Kilkeel area have, by this delay, earned priority for
                delivery of a primary healthcare facility because they have
                waited patiently for so long. It is a matter of great urgency,
                and for that reason the Minister and the Department should
                ensure that the capital funding required for the primary
                healthcare unit is made readily available. I hope that I will
                not hear that funding will be provided after a process of
                private financial inquiries. We all know that that is a dead end
                as far as hospital provision and care provision in Northern
                Ireland are concerned.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The people of Newry and Mourne have waited
                for a long time. They now have a business plan. I hope that the
                Minister will respond quickly and positively to it. I hope she
                will make the Department deliver the promises it gave to the
                people and make the money available to the trust and the board
                to enable those promises to be rapidly and fully undertaken.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have no doubt that other Members,
                particularly those from the south Down area, will support that
                concept for the people there.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Kennedy:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am grateful for the opportunity to
                participate in this important debate and warmly congratulate and
                commend Mr McGrady for bringing it to the attention of the
                Assembly. Lest anyone question my right to participate, Members
                will be aware that I am a member of Newry and Mourne District
                Council and have an interest there. I also want to make
                representations on behalf of the Ulster Unionist Party.
                Ministerial business has, unfortunately, kept my party
                Colleague, Mr Nesbitt, from the House today. Nonetheless, he is
                mindful of the health needs in his constituency of South Down
                and in the Mourne area. I take a broader view of things in the
                Newry and Mourne council district.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The historical context has already been very
                well covered by Mr McGrady. Although Mourne Hospital was not in
                ideal shape, it at least provided local services to local
                people, and there was always an expectation that it would, at
                some stage, be upgraded. Based on the pledges and promises made
                by Ministers and others in control of health at that time, the
                expectation locally was that a new hospital or centre would be
                built to give proper and adequate healthcare. It is a matter of
                great regret that those promises were never kept and that no
                such hospital materialised.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have considerable knowledge of the area.
                Newry and Mourne is strange in some ways. Once you go through
                the mountains, you go into new territory — politically,
                socially and, perhaps, in other ways too. It is largely rural,
                and it is far-flung, which is another important reason for
                having a hospital of some kind there. Considerable distances are
                involved, and the community is spread throughout small towns,
                hamlets and little villages in the coastal area. Minor roads are
                not in prime condition, although the roads of South Down are in
                a more satisfactory condition than those in my constituency of
                South Armagh. That, however, is a separate argument. In a
                far-flung rural area the important point is that hospital
                services and medical provision are essential. I certainly want
                to see such provision restored to Mourne.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGrady said that this area is a
                significant holiday destination. I am very happy to tell the
                House that only last week I used it as a resort. There was not
                much sun, but many of the great features we have come to expect
                were just as Mr McGrady said. To be able to cater for that
                increase in population at seasonal times as well as for
                accidents, emergencies and people who become unwell or need
                medical treatment is another valid reason for provision in the
                Mourne area.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.30 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to hear a clear, outlined commitment
                from the Minister that she will give sympathetic consideration
                to any request from the Newry and Mourne Trust to fund a
                hospital or medical facility in Mourne. That will right a very
                great wrong and make good promises that her predecessors from
                other Administrations gave but never brought to reality.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am happy to add my support to Mr McGrady’s
                motion.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr M Murphy:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.
                I congratulate Mr McGrady for tabling this motion. In saying
                that, it needs to go further. It needs to go right across the
                board in relation to health and social services, taking in not
                only Kilkeel, but also Newry and Mourne and south Down. I
                welcome the business plan proposed by the Kilkeel Trust to the
                Department and hope that it takes that plan on board and also
                that it provides proper capital funding to help update the
                health service right across Newry and Mourne and south Down;
                that is badly needed in that area.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Southern Health and Social Services Board
                need to fill the following posts in Daisy Hill Hospital
                immediately — a consultant surgeon to replace the one who left
                some months ago, a respiratory consultant and a new consultant
                in accident and emergency. Those posts will significantly
                strengthen the hospital’s resources. While I welcome the
                acquisition of a new CT scanner by Daisy Hill Hospital and the
                appointment of an additional consultant radiologist, there is
                also the need to strengthen cardiology with a new consultant in
                that department. I wish to see the board strengthen the hospital
                in order to provide a first-class service to the people of Newry
                and Mourne.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also want to see improved primary-care
                services. We need better cover for the whole of Newry and Mourne
                and the Down District Council area. The health board must review
                its arrangements and ensure that all GPs are properly involved
                in well-resourced out-of-hours services which provide
                first-class care to all our people. We need better community
                service, which is targeted to people’s requirements that will
                support them in their homes. We need to ensure that money is
                invested in health and personal services.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A very small percentage of our wealth is
                spent on essential services. We must aim to increase that
                investment and make sure that our public services are of a high
                quality. The Executive need to support the Minister of Health,
                Social Services and Public Safety and make sure that she has
                sufficient resources to invest so that she and her Department
                can start to tackle the causes of ill health.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The opportunity for the development of an
                all-Ireland service must not be overlooked. Such a policy would
                provide something from which all could benefit, especially in
                Newry and Mourne where we are so close to the border. We have
                already seen the benefits of cross-border renal services.
                Similar benefits could be reaped right across the whole range of
                acute and primary care services. However, that would require
                proper integrated planning and a determination to cut through
                red tape and bureaucracy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to see a new, properly equipped
                hospital in Downpatrick. Money must be found to provide that
                service, which is so desperately needed by people who are gutted
                about what has happened to their hospital. I am asking for a
                firm date on which the shape of those services will be made
                public, and a date on which money to build these services will
                be made available.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to highlight something that I feel
                very strongly about — the plight of the disabled in south Down
                and Newry and Mourne. A heavy burden of red tape is placed on
                their shoulders by inadequate procedures for applying for
                services to which they are entitled. The changes set up in
                November 2000 by the Housing Executive and the housing
                associations resulted in a unified housing selection scheme. The
                scheme awards points for housing. Social well-being assessments
                should have brought about important changes to disabled people
                and made their needs a priority.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This area is determined by the health and
                social services boards, but is it working effectively? In my
                opinion it is not. The scheme is too complex and needs
                continuous monitoring. The Northern Ireland Housing Executive’s

                health and social service boards, and I asked if it is working
                effectively. It is not. The scheme is too complex and needs
                continual monitoring. The Northern Ireland Housing Executive’s
                renovation grant scheme recognises the needs of disabled people.
                It funds the adaptation of properties and offers a design
                service, grants, finance and advice to elderly and disabled
                people.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Article 52 of the Housing (Northern Ireland)
                Order 1992 on the approval of applications for certain
                facilities for the disabled is the most important provision. It
                provides assistance to people in four areas, namely, enabling
                access to and around the home; facilitating the preparation of
                food and cooking by a disabled occupant; improving the heating
                system or providing a suitable one; and making it easier for a
                person to use sources of heat, light and power in the house.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The grant is mandatory. The procedure laid
                down in the 1992 Order begins when the Northern Ireland Housing
                Executive (NIHE) receives an enquiry from a disabled person. Red
                tape then comes into operation. Two NIHE officers deal with
                grants. The welfare officer responds to public sector enquiries,
                and the grants manager deals with private-sector applicants. The
                NIHE will then ask the local health trust’s occupational
                therapy department to carry out an assessment of a disabled
                person’s needs for adaptation.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker. I
                am becoming increasingly concerned about the drift of the Member’s
                contribution. Are we saying that we can raise any subject
                whatsoever under health and social services, provided that it
                affects somebody in the Mourne area? Are we specifically dealing
                with primary healthcare provision in the Mourne area? If we set
                that precedent this afternoon, can I do any amount of
                pontificating on any issue provided that it affects someone
                relevant to that debate?</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order. The debate is not specifically on
                primary healthcare. This is in order.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat. The assessment by the
                occupational therapist determines the length of time that a
                disabled person will have to wait to have work carried out. The
                recommendations will also determine whether adaptations are
                necessary. If the decision is not favourable, the disabled
                person must seek an independent assessor to review his or her
                case.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, occupational therapists are charged
                under section 2(e) of the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons
                Act 1970 to have regard to the provision of assistance for that
                person in arranging adaptation work in the home, or the
                provision of any additional facilities designed to secure the
                person’s greater safety, comfort or convenience — <i>[Interruption]</i>.</p>

                am sorry to interrupt my Colleague. My explicit purpose in this
                debate was to ensure that a primary healthcare facility, a care
                centre in Kilkeel that was promised in 1996, was built. That is
                the subject of the debate. While the Member’s comments would
                be legitimate in other debates, they are taking away from what I
                hoped would have been the focus — a ministerial reply on

                of medical and health facilities. That being the title of the
                Adjournment debate, it must be allowed to cover all areas that
                are considered to be medical and health facilities. You have
                specifically made the point concerning your reference in your

                a general social services problem that is experienced throughout

                obligation for the safety of the disabled in their homes on the
                health authority in the area. After those procedures are carried
                out, the Northern Ireland Housing Executive receives positive
                recommendations from the occupational therapists. The grant
                inspector visits the dwelling to determine its fitness. The
                process for a means test begins when the dwelling is passed as
                fit for grant aid. However, before that is done, the Housing
                Executive needs proof of legal ownership of the dwelling. Once

                process involving the Northern Ireland Housing Executive and the
                Health Service to get these grants. Therefore the point that I
                am making is part and parcel of the proceedings.</p>

                There have been too many points of order, and I want the Member
                to continue as briefly as possible. I accept that it is
                perfectly appropriate for you to talk about health facilities,
                but the area of grants and housing is beyond the remit of the

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly must provide adequate funding
                for all elements of the system. We must meet the needs of those
                disabled people who wish to remain in their homes. Disabled
                people are not asking for special deals; they are demanding the
                right to equality and the quality of life to which they are
                entitled — and that the Assembly is required to provide —
                under the Good Friday Agreement. We have the means to streamline
                the bureaucracy into a straightforward working format. We must

                that, Madam Deputy Speaker, you are in the Chair. I will be able
                to add some extraneous subjects that no doubt I would not
                normally be allowed to do. However, the subject, I believe, is
                writ narrow.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker.
                The point is not what Mr Wells believes; it is what the person
                under the health system is entitled to.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Wells:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Adjournment motion is a very useful
                exercise. It allows Members to come to the House and to raise
                specific matters and issues of local concern in the presence of
                the Minister. The subject of the debate this afternoon is the
                stuff that Adjournment motions are made of. To some extent it
                devalues the whole process if Members wander down &quot;by-path
                meadow&quot;. Therefore, I shall come directly to the subject of
                healthcare provision in the Mourne area, which is very much
                related to the lack of a proper integrated primary care facility
                in Kilkeel.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Kilkeel is an area that I have the privilege
                to represent. It is a wonderful place in many ways. Someone once
                said to me that Kilkeel men were not born, they were quarried.
                To some extent that explains their nature – they are rugged
                individuals who have made a living from fishing, quarrying and
                agriculture. Kilkeel is a unique community that has prospered
                over many years in a peripheral part of Northern Ireland. It has
                done very well for itself. It is a very proud community, but it
                is also very isolated. To get to Daisy Hill hospital, one must
                travel 20&nbsp;miles along a road that is very inadequate in
                parts and that passes through Newry town, where there can be a
                bit of a bottleneck. If one considers that, one realises how
                difficult it is for people of the Mourne area to obtain primary
                healthcare.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If one travels in the other direction the
                nearest hospital is Downe Hospital, which, of course, has been
                very much under threat in recent years. Indeed with the closure
                of the Mourne Hospital and the potential loss of Downe Hospital,
                one was almost faced with a situation where one could draw a
                line from Newry to Dundonald and not one primary-care hospital
                would have been available to anyone living south of that line.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The people of the Mourne community feel very
                aggrieved by the decision to close their own hospital. It was
                closed in the face of promises that there would be a new unit
                provided. Mr McGrady said that those promises were not kept.
                That is why many people involved in the Downe Hospital campaign
                take a very jaundiced view of some of the promises that are
                being made to them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If a fundamental mistake has been made – if
                you could call it that – it was the fact that Mourne Hospital
                was allowed to close before anything was arranged to replace it.
                In other words, the community groups should have said: &quot;We
                will allow this hospital to close only when you have the
                alternative up and running.&quot;</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Southern Health and Social Services Board
                is an organisation with which I have frequent contact. They are
                under enormous financial pressures. I regularly have meetings
                with Eric Bowyer and his team, and at times, I worry where the
                board is going to get sufficient resources to continue to
                provide primary health care and social services in south Down
                and south Armagh and the Newry and Mourne area. They constantly
                have problems with resourcing, and the only way that there will
                be any movement towards replacing the service that was lost in
                Kilkeel is if the Department provides capital funding. There is
                absolutely no way that the board can find the money in its own
                resources to replace the unit that has been lost. I hope that
                the Minister will not take the opportunity this afternoon to
                trot out those horrible letters, PFI — private finance
                initiative. We have already seen that the private finance
                initiative does not work for primary healthcare in Northern
                Ireland. If this facility is going to be provided it has to be
                provided from departmental funds.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We cannot have the whole process delayed
                simply because we have to go through the sham of the private
                finance initiative. That is an expensive exercise that drains
                away much needed resources from the Health Service and proves
                what is obvious — it cannot be done. If it cannot be done on
                the scale of Downe Hospital, it certainly cannot be done in
                Mourne, which has a growing, vibrant and expanding community.
                Many new houses are being built in Kilkeel, but it is certain
                that there will never be the economies of scale to enable a PFI
                scheme to work there.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rural hospitals are being considered under
                the Hayes review, but no matter what is decided, Kilkeel will
                remain out on a limb, too far away from the main sources of
                primary healthcare. Kilkeel was the part of south Down that was
                worst affected by the recent bad snowstorms. The whole area was
                entirely cut off for several days. It was not possible to drive,
                for instance, from Kilkeel to Newcastle; it was difficult to get
                past Killowen. That shows the isolated nature of the area and
                the need for adequate healthcare there.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We also have an influx of tourists, as Mr
                Kennedy mentioned. It does not look as though we are going to
                have a normal summer this year, but in a normal year Kilkeel can
                be a hub of activity, with tourists making their way to and from
                the Mournes. We also have the fishing industry, where serious
                injuries can readily occur because of its inherent dangers.
                There has been a proposal to remove the helicopter rescue
                service.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The people of Mourne rightly see themselves
                as being at the end of the queue when it comes to the provision
                of services. The promise to deliver a new integrated primary
                healthcare facility in Kilkeel has to be kept. The present
                buildings are well past their sell-by date; a new site has to be
                selected. If devolution is to mean anything in the Province it
                has to be accountable to local communities such as Kilkeel. It
                is absolutely essential that the Assembly honours the promises,
                even if they were made by previous Administrations that perhaps
                did not have the same political outlook as ourselves. Kilkeel
                deserves nothing less.</p>

                However, what I wish to say can be said in a few minutes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I compliment Eddie McGrady, who has been the
                Member of Parliament for South Down for some time. He has fought
                a long and difficult campaign to try to restore the necessary
                health services to the Mourne area. As he outlined in his
                presentation, that has been a remorseless dogfight. I hope and
                add to his wish that our present Minister will not be yet

                integrated healthcare service. As Mr Wells has already outlined,
                the community is a unique and isolated one, with major fishing,
                agriculture and tourism industries. All three provide
                opportunities for risks to health. We are not talking about
                acute services. We are talking about ordinary services to
                provide for the greater proportion of accidents. The need to
                have that in the Mourne area is very clear.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The area also has a poor road infrastructure.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.00 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to re-emphasise that, because Mr
                Kennedy must have had a glaze in his eyes when he was enjoying
                our tourist facilities. He must not have looked down at what he
                was travelling over. It is in a very poor state. All we need is
                a bit of inclement weather and many of the roads are difficult
                to pass. Accessibility is a serious problem.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also represent the Members from South Down
                — they asked me to, and I have continued to do so — on the
                Donard Commissioning Group, which is a very successful
                commissioning group in the area. It covers the northern end of
                Mourne — the Annalong area. That has clearly indicated to me
                the need for support services in the Mourne area. Current and
                valued evidence is available as a result of focus groups
                studying local problems of healthcare and providing accurate and
                up-to-date information. That is available for examination if
                there is any doubt about identifying the need factor. I do not
                believe that there is — identifying need is not the problem.
                Making the financial commitment is the difficulty. I want to
                ensure that this is the last Minister who will have to deal with
                this problem and that she will leave us with a successful
                outcome.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Bradley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I too pay tribute to Mr Eddie McGrady for
                bringing this Adjournment debate to the Chamber this evening.
                The great thing about the debate — although the Chamber is not
                packed — is that we are talking about all sections of the
                community. It goes right across all divides — from fishermen
                to farmers, and across differing religious and political
                beliefs. Everyone in the Mournes will be fully supportive of the
                comments made by the various Members so far.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are speaking about let-down. In common
                with Mr Kennedy, I am a member of Newry and Mourne District
                Council. In 1996, we took the promises that were made to us as
                being sincere. Prior to that we had a very intensive campaign,
                led by the Mourne councillors. It was supported by Mr McGrady
                and probably every other recognised Kilkeel-based group in the
                Mournes. They drove it along for the provision, but it did not
                come. We took the promises made in 1996 at face value. We
                thought that they were sincere. While I cannot say we were
                bought off because we got nothing, we believed that what was on
                offer would eventually happen.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Danny Kennedy, Eddie McGrady and then Jim
                Wells came in on a seasonal note — they were speaking about
                the summertime situation. Jim Wells touched on the winter
                problems — winter problems at sea and on the roads. This year
                in particular the place was closed off for almost seven days.
                The three roads into it were impassable. The only other place
                where that happened was in the Outer Hebrides, and I do not
                think that it was acceptable there. It is certainly unique.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister is still comparatively new to
                the job and to this case in particular. She will not fail to
                recognise from the research available to her to date that the
                Mournes urgently need a Kilkeel-based integrated medical health
                centre. Basic research will show that. The Minister will learn
                that very quickly if her homework is properly done. I again
                thank Eddie McGrady for bringing the issue forward, and I hope
                that we have advanced the cause of the people of the Mournes.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Mr McGrady for raising the important
                issue of the provision of health and social care for the people
                of the Mourne area. I fully appreciate the difficulties being
                faced by the people of the area, bearing in mind — as Members
                have stated — the distance that they have to travel to avail
                of many health and social care services and facilities. I assure
                Members that I am committed to ensuring that all of our people
                receive good quality care and treatment, regardless of where
                they live.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I know that the Southern Board and the Newry
                and Mourne Trust, which are responsible for commissioning and
                delivering services for the people of the Mourne area, have also
                clearly stated their commitment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGrady will be aware that the provision
                of health and social care in Kilkeel and the Mournes has been
                under discussion locally for a number of years. He has outlined
                many of the twists and turns in those discussions. Several
                consultation documents have been published by the Southern Board
                and by Newry and Mourne Trust, which have engaged with the local
                population. Those resulted in a number of recommendations for
                provision of services, and some of those have been put in place.
                They include an increase in the number of nursing home places in
                the Kilkeel area, the provision of a minor injuries clinic at
                Brooklands Nursing Home in Kilkeel and investment in a range of
                community services across a number of programmes of care.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the outstanding elements of the
                programme is the development of a primary healthcare centre in
                Kilkeel. Potentially, that will provide a more integrated
                service between the local GPs and Newry and Mourne Trust and
                will enhance co-operation between the various services. The
                trust has been working on a business case for the development of
                integrated care in Kilkeel for some time. That has been ongoing
                since before the Executive was established.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several factors, including changing local
                circumstances and the failure of the parties involved to reach a
                timely consensus on what was required, have also contributed to
                the lengthy delay in the trust’s bringing forward proposals
                for the Department’s consideration. In recent months the
                Department has emphasised the need for the trust and local GPs
                to reach a consensus on the way forward, which has come about
                recently. The trust’s business case for the development of a
                new primary care centre in Kilkeel involving the local GPs was
                finally received by the Department earlier this month. I can
                assure you that we take this very seriously.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The outline business case proposes to provide
                a new facility to deliver the range of services currently
                provided from the Kilkeel Health Centre and the professions
                allied to medicine (PAMS) and outpatient services now sited in
                the Mourne Hospital. Those include GPs, community nurses, health
                visitors, school nurses, speech therapy, psychotherapy,
                occupational therapy, podiatry, outpatient clinics, obstetrics,
                gynaecology, general surgery, general medicine, paediatrics,
                ophthalmology and psychiatry.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the funding for the business
                case, there are a number of cases for investment in health and
                personal social services. Newry and Mourne Trust has submitted a
                range of business cases to the Department — including this one
                — totalling £10 million. The level of resources available
                means that decisions on investment need to be based not only on
                merit, but also on priority. I cannot say today — and I am
                sure that Mr McGrady would not expect me to say today — what
                relative priority the new facility in Kilkeel will have.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The earlier versions of the business case, to
                which Mr McGrady referred, did not meet the guidelines that
                govern such investments. In addition, the proposed facility did
                not then have the support of the local GPs. That has now been
                secured. The business case now envisages an investment of
                £1·65 million. That needs to be fully tested — no more and
                no less than any other investment involving public money.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the neutral venue, Newry and
                Mourne Trust now wants to use the site for the new health
                centre. As a result, action on disposal of the site has been
                suspended until the trust’s proposals have been examined in
                detail. I am aware that, although the Kilkeel Community
                Association had hoped to acquire the site for the community
                centre, the trust is now working with Newry and Mourne District
                Council with a view to meeting the association to try to find an
                acceptable way forward for all parties. In taking the whole
                process forward, it is essential that all of the relevant
                players — Newry and Mourne Trust, the board, and the local GPs
                — work together to ensure a satisfactory outcome for the
                people of the Mourne area.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As for access, there are a number of ways in
                which that is being taken forward. Several reviews of services
                have been or are currently being undertaken through the
                capitation formula, for example, the ambulance service review
                and the acute hospitals review. There are incentive schemes for
                GPs to encourage practitioners to provide service in rural
                areas, but time does not permit me to give you the details of
                that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In answer to Mr Mick Murphy’s questions
                about the consultant posts in Daisy Hill Hospital, I can confirm
                that the necessary resources have been made available to fund
                those posts, and I also understand that the recruitment
                advertisements for all posts mentioned will appear in the local
                press this week.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Both the grant schemes and the housing
                selection schemes are matters for the Housing Executive. The
                trust is involved for consultation only on the necessity and
                appropriateness of the proposed works and on decisions as to
                referral for occupational therapy assessment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For the North overall, I have identified an
                additional 20 occupational therapists in the coming financial
                year. I have also approved implementation of the recommendations
                contained in the preliminary report of the joint Housing
                Executive and Department of Health, Social Services and Public
                Safety on the review of the housing adaptation service, which is
                designed to improve occupational therapy response times.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The primary care services are vital for the
                people of the Mourne area, and I understand that they are the
                first points of contact for most people who need help from the
                health and social services. As Members will know, we have just
                concluded a major consultation exercise about the future
                arrangements for primary care, and we are in the process of
                carrying out an analysis of responses to that. I am fully aware
                of the excellent initiatives developed by the Donard
                Commissioning Group and other primary care pilot schemes, and we
                will be encouraging the involvement of local communities and
                service users in the planning and development of services.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In conclusion, I am aware of the health and
                social care needs of the people of the Mournes, and I am keen to
                resolve the issue of providing a new primary healthcare centre
                for the people in Kilkeel. I can assure Members that the
                business case for the health centre will be taken forward as
                quickly as possible.</p>
