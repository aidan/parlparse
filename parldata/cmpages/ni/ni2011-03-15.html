      <p class="H2DocumentStartTime">The Assembly met at 10.30 am (Mr Speaker in the  Chair).</p>
      <p class="H2DocumentStartTime">Members observed two minutes&rsquo; silence.</p>
    <p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="1"></a>Matters of the Day</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Lance Corporal Stephen McKee</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Mr Stephen Moutray has sought leave to make a statement on the death of a  soldier who was killed in Afghanistan,  which fulfils the criteria set out in Standing Order 24.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will call Mr Moutray to speak for up to three minutes on  the subject. I will then call a representative from each of the other political  parties, as agreed with the Whips. Those Members will also have up to three  minutes in which to speak on the matter. Members will know that there will be  no opportunity for interventions, questions or a vote on the matter. I will not  take any points of order until the item of business is concluded. If that is  clear, we shall proceed.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Moutray</strong>:  Once again, Northern Ireland  has lost a brave young soldier to the conflict in Afghanistan. Lance Corporal Stephen  McKee from Banbridge laid down his life for the people of Afghanistan and  in defence of our safety and the maintenance of our liberties and way of life.  Whatever one&rsquo;s view of that conflict, there is no doubting the dedication and  valour of those who, on a daily basis, place their life in jeopardy to, on our  behalf, build a better future for the Afghan people.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Brave young people from all parts of Northern Ireland  have served or are serving today in that theatre of conflict. From across the Province,  families have shared in the loss of loved ones. Tears have flowed from beyond  our land border. From Macosquin all the way to Mayo in the Irish Republic  brave young soldiers have made the ultimate sacrifice while serving as part of  the British commitment to that troubled land.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My constituency of Upper Bann  has borne a terrible load of sorrow and loss in recent times. Last July, we had  the killing, also in Afghanistan,  of young Gurkha Lieutenant Neal Turkington from Portadown. Now another family  in our midst mourns a young life cut short and a brave young man taken away  from them. The McKee family has a distinguished legacy of service that spans  several generations. As Lieutenant Colonel Colin Weir, commanding officer of  1st Battalion of the Royal Irish Regiment, said:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;It is families like the McKees that make this  Regiment what it is; they are the fibre that runs through us and what gives us  our fighting spirit.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the Chamber today I want to give voice to the sincere  prayer of many people across the Province that, in the midst of their tears and  loss, the McKees will know that all around and underneath them are the  everlasting arms of the God of grace, the God of mercy, of compassion, of  comfort and of infinite tenderness. To Lance Corporal McKee&rsquo;s wife Carley, his  parents and his wider family circle, we extend our deepest sympathy at this sad  time.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I too add my expressions of sympathy  to Stephen McKee and his family on my own behalf as an MLA for Upper Bann and on my party&rsquo;s behalf. Another tragedy has  been visited on a family, and a young man has lost his life. Regardless of the  circumstances of the initial invasion of Afghanistan and the conflict there, we  as a society have to reflect on the continuing death toll in that country,  whether it be young men such as Stephen McKee or other young men from the area  who have lost their life.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is a duty on us to call for an end to conflict in  such areas, whether among NATO soldiers or Afghan combatants. As always in such  conflicts, it is the civilian population that suffers most. I hope that this is  the last time in the Chamber that we have to comment on the death of young men  such as Stephen McKee or reflect on the terrible carnage in Afghanistan. As  I said, I have no hesitation in adding my sympathies and those of my party to  the McKee family.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  On behalf of the Ulster Unionist Party &mdash; in particular, on behalf of my  colleagues in Upper Bann, Mr Gardiner and Mr Savage &mdash; I join others in paying tribute  to Lance Corporal Stephen McKee from the Royal Irish Regiment, who was  tragically killed in Afghanistan last week.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Stephen McKee was a dedicated and determined soldier  serving in his regiment along with his brother Michael and other members of his  extended family. I have known the McKee family personally for many years. They  have given significant service in both the military and police over many years.  Indeed, tragically, in April 1981, Stephen&rsquo;s uncle Richard, also aged 27 and  also holding the rank of lance corporal, was cruelly murdered by the IRA while  serving in the UDR. I understand that Richard&rsquo;s service and sacrifice inspired  Stephen to pursue a military career.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The McKee family has known service, sacrifice and sadness,  but, in the midst of their unimaginable grief on the loss of a dearly loved  son, they are entitled to take considerable pride in what Stephen stood for and  sought to achieve. The death of Lance Corporal Stephen McKee has yet again  brought home the sacrifices of those who serve the Crown in Afghanistan.  Stephen McKee represented the very best of the long and historic military  traditions of this part of the United    Kingdom. The tributes paid to him by his  commanding officer and comrades testify to that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is also right that we remember the Royal Irish Regiment  as it continues to serve bravely in Afghanistan. Men and women from  across the entire community in Northern Ireland  serving in the RIR and other regiments put themselves in harm&rsquo;s way to protect  the people of Afghanistan  against the forces of terror. They deserve our deepest respect, gratitude and  support. The death of Lance Corporal Stephen McKee has, I know, brought immense  grief to his wife, his parents, his family and his wider family circle. I trust  that none of us in Northern    Ireland will forget his sacrifice and their  loss.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  On my behalf and that of my party, I add our sincere sympathies and condolences  to the family of Lance Corporal Stephen McKee. I thank Mr Moutray for bringing  the issue to the Chamber this morning; it gives us all an opportunity to  express publicly our sympathies and prayers to his family and his regiment. I  am sure that his loss is felt not only by his colleagues but by the wider  family that he had opted to be part of.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As other Members said, the McKee family has a long history  of military service. One often wonders what sends young men to war. Some years  ago, I recall being horrified at the sight of women being routinely hanged in Afghanistan  from makeshift gallows. I am sure that such a sight would make many of our  young men and women go to fight to bring democracy to those who suffer such  oppression. It behoves all of us politicians to prevent wars. I hope and trust  that Governments and politicians will try to bring this cruel war in Afghanistan to  an end. Stephen McKee&rsquo;s wife and family will be in our prayers for some time to  come.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  On this very sad occasion, I join, on behalf of the Alliance Party of Northern  Ireland, with Assembly colleagues to offer our deepest sympathy to the family  and relatives of the young Royal Irish Regiment soldier, Lance Corporal Stephen  McKee, who unfortunately lost his life on the battlefields of Afghanistan.  Members who knew Stephen spoke very highly about him and his bravery and about  his colleagues. Our thoughts and prayers are with Stephen&rsquo;s family, friends and  relatives at this dreadful time.</p>
    <p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="2"></a>Assembly Business</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Justice Bill</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. I want to say something about the Justice Bill. Further to my  announcement in the House yesterday in respect of the Justice Bill, I can  advise the House that, in my view, the Justice Bill, as amended at Further  Consideration Stage, is outside the legislative competence of the Assembly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Standing Orders do not make specific provision for the  House to remedy such a defect at this stage. I therefore rule that an  exceptional Further Consideration Stage may be held with the sole purpose of  allowing the House to debate the vote on a corrective amendment prior to Final  Stage. That decision is, of course, subject to the House supporting a motion to  suspend Standing Orders 39(1) and 42(1).</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At today&rsquo;s Business Committee I will ask that a revision be  made to the Order Paper to debate a motion to suspend the relevant Standing  Orders to take an exceptional Further Consideration Stage of the Justice Bill  next Monday 21 March. If the House agrees those items of business, the Final  Stage will take place on Wednesday 23 March. I advise the House that I will not  select any amendments other than those designed to render the Bill competent. I  intend to issue a Marshalled List on Wednesday 16 March. I hope that that is  clear to all sides of the House.</p>
    <p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="3"></a>Ministerial Statements</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Road Safety Strategy</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment (Mr Poots)</strong>: I wish to make a statement to advise Members  formally of the publication of the new road safety strategy for Northern Ireland.  I further wish to provide an update on the position with regard to consultation  on proposed changes to the learner and restricted driver schemes and on  graduated driver licensing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Before I turn to my statement, I should say that four  people died on our roads yesterday and over the weekend. I must first pass on  my sympathies and, I am sure, those of the House to the families and friends of  those who died and to all those who lost loved ones on our roads over the year.  This occasion is particularly personal, Mr Speaker: on Sunday evening, my son  came home and informed me that a young man he had spent the weekend with had  been killed on his way home. It is sad and tragic when someone so young loses  their life in such circumstances. My son told me that the young lad concerned  did not have the opportunity to say &ldquo;Cheerio&rdquo; to his mother before he left for  the weekend and that, because of that, he went to Newcastle to buy her favourite sweets to take  home to her. He never got home. The loss is greatly felt by that family and all  those who were with that young man in the run-up to his tragic death.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">10.45 am</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Trying to move forward a road safety strategy in Northern Ireland  that will bring about safer roads for our people is personal for me. I recall  that, when I was a young man, I attended the funeral of a cousin who was  tragically killed on the roads at the age of 19. I will never forget that  funeral service or the grief that his parents, particularly his mother,  expressed. Therefore, it is incumbent on us all to seek to make our roads safer  and better places for everyone to travel on and to reduce the number of deaths  and serious injuries that are caused on our roads. We have done that quite  successfully. However, we should not be complacent, and we should always seek  to improve. That is why we are moving ahead with the road safety strategy two  years ahead of time. We achieved the targets that we set for 2012, but it is  good that we revisit them, drive them further downwards and reduce further the  number of deaths and injuries on our roads.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The House will know that, although the previous road safety  strategy was designed to run until 2012, it was decided to bring forward this  new strategy. Much has been done since I announced formal consultation on a  draft strategy around this time last year. At that time, I published proposals  for consultation, including over 170 potential measures that led to wide  discussion and debate on numerous issues with stakeholders from across the  country. The significant and positive response to the consultation exercise was  encouraging, and it underlined the continuing importance of road safety to so  many people in Northern    Ireland. In all, over 2,000 responses were  received, and Members will, no doubt, be interested to know that more than 800  of those responses came from children and young people.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Respondents believed that the road safety priorities  identified in the consultation paper were right and appropriate, and they were  broadly content with the substance of the proposals presented. There was broad  agreement with the vision, and there was support for the proposed casualty reduction  targets for fatalities and serious injuries. However, even with such broad  agreement, the debate throughout the consultation led to the consideration of  more than 300 refinements and proposals. The result of that is that I now  present a document that contains 199 measures and was produced with the broad  support of our community in Northern    Ireland. I want to record my thanks to  everyone who took the time to meet us or to reply to the consultation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">All views and comments were considered carefully as part of  the development of the road safety strategy that is being launched today.  Throughout the consultation, the Committee for the Environment frequently  engaged with stakeholders, and it gave detailed consideration to the evolving  strategy during its period of development and the related consultation. That  culminated towards the end of last year with the Committee&rsquo;s scrutiny of the  final draft strategy, and I thank the Committee for its support. I believe that  it conducted a very important piece of work that has contributed greatly to the  process and the quality of the final document. I presented the final draft to  the Executive, and ministerial colleagues agreed its contents, including  commitments made by several Ministers. I extend my thanks to them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The document is presented under the title &lsquo;Driving Road  Safety Forward&rsquo;. It is our vision:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;To make a journey on Northern Ireland&rsquo;s roads as safe  for all road users as anywhere in the world.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That is neither an unrealistic nor an  overoptimistic aspiration. I simply note that, in 2008, we would have been  placed around sixth in the table of the 27 EU countries ranked by fatalities  for each million of the population. Along with many who responded to our  consultation, I believe that we must seek to improve that position.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Last year saw the lowest number of road deaths since  records began in 1931. Provisional figures show that there were 55 road deaths  in 2010, which was 60 fewer than in 2009 and equated to an unprecedented fall  of over 50%. The latest provisional figures indicate a fall of around 17% in  serious injuries. However, we must remember that 55 families grieve for loved  ones whom they lost last year, and already this year 13 families are suffering  a similar loss, including those of the four people who lost their life over the  weekend and yesterday. Many more are coping with life-changing disabilities.  That is why we must strive for the day when there are no deaths on our roads.  That is the only acceptable level.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The strategy was developed and is presented using the safe  systems approach. That considers roads, vehicles and road users together and  seeks to ensure that each of those three elements takes account of the  limitations or potential weaknesses of the other two. The key road safety  challenges to be addressed over the lifetime of the new strategy include  continuing to reduce road deaths and serious injuries; improving safety on  rural roads; protecting younger drivers and motorcyclists; reducing  inappropriate and illegal road user behaviours including speeding, drink- and  drug-driving, and careless and dangerous driving; improving our knowledge and  broadening involvement in solving road safety problems; and working within  funding constraints and future uncertainties.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">What will probably be of most interest to Members and the  public are the strategy&rsquo;s casualty reduction targets. The targets, for  achievement by 2020, are to reduce the number of people killed in road  collisions by at least 60%; to reduce the number of people seriously injured in  road collisions by at least 45%; to reduce the number of children killed or  seriously injured in road collisions by at least 55%; and to reduce the number  of young people killed or seriously injured in road collisions by at least 55%.  The fatality target has been amended since the consultation from 40% to a more  challenging 60%. I took that decision to reflect the significant achievements  in fatality reductions. Those new targets are more challenging in two ways.  First, obviously, the actual percentage reductions proposed are higher than in  the past. Secondly, we are starting from much reduced baselines.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The 199 measures to be delivered over the 10-year lifespan  of the strategy were developed and agreed in partnership with other statutory  road safety bodies, including the Department for Regional Development, the  Department of Education, the Police Service, the Fire and Rescue Service and  the Ambulance Service. I thank the representatives of those organisations who  worked on the strategy project board and ministerial colleagues for their  unanimous support for and interest in the board&rsquo;s work.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The strategy includes short-, medium- and long-term  timescales for the implementation of each measure. The timescales form the  basis of implementation plans to support oversight, monitoring and reporting of  the delivery of the strategy. It is, of course, important not to lose sight of  the significant role that non-statutory partners will have in delivering road  safety, and we will encourage wider involvement in future planning, advising  and delivering of road safety. That will include local authorities and the  private and community and voluntary sectors. It will also include the wider  public, who are ultimately affected by the decisions and actions that we take.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Statutory partnerships and engagement with stakeholders  will continue to be crucial to the success of many measures as they are rolled  out in the months and years to come. I trust that the commitment from all  Ministers, Members and many other interested parties will continue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Like all Members, I am only too aware of the financial  position in which we find ourselves. The current and future economic conditions  within which the strategy will be implemented are clearly uncertain. This is a  10-year strategy that is flexible and can embrace new ideas and measures that  are desirable or, indeed, necessary, given the times that we are in. It will be  essential to examine and report on such issues every year to ensure that we  continue to move in the right direction.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Today may be the formal launch of the new strategy, but  much has already been done to move ahead with initiatives that will make a real  difference. There can be no one in the House who is not aware of and does not  share my concern about the unacceptably high number of young and new drivers  involved in fatal and serious collisions on our roads each year. That is why we  have a target in the new strategy to reduce by at least 55% the number of young  people killed or seriously injured on our roads. This will be the only part of  these islands to have such a target.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is clear that, if we are to achieve that target, we must  improve how we train and test drivers to ensure that they are competent and  safe. Currently, only the ability to control a vehicle and perform a range of  basic manoeuvres is tested. That training and testing regime is not fit for  purpose. We also need to improve how we allow new drivers who have just passed  their test to gain experience in as safe a manner as possible. I do not accept  that it is too complex or difficult to fix the problem and there is nothing  that we can do. I simply will not accept our young people being allowed to  continue to die and be seriously injured at today&rsquo;s rates, nor will I accept  that they should be allowed to kill and seriously injure other road users.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Make no mistake: young people are particularly vulnerable  on our roads. In Northern    Ireland, between 2004 and 2008, 17- to  24-year-old drivers were responsible for one in four road fatalities and one in  five serious road injuries, which amounted to 163 deaths and 1,237 serious  injuries. Young drivers were responsible for 41% of road deaths and 34% of  serious injuries caused by car drivers over that period. That is why I tasked  my officials with researching and developing a detailed paper on how we might  change that and improve the safety of new drivers. I announce the launch of  that paper and the start of consultation on amending the 45 mph speed  restriction on learner and restricted drivers and on options for a system of  graduated driver licensing (GDL) to build on the current R-driver scheme.  Evidence from countries that use such systems supports the view that allowing  new drivers to gain crucial experience in low-risk conditions can dramatically  reduce the likelihood of them being involved in a collision.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A GDL scheme might include raising or lowering the age for  a provisional or full licence; setting minimum learning periods; requiring  learners to take a minimum number of driving lessons or complete a minimum  number of miles or hours of supervised practice; allowing learner drivers to  drive on motorways; applying post-test restrictions on passengers; introducing  restrictions on night-time driving; increasing the duration of the current  12-month restricted period; and introducing an offence-free period. At its  simplest level, it will be about teaching appropriately, testing rigorously  and, while drivers gain experience, reducing risk.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The consultation paper will be available for all  stakeholders to consider, and I hope that everyone, having taken the time to  consider the issues and the measures that we might take, will provide us with  their views. I urge Members to get involved and to encourage their constituents  to do the same &mdash; everyone has an interest in the issue. I look forward to  meaningful debate. For now, I simply ask that no one jumps to conclusions about  decisions already made or restrictions already planned. I also ask that people  do not decide that some ideas are unworkable or unacceptable and should not  even be up for debate. Rather, they should study the significant scientific  evidence for the measures cited in the paper, read about the practicalities and  consider whether they have the support of communities where they dramatically  reduce road deaths among young people. People should read the paper, and, if  they do not like the ideas, they should tell us their suggestions. It would be  truly unacceptable for us to do nothing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Today, I have published the new road safety strategy. We  have identified the problems and issues and the measures to address them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have set targets and gained commitment, but let us be  clear: this is not the end. It is one step in a journey to make our roads safe.  With the announcement today of the next step, I encourage you to move forward  with us. Our new strategy will improve the safety of everyone who uses our  roads: pedestrians; cyclists; riders; drivers; children; new drivers; and  people with many years of experience.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank all of you for your continued interest in road  safety and for the support that my Department receives in that area from this  House.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">11.00 am</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for the Environment (Mr Boylan)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a  Cheann Comhairle. On behalf of Sinn F&eacute;in, I offer my condolences to the  families who were tragically bereaved in the road traffic accidents at the  weekend. There were people killed in my constituency, and our thoughts and  prayers are with those families at this time.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee has been kept well briefed on the Minister&rsquo;s  policy proposal for a new road safety strategy and welcomes its launch today.  One death on our roads is one death too many. We must all strive to reduce the  carnage on our roads, and I hope to see the implementation of the measures in  the strategy doing just that. As the Minister told the House, the Committee  engaged significantly in the development of the strategy and welcomes it today.  I would like to ask the Minister about his consultation on proposed changes to  the learner and restricted driver schemes. The Committee recognises the  importance of engaging with young people to hear their views on how to improve  training and how to gain experience in driving. However, it was concerned about  the impact of the changes on young people in rural areas. Can the Minister tell  us how he intends to engage with young people, particularly those who live in  remote areas?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: As the Member is well aware, we have been using  organisations, such as the GAA and the Young Farmers&rsquo; Clubs of Ulster, to drive  road safety messages out to young people. Those organisations are in regular  contact with young people in rural areas. We intend to continue to use  organisations that have assisted us in recent years to get the messages to  young people and to hear what they have to say.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Already, 800 young people have contributed to the road  safety strategy. However, let me make it absolutely clear: this is not about  targeting young people. Young people are entitled to be on our roads, and they  are entitled to drive on our roads. It is a great liberty and a great  opportunity for them. We simply want to make the roads safer, and we want to  ensure that everyone who travels on our roads can do so in a safer way. We will  be very happy to listen to young people.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I do not believe that some of the proposals will come into  place after the consultation exercise. Some of the proposals are very radical,  but let us get them out there, let us debate them, and let us identify the best  way forward. We are not simply consulting for the sake of consulting. We are  consulting so that we can listen to the responses, take them on board and move  forward in a united way and in the best way for the people who use our roads.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: The  Assembly can be proud of its efforts and achievements on the issue of road  safety over the past four years, although the fatalities on our roads in recent  days are a reminder to all of us that we cannot be complacent about the issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the fact that the graduated driver licensing  (GDL) scheme will go out to public consultation. I proposed the scheme in the  House a number of years ago. The Minister will know that the graduated driver  licensing scheme is a concept, and it would allow us to pick and choose which  elements are relevant to Northern Ireland, after we deem which bits are  practical, desirable, and, importantly, enforceable, after the consultation  process. Will the Minister tell the House what evidence exists from elsewhere  in the world of the impact that GDL has had on reducing the number of serious  collisions and fatalities on the roads, particularly for novice drivers?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: We have taken significant evidence from many other parts  of the world, including the United States of   America, New    Zealand and various other jurisdictions, and  it has been identified that GDL makes a real and significant difference. For  example, in many states of America,  young people are not allowed to carry other passengers in the early days.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We know that driving behaviour changes when there is a  large number of people in a car, and there is evidence to support that. The  conclusion that we reach will have to be appropriate and balanced against the  needs of people; that is why we need to have this discussion and why people  need to be consulted. Therefore, we are going ahead with the consultation to  enable us to garner fully the information available about the needs of the  people of Northern Ireland.  Nevertheless, there is evidence from other jurisdictions that the behaviour  proposed in the GDL can make a significant difference to driving behaviour.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kinahan</strong>:  I welcome the statement, particularly the target of making our roads safer.  However, as always, I point out that many young people are among the best  drivers, and I know that the Minister does not intend to attack them. I  congratulate the Young Farmers&rsquo; Clubs and the GAA for their involvement in  promoting safe driving. Will the Minister keep in mind the poor public  transport in rural areas and that if he restricts night-time driving, the number  of passengers and other matters, he will make it harder for young people to get  into the towns and cities for work or leisure? Will he ensure that the  Department for Regional Development is included so that we look at improving  the transport system in our rural areas?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: The hours that we are talking about for night-time driving  are the small hours of the morning, as opposed to night-time driving; therefore  night-time driving is probably not the appropriate wording. I suspect that the  Department of Regional Development (DRD) will not be running bus trips to rural  areas at 2.00 am or 3.00 am. Unfortunately, that is when many single drivers  are killed on country roads.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Seventy-two per cent of roads deaths happen on rural roads;  that is where the major problem lies. Much of this is about educating people,  which is why the Department of the Environment (DOE) has been working so hard  to get effective, hard-hitting messages across. That is why there has been a  substantial fall in the number of deaths on our roads, from 170 10 years ago to  55 last year. We need to keep working to get that message across. DRD has a  role to play in making our roads safer, such as dealing with dangerous bends,  corners and junctions. Roads can be made safer. For example, extending the M1  from Dungannon to Ballygawley, the Newry bypass, and other roads where  accidents happened regularly, will transform the number of road deaths. DRD  also has responsibility for public transport provision, so we will continue to  work with it on those issues.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>:  As a former teacher of road safety studies for many years, I welcome the  document and endorse it entirely line by line. I am conscious that one of those  who lost their lives in the past 24 hours came from my constituency, and my  sympathy goes to their family. Families lost more loved ones through road  traffic accidents over the years than through the Troubles. What message has  the Minister for those families to reassure them that their loved ones did not  die in vain? Will he assure us that any future cuts will not skimp on road  safety initiatives?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: The message to those families today is that it is the  number one priority of our Department to ensure that other families do not find  themselves in the same circumstances. That is why we have concentrated on the  issue and why we will continue to concentrate on it beyond the lifetime of the  current Assembly into the future Assembly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I cannot guarantee that the finance to deal with the issue  will always be on an upward trend. However, I guarantee that we will employ  every device possible to ensure that we get best value for money in putting our  messages across.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At this point, we are getting considerably better value for  money from advertising than previously. Members know how extensively young  people in particular, and people in general, use Facebook and a lot of other  new technologies to convey their messages. Therefore, we will use whatever new  technologies we can to get our messages across. Even if our funding is not as  good as we would like it to be, we will still maximise its use to ensure that  we get the maximum from it.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lyttle</strong>:  On behalf of my party, I extend my condolences to all families bereaved due to  accidents and collisions on the roads. I wholeheartedly welcome today&rsquo;s  statement and the announcement of the new road safety strategy, not least given  the unacceptable number of deaths among young people on our roads. I also  welcome the challenging targets that the Minister has set to address that.  Given the recent debate generated by the private Member&rsquo;s Bill on cycling  helmets, has the Minister considered including enhanced cycle training in the  new road safety strategy, to provide practical learning on the roads similar to  that provided by the Bikeability scheme and enhanced driver training to promote  motorist awareness of cyclists?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I had a number of discussions with Sustrans on that issue.  On a personal level, I see the benefits of better preparing young people for  cycling on the roads. The Assembly pays a lot of attention to people using  transport other than private cars to travel to and from work and school. If  that attention is to be more than lip service, then we must ensure that the  conditions are conducive to people travelling safely. To encourage people to  cycle, we need to ensure that they can do so safely; and in some respects,  changing the system of testing is one method of doing that. I do not believe  that the current system of testing deals adequately with the ability of new  drivers to overtake other cyclists, those in slow-moving vehicles or on horses,  or, indeed, pedestrians. So, that is one of the areas that we need to look at.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Sustrans wants the cycling proficiency scheme to be run  alongside a further scheme in which young people can practise on the roads.  That is a challenge, and we need the support of the DRD, education bodies and  the schools to meet it. However, I think that that is well worth delivering,  because it will provide young people with confidence to ride their bikes to and  from school and, indeed, to work when they get older. It will also reduce the  number of vehicles and casualties on our roads, which the Assembly desires.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We need to get the message across, because people perceive  cycling as being dangerous. Cycling, of itself, is not dangerous, nor should it  be. Cyclists and drivers need to be prepared properly and show the proper  respect and courtesy to each other so that both can travel to their  destinations safely.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his statement. As has been indicated, the scale of the  reduction in road deaths has been a success story. However, I join other  Members in pointing out that we cannot rest on our laurels given the tragic  events of the past few days. The Minister indicated how important it is to get  the detail and implementation of the consultation right on the graduated  driving licensing, in particular, which is very much welcomed. What is the  timescale of the consultation, and, depending on the result, how long will the  implementation period be?</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">11.15 am</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: The GDL scheme will go out to consultation. Normally,  consultations run for 12 weeks, and sometimes that period can be extended,  depending on the number of responses coming in. It will be a matter for whoever  holds this position to give adequate consideration to over the summer and come  back to the Assembly in the autumn with proposals on the way forward. I trust  that we will have someone in position who will come forward with proposals that  can make real change and better prepare our young people for the pleasure that  is driving and the responsibility that comes with it.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr W Clarke</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I welcome the statement and thank the  Minister for launching the consultation. Will he outline what co-operation  there has been between the Department and insurance providers on giving  incentives to young people to improve their driving behaviour?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I am somewhat disappointed with insurance providers. This  year, we are seeing insurance premiums go up, when the reason for raising them  does not exist for drivers across the board, and for young drivers in  particular. Last year, the number of people killed on our roads was halved and  there were 25% fewer serious injuries and road collisions. Therefore, I think  that the insurance companies are ripping people off by driving up premiums when  we are making such improvements in road safety. I lay down a challenge to  insurance companies that, when we are making significant steps in improving the  collision record in Northern    Ireland, they should be responding by  reducing premiums. That would be an incentive and an encouragement to people to  continue to drive in a safer way.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Spratt</strong>: I  welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement. In any road safety strategy, enforcement of  road traffic legislation is probably one of the most important elements. Given  the perception in the Police Service that its roads policing department has  become nothing more than a glorified motorway unit, will the Minister, in  future discussions with the Chief Constable, impress on him that there should  be no further dilution of roads traffic policing so as to ensure the proper  enforcement of road traffic legislation across the Province?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I thank the Member for his comments. Last year, I engaged  in a long discussion with senior police colleagues on that very issue. As I  said, 72% of deaths happen on rural roads. Therefore, pulling people in on the  motorway and fining them because their number plate happens to have letters  that are slightly smaller than they should be is, to me, not the best use of  police time. Engaging in what could be described as turkey shoots, where speed  limits exist in locations at which there are very few accidents and no history  of road collisions taking place, is not a good use of police time. Police time  would be better spent on roads where serious injuries and deaths occur  regularly. I made that very clear to the head of the road traffic division. As  a result, the number of rural roadside checks has been increased and the  division is moving away from motorways and those other roads. I urge that that  continue to be the case.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">This is not about putting points on people&rsquo;s licences but  about saving people&rsquo;s lives. There must be an absolute focus from the PSNI on  how it can assist us in saving people&rsquo;s lives. I believe that the PSNI is  making a significant contribution to saving people&rsquo;s lives. In all this, we all  have work to do to do it better, and that includes the PSNI. However, I respect  what it has done thus far.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Savage</strong>: I  also welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement. It is good news for all who use our  roads. The new road safety strategy is very welcome. If it can do anything to  cut out the kind of tragedies that we have had over the past number of weeks,  it will be a big bonus. The Minister has practically answered my question  already, but who will have sole responsibility for policing the new strategy?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: Responsibility for policing our roads rests with the PSNI,  and it is exclusive to the PSNI. Responsibility for carrying out road  engineering works rests with DRD. Responsibility for the educational aspect,  getting the messages across and developing road safety strategies and schemes  rests with the DOE. Therefore, it is a joint effort, although regulation  enforcement is very clearly a task for the PSNI.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Ramsey</strong>:  I also thank the Minister for bringing forward the road safety strategy  publication. As chairperson of the all-party group on road safety, I thank the  Minister and departmental officials for their help in highlighting and  advocating good measures during this mandate. It is important to acknowledge  the Minister&rsquo;s leadership role in reducing deaths on our roads by 50% last  year. That is good, and it is because of his commitment and determination.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There have been three pedestrian deaths in my area over the  past few days, one of whom was a close neighbour of mine. Will the Minister  consider reducing the 30 mph speed limit as part of the road safety strategy  initiative? We have clear evidence that one in five people is killed when hit  at 30 mph, but that the figure is one in 40 at 20 mph. Such a reduction in  densely populated residential areas would give much greater comfort and peace  of mind, especially to families with children.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: Speed limits are an issue for DRD, but I do not think that  the current speed limit system is the right one for road safety. For example,  as a couple of Members said, there are 14 different changes in speed limits in  the seven- or eight-mile journey from Carrickfergus to here. I would be content  to look at and address a reduction in the speed limit within the urban footprint  and, particularly, within highly pedestrianised zones. I would also be content  to raise the speed limit on our motorways. Those speed limits were set in the  1960s and were appropriate when the cars on our roads were Ford Anglias,  Hillman Imps, and so forth. Today&rsquo;s vehicles are not at all reflective of those  vehicles. On many motorways outside Northern Ireland, cars travel at  speeds considerably higher than 70 mph without causing a major risk to the  people using them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Speed limits should be set on the basis of risk assessment.  A 30 mph speed limit is not appropriate for every urban footprint, and a 70 mph  speed limit is not necessarily appropriate for our motorways. It is an issue  for DRD to look at in the new mandate, and I trust that whoever is responsible  will do so.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his statement and for launching the strategy. Research  suggests that one in five new drivers crashes in the first six months.  Therefore, I accept that more needs to be done to build on the progress that  has already been made. However, does the Minister recognise the fact that a  total night-time curfew would prevent new drivers, young and old, from taking  up new forms of employment and that such a move would be hugely risky to the  economy and people&rsquo;s search for work? I accept the fact that there is evidence  that a new driver with a car full of passengers brings increased risks. The  associated risks should be explored further.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: Yes, I agree with the Member. That is why we are having a  consultation, rather than putting forward a set of proposals to be introduced.  We will consult on those ideas to determine what is achievable. I have  absolutely no doubt that even a short night-time curfew from 1.00 am to 5.00 am  would still come with difficulties and problems. For example, there could be  problems for young people who take up employment in jobs that require them to  start very early in the morning, or those who work late into the night in the  hospitality industry may not be able to do their jobs. I am fully cognisant of  that, and that is why we have produced a consultation and discussion document  that will help us to arrive at the best suite of policies to best meet road  users&rsquo; needs, from both a road safety point of view and for the practical  necessities of daily living.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Callaghan</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. The Minister said that hard-hitting  messages had helped to reduce the numbers of fatalities and serious injuries on  our roads over the past several years. He will be aware that many of the  hard-hitting images to which he referred were the result of joint North/South  initiatives to address road safety problems. What consultation has the Minister  engaged in with the Southern Government up to now in the development of the  road safety strategy? How does he intend to move forward on the basis of  co-operation and harmonisation with the new Administration in Dublin to enhance road safety throughout the  island, especially along the border region?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: We have worked very closely with the relevant Ministers on  that issue. The departmental officials have worked closely with each other to  develop strategies and to consider what is being done on joint advertising in  other places, including the Republic   of Ireland. Without there  being any political connotation whatsoever, it is about getting the best value  for money and the best delivery from the resources that we inject into those  efforts.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is a success story in the Republic of Ireland,  in that the numbers of road deaths and serious injuries have fallen in that  jurisdiction, as well as in our own. I am very happy to continue to work with  others on those issues, whether they are in the rest of the United Kingdom or in the Republic of Ireland.  Where drink-driving is concerned, we have worked very closely with the Republic of Ireland to reduce the number of  milligrams of alcohol that would be allowed in the blood. Both jurisdictions  are bringing forward proposals to lower those limits.</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading"><a name="4"></a>Proposed Discontinuance of Stranmillis University   College and Merger with  QUB</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I have received notice from the Minister for Employment and Learning that he  wishes to make a statement.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning &nbsp;(Mr Kennedy)</strong>:  I welcome the opportunity to update the Assembly on the launch of a  consultation on the proposed discontinuance of Stranmillis University   College and its proposed  merger with Queen&rsquo;s University Belfast to create a world-class centre of  education on the Stranmillis site. Many Members will be aware of the  significant and historic links between Stranmillis University   College and the  controlled sector. It is my intention and desire that those links will be  maintained, and, in a few moments, I will set out how that can be achieved through  appropriate legislation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Members will recall the announcement that was made in April  2008 by the chairperson of the governing body of Stranmillis University   College on its proposal,  in principle, to merge with Queen&rsquo;s University. At the time, concerns were  expressed that that was a done deal. However, the previous Minister for  Employment and Learning, now Lord Empey of Shandon, gave an assurance that that  was not the case and that any such merger could take place only after the  completion of due process, including a public consultation and a full debate in  the Assembly. The Minister also stressed that he would not seek any form of  accelerated passage for the legislation that was needed to discontinue the  college.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The decision that was taken, in principle, to merge, was  not taken lightly, and it reflected the very challenging circumstances facing  the college, as well as the desire to create a world-class centre of education  at Stranmillis as part of a Russell Group university.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">To appreciate the context in which the governing body took  that decision, it is important to understand the provision of initial teacher  education (ITE) in Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">11.30 am</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are currently five providers in the sector:  Stranmillis and St Mary&rsquo;s university colleges, Queen&rsquo;s University, the  University of Ulster and the Open University. The two university colleges  differ significantly from the other three institutions in that their primary  business is teacher training. Any factors that may impact adversely on teacher  training could, therefore, not be mitigated as easily as they could in the  other three institutions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The intake of initial teacher education places at all five  institutions is set by the Department of Education each year in response to the  demand for teachers. I understand that the Department of Education has a  teacher demand model that informs its decision on numbers each year. However,  the intake numbers have been affected by the falling number of schoolchildren  overall and the declining number of schools, particularly in the primary  sector. That has inevitably led to fewer job opportunities and a need for fewer  teachers.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">To help Stranmillis and St Mary&rsquo;s to remain financially  viable as teacher training colleges, they have since 1998 been permitted to  diversify into areas of provision other than teacher education. Stranmillis  implemented a BA in early childhood studies and a BSc in health and leisure  studies, and St Mary&rsquo;s developed a BA in liberal arts. However, to ensure that  the colleges&rsquo; primary role as teacher training institutions is preserved, the  number of non-initial teacher education places at both colleges has been  regulated. Those places currently account for approximately one third of the  places at each college. That is in line with a recommendation previously made  by the Committee for Employment and Learning, and I welcome the Committee&rsquo;s  continuing interest in this important issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Stranmillis is an autonomous body, as are the other four  institutions. It is responsible for its own governance and financial affairs.  However, for academic purposes, Stranmillis is a college of the Queen&rsquo;s  University of Belfast. The conferment of university college status by Privy  Council was a direct consequence of academic integration and the unique  relationship with Queen&rsquo;s. Academic integration means that Stranmillis has, in  effect, operated as a school of the university since 1998, and that its quality  procedures are those of Queen&rsquo;s. Its students are fully registered students of  Queen&rsquo;s University. That is an important point, as the proposed merger could be  viewed as the logical extension to the already existing academic integration.  St Mary&rsquo;s University College is likewise academically integrated with Queen&rsquo;s.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The funding provided to all Northern Ireland higher education  institutions by my Department is directly related to the number of students  enrolled. The current level of funding per student at Stranmillis compares  favourably to rates paid for similar provision across the higher education  sectors in Northern Ireland and England. However, funding associated with the  declining student numbers does not generate sufficient income to permit the  college to maintain its estate in a fit-for-purpose condition.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">One of its main buildings is not currently in use due to  health and safety concerns. The college has estimated that the cost of putting  its estate into a proper, fit condition would be in the region of &pound;9 million.  The scale of the problem can only be grasped when one considers that its  recurrent annual funding from my Department is less than &pound;6 million. In the  current financial climate, it is unlikely that sufficient funding could be  provided to the college to both fund its ongoing activities and address its  infrastructure needs.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In 2007, the governing body engaged David Taylor, an  education consultant and formerly director of inspection at Ofsted, to provide  a report on the long-term strategic options for Stranmillis. It was following  consideration of the options shortlisted in the Taylor report that the  governing body took the decision in principle to merge with Queen&rsquo;s. I  understand that our other university college, St Mary&rsquo;s, is also considering  its future strategic options.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Legislation is not normally required to effect the merger  of two independent higher education institutions. However, to transfer the  property, rights and liabilities of the governing body of Stranmillis to  Queen&rsquo;s requires that the college be formally discontinued by subordinate  legislation, subject to the affirmative resolution of the Assembly. To take  matters forward, the college was required to develop a full business case to  relevant Treasury standards to support the proposal. That was submitted to my  Department and, subsequently, to the Department of Finance and Personnel for  consideration and was approved by both Departments. The college&rsquo;s governing  body has also carried out a consultation on an equality impact assessment  (EQIA) on the proposed merger. Having considered the responses that it  received, the governing body concluded that there would be no adverse impacts  on any of the section 75 categories or on good relations generally as a result  of the proposed merger. The equality impact assessment, along with the Taylor  report and the business case, is already in the public domain.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although the outcome of the equality impact assessment was  satisfactory, the Department and the governing body have been aware of the  concerns of some stakeholders around issues that relate to the ethos of the  college and the protection of its estate in any post-merger situation. My  predecessor and I have made it clear that we shared those concerns,  particularly around ethos, and would not support any merger unless the newly  merged entity can, through appropriate legislation, guarantee respect for the  ethos of the controlled sector and the college. That has been discussed in some  detail with Stranmillis, Queen&rsquo;s and the Transferor Representatives&rsquo; Council,  and legal advice has been sought. The resulting proposal is to provide for  relevant key stakeholders, including the transferors and the wider controlled  sector, to have a direct advisory role in the proposed Stranmillis school of  education at Queen&rsquo;s. That would mean the establishment of a stakeholder forum  on which interested parties will have guaranteed representation. The  stakeholder forum would have an advisory and consultative role in the  governance of the new school of education. The legislation to discontinue  Stranmillis would require that of Queen&rsquo;s.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, Queen&rsquo;s University has given an assurance that  there will be no change to the teaching of the agreed religious education  curriculum should the proposed merger take place. The programmes to ensure that  all primary teachers in the controlled sector are prepared for their statutory  duty to teach the religious education curriculum will continue post-merger. The  legislation to discontinue Stranmillis will require that of Queen&rsquo;s. Likewise,  the legislation will include safeguards to protect the Stranmillis estate in  the public interest. That will cover the use to which the estate is put and any  future disposal of all or part of it. As Members may be aware, the estate is a  designated conservation area and is subject to a wide range of planning  restrictions, which may further limit the feasibility of any disposal or change  of future use.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the business case, Queen&rsquo;s has undertaken to transfer  its school of education to the Stranmillis site to form the Stranmillis school  of education of Queen&rsquo;s University Belfast. The university has also agreed to  take over the existing maintenance backlog of &pound;9&middot;4 million on the Stranmillis  estate and to invest an additional &pound;7 million to develop the new school of  education. As a result, that significant asset will be more fully used for the  benefit of the wider educational community in Northern Ireland while  maintaining the significance of Stranmillis for the controlled sector.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Having clarified the legal position regarding the ethos and  estate issues, and subject to the outcome of a public consultation, I am fully  supportive of the proposal to merge the two institutions. The governing bodies  of Stranmillis and Queen&rsquo;s have a shared vision for the future merged entity,  which is that the Stranmillis school of education at Queen&rsquo;s will be a  world-leading centre for initial teacher education and for professional  development and research in education.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At Stranmillis this afternoon, I intend to launch the  consultation on the proposed merger, and I look forward to seeing the  Stranmillis school of education become a reality. I have always recognised the  importance of giving the Assembly and the public a say on significant issues. I  remain committed to doing that through further engagement with Members and  through the forthcoming public consultation process.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Employment and Learning (Mrs D Kelly)</strong>: I thank the  Minister for his statement. For the past three years, the Employment and  Learning Committee has been considering he proposed merger of Stranmillis  University College and Queen&rsquo;s University, including as part of its inquiry  into teacher education. Members are very much aware of the arguments for and  against the merger, and the Committee will welcome the opportunity for  stakeholders and those with an interest to have their say on this important  issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Did the Minister&rsquo;s officials make any attempt to assist  Stranmillis in the development of plans for its continued viability as an  independent university college, for example, by allowing it the flexibility to  copy the extremely successful American model of small liberal arts colleges?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I am grateful to the Committee Chairperson for her  remarks. My Department and officials have been engaged in this process for a  considerable time, during which they discussed the best options in detail with  the governing bodies of Stranmillis and Queen&rsquo;s. The option agreed and  supported by the respective governing bodies &mdash; indeed, it has their unanimous  support &mdash; is the proposed merger. We have sought to protect the ethos and other  matters related to the Stranmillis estate, but in the prevailing circumstances,  that represents the best possible option for the future of Stranmillis college  and for Queen&rsquo;s University.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his warm words of affection for Stranmillis, which will  be shared. It was a college, to which I was accepted way back in 1988, that is  known for its educational excellence, quality of teaching and quality of  learning. Many of us have a strong view on the Christian ethos of Stranmillis  college, particularly its references to our Protestant Reformed faith. Can the  Minister advise the House that there will be no change in the status of  Stranmillis college without legislation and, therefore, without the consent of  the House?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I am grateful for the question and I, also,  acknowledge the significant teaching role and preparation for teachers  performed and provided by Stranmillis college since it first opened in 1922.  Members of my family have availed themselves of that teaching quality, which  has always been excellent. The Member raised the important point of the  continuing ethos of Stranmillis college and its importance in and to the  controlled sector, particularly in delivering the RE curriculum. We are seized  of the need to protect that ethos, have sought to do so and will continue to do  so. In fact, it is only on that basis that, as Minister, I want to move  forward. Therefore, protective measures will be in place to give voice and  legal commitment to the historic position of Stranmillis in the controlled  sector and in the religious education element of teaching, which is so  important to it.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his statement, in which he said:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;concerns were expressed that that was a done deal.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The Chairperson of the Committee mentioned that we  have been dealing with this for over three years.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The statement made it clear that the Department has  supported the merger all along and that a waiting game has been played out to  ensure that we get to the point at which the Department can go ahead with it?  How will the Minister and his officials ensure that the future of the other  teaching college, St Mary&rsquo;s, will not be compromised by the proposed merger?  Will he send out a clear message that Queen&rsquo;s will not eat up St Mary&rsquo;s at the  same time?</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">11.45 am</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I am grateful to the Member for her question. I  assure her that, in my view, the original assertion that there was no done deal  remains true today. It is true that, at an early stage, both governing bodies  agreed to the merger in principle. However, significant details had to be  worked out, including the protection of the ethos and, indeed, assurances  concerning the future of the overall estate. Let me also say that I do not  believe that the merger will impact adversely on the other university college,  St Mary&rsquo;s, which is also an autonomous body.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Like Stranmillis, St Mary&rsquo;s University College is  integrated academically with Queen&rsquo;s University. The Department of Education  will continue to allocate teacher training places to St Mary&rsquo;s, and my Department  will continue to fund those places. Presently, St Mary&rsquo;s is considering its  strategic direction and examining its financial sustainability. I am not yet  aware of what path St Mary&rsquo;s will take to ensure its continued sustainability.  Initially, the decision is in the hands of its governing body. Nevertheless, I  assure the Member that, as it has done in the past on such issues, my  Department will continue to work closely with St Mary&rsquo;s.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr Robert  Coulter</strong>: I thank the Minister for his statement, and I congratulate him and  his departmental officials for their work on this protracted issue. Does he  agree that the controlled sector would benefit greatly from initial teacher  education being delivered within a Russell Group university?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I am grateful to the Member for his comments and  his question. I am very much of the view that delivering the college within  Queen&rsquo;s University, which is part of the Russell Group, will afford significant  opportunities and benefits.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Russell Group represents the 20 leading UK  universities. It is committed to retaining the very best research, outstanding  teaching and learning experiences and unrivalled links with the business and  public sectors. Therefore, having vocational teachers trained for the  controlled sector in such an institution can only benefit future generations of  schoolchildren taught by graduates of the Stranmillis school of education at  Queen&rsquo;s. Stranmillis and Queen&rsquo;s share a vision of a high-quality,  fully-integrated approach to teacher training that will benefit from  world-class research in education. I see it as a unique opportunity for  children and students who attend schools in the controlled sector in the years  to come, and it is one that we should not miss.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his statement. He is quite right to point out that we  currently have five teacher training providers. Should we not be thinking about  fundamental reform to bring the five providers together into one institution?  That is one option in the Taylor report.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I am grateful to the Member for her question. She  raises significant issues about attempting to unify all five colleges. Not  least, we see them played out in the affairs of the Department of Education and  the various sectors involved, including the controlled, maintained and  integrated sectors.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I am conscious, however, of the condition of the  Stranmillis College estate. I want progress to be made, and this is an  opportunity for Stranmillis, in conjunction with Queen&rsquo;s University, to provide  a world-class facility for teacher training that will enjoy a high reputation  and to improve its estate. The college is in the Member&rsquo;s constituency, and she  is aware of some of its failings. I am anxious that we move forward on the  issue, particularly at this time.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his statement. He identified that one of the key issues  and sensitivities in any merger is the protection of ethos. Will the Minister  provide more detail on the potential composition or structure of the proposed  stakeholder forum? He said:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The resulting proposal is to provide for relevant key  stakeholders, including the transferors&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Will he assure Members that there will be  positions, as of right, for the Transferor Representatives&rsquo; Council on the  stakeholder forum?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I am grateful to the Member for his question,  which goes to the very nerve of the protection of the ethos of the controlled  sector, which is what we seek to achieve. In my view, and this has been  accepted by Queen&rsquo;s University and Stranmillis, it will be essential that any  key stakeholder group, including the Transferor Representatives&rsquo; Council, have  a place on the forum so that that they can bring forward their views on the  range of issues affecting the college in its new format. However, that role  will itself be significant and, for the first time, enshrined in law. That is  an important consideration. The Transferor Representatives&rsquo; Council welcomes  the proposals on which we seek public consultation. It is important, therefore,  that they are given a meaningful place and role in discussions on the future. .</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Maskey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle agus a Aire.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister said that the proposal did not have an impact  on St Mary&rsquo;s. I was glad to hear him say that the Department would continue to  work closely with St Mary&rsquo;s. What was his Department&rsquo;s response to the  consultation on an 81-page report produced by the PA Consulting Group, with the  support of the Strategic Investment Board (SIB), which aims to set out a  pathway to ensure the long-term sustainability of St Mary&rsquo;s University College?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I am grateful to the Member for his question. As  he may know, I visited St Mary&rsquo;s and have had regular contact with its  principal, Professor Finn. I will seek to continue that contact. My Department  and I will work constructively and positively with St Mary&rsquo;s on any proposals  that it may have for its future. It is on that basis and in that spirit that I  want that developing relationship to continue.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Anderson</strong>:  I also thank the Minister for his statement. He is aware of the history of the  proposed merger. One could say that it has caused controversy from the start  and that it has been badly handled by the Stranmillis management. What is the  Minister&rsquo;s current assessment of staff morale at the college in light of the  proposed way forward?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I thank the Minister. Sorry, I thank the Member  for his question &mdash; I am not sure who is who today.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Over recent years, staff morale has been affected,  particularly by the conditions in which they work and the general condition of  the overall estate. Through this proposal, it is clear to me that there is an  opportunity to address that in a very significant and meaningful way.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As for the issue of staff morale, all staff, all public  representatives and anyone with an interest in the future of Stranmillis  University College and the proposed merger into Queen&rsquo;s University as a college  of teacher training will now be given the opportunity to have an input as part  of the 12-week public consultation period. I encourage people, whatever their view,  to share it with me and my Department so that we can, hopefully, address any  issues of staff morale that need to be looked at or, indeed, what is best for  the future of Stranmillis.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  I had better declare an interest as a former student at Stranmillis Training  College, as it was in those days. In fact, while I listened to the Minister, I  worked out a little sum. I went into the college in 1960, so I have 50 years of  long service there. I am looking for my medal at the end of this, Minister.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am glad that the process has moved forward. I certainly  would have liked Stranmillis to be able to stand on its own two feet, but the  situation has moved on, and the demographics and the building are against it.  It was all right when I left it; I do not know what has happened in the  intervening period. Can the Minister perhaps provide more details on the  investment package that Queen&rsquo;s is liable to put into the Stranmillis college  of education should this all proceed?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I am grateful to the Member for his question and  also for his lifelong commitment to education. It is appropriate, as we come  near to the end of this Assembly session, that we formally record the huge  contribution that Ken Robinson has made to education, not only as a  practitioner through his role as a teacher, but also through his interest and  abiding commitment to education in his public role.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The interesting and important thing about the proposal is  how it can improve significantly the present condition of Stranmillis  University College. As I have said, there is a maintenance backlog valued at  about &pound;9 million. I understand from the business case prepared by the college  that Queen&rsquo;s is willing to take over that backlog and to address the existing maintenance  issues. I also believe that Queen&rsquo;s has indicated that it plans to invest a  further &pound;7 million in the new Stranmillis school of education at Queen&rsquo;s  University after the merger has taken place. That is a significant investment  and a significant proposal that will be warmly welcomed by anyone connected  with Stranmillis, either former students or, indeed, those who served on the  staff. There is a positive future available for Stranmillis as part of Queen&rsquo;s  for a considerable time.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Ramsey</strong>:  I also welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement, within which there are clearly two  areas. The legislation will include safeguards to protect the land bank in  south Belfast, and it is clear and obvious that there are concerns about that,  particularly in conservation areas. Also, I acknowledge the assurance from  Queen&rsquo;s University that the faith-based education ethos in Stranmillis will  continue as a priority, and it important to acknowledge that from the  Minister&rsquo;s perspective as well.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, I will follow on from other Members&rsquo; comments  about St Mary&rsquo;s. We received a briefing from St Mary&rsquo;s at a recent Committee  meeting, and that college clearly wants to make itself much more sustainable as  it enters the next four years. However, there are concerns that the merger will  compromise that safety. Can the Minister outline to the House any departmental  efforts that there have been and will be to ensure that St Mary&rsquo;s will get that  comfort from the Department and will be sustainable for the future?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I am grateful to the Member for his question, and  I accept the points that he raises. I have tried to deal this morning with my  commitment to an open-door policy for St Mary&rsquo;s. I am keen to work with St  Mary&rsquo;s at all levels to bring forward any proposals that it may have and to  address any concerns that it may have.<span class="SectionMarker"><span style="font-size:14.0pt; "> </span></span></p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I do not think that there are adverse implications  for it from this announcement. I hope that it will see this as a good  opportunity for Stranmillis to further develop and enhance its facilities, notwithstanding  the desire of St Mary&rsquo;s University College to continue to produce excellence.  My officials and I are at the disposal of St Mary&rsquo;s to work together on all  those issues.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">12.00 noon</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs McGill</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his  statement. I, as other Members have done, register my concerns about the future  viability of St Mary&rsquo;s if the merger goes ahead. I was heartened to hear the  Minister say that the Department continues to work with St Mary&rsquo;s. If the  merger goes ahead, when will it be in place?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I am grateful to the Member for her question. I  hope that she has taken some comfort from my answers on my commitment and that  of my Department to working with St Mary&rsquo;s.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The consultation for the proposal is for 12 weeks, so it  will run until the middle of June. Whoever is Minister then will have  responsibility for assessing the responses. If there is agreement on and  widespread support for the proposal &mdash; I hope and expect that to be the case &mdash;  the appropriate legislation will be brought to the House. The House will have  to pass subordinate legislation having fully debated it. My view is that we  should hold with the view that was held by my predecessor, Lord Empey, and not  seek accelerated passage but bring the legislation through all the proper  procedures of the House. That way, it would be properly debated, fully assessed  and brought to its logical conclusion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Spratt</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his statement. As a former Deputy Chairperson of the  Committee for Employment and Learning, I have to say that the Minister has not  convinced me that the merger was not always a done deal between his Department  and the board of governors. Indeed, the board of governors has treated the  staff disgracefully.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister acknowledged that there are real concerns  about the open space in the Stranmillis complex. What safeguards will be put in  place in legislation to protect the Stranmillis estate in the public interest  and, indeed, to ensure that it will not become another building site in south  Belfast? That is the last thing that people need.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I am grateful to the Member for his contribution,  and I acknowledge his concern. The legislation to discontinue Stranmillis will  include safeguards to protect the Stranmillis estate in the public interest. As  he knows as a representative for South Belfast, the Stranmillis estate is  subject to a wide range of planning restrictions that may impact on the  viability of any alternative use, whether by the existing governing body or,  indeed, by Queen&rsquo;s University. In particular, he will know that the estate is  within the Stranmillis conservation area. Such a designation introduces  controls on the demolition of unlisted buildings, provides automatic protection  for trees and introduces certain additional limitations on the exercise of  permitted development rights.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Many of the buildings in the Stranmillis estate are listed  by the Northern Ireland Environment Agency as being of architectural or  historical interest, and any development proposals that affected those  buildings would be subject to the relevant Department of the Environment  Planning Service policies. Such policies may place restrictions on changes of  use, extensions, alterations or demolition, even where changes to listed  buildings are not proposed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Developments that would adversely affect the setting of a  listed building may be subject to restriction. Under the draft Belfast  metropolitan area plan, the college grounds are used as a historic park, garden  and demesne, which, again, places potential restrictions on any development.  Significantly, the estate is protected for use for educational purposes. That  is an important factor in any plans that Queen&rsquo;s University or any governing  body may have for future usage.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gardiner</strong>:  I join other Members in expressing gratitude to the Minister for his statement.  Does he agree that it is essential to acknowledge the transferors&rsquo; role in  initial teacher training in the controlled sector?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I am grateful to the Member for his question. I  very much agree that, over many years, the transferors have played and continue  to play an important role in the education of teachers for the controlled  sector. Their input and influence has helped to shape the sector and give it  its unique ethos. Therefore, it is essential that the transferors are given a  voice in new arrangements for the proposed Stranmillis school of education at Queen&rsquo;s  University. In fact, I would not be prepared to support the closure of  Stranmillis and its merger with Queen&rsquo;s University if the role of the  transferors were not to be recognised. That is why my predecessor and I have  insisted that the transferors are given a role and that they have guaranteed  representation on the proposed stakeholder forum in the new school.</p>
    <p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="5"></a>Executive Committee Business</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">High Hedges Bill: Final Stage</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment (Mr Poots)</strong>: I beg to move</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That the High Hedges Bill [NIA 15/09] do now pass.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As Members are aware, immediately after I took office, I  stated my intention to bring forward high hedges legislation as a matter of  urgency. I am delighted that the High Hedges Bill has reached Final Stage. On  26 April 2010, the Bill was introduced in the Assembly. On 16 December 2010,  the Committee agreed its draft report. I want to take the opportunity to thank  the Chairperson of the Committee for the Environment and other members for  their detailed scrutiny of the Bill. In addition, I thank Members for their  contribution to debates on the Bill throughout its passage and officials in my  Department and the Committee office for their efforts.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am certain that the Bill will help many people throughout  Northern Ireland who have suffered for so long because of problems associated  with evergreen or semi-evergreen high hedges. It will give the owners of  domestic properties a means to compel their neighbours to manage their hedges,  so that they can both reasonably enjoy the benefits of their home and garden.  It establishes a system that will be regulated by councils and will ensure that  all parties to the dispute are treated fairly. The legislation will not mean  that all hedges that are above a certain height will need to be cut down, nor will  council permission be needed to grow or retain a hedge along the boundary of a  property. Councils would intervene only in circumstances where a complaint is  made and it can be shown that other efforts to resolve the dispute have failed.  Even then, cases will be determined on their own merits.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill will make an owner of an evergreen or  semi-evergreen hedge that is over 2 m in height maintain that hedge in a  responsible and reasonable manner, taking account of their neighbours&rsquo; needs,  or face the prospect of being legally obliged to do so. I hope that the very  existence of the legislation will encourage neighbours to work together to  resolve their disputes and avoid the need to involve councils. Councils will  have discretionary power to charge a complaints fee. That should help to deter  people from making frivolous or vexatious complaints while ensuring that  account is taken of ability to pay. To ensure fairness and in line with the  polluter pays principle, when a remedial notice issued by a council takes  effect, the council will refund to the complainant any fee that was charged.  The council will then be able to recover the fee from the hedge owner.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In order to maintain this fair process, the development of  the fee transfer mechanism will be the subject of public consultation and will  be brought to the Assembly for approval. My Department is working closely with  NILGA and local councils to produce detailed guidance, provide training and  seek views on appropriate complaints fees.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although subordinate legislation must be made before the  Bill becomes operational &mdash; I trust that whoever is in this ministerial role  will do that as soon as they come into post after the May election &mdash; I am  convinced that it moves Northern Ireland a significant step closer to providing  a means to solve many high hedge disputes, and I therefore commend the High  Hedges Bill to the House.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for the Environment (Mr Boylan)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a  Cheann Comhairle. Ar son an Choiste Comhshaoil, ba mhaith liom f&aacute;ilte a chur  roimh Ch&eacute;im Deiridh den Bhille um F&aacute;lta Arda. On behalf of the Environment  Committee, I welcome the Final Stage of the High Hedges Bill. As is  traditional, on behalf of the Committee, I once again thank the departmental  officials and the Minister for the close working relationship that we  maintained throughout the passage of the Bill. That helped to ensure that the  Committee scrutinised the Bill thoroughly and was able to agree proposed  amendments with the Department. I take this opportunity also to thank once  again the Committee staff who worked on the legislation and the Bill Office.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The High Hedges Bill may have a small number of clauses,  but, as we witnessed at Further Consideration Stage, it generated plenty of  debate. The Committee&rsquo;s detailed scrutiny of the Bill led to recommendations  for amendments in relation to the inclusion of single evergreen and  semi-evergreen trees and for fees to be refunded to a complainant in the event  of a complaint being upheld.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I do not intend to rehash the debate about single trees.  Suffice it to say that I was glad to hear the Minister state at Further  Consideration Stage that a review of the legislation would happen further down  the line. If the review finds that there are significant problems with  evergreen and semi-evergreen trees, I hope that a future Minister will  introduce the necessary legislation to address those.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I was glad to see that, at Consideration Stage, the House  supported the Committee&rsquo;s recommended amendments on fees. The amendments are in  the interests of fairness and will prevent vexatious complaints. I welcome the  agreement of the Department&rsquo;s further amendments at Further Consideration  Stage, as they take account of human rights and public consultation  requirements. I believe, as does the Committee, that we now have a stronger  Bill as a result of the co-operation between the Department and the Committee,  and, on behalf of the Committee, I am pleased to support the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I would now like to say a few words on behalf of Sinn F&eacute;in.  Funnily enough, I watched a television interview last night in which people  talked about rushing legislation through at this time. The Department of the  Environment and the Committee have pushed through nine or 10 Bills during this  mandate. That has been good, progressive work, and I commend all those  associated with it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">This Bill highlighted that there is an issue with single  trees. I hope that a future Minister and the Department will look at that. On  behalf of Sinn F&eacute;in, I hope that that will be taken on board because it was an  issue that we definitely could not have dealt with in this mandate. On that  note, I support the Bill on behalf of Sinn F&eacute;in.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  welcome the passage of the Bill. I commend not only the officials but the  Minister for his strong personal commitment to getting this Bill through the  Assembly. I think that it will be important to people. It is unsurprising, from  a media point of view, that we in the Chamber often concentrate on big  set-piece occasions. Last week, for example, we debated very important issues  around the Budget, and there was clearly a lot of focus on and controversy  around that. That is not altogether surprising. However, it is also important  to note that, sometimes, the things that do not get the same media attention,  such as this legislation, are vital to many people. I believe that this Bill  will make a positive impact on people&rsquo;s lives. If everyone behaved entirely  responsibly and acted as a good neighbour, it could be argued that there would  be no need for this legislation. There would be little need for the legislation  if people acted with a degree of social responsibility, but, unfortunately,  that is not the world in which we live.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">12.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mention has been made of the number of Bills that have gone  through. I suppose that this legislation is particularly welcome, because it  relates to something on which, I suspect, Members from all sides of the House have  been lobbied for years. There was a degree of frustration about the fact that  legislation on high hedges had been put in place in England yet it had taken  some time for similar legislation to appear in Northern Ireland. The  legislation that we have got shows the merits of devolution. It was achieved  not simply by way of the co-operation between the Department and the Committee,  which, I think, helped refine the Bill in the best possible way, but through  the great care that was taken to get something that is right for Northern  Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">One thing that arose from the legislation in England was  that the legislators there got a number of things wrong and there were unforeseen  circumstances. As a result, decisions have been taken here that will benefit  our legislation. For instance, we have ensured that there is a fees cap here.  Hopefully, that will help us avoid the situation that pertained in England,  where there were massive variations and people did not have access to the same  services.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have also taken a position that tries to differentiate  between unmerited and vexatious applications and situations in which an  individual is genuinely suffering as a result of the ill-considered behaviour  of a neighbour. We have followed the polluter pays principle or costs-follow-the-event  view. At the moment, we take the view that the legislation should be restricted  to hedges and groups of trees. For the time being, it does not include single  trees. All those decisions have been right. Broadly speaking, we have the right  legislation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As the Minister indicated, it is also important that, in  moving forward, we have something that is cost-neutral to councils and is  implemented in a proper fashion. That being the case and as the Minister also  indicated, it is important that time and care be taken to ensure that the  detail of the implementation is got right in the work that departmental  officials, NILGA and local councils will do. At this juncture, it would be  remiss of me not to declare an interest as a member of North Down Borough  Council. There are a few high hedges dotted around North Down, so the Bill will  be particularly welcomed in my constituency. It is important that that time and  care be taken to ensure that the detail of implementation is got right.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Even given the very wise figures on all sides of the  Chamber, I cannot guarantee that we have a monopoly on wisdom. Some Members,  present or absent, may be keen to claim a monopoly on wisdom, but, thinking  about it objectively, I do not think that we can guarantee that we have a  monopoly on wisdom. However, we have taken a degree of care in the legislation  to get it right for Northern Ireland. Time and the full implementation of the  Bill will tell whether everything is right. It has been indicated that there  will be a review of how the Bill is operating following its implementation. At  that stage, we will see whether further tweaks need to be made, and that is to  be welcomed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">This will be welcome legislation for many people up and  down the country. It will lead to an improvement in the quality of people&rsquo;s  lives. It may well lead to the ending of several long-running sores in society  and, in particular, neighbourhood disputes that, in many cases, have rumbled on  for years. The issues have been fairly well covered at the various legislative  stages. This is good legislation for Northern Ireland, and I commend it to the  House.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kinahan</strong>:  Everyone here can welcome the Bill, even if there is a chance that councils  will have to touch on that little bit of wisdom of Solomon as they sort out  some matters. Every council and every MLA will be pleased to see that this  mechanism to resolve disputes has at last been put in place.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At Consideration Stage, I mentioned one person whom I was  trying to help. She was shaking in fury with her neighbour. Not everyone has  the ease of being able to deal with a neighbour. Here, we are putting in place  a very necessary mechanism to resolve disputes. Those of us who are on councils  will probably be surprised at the build-up of the queue of people who have  hedge disputes that they want resolved. I welcome the fact that, at this  juncture, we have not included the single-tree problem, although we really need  to take that issue on board, and I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s comment that that  will be reviewed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I should have started by congratulating the Department, the  Committee and the Minister on working well together to get the Bill through. I  also welcome the fees cap in the Bill and the variation of fines, refunds and  provision for multiple owners that will be possible. A lot of good thought was  put into the Bill and, as was said, a lot of wisdom put together as we improved  on the English and the Welsh system. I hope that it turns out to be  cost-neutral for councils. I look forward to seeing the guidance from the Minister  and the Department. We warmly welcome the Bill, which is a great addition to  the legislation that we have passed.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>: I  also welcome the Bill. It was certainly an enjoyable aspect of the Committee&rsquo;s  work, bringing us to lots of exotic places, like Carrickfergus, where we had a  meeting in Carrickfergus Castle. I was most impressed by the fortifications  there. There were certainly no evergreens, but loads of walls that had stood  the test of time for hundreds of years. I take this opportunity to encourage  anyone who has not been to that castle to go and see it. It is a wonderful  example of Norman Irish history.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">While we were at Carrickfergus Castle, we got a lot of  helpful advice from the officers of the local council on how the Bill should be  shaped. We certainly came face to face with many of the difficulties that would  arise. The public have been asking for a high hedges Bill for many years and,  of course, such legislation has existed in a different form in other islands  close to here for at least eight years. Like other Bills, this Bill is  certainly very useful, but it will not meet the expectations of everyone.  Speaking as a member of the SDLP, I am disappointed that the single trees issue  was not accommodated, although I can understand the difficulties. There is also  some concern about the costs involved. In most cases, I accept that people have  genuine concerns, and those can, hopefully, be resolved by mediation and so on.  However, there will be times when individuals will perhaps use the Bill as an  opportunity to sort out their next-door neighbour.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">If I have any advice for anyone about trees or hedges, it  is to give serious thought before planting the things. I have personal  experience of that. My late mother presented us with a small leylandii when we  moved into our new house, and I planted it in the middle of the lawn. That was  30 years ago. It is still there but, some day, someone will have to make an  important decision about what to do with it. My colleague will probably cover  all the environmental aspects of what to do with trees when they have reached  the end of their life. Do you leave them standing or cut them down with those  horrible chainsaws?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">All in all, the Bill is useful. The Minister is to be  congratulated on pursuing it and, hopefully, the 26 councils dotted around  Northern Ireland will not be inundated with grudging neighbours who just want  to sort each other out. It will, in fact, offer daylight to people who have  been denied it, perhaps for years.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lyttle</strong>: I  join my colleagues in wholeheartedly welcoming the legislation, and I thank the  Minister for its progression through the House. I welcome the power that will  be given to councils to enforce appropriate maintenance of high hedges and  share the Minister&rsquo;s hope that the very existence of the legislation will  encourage voluntary maintenance of high hedges.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have placed on record my regret that the Minister was  unable to include provisions for appropriate and neighbourly maintenance of  single trees in the Bill. I sincerely regret that the Minister, who is a  self-professed man of integrity, sought, if we are to be honest, to  misrepresent my position on the issue. He said that I was attempting to get  single trees removed, which is not the case. My party and I have done extensive  work in my constituency and across Northern Ireland to preserve historic trees.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  thank the Member for giving way. Would the Member, therefore, take  responsibility for John Dallat&rsquo;s leylandii? Is there an appropriate place to  shove it in east Belfast?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. I should perhaps remind the House that the Bill is at Final Stage.  Members should discuss only what is in the Bill now and not what they think  should have been in it.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lyttle</strong>:  Thank you, Mr Speaker. I welcome the commitment to re-examine that problem,  and, if I am returned to the House, I will work with anyone on the issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Many local people, particularly in my constituency, have  suffered a loss of enjoyment of their property and a significant negative  impact on their quality of life because of poorly maintained high hedges. I am  particularly glad for those people that the Assembly has intervened in a  positive way to tackle the problem. I look forward to local council officers  restoring that enjoyment of property and quality of life through the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Humphrey</strong>:  I support the Bill. All Members will have dealt with constituents who have  issues with gardens and, more particularly, trees, hedges and bushes in their  neighbours&rsquo; gardens that have caused them stress. I declare an interest as a  member of Belfast City Council. I know through my work with the council that  its environmental health service is hugely frustrated when it attempts to  address those issues, as it does not have the power to deal with them. I was  speaking to a constituent in church on Sunday who has been dealing with a  problem with a neighbour who can no longer look after trees that are now  encroaching on his property. When council officers went out, they did not have  the power to do anything about it. The public do not understand the demarcation  lines between councils and the DOE, and they feel frustrated when the work is  not carried out.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the cap on fees. It is a common-sense approach  that will lead to the Bill delivering for people out there by addressing the  issue and their concerns. I also welcome the co-operation between the Minister,  the Committee for the Environment and the Department in securing a Bill that is  a significant step forward for the public.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Perhaps all Members who are keen on gardening should take  some advice so that we do not run into the situation in which Mr Dallat found  himself. They should, therefore, attend the reception in the Long Gallery to  celebrate community gardens and allotments, which begins in the next few  minutes.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr W Clarke</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I also welcome the Final Stage of the  High Hedges Bill. I want to thank staff from the Department, the Assembly&rsquo;s  Research and Library Service, the Bill Office, the Committee and Committee  members. I particularly thank the Minister for bringing forward the legislation  very quickly after taking office. The Minister must have been inundated with  these issues in his constituency.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill is good legislation that will make a real  difference to people&rsquo;s lives. As Peter Weir said, the Bill may not get the  media attention, but it will make a huge difference to people&rsquo;s quality of  life. I will touch on the negatives. The media and some Members criticised the  Bill for coming forward too quickly. However, we are here to progress  legislation as quickly as possible, and people elect us to create good  legislation, such as this Bill, to improve their lives.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As an elected representative, I am acutely aware of the  problems that high hedges can cause, and I have been involved with a number of  cases in my constituency. They can lead to a complete breakdown of neighbour  relations, and local authorities and elected representatives have tried to  mediate without any tools to do the job. Some may think that the issue is  light-hearted, but they fail to understand that it affects people&rsquo;s mental and  physical health and well-being.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I still say that mediation, which I think the Minister  touched on, would be the first option. A mediation process will now carry extra  weight; that is the difference. We have the tools in the box to deal with the  issue. An alleged offender will have to pay the complainant&rsquo;s fees as well as  the costs involved in reducing the height of the hedge. That is good leverage  to get a resolution to the problem.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Devolution is working, and this Bill proves that it is  working.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">12.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Savage</strong>: I  declare an interest as a member of Craigavon Borough Council. The progression  of the Bill represents a working, textbook example of how the House took a  Province-wide problem and found an acceptable solution. It is important  legislation, which has attracted the interest of many households across  Northern Ireland, especially in my constituency, where it will have a great  impact, particularly on those who have issues with neighbours and their high  hedges.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill introduces a system whereby hedge difficulties and  disagreements between neighbours can be resolved through discussion and  mediation. Should that fail, there remains the facility for a formal complaint  to be lodged with the local council. The council effectively acts as an  independent third party and will make a decision based on the merits of the  case presented to it. The Bill represents real progress on a troublesome issue  and will be welcomed by householders across Northern Ireland. However, many  issues remain, including the single tree issue. That will probably be on the  agenda for the new Assembly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I pay tribute to all those who brought the Bill to where it  is today. I commend my colleagues on the Environment Committee. I also pay  tribute to the Committee staff, who do a sterling job and are sometimes taken  for granted. It would be remiss of me not to thank the key stakeholders for  their interest in bringing the Bill about. I support the Bill and congratulate  the Minister.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I will be brief because much has  already been said, although I remember the last night I said that I was going  to be brief and maybe it did not turn out that way.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the legislation. Although high hedges may not be  as contentious in some rural areas, they can intrude on people&rsquo;s amenities and  privacy and affect the light going into homes in urban areas. Hopefully, the  legislation will make a difference to people&rsquo;s lives and alleviate some of  their burdens in trying to address issues with high hedges.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will add a wee caveat. I hope that my colleagues on  councils will not now see an avalanche of issues portrayed as council  responsibilities that are, in fact, neighbour disputes and will lead to all  sorts of contentious issues coming down the line at them now that they have  been empowered with those responsibilities. There will probably be a role for  mediation along the line.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The issue of single trees proved to be vexatious. I ask one  point of the Minister. The debate that we had the last night became a wee bit  surreal. However, there is a serious aspect to that debate, namely, whether a  tree is dying or dead and the scientific basis for retaining a tree that has  been proved scientifically to have a biodiversity benefit and to be of much use  in the overall scheme of things scientifically. So, I ask that the Minister  commits to more research into that matter with a view to having it reviewed  down the line, so that we do not treat that vexatious issue as dismissively as  in the past. There are good grounds &mdash; maybe I should say good roots, but I will  not go there either &mdash; for that argument.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Committee staff because they, as the  Chairperson kindly said, were shoe-to-the-floor on the raft of legislation that  came before the Committee in assisting members to get to the point of making  decisions and helping us on every occasion. And with that, complementarity was  offered by the Department.<span class="SectionMarker"><span style="font-size:14.0pt; "> </span></span></p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Seeing well-briefed staff from the Department is  refreshing for those of us who sit on the Committee. Sometimes they are not so  well briefed, but that did not apply in this case. It is good to see  complementarity of accountability with democracy work in the interests of the  community, which, I hope, the Bill will do. I thank the Minister for bringing  the legislation before us.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I am delighted that we are at the Final Stage of the Bill.  I would like to have reached this stage sooner, because I might have been able  to introduce the subordinate legislation as well, but we are where we are.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A few issues were raised by Members. In the earlier part of  his speech, Mr McGlone made a strong argument against including provision for  single trees, when he talked about the potential for an avalanche of complaints  and the vexation that such a provision could result in. We will implement the  provisions of the High Hedges Bill and see how they pan out. I know that a  limited number of cases involve single trees. However, it is important that we  do not get to a situation where someone, for the sake of complaining, wants to  cut down their neighbour&rsquo;s monkey puzzle tree and the council feels duty-bound  to ensure that that happens.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I regret that Mr Lyttle felt a little offended on the last  occasion, but this is a debating Chamber, and one should realise that in  debating Chambers there can sometimes be a fair degree of cut and thrust. He  was keen to cut down some of the single trees and therefore got referred to as  &ldquo;Chopper&rdquo;. The next day, the Alliance Party submitted an amendment to the  Planning Bill for dead and dying trees to be kept. So, one day it wanted to cut  down healthy monkey puzzle trees, and the following day it wanted to keep dead  trees. One can understand why we do not always take the advice of the Alliance  Party, although it does get it right on occasions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McGlone was referring to the Planning Bill when he spoke  about dead and dying trees. We will deal with that issue in due course in the  Planning Bill rather than today.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">This is a good news story. I was committed to the Bill some  time ago; when I was a Back-Bencher I wanted to see it brought forward. On too  many occasions, I have spent time in the back gardens of people who have no  light in their back garden as a consequence of other people&rsquo;s behaviours. I was  with senior citizens who were heartbroken that they could not enjoy their  property in the way that they wanted to because other people did not look after  their properties. Ultimately, we are doing something that is good for ordinary  people. It may not be headline-grabbing, but it will make a real difference to  the quality of life of hundreds of people across Northern Ireland over the next  number of years. That is what this Assembly is about. As Peter Weir said, it is  not always the big things that improve people&rsquo;s lives; sometimes it is the  small, incremental things. That is why it is good that we can come together as  representatives of the people of Northern Ireland. A direct rule Minister may not  have been remotely interested in a subject like this and may not have wanted  the hassle of taking this legislation through Westminster. We can get our teeth  into legislation like this, which will make a real difference to the lives of  ordinary individuals whom we represent.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am delighted that the Bill has reached its Final Stage,  and I look forward to Her Majesty putting her stamp of Royal Assent on it,  which will allow us to proceed.</p>

    <p class="OralAnswers-H2DepartmentHeading">Agriculture and Rural Development</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Questions 1 and 11 have been withdrawn, and written responses are  required. Question 3 has been transferred.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Forests</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">2. <strong>Mr  Molloy </strong>asked the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development to outline  what action she has taken to expand forest cover.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  (AQO 1283/11<a name="AQO1283/11" id="AQO1283/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development (Ms Gildernew)</strong>: Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat,  a LeasCheann Comhairle. To encourage more farmers and landowners to create  their own woodlands, I announced increases in grant rates of up to 30% in  November 2009. Since then, there has been an increase in applications for the  woodland grant scheme. In addition, woodland creation has been encouraged  through implementing beneficial changes to the single farm payment scheme  (SFP), allowing farmers to continue to receive their SFP, as well as forestry  grant payments, on land converted to woodland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We are engaging with a wide range of landowning bodies,  such as local councils and other central government Departments, encouraging  them to consider woodland as a viable economic alternative to their current  land use. We are engaging with afforestation stakeholders to identify barriers  to woodland creation and possible solutions. We are extending the funding of  the short rotation coppice scheme until the end of the current rural  development programme in 2013, and we are publicising the woodland grant scheme  through the Balmoral Show and other shows. We are talking to interested groups and  having press articles, open days and targeted mail drops. In addition to the  woodland grant scheme, participants in agrienvironment schemes may avail  themselves of funding for planting small areas of native trees on farmland and  managing existing woodland. Those schemes include the countryside management  scheme and the environmentally sensitive area scheme.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>:  The new forestry Act will help. Are there any plans to create training for  people who are going into forest farming to develop linkages between good land  that is being used for farming, which could be diversified into forestry in the  future?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: I do not think that a lot of training is  required. A lot of landowners often bring in contractors to plant the trees,  and they will advise on an ongoing basis as and when necessary. There is not a  great deal of training available, because, by dint of the subject that we are  talking about, most of the time, once the trees are planted, a small bit of  maintenance is as much as is needed.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kinahan</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her answer. Can she give an update on sudden oak death  disease and whether any compensation has been organised as yet?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: There has been quite a bit of concern  about sudden oak death in parts of Britain, but we do not have as big a problem  with it as other parts of these islands. The big issue for us at the moment in  terms of tree diseases is phytophthora ramorum in Japanese larch. That is  exercising us a lot in the current scheme. However, I am aware that sudden oak  death is an issue, particularly in the south of England, and I will keep a  close eye on what happens there.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Common Agricultural Policy</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">4. <strong>Mr  McQuillan </strong>asked the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development for an  update on her recent meeting with the Secretary of State regarding the reform  of the CAP post 2013.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  (AQO  1285/11<a name="AQO1285/11" id="AQO1285/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: The meeting with Owen Paterson took  place on 20 February, and it provided me with another opportunity to continue  making the case, on behalf of the agriculture industry and rural communities in  the North, for the continuation of common agricultural policy support. During  that meeting, I pressed four key issues. First, I stressed the importance of  CAP to the viability of our agriculture industry for the foreseeable future.  Secondly, I pointed out the need for the British Government to take a more  pragmatic approach to CAP budget issues. We need the Department for  Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) to focus its efforts on securing a  fair and proportionate share of the budget, rather than pursuing issues that  are not even in the remit of the agriculture council. Thirdly, DEFRA needs to  take on board and reflect properly the views of the devolved Administrations in  its dealings with Brussels.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, I stressed the need for regional flexibility to be  built into the CAP settlement. Overall, the meeting was cordial. Although there  has been a very small shift in the British Government&rsquo;s position following the  formation of the coalition Government, in that it is now calling for a gradual,  rather than an immediate, removal of direct payments, it is still a position to  which I will not be subscribing.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McQuillan</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her answer. Did the farm modernisation scheme come up  during the meeting? Will the Minister agree that there is a built-in religious  bias in the way in which the farm modernisation programme is being  administered?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: I absolutely do not agree with the  Member, and that will be proven in the coming weeks. I want to use this  opportunity to make a point, because I did not finish my original answer. I  assure the House that I will personally be presenting my submission to the EU  Commission on CAP reform post-2013. I will make that submission publicly  available, and it will be informed by the views presented to me by stakeholders  in recent weeks. I convey my thanks to everybody who responded to the  consultation.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Doherty</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. In some ways, both the question  and the previous answer touched on what I am going to ask. Are there essential  differences between the stance of the Department of Agriculture and Rural  Development (DARD) and that of the British Government as we move beyond 2013?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: There are a number of very obvious  differences between the two positions. First, the British Government argue for  a substantial cut to the CAP budget. Secondly, I support fully the continuation  of the single farm payment, where they do not. Although they are no longer  calling for an immediate end to the SFP, I cannot see how those payments can be  phased out in the foreseeable future. Thirdly, I support the continuation of  existing market mechanisms, such as intervention and aids to private storage,  while the British Government want to see those rolled back. Given the important  role that such mechanisms have played during the recent dairy crisis, I could  not support their removal.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>:  Jonathan Craig is not in his place to ask question 5.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Single Farm Payments</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">6. <strong>Mr  Gibson </strong>asked the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development for an  update on the legal action her Department is taking against the European  Commission&rsquo;s decision to levy disallowances in relation to single farm  payments.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 1287/11<a name="AQO1287/11" id="AQO1287/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: In my statement to the Assembly last  autumn, I advised that the Department had lodged a challenge with the European  Court. The Commission has now responded to that and has presented a plea for  inadmissibility. We believe that our case is admissible and have replied  accordingly. This is an important procedural test, as we are seeking to  establish our standing and right to bring a challenge before the court.  Although I am confident that we will be able to satisfy the court that we have  standing, the problem would not have arisen had DEFRA taken the case from the  outset. Consequently, the secondary issue has now become an important principle  in itself, in that a paying agency in a devolved Administration should be able  to challenge a Commission decision that unfairly affects it. The process moves  slowly, and I understand that it is unlikely that the European Court will make  a decision on that point much before the end of this year.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gibson</strong>: I  thank the Minister for her reply. Will she inform the House of the cost  incurred so far in pursuing the legal action?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: I do not have the exact figures, but the  cost is quite minimal at this early stage. Although we have a costing of around  &pound;100,000 over the entire court case, I believe that it is money well spent. In  the current case, we can potentially save &pound;9 million on current disallowance  and also save money in the future. It is a risk worth taking.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am most anxious that, throughout the process, it is  obvious that English interests in the EU supersede those of the devolved  Administrations and our framers. I question the British Government&rsquo;s ability to  represent properly our views at EU level.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gardiner</strong>:  Will the Minister provide an update on the farm mapping process and indicate to  the House when she expects the process to be completed.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: Again, those things tend to move  extremely slowly. There will be some update by the end of 2011, but it could be  2012 before the case is heard.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Just to clarify the point that I made to Mr Gibson:  the cost of the case, which is in the region of &pound;150,000, will be met by DARD.  I hope that that clarifies the issue.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  Why does the Minister&rsquo;s Department disallow single farm payment claims for  hedgerows that are more than 4 m wide? Does she accept that that is unfair and,  indeed, contrasts very sharply with the Republic of Ireland, where all  hedgerows, regardless of width, are regarded as an environmental enhancement?  Will she tell us why she does not apply an all-Ireland policy on the matter?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: I think that the Member is all too aware  of where I stand on such issues and of my feeling that the current application  of EU rules is, at times, unfair and very difficult. However, we have had the  very real experience of payments being disallowed because the interpretation of  EU rules in Europe is different from the interpretation here. Indeed, my  Department has been criticised for being too lenient with farmers on that  issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We recognise the importance of single farm payments to the  economy here; we could not do without them. At the same time, application can  lead to difficulties for farmers, and I will continue to do all I can in my  role to press for a fair and equitable solution. However, it is certainly  difficult when a change is applied retrospectively, and we end up with a  significant disallowance on the back of that.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Farm Mapping</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">7. <strong>Mr  O&rsquo;Loan </strong>asked the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development for her  assessment of whether there will be any significant problems when the new farm  mapping exercise is completed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO  1288/11<a name="AQO1288/11" id="AQO1288/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: Although I am not anticipating any major  problems with the land parcel identification system (LPIS) after the mapping  project is completed, the process is not straightforward. The mapping project  will be carried out in two phases. Phase 1, which will be substantially  completed by early 2012, will deal with the issues that are of most concern to  the EU auditors and will remove areas from fields that are ineligible to  receive area-based payments. It is essential that farmers check their new maps  carefully to tell us about any changes. If they do so, the risk of their facing  penalties and our facing further disallowance will hopefully be substantially  reduced. Phase 2, which will be completed in early 2013, will amend the DARD  farm maps to align them with GPS technology. If farmers carefully check their  maps again, the risk of disallowance should be further reduced.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We are all in this together. My Department will provide an  updated map, but farmers are responsible for ensuring that the maps are correct  and that they claim for eligible land only. Given the dynamic nature of maps,  we cannot become complacent. After the mapping exercise is completed, farmers  will need to tell us about any changes to their maps in the future. My  Department will continue to improve the maps and, to that end, is developing  long-term linkages with Land and Property Services (LPS). That will include provisions  for LPS and DARD to share information on mapping changes, which will help to  synchronise both sets of maps and to keep them up to date as far as practical.  Although we hope that that minimises the risk of farmers&rsquo; penalties and further  disallowance related to the LPIS project, that ultimately depends on the EU  Commission being satisfied that we have the required controls in place.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  thank the Minister for her answer. Has she ensured that an independent quality  control mechanism is used for the mapping exercise? I ask that question  advisedly because I have seen the operation being carried out and believe that  there are distinct limitations to it. However, that is not a criticism of the  LPS staff who are involved in it.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: I certainly feel that we need to keep a  very careful eye on that and to ensure that proper monitoring is in place. We  have received significant investment for that through invest to save. We need  to ensure that it is done right. However, the best mechanism of quality control  is basically farmers telling us when the maps do not correlate with a feature  on their land.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Boylan</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Just for clarity, will the  Minister indicate whether the mapping exercise is on target for completion?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: As I said, our aim is to reduce the risk  of disallowance as far as possible by the start of the 2012 single farm payment  scheme year, and we are on target to achieve that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Phase 1, which corrects the main issues in the maps, will  be substantially complete by that stage. Phase 2, which aims to bring the maps  into line with GPS technologies, will not finish until early 2013. However, we  anticipate that the effects of that at farm level will be generally small.  Therefore, it represents a much lower risk of disallowance.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  Is the Minister satisfied that those maps, in comparison with the previous maps  that her Department spent many thousands of pounds setting out, will be more  accurate?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: As I have said in the House before,  technology changes all the time. I expect that the maps will be of a better  quality and will show more. As technology increases, we have to get better with  it. However, I expect that there will be some changes to people&rsquo;s maps. What  would be the point in carrying out another costly exercise if we are going to  reproduce the same maps?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  They were your fault anyway.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: No, they were not.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  As some Members will be aware, across council chambers, the SDLP has been  committed to the promotion and retention of the use of townland names. Will the  Minister confirm that townland names will be used in the mapping exercise for  the townlands and fields on which farm holdings are located?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: Absolutely. In every area of work, we  will do all that we can to promote the use of townland names.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is interesting that the Member should ask that  supplementary question. I had a visit last night from someone on behalf of the  census team, who was insisting on getting my road number. I was equally  insistent that I do not use a road number and that I use my townland. It was a  wee bit difficult to persuade that person that my townland was a genuine way of  identifying my address.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that other Departments are as proactive on that as  we are.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Single Farm Payments</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">8. <strong>Mr  Moutray </strong>asked the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development how many  single farm payments are outstanding in relation to applications that were  submitted in 2010.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 1289/11<a name="AQO1289/11" id="AQO1289/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: As of 10 March 2011, my Department had  finalised 94&middot;7% of 2010 claims and paid out over &pound;250 million to farmers. That  means that 36,150 claims have been paid and that 1,915 claims have not yet been  finalised. There are a variety of reasons for that, including queries on the  claim that need to be completed, the processing of on-farm inspection reports,  challenges by others of the right to claim the land and the need to await  probate. It should be noted that, because of the application of penalties under  scheme rules, not all remaining claims will necessarily be due a payment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have met our 2010 published targets, but I appreciate  the difficulties that are experienced by many of those claimants who have not  yet been paid. Although my Department is working to clear those cases, they  tend to be more complex and, by necessity, take longer to work through. In  recognition of that, I have arranged for additional staff to move to the single  farm payment branch to accelerate the payment of the remaining claims.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Looking ahead, I hope that the remapping exercise will  reduce many of the errors that are currently being found in on-farm  inspections. That exercise will speed up the inspection process. Over and above  that, I have asked officials to begin the process of a review of the entire inspection  and payment procedure to see how it can be improved.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Moutray</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her response. It is encouraging to hear that  approximately 95% of single farm payment claims have been sorted out. However,  that still leaves 5%. Will the Minister give an assurance that the outstanding  single farm payments will be dealt with expediently and that there will be no  delay on behalf of her Department? Many farm families are suffering financial  hardship as a result of the delay.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: Absolutely. In common with the Committee  Chairman, I have pointed out that 1,915 claims are still outstanding. It is  great to get 95% of claims paid, but we need to concentrate now on getting that  5% over the line.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">One reason for our not being able to process farmers&rsquo; money  is that we have moved to a system whereby all transactions are done under BACS,  that is, automatic account transaction, and some farmers have still not shared  their account details with us. We would like everybody to give us that  information. Their accounts do not have to be in a bank; they could be in a  credit union. We encourage farmers to give us that information. I want to pay  out that money as quickly as I possibly can. The review will be very important,  in that we can look at all the issues on the timing of inspections, the use of  satellite imagery and everything else to try to pay those people quicker.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I  understand that some other EU countries provide advance part-payment. Will the  Minister indicate why that has not happened here? If there are delays  attributable to her departmental officials, will she indicate whether an  interest repayment will accompany the final payment? That will ensure clear  accountability where undue delays have been caused by departmental officials.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: Again, I assure the House that, as part  of the review, I will look at the fact that some other member states make 50:50  payments and consider that as a mechanism for the future. If we decide to go  down that route, we will have to follow all the rest of the inspection  procedures and everything else. That is why a review of the process is  important. We must try to build in the ability to allow us to be flexible. The  vast majority of farmers were paid before Christmas. However, we are now into  the spring, and some have still not been paid. We want to pay those farmers as  quickly as possible. Everything is on the table to ensure that the process is  as painless as possible for farmers.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McKay</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. The Minister referred to the fact  that a number of inspections are outstanding. Will she elaborate on that and  outline whether those inspections have to be completed before payments are  made?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: Yes; unfortunately, that is one of the  difficulties. In line with EU legislation, we have to finalise all verification  checks, including land eligibility inspections, before we can make payments.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P J Bradley</strong>:  We have often heard that delays in payments can be caused by the farming  community omitting information, giving incorrect information or making errors.  Will the Minister give an assurance that no mistakes in her Department,  including Orchard House, led to any delays in payments being made?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: A dedicated team works out of Orchard  House and has a great deal of experience in this matter. I commend those people  for the way in which they process the claims. However, the Member raises a  welcome point. Mistakes can occur when the forms are completed on paper, and it  can take more time to iron out those mistakes. We encourage the use of online  application forms and, in fact, online application forms will be mandatory by  2015. The reason for that is that the online forms are self-correcting. If  someone makes a mistake on an online application, that person is told that that  is not the answer that should have been given.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We want to reduce the amount of mistakes, and we want to  pay farmers. I would love to be able to pay 100% of farmers as soon as that  payment window opens. The more farmers who work online, the better it will be  for them, as it will reduce the number of mistakes.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Rural White Paper</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">9. <strong>Mr  O&rsquo;Dowd </strong>asked the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development to outline  the progress made on the rural White Paper.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO  1290/11<a name="AQO1290/11" id="AQO1290/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: I am pleased to be able to report to the  House that work is developing on the rural White Paper. It is now at an  advanced stage, and I hope to publish a draft rural White Paper action plan for  consultation on 21 March. I expect the consultation document to contain a wide  range of actions aimed at improving the well-being of rural communities, such  as addressing difficulties in accessing services, public transport, broadband  quality and speed, and the development of effective community development  structures.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The rural White Paper has been developed to provide a  strategic rural policy framework for the next 10 years and will help to guide  the work of the Executive in that significant and challenging area. Our rural  areas face particular challenges as regards growth, jobs, infrastructure  provision and access to services. The provision of good communication  infrastructure and connectivity is vital to the sustainability of our rural  areas and important in providing the isolated and vulnerable in our community  with much-needed access.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The rural White Paper shows that our rural areas and people  are important; that they have rights that must be respected; that they provide  enormous value and untapped potential; and that government will do what it can  to help recognise those rights, support that potential and address the real  challenges that exist in our rural communities. It will provide an opportunity  to look at what we do to support our rural areas and to think innovatively  about how we target our limited resources for the betterment of our rural  communities. It is an initiative that is close to my heart, not only as a rural  elected representative but as a rural dweller who understands the challenges  that living in rural areas can and does bring.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>: I  welcome the progress thus far on the rural White Paper and the policy. As part  of the policy development, will the Minister hold public consultation events in  which rural communities will be able to feed into the policy development?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: Absolutely. The public consultation will  last for 12 weeks, during which my officials plan to hold a number of  consultation events in rural areas throughout the North. My officials will work  with rural representatives to ensure that there is full engagement with rural  communities and a good geographical spread of events. Everyone with an interest  in rural issues is welcome to attend. I ask them to come along and give us  their feedback and their opinions and make sure that the document is as good as  it possibly can be.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  The Minister will be aware that rural proofing, which she has highlighted and  brought forward, is something that needs to be addressed. Have her officials  raised the issue of Libraries NI with their counterparts in the Department of  Culture, Arts and Leisure to ensure that rural proofing of Libraries NI is  taken into consideration during the consultation?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: I wrote to Minister McCausland for  clarification on that issue and asked whether the decision to close a number of  libraries, including some in both our constituencies, had been rural-proofed. A  lot of people in rural communities do not have broadband at home and rely on  the library for Internet access, for example, as well as for borrowing books  and using the valuable resources that a library can provide. I am hopeful that  the consultation, along with the additional money that has been made available  for libraries, will save a number of libraries that have been earmarked for  closure.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  I am sure that the Minister will want to join me in paying tribute to P J  Bradley, who is attending his last agriculture Question Time as an MLA, and who  has served the SDLP for the past decade in that portfolio.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Can the Minister assure the farming community that the  rural White Paper is also about understanding and maximising the potential role  that farming will continue to play in rural communities as an economic, social  and environmental driver?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: Absolutely. I believe that the agrifood  sector has weathered the worst of the storm, but, as I said in my original  answer, I believe that there is still untapped potential for rural communities  and for farmers. I would like to take the opportunity to thank P J Bradley for  his helpful and constructive critique of my performance over the past four  years. It is the last agriculture Question Time for us all, so I thank the  Committee and the House for their support over that period. I wish P J well in  whatever he decides to do in the future.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Agritourism</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">10. <strong>Mr  Neeson </strong>asked the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development to outline  the action she is taking to develop agritourism.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  (AQO 1291/11<a name="AQO1291/11" id="AQO1291/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: Unfortunately, under axis 3 of the rural  development programme, we cannot fund anything that is associated with  agricultural production. However, under measure 3.1 of the rural development  programme, farm diversification, farm families who wish to diversify into  tourism can avail themselves of funding to develop non-production-related  infrastructure such as, for example, self-catering units or activity-based  tourism, and, in doing so, provide activities and accommodation that could  complement a wider tourism project.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I said previously in the House, the work that is ongoing  through the rural development programme is delivering the tourism  infrastructure that will help rural communities to provide a better tourism  offering in the future. Agritourism and social farming are innovative ways of  increasing the farm family income. My officials are examining whether those  farming innovations could be supported by my Department and how it can do so.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Neeson</strong>:  The Minister will be delighted to hear that I have just left my farewell lunch  to be here to ask my question. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.] </span>To what  extent does her Department work with the Northern Ireland Tourist Board to  promote agritourism in Northern Ireland?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: We work with all agencies. I have  attended a number of North/South Ministerial Council meetings at which Tourism  Ireland has highlighted how rural agritourism and the better use of forests and  our rural communities have the potential to attract visitors to this island. We  will work with all and any organisations, not just the tourist bodies, but  local government with private partners, to determine how we can better develop  agritourism. I welcome the fact that the Member left his farewell lunch to be  here. He can go back to it now. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span><span class="SectionMarker"><span style="font-size:14.0pt; "> </span></span></p>

    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Question No 6 has been transferred, and question No 9 has been  withdrawn and a written response is required.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Altnagelvin Area Hospital: Radiotherapy  Unit</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">1. <strong>Ms M  Anderson </strong>asked the Minister of Finance and Personnel whether he has  corresponded with the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety in  relation to advancing the business case for the proposed radiotherapy unit at  Altnagelvin Hospital. &nbsp;(AQO 1297/11<a name="AQO1297/11" id="AQO1297/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">8. <strong>Mr P  Ramsey </strong>asked the Minister of Finance and Personnel for an update on the  business case for the proposed radiotherapy centre of excellence at Altnagelvin  Hospital. &nbsp;(AQO 1304/11<a name="AQO1304/11" id="AQO1304/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel &nbsp;(Mr S Wilson)</strong>:  As this is also my last Question Time, I thank all the Members who have  interrogated me and sought to trip me up as well as those who have come for  enlightenment. I hope that they found it during Question Time.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">With your permission, Mr Deputy Speaker, I will answer  questions 1 and 8 together, as they are similar. I have had no correspondence  from the Minister of Health on the issue. However, my officials have looked at  the business plan that was submitted by the Department. They asked questions  about the plan on 7 January 2011 and only in recent days have we had a partial  response from the Department of Health.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms M Anderson</strong>:  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat. I thank the Minister for that answer. It is news that  at least part of the questions have been answered. Were the questions that his  officials asked too complicated to allow stage one of the business case to  proceed? Does the Minister feel that the Health Minister is playing politics  with the most vulnerable in our society &mdash; cancer patients? As he will  appreciate, the radiotherapy unit at Altnagelvin is needed for patients across  the north-west, and there is a lot of cross-community and cross-party support.  It is absolutely unforgivable that we are at this stage &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Question, please.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms M Anderson</strong>:  &mdash; and a number of questions have not yet been answered.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: First, the Department of Finance does not ask  complicated questions; it asks simple questions and always gives simple, clear  answers.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We asked a number of very straightforward questions. The  first related to what commitment had been given by the Irish Republic for its  input into the Altnagelvin scheme. As Members know, one third of that scheme  was to be funded by the Government in the Republic, and we wanted to find out  the level of commitment and how the Department of Health in Northern Ireland  had sought to nail that down. The second question was whether the capital  project could be afforded if the Department of Health in the Republic decided  not to pursue the project in collaboration with DHSSPS in Northern Ireland. The  third question was about comments made by the Minister. The capital cost was  funded in what was then the draft Budget, and the Member will be aware that the  Minister said he could not afford to run the unit. Therefore, the question of  money being available from the Department of Health, Social Services and Public  Safety in Northern Ireland was raised with him.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The project was meant to be top priority. In fact, when the  Minister visited Londonderry, he said that it was a priority. It surprised us  that, suddenly, funding has not been made available, and the only conclusion  that one can draw is that this was yet another attempt to create a crisis that  would be used as leverage to get more money into the Health budget.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Ramsey</strong>:  I thank my colleague from Foyle for asking the original question. I acknowledge  the Minister for meeting all MLAs from the city some weeks ago, and he has  agreed to meet us again. This is the most important subject to affect not just  the people of the north-west but ultimately the provision of healthcare across  Northern Ireland. We are aware that the cancer unit in Belfast is at capacity &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Question, please.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Ramsey</strong>:  As regards the business case, has there been any indication from the Health  Department, for example, that the project is not affordable?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I thank the Member for that important question. The  argument has been that the Department of Health, Social Services and Public  Safety does not have the money to fund the project. It was asked whether the  unit could be run and funded solely by the Department here in Northern Ireland,  if the Republic dropped out. On 16 December &mdash; after the draft Budget &mdash; DHSSPS  officials wrote to my officials and said that, if the Republic of Ireland  funding did not materialise, the project would still be required, as the Member  pointed out, and would still be affordable. Even without the funding from the  Republic of Ireland and knowing the amount of money in the draft Budget &mdash; to  which another &pound;89 million has since been added &mdash; the Health Department said on  16 December that that was affordable. I have met Members from Londonderry from  all parties. What is happening in relation to that very important facility is  nothing short of scandalous. There has been a bit of political footballing.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kinahan</strong>:  I am appalled by the way in which the Minister has answered the questions and  has used the issue as a political football. Is the Minister looking to find  extra funds to help the Health Minister run Altnagelvin Area Hospital?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: That is an amazing question from the Member for  South Antrim. He asked whether I was looking for ways of helping the health  budget. The whole Executive and the whole Assembly &mdash; at least, those who voted  for the Budget &mdash; have sought to help the Health Minister, despite the fact that  he has not been prepared to help himself or his Department. Over the past year,  he has been excluded from &pound;30 million worth of savings that were imposed by the  Government that that party encouraged the people of Northern Ireland to vote  for. The Health Minister was excluded from &pound;30 million worth of savings. In  addition, during the monitoring rounds over the year, an extra &pound;70 million was  made available to the Health Minister. In the Budget, from the draft stage to  the Final Stage, another &pound;189 million was found for the health budget.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member asks me what we are doing to help the Health  Minister. One of the things that his party could have done to help the Health  Minister in the first place was not to advocate voting for a party that took  &pound;4,000 million out of the Northern Ireland Budget.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  My question has been partially answered. Yesterday, when I asked the Minister  for Regional Development what liaison he had had with the Minister of the  Environment on a major road scheme, he said that he had not had any direct  liaison. That is not the first time that we have heard that in the House. Does  the Minister agree that it is time that Ministers put their heads together and  that there should be some strategic and joined-up thinking on major schemes,  not least the one that we are discussing?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: When we look at the Budget collectively, we are  looking to see what the priorities for each Department should be and what the  overall strategic priority should be. However, as I am sure the Member will  appreciate, when it comes to spending and being responsible for the budget of a  Department, it has to be the individual Minister who takes responsibility. I do  not think that anyone would want it otherwise, as you would then find that  Ministers would simply shelter behind somebody else&rsquo;s decision rather than make  the decisions themselves. Unfortunately, there are a fair number who would be  prepared to do that.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Government: Joint Services</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">2. <strong>Mr  Molloy </strong>asked the Minister of Finance and Personnel for his assessment of  whether joint planning and shared spending between Departments in Northern  Ireland and the Republic of Ireland in areas such as education, health,  agriculture, tourism and transport would help address the economic difficulties  that both Administrations are facing. &nbsp;(AQO  1298/11<a name="AQO1298/11" id="AQO1298/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: There are many examples around the world of border  regions co-operating to reduce duplication and to exploit economies of scale.  As we have already seen, there is potential for such savings between Northern  Ireland and the Irish Republic. Indeed, we already have wide co-operation. I  have discussed at macro level with the Minister for Finance in Dublin where we  could co-operate to help both jurisdictions with the economic consequences and  challenges that we must face in the years ahead.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Let me make it plain to the Member, to his party and to the  party on the Benches to his left that, although I believe in economic co-operation  when it makes good sense, in allocating resources and saving money for the  public purse in each jurisdiction, sometimes the case for doing that is not  helped by the political overlay that some people in Sinn F&eacute;in and the SDLP try  to put on such co-operation. Co-operation would come about more naturally if it  were seen to be divorced from a political agenda.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his answer. He knows that I would not put a political  connotation on it at all.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister accepts the fact, which I welcome, that  cross-border co-operation can be managed to the benefit of both communities,  particularly where services are duplicated, such as after-hours doctors,  ambulances and other services. Some facilities will be in the South, others in  the North, but how do we get harmonisation and co-operation? How do we work  together for economic reasons?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: The Member almost said what he said with a straight  face; unfortunately, it broke towards the end. Nevertheless, he made an  important point. In the next four years, we, in Northern Ireland, face the  challenges of having to live with budgetary constraints, and the Irish Republic  faces exactly the same problems. Of course, where there are opportunities for  co-operation, we should take them. In fact, it would be remiss of us not to,  because we would be failing not just people in border regions but those, in  general, who depend on the public purse.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I know that I spoke light-heartedly, but there is often a  suspicion that, regardless of whether it makes economic sense, reduces  bureaucracy or costs and so on, co-operation and collaboration is done only for  political reasons. This party will very clearly oppose co-operation done for  purely political reasons, because we do not believe that our future lies in a  political joining with the Irish Republic. However, it is up to individual  Ministers to look for opportunities to co-operate. As I did with the previous  Minister for Finance in the Republic, I am happy to commit to looking for  general areas in which co-operation may be sustainable and helpful. It will  then come down to teasing out the details at ministerial level. The previous  question illustrated that, even where there are good examples, such as where  one third of the capital cost and the best use of a hospital or a radiotherapy  unit &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Minister is coming up to the time permitted for his answer.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: &mdash; could have been jointly undertaken, Ministers have  not pursued the matter.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Callaghan</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Does the Minister share many  people&rsquo;s frustration that securing better service outcomes and better value for  money is frustrated by political posturing from his and other parties? Does he  agree that it is time to take off the blinkers and set every Minister in the  Executive the task of exploring possible savings and better outcomes in every  Department, rather than leaving it up to each Minister? That has been the  failed approach over the past four years, and it is time to stop losing such  opportunities.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: When it comes to political posturing, the questioner  is a master. We have seen the political posturing in which he and his party  engaged over the past three weeks during the Budget discussions. All I can say  is that, as the Member will know well, the detailed co-operation between one  Department and another comes down to work that individual Ministers have to  undertake.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My record on this is good. I have made it clear that, where  there are opportunities to be explored, I want to see them explored. I will  encourage that and, during the Budget process, I encouraged Ministers to look  at different, better and more efficient ways of carrying out and delivering services.  If doing that includes North/South co-operation, I am happy to see it.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gardiner</strong>:  Would the Minister not be better to try the exercise that the question proposes  with countries in the same legal jurisdiction &mdash; the United   Kingdom &mdash; and talk to Scotland  and Wales?  Surely that would be less complicated.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: First, we have a land boundary with the Irish Republic,  so there are cross-border problems that have to be addressed. For example, when  I was Minister for the Environment, we had a problem with illegal waste from  the Republic being dumped and polluting rivers and bogs in Northern Ireland.  That problem had to be addressed, and I am sure that the Member would have  thought me irresponsible if I had not dealt with that and a range of other  things. Of course, I meet just as frequently with Ministers from Scotland and Wales to look at east-west  co-operation, because, especially when it comes to our dealings with the  Westminster Government, there are things that we need to do. Indeed, just this  week, I have been in touch with Scottish and Welsh Ministers about dormant  accounts, on which, we believe, a joint approach from the three jurisdictions,  with Westminster,  could be beneficial to us.</p>

    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">3. <strong>Mr McCartney </strong>asked the Minister of Finance and Personnel whether he intends to meet with  the new Irish Minister for Finance to build on the progress that had already  been made as a result of his meeting with the previous Irish Minister for  Finance. &nbsp;(AQO 1299/11<a name="AQO1299/11" id="AQO1299/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I hope that that can be arranged as soon as  practicably possible. Over the past two years, I met the previous Finance  Minister, Brian Lenihan, on a number of key issues that were relevant to both  economies. I am confident that I can build an effective working relationship  with the new Irish Finance Minister. As I said, I see that as essential in  dealing with cross-border issues. Of course, the Finance Ministers from both  jurisdictions will continue to meet in the North/South Ministerial Council,  which is of particular importance to me because of the Special EU Programmes  Body.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCartney</strong>:  Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire as a fhreagra. I thank the Minister for his  answer and for his commitment to seek a meeting as early as possible. I hope  that high on the agenda will be the House&rsquo;s need for reassurance that the  commitment to the A5 road scheme will continue unabated and that, in line with  a previous question, money for the radiotherapy unit at Altnagelvin is secure.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: The issue was raised in Armagh,  in January, at the last North/South Ministerial Council meeting. If the  Government of the Irish Republic decide that they do not want to continue  funding some of the cross-border schemes, it is important that we know early,  because that would have implications for our Budget, and some of our spending  priorities would have to be looked at again. Obviously, therefore, it will be  an important issue when I or whoever takes over from me can meet the Finance  Minister.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  Given the Minister&rsquo;s love of technology and in light of issues around carbon  footprints, is he considering using videoconferencing in his meetings with  Ministers from other jurisdictions?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I think that the Member is trying to taunt me into  commenting on some of the climate change nonsense that we have to listen to  from time to time in the House and elsewhere.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I support the use of videoconferencing. Indeed, we have  encouraged its use in Departments. When it can be used, I prefer to use it,  because not only is there a saving in travel time but there is a saving in my  time if I do not have to travel long distances and waste time travelling. It is  ironic that the first time that I suggested using videoconferencing was with  the Green Minister in the Republic   of Ireland, when I was  Environment Minister. I suggested that he might wish to reduce his carbon  footprint by talking to me by television, but he preferred that I travel the  whole way down to Dublin, emitting I do not know how many tons of CO2 in the  process. That was his choice. Of course, I am always happy to bring a little  northern sunshine to the grey, gloomy skies of the Irish Republic.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  Will the Minister of Finance clarify for the House which of the two Finance  Ministers in the Republic &mdash; Noonan or Howlin &mdash; he anticipates having the closer  working relationship with? Is the Minister concerned that NAMA may be obliged  to offload its Northern    Ireland portfolio early? Does he accept  that, given the continuing slump in the market here, should a situation like  that occur, it will have grave consequences for our property market? Will he  assure the House that he will continue to raise that matter with whichever of  the two Finance Ministers he feels it would be more appropriate to raise it  with in the months ahead?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I am sure that I will get on with either of them. I  know neither of them, therefore it will be a learning curve for me.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member raises an important issue. Indeed, on Monday of  last week, the First Minister, the deputy First Minister and I met the chief  executive and three other members of NAMA to discuss the very issue about which  the Member has spoken. We are greatly concerned that, with &pound;3&middot;2 billion worth  of assets held by NAMA in Northern Ireland and a target of realising 25% of  them in the next two years, there could be a huge impact. Let us not forget  that we in the Executive also want to offload assets as part of the budgetary  process and non-NAMA banks also want to offload assets. Some co-ordination on  that is needed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In conversations that I have had with Minister Lenihan in  the past and with the NAMA representatives on a number of occasions, I have  welcomed their assurances that, even though there is a target of realising 25%  of assets, they will look for markets where there is demand and liquidity and  will not seek simply to get a quota in each of the areas. They, too, realise  the dangers. One of the important concessions that we won in early discussions  with Minister Lenihan is that we now have two Northern Ireland members of the  NAMA Northern Ireland Advisory Committee advising the NAMA board. That gives us  some input and the Executive some assurance that there will not be a  destabilising of the market in Northern    Ireland.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Finance Ministers</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">4. <strong>Mr  O&rsquo;Loan </strong>asked the Minister of Finance and Personnel if, since taking up  office, he has had any contact or has held discussions with the former Irish  Minister for Finance. &nbsp;(AQO 1300/11<a name="AQO130011"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I have probably answered the question, as the Member  well knows. I am a bit surprised at the question. I have made statements in the  House on this on a number of occasions, and I have referred to meetings that I  have had with Minister Lenihan in the past. I do not think that I need to  elaborate on that.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  Let me return to the question of NAMA. Some &pound;350 million of the NAMA loans  relating to Northern Ireland  property relate to buildings or projects that are in the course of  construction. NAMA has said that it may be prepared to give loans so that those  projects may be finished, if it makes financial sense to do so. Has the  Minister raised that matter with NAMA representatives, and does he have an assurance  that they will do so equally in Northern    Ireland?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I am glad that the Member raised that issue. I  should perhaps have said something in reference to that in my last answer. Yes,  we did; it was one of the issues that we discussed with NAMA representatives  last week. They indicated to us that they have &pound;7 billion &mdash; perhaps it is &pound;5  billion, I cannot remember offhand &mdash; to provide as working capital for  projects. The building that Google bought in the middle of Dublin is an example of where working capital  was put in to allow a project to be finished. NAMA has given us assurances. We  will make representations where projects are identified in Northern Ireland  as being able to add value if some working capital is made available for them.  We will be in constant contact with officials in NAMA to ensure that that  happens. No indication has been given that there will be an allocation to each  jurisdiction. It will depend where opportunities arise to add a bit of value,  offload an asset and realise some money from it.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Humphrey</strong>:  Does the Minister agree that there is irony in the Member asking that question?  Perhaps if the Member had had more contact with the Minister for Social  Development &mdash; his Minister, the stay-away Minister in last week&rsquo;s debate on the  Budget &mdash; that Minister could have advised the Finance Minister and his other  colleagues of his decision to announce the housing at Girdwood, which he did  without Executive approval.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I am sure that the Minister for Social Development,  when making an announcement about housing in north Belfast, was well aware that  it was an opportunity to present a good picture coming up to the election. I  expect that we will find that many other Ministers want to do the same. I just  hope that, when they make those announcements, they all have the money to  deliver on them because, as Finance Minister, I am concerned about whether  those things are deliverable or are simply promises floated before an election  that will lead to disappointment for people after it.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Low Carbon Homes Schemes</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">5. <strong>Mr  Storey </strong>asked the Minister of Finance and Personnel for his assessment of  the low carbon homes scheme. (AQO 1301/11<a name="AQO1301/11" id="AQO1301/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: The Member will be aware that the Executive agreed  to close the energy efficiency homes scheme and the low carbon homes scheme  from the end of this month. Although the aim is to improve the energy  efficiency of the local housing stock, the take-up so far has been disappointing.  There are only three low-carbon properties, none of which has qualified as a  zero-carbon property. I want to make it clear that the savings associated with  the schemes will not be taken out of the Budget altogether but will be  transferred to the green new deal project. It was felt that that was a much  more appropriate way of cutting down the heating bills of a large number of  houses. For that reason, the Executive and the Committee gave their approval to  move forward with that.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his answer and for the recent clarity about the  extension to the scheme. He announced that, rather than coming to an end on 31  March, the scheme will be extended to 2012. However, could the Minister advise  the House about the ending of the zero-carbon scheme and about the green new  deal? How can we encourage a far better uptake of those schemes? The Minister  has clearly indicated today that the uptake of the previous scheme was poor.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: The improvement will be threefold. First, the  administrative costs of the scheme outweighed the actual benefits to  householders. There is no point in us spending money simply on administration  if we want to cut down the heating bills of homes. Secondly, especially with the  low-carbon homes, the benefits very often went to people who could afford to  build very high-spec houses. To a certain extent, I believe that those houses  will be built anyway because the people can afford to do so. Thirdly, if we put  the money into the green new deal, a far greater number of homes will be  covered by insulation and other heat-saving approaches, and we will get to  people who might not have been able to benefit from the other scheme.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. The Minister outlined some of the  useful benefits of the green new deal, not least its potential to create jobs.  In light of the withdrawal of the previous scheme, does he agree that, for the  reasons he outlined, the green new deal requires greater investment?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: We made it clear that the amount of money being put  into the green new deal project was only a start and that, as we found  efficiencies during the four-year Budget period, we would put more money into  it because, first, it would help to lever down even more money; secondly, as  the Member said, there is job potential; and, thirdly and most importantly,  especially with rising fuel bills, it will help to combat fuel poverty.</p>
    <p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="8"></a>Ministerial Statement</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Higher Education: Tuition Fees and Student Finance</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I have received notice from the Minister for Employment and  Learning that he wishes to make a statement.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning &nbsp;(Mr Kennedy)</strong>:  I welcome the opportunity to update the Assembly on the latest developments in  our work on future policy on higher education tuition fees and student finance  arrangements. In particular, I advise Members that I am today launching a  public consultation document on future policy on higher education tuition fees  and student finance arrangements in Northern Ireland, which I am  immediately making available on the Department for Employment and Learning  website, along with an associated equality impact assessment.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">3.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As Members will recall, on 8 February 2011, I made a  statement in the Assembly to advise of the publication of the update to the  independent review of variable fees and future student finance arrangements in Northern Ireland,  which was carried out by Joanne Stuart, and to set out its findings. I have now  fully considered the updated review, as well as developments in other regions  of the United Kingdom and  the Republic of Ireland, and taken into account costing  and modelling by departmental officials and the final Budget settlement for my  Department. Consequently, I have set out a range of options in the consultation  document, and I am seeking views on those.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Before outlining those options, it is important to set out  the key factors that have influenced my thinking on the whole area of student finance  arrangements. Ultimately, I want to ensure that, once the public have had their  say, we develop a &ldquo;made in Northern Ireland&rdquo; model that strikes an appropriate  balance between maintaining access and continuing our proud record of having  the best higher education participation rates in the United Kingdom for those  from socially disadvantaged backgrounds; promoting excellence in our higher  education institutions and allowing them to remain internationally competitive;  and being affordable to the public purse as well as to the students and  graduates.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Northern    Ireland&rsquo;s higher education sector makes an  essential contribution to the economy and wider society. Our higher education  institutions are well respected and compare favourably against their counterparts  throughout the world. Yet, in common with all United Kingdom universities, they  are required to compete in a global market for the best staff and students so  that they can maintain those high standards. Their success is critical to the  performance of the local economy. Often regarded as the engine of research and  innovation, their activities support wider initiatives to attract inward  investment and create high quality, sustainable jobs. Over the years, they have  produced most of the graduates on whom our businesses, professions and services  rely. They have been particularly successful in widening participation for  those from lower-income families to the extent that Northern   Ireland has now, by some margin, higher participation  rates than England, Scotland or Wales. That is a record of which we  should be rightly proud.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A range of challenges lie ahead for higher education,  including the financing of the sector. Given the current financial climate and  the public expenditure challenges faced by the Executive, it is right that we  look at options around the possible level of tuition fees and how much  government contributes to the sector. Before giving some detail on each of the  options, I make it clear that no student will have to pay upfront fees. That is  a very important principle to which I am committed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I now turn to the five options that are set out in the  consultation paper to illustrate the potential implications and key  considerations associated with each of them in turn. The first option that is  identified is the abolition of fees. That option would require additional  resources of some &pound;120 million per annum from the Northern Ireland block to make up  lost revenue for the higher education institutions from tuition fees and the  consequences of the Budget settlement. In giving consideration to that option,  it is very important to stress that it could be delivered only at the expense  of other government programmes.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, it is worthy of note that, although the current  arrangements provide for fees of &pound;3,290, the research that was conducted to  inform the Stuart review indicated that that level of fee did not inhibit  access to higher education by Northern Ireland students. Indeed, as I indicated  earlier, Northern Ireland  has the highest participation rates in the UK by some margin. Therefore, the  case for abolition would rest solely on a judgement that higher education  should be made freely available to those who can benefit from it.  Paradoxically, that would mean that all taxpayers, many of whom earn less than  graduates, would bear the full cost of tertiary education. That would not be  fair. Finally, that option would also mean that higher education institutions  would be wholly dependent on the public purse for financing their teaching  activities and the quality of the student experience. History shows that the  Government have found it difficult to find the resources necessary to finance  the increasing number of students participating in higher education at a level  consistent with sustaining the quality of teaching and research necessary to  maintain the sector&rsquo;s international reputation. That is one of the key  considerations for the introduction of fees in the first place.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The second option is to maintain the status quo. That  option would provide for fees to be capped at the current level of &pound;3,290 per  annum and subject only to inflation-linked increases. Maintenance grants and  loans would also be maintained at current levels. Over the past two years,  there have been significant changes in the economic and financial environment.  The Executive face a challenging budgetary position. The impact of the Barnett  consequentials and the post-Brown context mean that, throughout the United Kingdom,  a reduction in support for the higher education sector is unavoidable. Indeed,  after meeting efficiency savings of some &pound;28 million and other inescapable  pressures, a funding requirement of &pound;40 million by 2014-15 remains in my  Department&rsquo;s budget for higher education. If current participation rates, the  quality of teaching and research and the levels of student support are to be  maintained, additional income for the sector would have to be found. Under that  option, that income would have to be found from the public purse through  reductions in other services. I strongly believe that that would have serious  implications for the level of support provided to people who are unemployed or  who wish to access further education or training opportunities. The alternative  would be a significant reduction in higher education capacity, which would  undermine not only our achievements in widening participation but the quality  and international reputation of the higher education system. Indeed, the  financial viability and sustainability of the system would be threatened, with  serious consequences for the local economy. Those issues must be taken into  account when considering that option.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I realise that some Members may ask why higher education  institutions cannot release more money. All of the evidence shows that  universities work largely within, but at the lower end of, the expected norms  of financial performance. Clearly, no super-profits are being made. There is no  cushion to absorb, on an ongoing basis, a reduction in annual funding of a  further &pound;40 million from 2014-15. In addition, the reserves held by  universities are lower than those of institutions in Great Britain and are already  largely committed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We are all aware of the difficult public spending context  that faces the Executive and the competing and significant public spending  priorities that must be met. That being the case, I cannot, in good conscience,  recommend a top-slicing of Departments to cover the shortfall in the higher  education budget. Such an approach would require us to cut budgets for the  vulnerable, marginalised and sick to pay for higher education, and it would not  represent a sustainable approach to funding higher education. Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  excellent universities cannot be expected to plan on the basis of top-slicing  departmental budgets, mindful that other pressures and changing political  circumstances could easily lead to that decision being overturned. The demands  of social justice and the need to secure sustainable funding for universities  require a more considered and fairer approach.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The third option recommends an increase of tuition fees to  &pound;4,500 and an increase in the threshold of the maintenance grant. Under that  option, the increase in tuition fees would generate additional income of some  &pound;30 million by 2014-15, which would largely address the financial pressures  associated with the budget settlement, to which I referred earlier. It is  important to stress that, as is the case now, no student would be required to  pay tuition fees upfront. Instead, loans would be available to meet the cost.  It would be the intention that those loans would not become repayable until an  individual is earning &pound;21,000 a year compared with &pound;15,000 under the current  arrangements.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In comparison with England, the public commitment to  financing higher education would be significantly higher. The teaching grant in  Northern Ireland would be  reduced by only some 20% compared with 80% in England  and 35% in Wales.  Very importantly, that option would also provide for an expansion of the income  threshold for full grant support from &pound;19,000 to &pound;25,000, meaning that almost  3,000 more students would qualify for full support, and none would have his or  her grant reduced. I believe that that would help to maintain Northern Ireland&rsquo;s position of having the  highest participation rate in the United Kingdom of those from lower  income backgrounds. It is also worthy of note that, notwithstanding the  proposed fee increase, that option would retain a significant majority public  contribution towards the cost of higher education teaching, which recognises  the public benefit of such teaching.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Importantly, it would also provide for a fair and  progressive loan and repayment system that is more generous than the current  one and a maintenance grant system that would provide a higher level of support  than that available in England.  After efficiency savings are taken into account, the impact of the proposals  would be broadly neutral for higher education institutions, as the income  surrendered from the teaching grant would be replaced by fee income from  students.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Option 4 recommends increasing fees to between &pound;5,000 and  &pound;5,750, increasing the threshold for the maximum maintenance grant and  increasing the amount of maximum grant payable. That, in effect, is the option  preferred by Joanne Stuart in her updated independent review. Under that  option, the proposed increase in tuition fees would generate additional fee  income of some &pound;40 million to &pound;60 million. That would be sufficient to address  the financial pressure associated with the Budget settlement for my Department.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As with the previous option, no student would be required  to finance upfront fees, as loans would be available to meet that cost. Again,  it would be the intention that those loans would not become repayable until an  individual is earning &pound;21,000 compared with &pound;15,000 under the current  arrangements. Under that option, the reduction of the teaching grant for  universities would be around 33% compared with 80% in England and 35% in Wales. That option, therefore,  would also maintain a significant public contribution to teaching. Again,  similarly to option 3, option 4 would provide for an expansion of the income  threshold for full grant support from &pound;19,000 to &pound;25,000, providing for almost  3,000 more students to receive full grant. No one would have their grant  reduced. The additional fees would enable grant support to be increased by some  &pound;275, thus reinstating the current &pound;500 differential between grant support here  and in England.  That would benefit more than 15,000 students, and the increase in maintenance  grant should help to promote and sustain access to higher education for those  from lower socio-economic groups. As with the previous option, after efficiency  savings are taken into account, the proposal would be broadly neutral for higher  education institutions, as the reduction in income from the teaching grant  would be replaced by tuition fee income.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My final observation on option 4 is that, although it is  quite similar to option 3, it shifts the burden of cost more to the student  than options 2 and 3. It may also be less attractive to students, given the  additional loan they may be required to take out.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The final option recommends increasing fees to between  &pound;6,000 and &pound;9,000, increasing the level of maintenance grant and the lower threshold  for entitlement and increasing maintenance loans.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That option is similar to the arrangements in England, and  would constitute a significant departure from the current policy, under which  the teaching element of the higher education system is largely funded by the  public purse. Net additional income in excess of some &pound;100 million per annum  would be generated. That would address the financial pressures associated with  the proposed budget settlement by some margin. It would also provide for additional  grant support in line with the previous option, allowing for a &pound;500  differential between grant support here and in England. In addition, maintenance  loan support would be increased from &pound;4,840 to &pound;5,500, which is the proposed  rate for England.  However, it is important to point out that, notwithstanding the substantial  increase in the student support arrangements, this option would pass a  significant proportion of the costs of teaching to graduates. As with England,  teaching grants would be reduced by some 80%.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In addition to releasing funding to allow for enhanced  grant and loan provision, this option also has the potential to release  existing public resources that could be deployed elsewhere. However, I think  that it is important to balance that against the fact that this option would  represent a major change in policy direction in relation to the balance of  public and private funding of higher education and would shift the burden of  cost in a significant way to graduates. I do not agree with such a shift in the  burden of cost. This proposal may have the potential to have a detrimental  impact on Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  position of having the highest participation rate in the UK of those  from lower income backgrounds.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is widely acknowledged, and I am well aware, that  tuition fees are a contentious issue. I would like to stress that it is very  important not to consider the level of fees in isolation but to recognise all  of the elements of the student support package, including maintenance grants,  loans and repayment arrangements. I make no apology for reiterating that the  underlying principle in bringing forward options in this consultation is that  access to higher education is based on the ability to learn, not the ability to  pay.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Should, following this consultation, the new mandate of the  Assembly decide that tuition fees should be increased, the whole area of  repayment will be a critical one that we need to ensure that students, their  families and others fully understand. Students do not need to pay upfront to  participate in higher education, and I intend to ensure that that continues.  They can defer payment of their tuition fees through a tuition fee loan, which  is repayable only after they leave higher education and are earning above a  certain income. Even then, the repayment is not based on the amount that they  owe, but on the amount they earn.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That is a critical point, and I am convinced that if young  people and parents, particularly those on lower incomes, are provided with the  right messages on the issue, both by this consultation paper and, dare I say  it, by their political representatives, no one should be deterred from entering  higher education, with all of the benefits that it can confer on the individual  and on society as a whole. Therefore I reiterate to Members the importance of a  mature and responsible debate on these issues, which will allow a consensus to  emerge on proposals that are affordable for government and for students and  graduates; protect and maintain our widening participation record; and secure  appropriate investment in higher education institutions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, I thank Joanne Stuart for her work in  producing the independent review of variable tuition fees and student finance  arrangements and its subsequent update. In addition, I acknowledge the  contributions of the people concerned by those changes, whose views and  expertise have informed our thinking as the Department developed the proposals  contained in this public consultation document. I also thank and pay tribute to  my officials for producing the work.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, it is my strong view that we now need to let all  those interested in this important issue to have their say through a public  consultation so that we can develop a &ldquo;made in Northern Ireland&rdquo; model, which,  as I have said before, strikes the right balance between maintaining access to  higher education for those from lower-income backgrounds, securing the  excellence of our institutions and ensuring that affordability is guaranteed.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Employment and Learning (Mrs D Kelly)</strong>: I thank the  Minister for what is a very significant statement on the future of higher  education, particularly for our young people in the North. The Committee has  heard a number of briefings from several stakeholders in recent months and, no  doubt, will do so again after the election.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, I am sure that the Minister will acknowledge the  fact that, to encourage them to take up opportunities for higher education,  society entered into a social contract with young people: if they get a good  degree, at the other end there will be a job for them. That contract has been  broken, because we know that many young people have left university with a  degree but no job and high levels of debt. At a public meeting recently, a  young graduate spoke very emotionally about coming out of university with debt  alongside her, hopefully, husband-to-be. They have a cumulative debt that will  make life difficult for them when they want to get married and start a family.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">With that in mind, I heard what the Minister said about the  role of elected representatives in getting the message out, but it is still a  widespread view that the costs will deter people from going to university if we  increase them any more. If the consultation is to be meaningful, what  guarantees can the Minister give to the respondents that there will be a move  by the Executive to put the economy at the heart of the Executive and provide  the funding that is required for further education so that it is open to all?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I am grateful to Mrs Kelly for her contribution as  Chairperson of the Committee for Employment and Learning. I listened carefully  to the points that she raised. In launching the consultation today, I ask  everyone to look at the document in all seriousness, to study the options  outlined in it, and to focus on what we require and what we will want to do for  higher education provision for our students in Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I think that we can bring forward a Northern Ireland-based  model. There are severe financial implications contained in the document, and  parties, politicians and everyone concerned should understand those and reflect  on them so that we can continue to have a system based not on the ability to  pay but the ability to learn; that we protect the widening participation record  that we have; and that we keep higher education at affordable levels.  Importantly, I stress that we need to protect and maintain the worldwide and  richly deserved reputation of our local universities. That is a very tall order  and is a challenge. I want to move the debate forward by consensus on that  basis in the hope that the new Executive and new Assembly, which will  ultimately decide on the issues, will bring forward that Northern Ireland-based  model.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>:  Given that the Minister and I share the twin aim of having students go to  university on their ability to learn, not their ability to pay, and having  those universities properly resourced, and given my personal opposition to  this, as a working-class boy who went to university, surely the obvious answer  is not to raise student fees but to top-slice that &pound;40 million from other  Departments. Was that option ever put to the Executive, and, if so, will the  Minister tell the House what his response was?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I am grateful to the Member for his interest in  and long-term commitment to further and higher education. However, he is  attempting to bring me back to what is almost a political question. In my  statement, I made it clear that that approach to funding, whereby the funding  of other Departments is top-sliced, is an unsatisfactory way to do business for  any Executive, Administration or government. In the statement, I confirmed my  opposition to that method. That is why I did not pursue it in my discussions  with Executive colleagues. I firmly believe that all the political parties  should address the issue in a mature and responsible manner, and to simply  top-slice other Departments&rsquo; resources would cut funding to essential services  for other Ministers who are already facing stringent cutbacks. Therefore, it is  not a real solution to the issue. The Member may disagree with that, but that  is my position, and it is the one that I relayed to my Executive colleagues.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I agree with the comments that the  Minister made in his statement about how we need to maintain access to higher  education. I also agree with the sentiments that are in almost every statement  that he makes to the House. Those sentiments are that access to higher  education should be on the ability to learn and not on the ability to pay. It  is up to us to deliver that concept.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Considering that we must have students&rsquo; involvement and  that we are moving towards the end of this Assembly and into the summer period,  how long will the consultation period last? At one time or another, every party  in the Assembly has opposed student fees and an increase in student fees. How  does the Minister aim to get any proposal that will increase student fees  through the Executive when Sinn F&eacute;in is totally opposed to that concept?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I accept the Member&rsquo;s point. It was slightly depressing,  in advance of the public consultation being issued and of the statement being  made to the House, to read the comments that were attributed to the Member in  today&rsquo;s edition of &lsquo;The Irish News&rsquo; and that expressed her party&rsquo;s view. She is  perfectly entitled to do that, but I will say that this is an important  decision that must be taken with due consideration and in a mature and  responsible way. That is what I sought to do as I wrestled with this enormously  difficult question.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I accept that if most of the political parties were given  the luxury of having either no charges or no increase in charges, they would  take it. However, that is not the reality of the situation that confronts the  Department, the Executive or me as the Minister. I hope that the 12-week public  consultation period will serve as an opportunity for those who are interested.  I expect that many people will share their views, and I encourage them to do so  in the public consultation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have tried to reflect fairly the situation that we are  all in. I ask that parties do not seek to use the issue as a political football  or for political gain in the forthcoming election campaign, however tempting  that might be. Rather, I hope that they will reflect on the realities of what  is best for our students, our universities and for bringing forward a Northern Ireland  model.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  I welcome the presentation of the consultation document today. As we heard from  Members, this is a complex and emotive issue, and it is one that will have  long-lasting effects on institutions, on the individuals who seek to move into  higher education, and on those individuals&rsquo; families.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister set the tone. He set out a demanding challenge  for the Assembly and Executive: how will we fund higher education? There is not  enough money to go around. He set out realistic options, and I hope that the  public and anyone else with an interest in higher education and this economy  will take the 12-week opportunity to respond and respond positively to the  consultation. Perhaps we will find ideas over and above the options that the  Minister has brought to the House today.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Does the Minister agree &mdash; I think that he will &mdash; that there  is a weighty responsibility on all parties to build a fair and realistic  consensus on the issue? It is an issue that will not go away, and it is central  to education and to the welfare of this community.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">3.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I thank the Member for his observations and for  his point about the need for mature reflection from us all. That is what I  attempted to do in my dealings with this complex issue. I appreciate that we  could launch full-scale into this issue during the election campaign, but I  know because of the abiding interest that most people have in the matter that there  is a real desire to come together and bring forward a Northern Ireland-based  solution that we can all accept and move forward on, even in the present  difficult financial circumstances. That is the approach that I as Minister will  take. I hope that whoever will be Minister for Employment and Learning after  the election will take a similar approach and that a similar tone will be  adopted by all parties.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lyttle</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his statement. I agree with my colleague Mr Robinson  that finding funding for higher education is a significant challenge for the  Assembly, not only on the grounds of social justice but on the grounds of  economic development for the region.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I do not agree that the only way to maintain the current  arrangement for higher education financing is to reduce other services or  increase fees. I also do not agree that the options put forward in the paper  are realistic in their entirety. The Minister said that in options 4 and 5  there is a shift in the burden from the public purse to the private individual.  He did not see fit to note that in option 3, which recommends raising student  fees to &pound;4,500. Why did the Minister do that?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I hope that the Member will study not only the  Hansard report of the debate but the detail of the consultation document, which  indicates that option 3 is just about affordable within the current expenditure  envelope that was given. That is slightly different from options 4 and 5. I  have tried to set that out fairly, in a non-partisan way and without indicating  any preferred option. That is the basis of the document. When the Member gets  an opportunity to study the consultation document, it will become clear why it  is set out in that way.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his statement. Members will have different views on the  options and will find some unacceptable. I will ask a question on behalf of a  group that is oft neglected and rarely mentioned in the House: middle-income  families. Above all, people want financial certainty, particularly those who  will be applying for university. The Minister mentioned a 12-week consultation  period. What is the timescale for decisions to be taken? It is vital that that  is done before people fill out prospectuses and look at their options this  autumn.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I am grateful to the Member for his question. He  raises an important point. The 12-week consultation starts immediately and will  run until almost the middle of June. At that point, whoever is the incumbent of  the office that I currently have will have to reflect on the consultation  responses and prepare for decisions to be made and clarity and certainty to be  given. The Member is absolutely right: clarity and certainty are required not  only for students who are considering higher education as an option and their  families but for universities as they publish their prospectuses. I imagine  that, by late June or early July &mdash; certainly, I anticipate, before the new  House rises for the summer recess &mdash; a decision that gives clarity, direction  and purpose on the issue will be required.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Maskey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Universities receive &pound;200 million  through public funding and &pound;300 million through other avenues. Would it not be  more appropriate for the universities and the Department to be more creative  and raise more money through other avenues instead of taking the easy option by  increasing student fees? I am not electioneering; it is about doing the right  thing by students and by our constituents.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I hear the point that the Member makes. However,  it would not be good public policy for me, as Minister for Employment and  Learning, to effectively strip bare our world-class and internationally  regarded universities. I do not see the logic of doing that at all.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Let me assure the Member that we have tested with some  rigour the financial background of both our universities, and the present  Budget settlement confirms that they have had to bear the brunt of the  efficiency savings that I, as Minister, and my Department have brought forward.  So, universities will not be given an easy ride.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We must remember that one of the prime reasons why the  First Minister and deputy First Minister, who are currently en route to Washington, are able to promote Northern Ireland  as a centre of excellence is the status of our universities. Therefore, we need  to ensure that they have proper funding arrangements in place. The issue is  finding the balance between affordability, widening participation and  maintaining the status of those universities. That is the challenge for all of  us &mdash; not just for Danny Kennedy, not just for my political party but for every  party in the House and every party in the Executive.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Anderson</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his statement. The Minister is consulting on this  important matter, and he has presented us with five options. I do not wish to  pre-empt the outcome of that consultation, but, if it turns out that the  majority of consultees are in favour of the option that abolishes fees, would  his Department be in a position to adopt that approach? Is option 1 not really  an option at all?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: The Member raises an important question. Option 1,  if it is to be supported either politically or through the consultation  process, is not a cost-free zone. In fact, it is a very expensive solution that  will cost up to &pound;120 million a year. In my view, it is, therefore, unrealistic  to expect that outcome. I have also said that option 5 &mdash; the Browne option,  which would increase fees to up to &pound;9,000 a year &mdash; is, for Northern Ireland students and Northern Ireland  families, an unrealistic expectation. I have not set out a preferred option. I  genuinely want people to study the consultation document and make considered  comments. However, I issue a health warning, particularly with regard to  options 1 and 5.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gardiner</strong>:  I thank the Minister for bringing his consolation &mdash; I mean, consultation &mdash;  document before the House this afternoon. Does he accept that it is essential  to Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  economic and social well-being that the Assembly and the Executive secure  sustainable funding for our first-rate universities?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I am grateful to the Member for his consolation on  the consultation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I agree with the point that the Member makes, and I think  that I indicated that in my statement. Northern Ireland&rsquo;s higher education  sector makes an essential contribution to the economy and to wider society. Our  higher education institutions are well respected and compare favourably with  their counterparts throughout the world, and I believe that their success is  critical to the performance of the local economy. Their activities support  wider initiatives to attract inward investment and create high-quality,  sustainable jobs. Therefore, it is imperative that the Assembly and the  Executive find a way to ensure sustainable and fair funding arrangements for  our universities.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Ramsey</strong>:  I welcome the commencement of the consultation on student fees. It is a hugely  challenging task, and, from the SDLP&rsquo;s perspective, we will find it difficult  to decide on a course of action other than one that keeps fees as they are.  Fees will increase significantly in England,  which will have an impact on students in Northern Ireland when they are  deciding whether to go there. Furthermore, a cap exists in Northern Ireland,  and we have the smallest higher education base per head of population in all  these islands. That will be a barrier to widening access to education for a lot  of young people because of the fear of debt and being unable to go to England and Wales. Therefore, does the Minister  not believe that it is time to relax and raise the MaSN cap? We know about the  high numbers of young people who have wanted to get into higher education over  the years, but increasing numbers across Northern Ireland will want to get  into it now. I say that to the Minister quite deliberately, knowing that, under  the CSR, he and the previous Minister, Lord Empey, tabled the MaSN cap increase  for Magee and the main campus of the University   of Ulster. Does he not  believe that it is time to relax the MaSN cap, given the high numbers of young  people who want to go into higher education and will not have access to it  unless the cap is relaxed?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I am grateful to the Member for the point that he  makes. In his unique and customary style, he brought it back to his own  constituency, and I congratulate him on the ingenious way that he manages to do  that every time.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I understand the point that the Member makes. He will know  that there is another consultation in place in the form of the higher education  strategy. It will examine the MaSN cap, which he referred to, and it will look  at the flexibility of provision and greater part-time access.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As part of the development of the higher education  strategy, we wish to explore whether, within the Budget settlement, there will  be scope to expand the level of higher education in the north-west.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. The Minister has given us an  unusually humble presentation of his views today, but is it not the case that  every molecule of his political DNA is telling him that it is politically  acceptable to have student fees and to raise those fees? If you approach an  equation with that mindset and if you are in charge of the Department at the  end of it, the outcome of the consultation will be an increase in student fees,  regardless of what the public consultation brings forward or tells the  Department over the coming weeks.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">3.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I am slightly curious about the Member&rsquo;s unique  powers to get right inside my mind. I will let him speak to my wife.<span class="Italic"> </span></p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Member for the tribute of modesty that he  afforded to me. What Danny Kennedy thinks, either as Minister or as a Member of  the Assembly, is not that crucial. However, it is crucial that we set before us  realistic options for the future funding of tuition fees and higher education.  I simply want to honestly set before the House, the political parties, the  wider public, including the many parents and students, and the leaders of our  universities how we can move forward on a Northern Ireland-based common  approach that is mature and will deal with the questions before us.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his statement. I am sure that the Minister will accept  that many thousands of families will read the statement and wonder whether  there is a secret desire to opt for option 3 hidden in it. That is certainly my  reading of it. Will the Minister confirm to the House whether he presented a  preferred option to the Executive and whether that was option 3?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I am grateful to the Member. One Member can get  inside my head, and another can read between the lines of my statement. We have  a very talented House.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am not breaking Executive confidence by stating that my  preferred position and that of my party is to maintain fees as they are.  Unfortunately, due to the budgetary settlement, that is not the position that I  find myself in, and, therefore, it would be irresponsible of me, following the  outcome of the Budget debate and the confirmed budget for my Department, to continue  to use that as a preferred option. I have not sought to do that today. I have  sought to lay out, in fair proportion, the options available to the House &mdash; or  the House as it will be in the next mandate of the Northern Ireland Assembly &mdash;  and, presumably, the next Executive. Therefore, I want people to consider the  statement on that basis and not on the basis that decisions have already been  made.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his comprehensive statement. I appreciate that he has a  difficult job in trying to balance competing demands. Even though he said that  there was little more money to be made from universities to help with funding,  can we not think about giving universities more flexibility? For example, some  degrees could be shortened from four years to three, and others from three  years to two. For community development, some universities allow students to  work throughout the summer to shorten their degree. That may help some  students.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I thank the Member for her initial comments and  her question. Her point is slightly different to that of student tuition fees.  It strikes more at the strategy, and, as I have outlined, work is under way on  the future of higher education and how it operates in Northern Ireland.  I, of course, encourage her, along with others, to contribute to the  consultation. There may be ways to achieve a better working-out of the  education systems in Northern    Ireland. The Member&rsquo;s suggestion certainly  merits some consideration, and I hope that she will take the opportunity to  submit that to the consultation.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Callaghan</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. The Minister spoke favourably  about option 3, which I think is the least that we can say. He said that that  option, which brings with it a tuition fee burden of &pound;4,500 per annum, would  largely address the financial pressures associated with the Budget settlement.  Does the Minister acknowledge the concerns of young people and their parents &mdash;  they have been expressed to me and, I am sure, to other Members over recent  weeks &mdash; that an option such as option 3 would place tremendous budgetary  pressure on them as they set out on their life journey after finishing college,  buying their first car, getting a deposit to buy their first home and starting  a family. Will he assure the House that those very real budget pressures on  young people and new families will be borne in mind when any decision is taken  in the future?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I am grateful to the Member for his question and  the point that he made. I cannot identify one single option that is  economically pain-free either for Departments and agencies connected with the  Executive or for the House or for parents and students. There is no option here  that will not involve cost. Abolition would cost any future Executive &pound;120  million per annum, which is money that they clearly do not have at the moment,  so that is not cost-free. Nor is option 5 cost-free, given that it proposes to  increase fees to up to &pound;9,000. I just do not think that parents or, indeed,  students in Northern Ireland  could afford that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The consultation document is a serious attempt to focus  minds on difficult territory. I think that together we can reach some kind of  consensus that delivers a Northern    Ireland model that is based on ability to  learn and not ability to pay, protects widening participation, keeps university  education affordable and maintains the status of universities. That is the  challenge for us all.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement. I am relieved that he, not Jonathan Bell,  is the Minister.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister outlined the high cost of abolishing fees at  &pound;120 million a year. Does he agree that the parties that propose that course of  action have a duty to tell us how they would fund that?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I agree with the Member&rsquo;s point. The challenge of  finding &pound;120 million a year would certainly be a significant one. I can think  of horses that will be flogged at Cheltenham  this week that would have a greater chance of finding that. If some individuals  or parties want to adopt that stance, we will see the detail of it. I encourage  everyone to read the consultation document, to look carefully at the options  and to respond accordingly.</p>

    <p class="Q3Motion">That the Autism Bill [NIA 2/10] do now pass.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. T&aacute; an-&aacute;thas  orm t&uacute;s a chur leis an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht seo ar an Ch&eacute;im Deiridh den Bhille  Uathais. I dt&uacute;s b&aacute;ire, ba mhaith liom moladh a thabhairt do mo  iar-chomhghleaca&iacute; Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Fiaich, a bh&iacute; ina Chomhalta Tion&oacute;il don I&uacute;r agus Ard  Mhacha. Ba &eacute; an ch&eacute;ad duine &eacute; a leag r&uacute;n faoi bhr&aacute;id an Tion&oacute;il ar an &aacute;bhar &aacute;irithe  seo sa bhliain 2002.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I pay tribute to my former colleague the late John Fee, an  SDLP MLA for Newry and Armagh, who was the  first to introduce a motion on autism in the Assembly, back in 2002. I see  today&rsquo;s debate as the culmination of the work begun by John Fee. I hope that  his two young daughters will at some stage in the future read the report of  today&rsquo;s proceedings and feel proud of their father&rsquo;s role in the progress of  the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Molloy] in the Chair)</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill as amended on 23 February 2011 and 7 March 2011  now consists of six clauses. The first clause is an amendment to schedule 1(4)  to the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (DDA) and inserts:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;(i) taking part in normal social interaction; or</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">(j) forming social relationships&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The clause was amended as recommended at Committee  Stage, as it was believed that the terms &ldquo;mental&rdquo; and &ldquo;physical&rdquo; in the DDA  were all-encompassing and any change might be restrictive rather than  expansive.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The second amendment at Consideration Stage removed the  original clause 3(5), which placed a duty on the Department to set out the  steps it proposed to take to ensure that Northern Ireland Civil Service staff  who dealt directly with the public in the course of their duties be given  autism training. I was satisfied that clause 3(4), which places a duty on the  Department to set out proposals for promoting an autism awareness campaign  would obviously contain an element of staff training. It is my contention that  the autism strategy outlined in detail in the Bill also implies an element of  staff training. In that respect, I was happy to leave a certain degree of  flexibility to the Department. I also wish to avoid unnecessary duplication in  the Bill. The level and extent of training will, therefore, be for the  Department to decide, within the parameters of the prevalence of autism in the  population of Northern    Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On 7 March 2011, at Further Consideration Stage, the  original clause 5 was removed, as it contained redundant references to Orders,  and the remaining elements of the clause were included under clause 3, as  subsections (6) and (7).</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The main clauses, clauses 2 and 3, deal with the autism  strategy, the role of the lead Department &mdash; the Department of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety &mdash; and how the other Northern Ireland  Departments relate to it. The strategy is a framework of development and allows  the lead Department a certain degree of flexibility to fulfil the requirements  of the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Other changes were, of course, made to the Bill before it  came to the House, the main one being the removal of the office of autism  commissioner.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">It was removed in light of the current financial  situation and replaced with an accountability requirement on the Department to  report to the Assembly triennially.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Health Committee, of course, has the power to call  departmental officials to give evidence on the strategy at any time. The  strategy is not age specific and, therefore, covers the lifelong health,  education and social needs of people with autism. It must also address the  needs of families and carers and promote an autism awareness programme. It  gives the Health Department the power to make regulations on the contents of  the autism strategy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In evidence to the Health Committee, some Departments said  that legislation was not needed to devise an autism strategy. If that is the  case, why has a strategy not been devised heretofore? There are the makings of  an autism strategy in the Department of Education and an action plan in the  Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, but where are the  links between those? What about the other Departments? What have they done? If  a cross-departmental autism strategy could have been established without  legislation, surely one would exist. As we know, a strategy does not exist and,  in all likelihood, would not exist in the future without the Bill. We need an  Autism Bill to make that happen.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Autism has been the Cinderella of disorders and is only now  beginning to get the recognition and response that it requires. The Bill will  give greater impetus to that response across a wider range of Departments. As  we know, Departments do not like to act as one, but the Bill challenges them to  do just that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As well as having widespread support, the Bill has its  detractors. Not least among those detractors are some Departments, which argued  that the Bill would lead to a hierarchy of disabilities. That argument was made  by the Department of Education and the Department of Health, Social Services  and Public Safety, but their own actions rebut that argument. The Department of  Education initiated a task force on autism, opened a centre of excellence for  autism and is devising a strategy for autism. The Department of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety (DHSSPS) devised an action plan on autism. It could  be argued that those actions create a hierarchy of disability, but I do not  believe that they do. The Bill is mainly about establishing a  cross-departmental strategy. It does not seek to place autism above any other  disorder or disability; it seeks only to ensure that people who have autism get  the support and services to which they are entitled. Nothing in the Bill states  anything other than that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department of Education also argued that the Bill may  conflict with SENDO (Special Educational Needs and Disability (Northern Ireland)  Order 2005). As I said, the Bill is about devising a strategy for autism, which  the Department of Education is already doing. Presumably, its strategy does not  conflict with special needs legislation. The interdepartmental strategy that  the Bill proposes will probably encompass the Department of Education&rsquo;s  strategy. Therefore, it is not true to say that the Bill conflicts with special  needs legislation. The Autism Bill&rsquo;s amendment to the Disability Discrimination  Act is intended to emphasise the inclusion of autism spectrum disorder in that  legislation by adding two autism-related daily descriptors to the existing  list. Its only effect on special needs legislation will be to help to clarify  the definition of a disabled person.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety  argued against the Bill on the grounds that it was not human rights compliant.  At Second Stage, the Minister said that he would refer the Bill to the Office  of the Attorney General and report back to the House. He has not yet done so,  and he did not speak at Consideration Stage or Further Consideration Stage. I  can conclude from that only that the Attorney General did not raise any  objections. Indeed, why should he have done so, given that the Northern Ireland  Human Rights Commission raised no such concerns in its evidence to the Health  Committee?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill provides for the establishment of a  cross-departmental strategy. No Department, I am sure, will have in its  contribution to that strategy anything that creates a hierarchy of disability  or which is not human-rights compliant. Neither of those arguments against the  Bill stand up to scrutiny, and both can be dismissed as groundless. They are  merely the dying groans from silos that have been challenged to work in  joined-up government.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In sharp contrast to the glass half-empty attitude adopted  by some Departments, the Bill has already united the autism community as never  before. The autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) voluntary sector in Northern Ireland  was created by parents in reaction to the failure of government to provide  information, training, support and services. The creation of the sector was a  response to specific needs, which sometimes compete and overlap vigorously.  Given that history, it is amazing that six out of seven ASD voluntary agencies  have declared in favour of the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mr Wells)</strong>:  The Member knows that the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public  Safety supports his Bill, but, to be fair to all concerned, I say that the  autism groups were deeply divided on the issue. There were those autism groups  that gave the Bill very strong support, those who were neither for nor against  it, and those who were bitterly opposed to it. To be absolutely accurate, it is  wrong to say that the Bill has united the autism community; it certainly has  not.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  I thank the Chairperson of the Health Committee for his contribution, but I  have with me a copy of the report on the Autism Bill, which, as you can see, Mr  Deputy Speaker, is well thumbed. I have read through the evidence carefully,  and, as I say, six out of seven of the voluntary advocacy groups for autism are  in favour of the Bill. Therefore, I contend that, to contradict the Chairperson  of the Health Committee, the Bill has not split the autism community. On the  contrary, it has largely united it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am aware that Autism Northern Ireland has successfully  lobbied with the National Autistic Society at UK level, as well as with  Parents&rsquo; Education as Autism Therapists (PEAT), adding to the existing support  from Autism Initiatives, the Centre for Early Autism Treatment (CEAT) and  Special Provision for the Education of Autistic Children (SPEAC) to achieve a  historic unity in the autism community on the legislation. I have with me some  15,000 signatures from across Northern    Ireland, all representing a voice for  equality for autism and a vote for recognition of a long-ignored and  misrepresented disorder.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The autism community should be justly proud that its  campaign for justice has garnered support and understanding from a range of  organisations such as the Human Rights Commission and the Equality Commission,  which are aware that the impact of the Bill will be to plug a gap in our  current outdated understanding of disability by providing clarity and a  position for autism in the forthcoming work of the Office of the First Minister  and deputy First Minister (OFMDFM) on compliance with the United Nations  Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The Bill will provide  firm foundations for future development year on year.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Families have learned not to expect overnight answers or  solutions. However, the Bill brings autism in from the cold. The autism  awareness campaign will increase public knowledge, understanding and tolerance  of that invisible disability. The cross-departmental requirement to collect and  share data will improve the potential to accurately project future need for  planning of services and will help to reduce duplication, and, therefore,  reduce costs. The cross-departmental strategy will minimise duplication at a  time of fiscal restraint, while improving effectiveness through shared  resources. The cross-departmental strategy will help to implement the new DDA  recognition of autism, with which all Departments will have to comply anyway.  The Bill, by implementing the new DDA recognition of autism, clarifies the  definition of disability that is being used to make decisions on entitlement to  benefits, such as disability living allowance (DLA) and employment and support  allowance (ESA).</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Autism will no longer be assessed by the measures of  another disability. By implementing the new DDA recognition of autism, the Bill  will remove the IQ score of 70 as a barrier to the gateway to services. The  Bill will remove discrimination against individuals with autism in respect of  their limited access to services.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Autism must at last be understood and addressed as a full  intellectual-range disability. For families and individuals with autism, the  Bill will bring the era of official denial to a close. Affected families pay an  emotional, physical and mental cost. That cost has been calculated and  researched and forms the basis of the lobby for this Bill. By passing the Bill,  we will shift that burden to government. It is time for government to calculate  and plan holistically and realistically for future need. The time for sticking  plaster fixes, with fragmented planning and short-term funding, is over.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly Research and Library Service document  &lsquo;Improving Services for People with Autistic Spectrum Disorder&rsquo; predicted the  need for this legislation. As it remains the only truly independent document on  the issue to date, I will conclude with an excerpt from it. &ldquo;To circumvent this  constraint&rdquo;, which is the silo mentality, legislation:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;may be a more direct method of providing departmental  buy-in for improving services&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Molaim an Bille seo. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I commend the Bill to the House.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: The Health  Committee welcomes the Final Stage of the Bill and believes that it is a much  needed step forward in supporting those who are affected by autism and ASD.  Speaking on behalf of the Committee, I recognise and commend the commitment of  those working in the voluntary sector, the health and social care sector, and  other statutory agencies that have a role in treating individuals with autism  and ASD and supporting families living with the condition.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Autistic spectrum disorder is a lifelong developmental  condition that affects those who live with it in a number of different ways.  Essentially, it affects the way in which a person communicates with and relates  to other people. The condition has a significant impact not only on  individuals, but on families and carers. Bearing that impact in mind, it is  vital that autism is addressed from a holistic perspective. In the past, autism  has been primarily considered to be a health issue, but other Departments  including those of Education, Employment and Learning, Social Development and  Justice, also have a crucial role to play. The Bill legislates for a  cross-departmental strategy on autism.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill has been significantly improved and strengthened  because of the amendments that the Health Committee persuaded its sponsor, Mr  Bradley, to make. The Committee&rsquo;s detailed scrutiny led to its recommending  that the sponsor make two amendments. I thank Mr Bradley for his co-operative  approach and for taking on board the Committee&rsquo;s recommendations. I will recap  briefly on the substance of the two amendments.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Originally, the Bill proposed to amend the definition of  disability in the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 by making reference to a  &ldquo;physical, mental or social&rdquo; communication impairment. However, when the  Committee reviewed the evidence, it became clear that the term &ldquo;physical or  mental&rdquo; impairment had intended to be all-encompassing when the DDA was  introduced, and that to change that definition of disability could narrow the  scope of people who fell within the protection of that Act. Mr Bradley  concurred with the Committee&rsquo;s views and the Bill was amended accordingly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The second amendment to the Bill related to the requirement  for autism awareness training for civil servants who deal directly with the  public. Concerns were expressed by stakeholders, including the Department of  Health and the Department of Finance, that that would have a significant cost.  Again, Mr Bradley took those concerns on board and was prepared to address the  issue by leaving that clause out of the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee notes the Final Stage of the Bill. I also  want to clarify that these comments are those of the Committee, not my personal  views.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs O&rsquo;Neill</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I declare an interest as a member  of the all-party group on autism. On behalf of Sinn F&eacute;in, I welcome the Final  Stage of the Autism Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">During the various stages of the Bill, we discussed at  length autism, its effects and definition, and the impacts and effects that it  has on those who are on the autistic spectrum and their entire families. I am  delighted that we have eventually arrived at the Bill&rsquo;s Final Stage.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Since the Bill&rsquo;s First Stage, the proposed legislation has  changed. What we are discussing today is a result of the Committee Stage and  some amendments being put forward and being taken forward by the proposer. What  we have now is an amended Bill. There were those who feared that the Bill, as  originally drafted, would have diluted the Disability Discrimination Act 1995.  We listened intently to those arguments, and I am delighted that the issue was  resolved and that the Bill was amended accordingly. There was never any intention  to weaken disability discrimination legislation. It is very important that we  send out the message loud and clear to the public that there is absolutely no  danger of the Bill having any kind of negative effect on the lives of those  with a disability.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Some concerns were also raised around special educational  needs provision and any impact that the Bill might have on that legislation.  Special educational needs provision meets the needs of the child; it does not  meet a definition. Therefore, we are absolutely sure that we are in no danger  of having any kind of negative impact on special educational needs legislation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">What we have now is a Bill that creates a legislative  framework to provide a cross-departmental strategy. What we have ongoing in the  various Departments at present, especially around health, is the RASDN, which  is the regional autistic spectrum disorder network. I commend that good work  that is already going on and also the development of a strategy that has been  started in the Department of Education. However, we also want to encompass the  impact of the work that is done in the Department for Social Development (DSD)  and the Department for Employment and Learning (DEL). The Bill merely creates a  legislative framework that allows all of that work to be done under one  umbrella and allows a very positive, much-needed cross-departmental approach  for all those who live with autism and who are on the autistic spectrum.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I commend all the autism charities for their work and for  their input into the Bill. I particularly put on record my thanks to Cecilia  and Anne from the mid-Ulster branch, who made sure that I was kept abreast of  all developments. I also put on record my appreciation to Arlene Cassidy of  Autism NI. She is recovering from surgery, but I see that she has hobbled along  and has made it here to the Gallery for the Bill&rsquo;s Final Stage.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, it is a good day for those who are on the  autistic spectrum. It is a good day because the Assembly has sent out a clear  message that we are interested in improving the lives of all those who live  with a disability. The work does not finish here. We are at the Final Stage of  the Bill today, but there is much work to be done in developing a strategy. We  will have to get into more detail around what is in the strategy. We have that  to look forward to in the term of the next Assembly. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  My concerns, and those of the Ulster Unionist Party, about the legislation are  well documented in various debates and throughout the Committee Stage. It is  important to stress that whatever side various people have taken over this  Bill, I am in no doubt about the commitment of everyone in the House to doing  their very best for children, families and adults with autism. It is important  to get that message out. There is a commitment from the Health Department, the  current Health Minister, the Minister for Social Development and the Minister  of Education to do what has been lacking for some time and start to work with  people like Lord Maginnis and his group to see what can be put in place and  what action plan can be implemented. It is important that there is a real  commitment to face up to this subject and the debate. It looks likely that the  House will pass the Bill. Without getting into the debate on that, there is a  commitment in the House to do our very best for people and families who are on  the spectrum. That is an important message to send out.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I certainly agree with Mr Wells&rsquo;s intervention, not as the  Chairperson of the Committee but as a Member for South Down. When we took  evidence in Committee, there were very clear divisions among autism groups  about the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I certainly think that, when the Bill is passed &mdash;  hopefully, in a number of minutes&rsquo; time &mdash; there will be a duty to make sure that  Mr Bradley and those who support him in Autism NI and PAL do all that they can  to heal some of those divisions in the autism community and to ensure that the  focus is on making this legislation work to meet everyone&rsquo;s needs.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  I thank the Member for giving way. He referred to certain divisions in the  autism community. There may be divisions within that community, as there are in  many communities. Does the Member not accept that those divisions existed  before the Bill was even drafted?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I accept that, yes, there are divisions when it comes to how to move forward.  However, the point that I make to Mr Bradley is that it is more important to  realise that many of those divisions were even more starkly highlighted during  the debate about the Bill. Now that the legislation looks certain to pass,  there is a duty to try to move past that and to move such issues forward in a  way that brings some of those groups in. We must work with everyone in the  autism community to make the legislation effective and to help people to feel  that they all have a part to play in it, so that the Bill lives up to the  expectations on which it was perhaps sold to some people.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My reservations about the Bill and those of my party are  well documented. However, to get a private Member&rsquo;s Bill passed by the Assembly  is a difficult business. I congratulate Mr Bradley for guiding his Bill to  Final Stage. To Autism NI and PAL, I say thank you.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  I welcome the Final Stage of the Autism Bill. As we come to the end of this  mandate, let no one say that the Northern Ireland Assembly is useless, just a  talking shop or an expensive luxury that sits on the hill at Ballymiscaw,  Stormont. Today, that myth has been exposed. Today, we will agree legislation  in Northern Ireland  that will improve the lives of everyone, young and old, who has been diagnosed  with autism. We have come a long way along a sometimes tortuous road to get to  this Final Stage.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I and other Members have served on the all-party Assembly  group on autism and worked with various voluntary autism groups with the aim of  making the lives of people with autism better, as of right. We give our 100%  support to families who care for people with autism. I have said previously  that it is unfortunate that Northern    Ireland is experiencing an increase in the  incidence of autism among youngsters who will grow to become adults and  seniors. The Assembly must accept what is happening and make the necessary  arrangements to ensure that everyone with autism has exactly the same rights  and expectations as everyone else.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Unfortunately, more often than not, people with autism and  their parents or guardians have to fight for everything when it comes to  healthcare, education, social development and so on. Why should that be? Like  the rest of us, people with autism have normal everyday needs and ambitions. We  need the Autism Bill so that there is a statutory requirement that everyone  will receive their entitlement. It is outrageous that, at present, parents and  guardians who have to do so much caring and watching must spend much of their  valuable time getting what should be theirs as of right.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As was said, evidence presented in the all-party Assembly  group on autism briefing paper overwhelmingly favoured progressing the Bill. As  was also said, a petition of support signed by thousands of campaigners was  presented to all political parties in Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Indeed, the Northern Ireland Local Government Association  (NILGA), and, as far as I am aware, all 26 councils, supported positive motions  in favour of an Autism Bill. Most of the political parties signed up to support  the Bill, and we are all grateful for that. Many families at the coalface of  the autism spectrum also supported the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank all members of the all-party group on autism, and I  pay tribute to our chairperson, Dominic Bradley, for his determination and hard  work, particularly that which he did with Arlene Cassidy and the staff of  Autism NI, in getting us to Final Stage. Although there is real work ahead,  this is a vital first step. Families will need to know their rights under the  law and the real impact that that will have.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The battle for the Bill was not won easily or overnight. It  succeeded, despite massive ignorance and a reluctance to recognise the major  problems for people with autism. The work to activate the potential for the new  law will be just as vital, and I have no doubt that Autism Northern Ireland and  others will once more be at the forefront of ensuring that people in Northern Ireland  with autism, as well as their families, no longer get second-rate  consideration.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, all concerned are to be congratulated for  their dedicated work in bringing this vital new legislation to Northern Ireland  through the Assembly. I certainly support and welcome the Final Stage of the  Autism Bill.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Givan</strong>: On  behalf of the DUP, I welcome the Final Stage of the Autism Bill, and I commend  the Member for Newry and Mourne for the work that he has done to take us to  this point. I am particularly pleased that my party has been able to support  him in bringing the Bill to Final Stage. I also thank my party leader, Peter  Robinson, who took an enthusiastic interest in ensuring that the legislation  went through the Assembly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When I replaced Jeffrey Donaldson, my maiden speech to the  House contained the commitment that one of my main priorities would be to  support those in our society who are disadvantaged, particularly those with a  learning disability. Therefore, I have a particular sense of pride that the  Assembly will be able to vote through this piece of legislation. Other Members  indicated that the legislation will draw together a cross-departmental strategy  to ensure that all Departments tackle the issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I previously gave the House one example from my experience.  That example was the I CAN centre in Ballynahinch, which dealt with young  people with speech and language difficulties. The unit was established and  funded jointly by the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety  and the Department of Education. That excellent facility ensured that both  Departments worked collectively and in a co-ordinated fashion to address an  issue for young people who had difficulties communicating with other people.  Sadly, the funding did not continue, so the unit had to close. That was  particularly regrettable and should not have happened. Had there been  legislation relating to speech and learning difficulties such as that that we  are now putting through for autism, I believe that the unit would not have  closed. When I met the commissioners from the South Eastern Education and  Library Board, parents came along and made a very cogent and emotional case as  to why the existing expertise in the unit meant that it should be retained. However,  funding was not found to do that. I know that the Health Minister was keen to  ensure that his Department&rsquo;s funding would continue, and it was wrong that the  facility had to close.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That unit is an example of how funding should be organised  on a cross-departmental basis and of how, having initially established  something that was very good and then not sustaining it, government should  learn from experience.<span class="SectionMarker"><span style="font-size:14.0pt; "> </span></span></p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">For those who have autism, this legislation will go  towards developing a strategy that will ensure that all the relevant  Departments work together properly and help those who suffer from it.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that, in dealing with autism and other  difficulties experienced by young people, early intervention and identification  are always key. It is vital that the health professionals fully understand  that. I recognise that it is a complex issue. I am certainly not a medical  expert, and I could not be an authoritative guide on this issue. However,  families have indicated to me that, at times, they feel that health  professionals do not fully understand this very complex issue. At times, some  interventions have not been appropriate and have caused harm rather than  helped. It is vital that that support is put in place for those working not  just in health but in education, so that they can identify this issue early on  and make appropriate interventions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That said, I want to commend those in the autism community  who have taken this forward. They can take immense pride in having the Assembly  pass this legislation. In my area, I thank the Lisburn branch of Autism NI,  which has kept me informed of progress. I have received numerous letters about  this. Indeed, when I have been out on the doorsteps, people have raised this  issue with me, asked for my views and asked how I would vote on it. It is an  issue that they have definitely brought to the public&rsquo;s attention, and we as  political representatives have responded well to that. I commend the Autism  Bill to the House, and my party will give it full support.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Let me begin by apologising for missing  the last couple of minutes of the debate. I was giving an interview on student  fees.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Today is truly a historic day in the Assembly. Members must  recognise the part that not only parents but professionals have played in  getting the Bill to this point. It has been a battle. Political leaders over  the past 10 years of the Assembly have said that there will be a battle a day  up here. They did not necessarily mean that in the political context. It takes  a battle a day to change the mindsets of some of the officials who have been  involved in the Departments. We should give special mention to parents and  those involved in the sector. They have beavered and battled away and sometimes  come up against more closed doors than they expected. Special mention needs to  go to those in the Public Gallery who did that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">During my time in public office, I sat on Lisburn Borough  Council for two terms. I came across a number of parents whose children had  autism. They asked for no special treatment, only to be treated with respect  and equality. They asked to be recognised within the health and education  sectors, DSD, play and leisure, but they only asked for that treatment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We need to recognise the work of the all-party group on  autism, which Dominic Bradley chairs, in getting us to this point. There have  been ups and downs. I sit on the Health Committee, which scrutinised the Bill.  The maturity shown by the people involved not just in the Health Committee but  in the all-party group, including Dominic, and in the work on this Bill has  been second to none. We knew that, at certain points, there was a possibility  of the House dividing on the Bill, and we came through that. I appreciate that  some people still have difficulties with the legislation but will not push it  or force a Division. That needs to be recognised, too.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">All Departments have a role and a responsibility in this  type of work, some more so than others. However, the message that parents and  children want to hear is that all Departments are taking the issue seriously.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Michelle O&rsquo;Neill mentioned to me before I was due to speak  that, although we have now got to this point and not to put a damper on it, the  work starts today. We have seen how easy it is to put legislation, strategies  or commitments under a pile of paperwork. So, although we all commit to  ensuring equal recognition for people who suffer from autism &mdash; whether from a  young age or for those aged 16 to 19, 19 to 25 or older &mdash; we need to ensure  that we keep an eye on this. We cannot leave here today and assume that  somebody else will lift it and move on. The Assembly and individual Members in  it can give that commitment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When we mention individuals by name, we sometimes forget  other people. So, while I commend the whole group involved in this, it is  important to give special mention to Anne Marie, who has probably tortured me  and Jennifer McCann more than anyone. One thing I like about being a political  representative is that, in general, people in our community and our  constituency are not shy in coming forward. I am not saying that they are rude  or ignorant, but they stop me in the street and approach me when I am doing my  groceries and so on. Anne Marie is one of those people &mdash; she tortures you. She  ensured that autism was the first thing on our mind morning, noon and night.  Jennifer will probably say the same thing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Other people have played their part too, and Sharon has  tortured me on the social networking site. Fair play to her; she has probably  tortured other people here too. Eileen Bell, in her former life as a political  representative in this place, needs a special mention too. On top of that,  Arlene, David and others should be mentioned because they ensured that autism  was taken from people&rsquo;s front rooms and brought into the political arena. We  need to ensure that, now that it is in the political arena, we make a change in  people&rsquo;s front rooms. So, those are the good things.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I commend all the work that has been done. We need to  ensure that the Departments have a joined-up and cross-departmental approach to  autism, and, as I said, we should leave here today with a commitment to now  take that ball and run with it and ensure that autism cuts across all  strategies in all Departments. In ending, I will repeat: today is a truly  historic day for families and children out there in the autism world.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  As I have said before, I am an unapologetic supporter of the Autism Bill. Words  cannot express my delight in seeing the Bill reach Final Stage today. I welcome  the fact that no one has stated that there will be a Division. That is a good  thing. As the previous Member who spoke said, although some Members have  reservations, there will be agreement across the House that the Bill is a good  thing, and I look forward to it coming into play.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have worked for some time with the autism group in my  constituency, and you, Mr Deputy Speaker, will be more than aware of the  ability of members of that group. I do not like to name people, but Cecilia  O&rsquo;Hagan has been very good at her job of lobbying and ensuring &mdash; through text  messages, e-mails, direct phone calls or, indeed, when you meet her and others  in the street &mdash; that the representatives of Mid Ulster are more than aware and  are fully supportive of every stage of the Bill. It is good that that is  happening.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We all have a personal interest in certain issues in the  House. However, anyone who has met or knows anyone who suffers from autism or  ASD will know only too well that they have every right to get to this stage and  to have a Bill in their name. I recall, not long after I was elected to the  House, standing in the Long Gallery when the then First Minister, Dr Paisley,  spoke to the Members present about the need for an Autism Bill. He hoped that  such a Bill would be passed by the end of this mandate, and it is good that  that will become a reality.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At the Bill&rsquo;s various stages, a lot of issues were  rehearsed by people who supported it and people who did not support it on what  they saw as its good and bad aspects. I do not wish to make a personal attack,  but, in that vein, some comments were made by people who have been put in the  position of representing autism on the regional autistic spectrum disorder  network that gave many people concerns. Lord Maginnis made wrongful personal  comments about people who support and are involved with Autism NI; those  comments should be withdrawn and an apology given. I know from my dealings with  anyone who is in Autism NI or, indeed, PAL that they acted with honour and  showed 100% support for the need for an Autism Bill and for the needs of people  who suffer from autism. I make no apology for comments that I have made about  Lord Maginnis, and I ask him to withdraw his comments about some of the members  of those groups.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I do not wish to rehearse a lot of what has been said. This  is a good day for autism, and I am proud. I will not go as far as Mr McCarthy  in praising all the good work of the Assembly, but a lot of good work has been  done. I believe 100% that this is a very good day for autism, and I support the  Bill.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Ramsey</strong>:  Along with other Members, I am delighted and honoured to stand here to support  the Final Stage and the passing of the Autism Bill. I welcome the fact that  some of the families are present for the debate. As Kieran McCarthy rightly  said, they want to see the benefit of the legislation in the big house that is  Parliament Buildings. I pay particular tribute to all those families for their  resilience, patience and determination in seeing this through over many  decades. They include men and mothers whose children have now become adults. I  also pay particular tribute to my colleague Dominic Bradley for his  determination alongside the all-party group on autism, which other Members  mentioned.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill is immensely important and is now at Final Stage.  As Sue Ramsey rightly said, this is one historic day for so many families,  carers and parents across Northern Ireland. Thank God, we are at this stage for  them. I am so delighted at all Dominic Bradley&rsquo;s hard work, and he should be  very proud of his achievement in getting the Bill to this stage. John McCallister  got his Caravans Bill through, and that was the first private Member&rsquo;s Bill to  be passed since around the 1940s. Dominic Bradley will be the first SDLP Member  ever to have delivered a private Member&rsquo;s Bill. Well done to him.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  I agree 100% with the Member, but he will know that behind every good man is a  good woman. Will the Member agree that, behind Mr Bradley as chairman of the  all-party group on autism, he has had a number of good colleagues who have  given him the support that he has needed?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Ramsey</strong>:  I concur with that. I did mention Dominic Bradley and the all-party group on  autism, and everyone has mentioned that group. There is no doubt that consensus  was reached.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As John McCallister said, there was some resistance from  the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety. Thank God that we  wore it down, at the very least. It is very disappointing that the Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety is not in the Chamber. He has not  been present during any of the legislative stages. I want to place on record my  disappointment.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill is long overdue. We will now see the equality that  so many people have sought for their loved ones enshrined in law. The long  battle against complacency, lack of services and answers will soon be over. The  often complex needs of autistic members of the community will be addressed in a  way that should always have been the very least that the system provided. As  other Members have said, a cross-departmental, universal approach has to be  taken in the system to ensure that provisions are targeted on where they are  badly needed on the ground.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Let me make it clear: the Bill is not the end, nor the  beginning, nor even the beginning of the end of the fight to ensure that more  vulnerable people are provided for in a way of which our entire society can be  proud. I have sought to champion that during my entire political life. I will  continue to do so if re-elected to the Assembly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to refer, as other Members have done, to Autism Northern  Ireland. That organisation does amazing work with all members of society who  are on the autistic spectrum. It has provided and, I am sure, will continue to  provide invaluable support to families and carers. It has been a driving force  behind the Bill. In particular, I wish to name its chairperson, David Heatley,  and Arlene Cassidy, whom other Members have mentioned. She is recovering at  present. I hope that her health continues to improve. My office staff have met  David on a number of occasions. I am sure that the families who are present  will agree that his guidance, advice and enthusiasm have helped to grease the  wheels of a sometimes arduous legislative process.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">People from throughout Northern Ireland are present in the  Public Gallery. They are most welcome. Many more would have been present. The  reason why they are not here is that they are carers in their own right and  have to look after their children and, sometimes, adults. If it were not for  those challenges, many more people from my constituency in Derry would have  been present. I thank the parents in Derry who came to my office, went through  the Bill with me and made sure that I understood the complexity not only of the  Bill but of trying to bring up a child with autism and the awfulness of trying  to get through the system to ensure that that child gets effective early years  treatment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In particular, I want to mention Maire O&rsquo;Kane from Derry,  who contacted me today. She has always encouraged me to step up to the plate  for autism in Derry. I want to thank her. She is extremely disappointed that  she cannot be here. I am sure that she is watching the debate live.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that, in coming months, Autism Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  expertise and network of families will be at the forefront in assisting with  the creation of the autism strategy. I know that that is the wish of many  families here and throughout the region. It is the wish of many Members who  have already contributed to the debate. It will be the responsibility of the  Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, whoever he or she may be  in the new mandate, to deliver that strategy and to ensure that parents are  properly consulted on it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Given the fiscal position on which the Executive go  forward, it is also important to state that the Bill&rsquo;s provisions should be a  high priority for all relevant Departments. Should the Assembly pass the Bill,  Ministers and Departments cannot shirk their responsibilities simply by saying  that money is the issue. We cannot and will not tolerate that. The aspirations  of families who have waited for the Bill to be passed must be at the forefront  of the considerations of those in the Civil Service who will help to create and  implement an autism strategy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As regards the Bill&rsquo;s content, it is vital that clause  3(5), which states that</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The Department may make regulations as regards the  content of the autism strategy&rdquo;,</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">be taken on board by the Department in the spirit  of the Bill and that the Department ensure that the torch handed to it by  families is not taken in bad faith. I trust that officials in the Department  will recognise the gravity of this issue and will fulfil their role in a  professional and timely manner.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It has been a privilege to be involved in this process,  albeit on the fringes, and to provide encouragement to Dominic when there were  difficulties. The aspirations of families the length and breadth of this region  will, I hope, be met by the implementation of this Bill across many  Departments.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, I understand that across Northern Ireland there  are 30,000 people who have autism, but many of them do not get the support that  they should. Hopefully, they will now get the support and provision that they  need. This means that children and adults with autism will be able to reach  their full potential. Again, early years intervention is so important. The  proposals in what will be known, for ever and amen, as the Bradley Bill will  remove the many important barriers and obstacles that exclude people with  autism from services and provisions. The Bradley Bill will afford many autism  sufferers, their families and carers the proper cross-departmental services  that they have been denied for so long. The Bill will be a major step forward  for people with autism, who have long suffered a service deficit in Northern  Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Other Members have alluded to this, but people come to my  constituency office seeking help and guidance. They want to know who they  should talk to or who they should ring in the Health Department or the  Education Department to get answers to their many queries. I have met so many  families and carers who have been absolutely burnt out as a result of years and  decades of caring for children and who suffer from stress and mental  difficulties themselves due to the ongoing pressure. I am delighted to finish  by saying that this Bill is so important for so many people across Northern  Ireland, and I am delighted that an SDLP Member is behind it.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>: I  support the Bill and welcome its Final Stage. I reiterate what my party  colleague said about my party&rsquo;s full support for this Bill as well as  expressing my personal support for it. This Bill has been a long time coming,  and I thank all those who lobbied on its behalf, especially the all-party  autism group in the Assembly. I also thank Dominic Bradley for introducing this  private Member&rsquo;s Bill. That is no mean feat. Well done to you, and I do not say  that lightly, especially to the SDLP.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That wee issue aside, I thank Autism Northern Ireland, in  particular David Heatley, who is a member of a model railway club in north  Down, so he is not too far away from me. He is also a big fan of Facebook; he  seems to be on it more than I am, and that is saying something. I also thank  Arlene Cassidy for her support and advice and Eileen Bell, who is a constituent  of mine and makes that fact well known.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Of all the legislation that the Assembly has passed, this  Bill means most to me. It is the one that I will probably remember best from  the past four years, and I hope that I have helped to play a small part in  moving it forward. If anyone still has doubts about the Autism Bill, it may be  worth refreshing a few Members&rsquo; memories about some of the issues. Between  5,000 and 10,000 schoolchildren across Northern Ireland have autism. Some  30,000 adults and children have autism, and, every year in Northern Ireland,  300 children are born who will be diagnosed with ASD. The number of children  with ASD has increased by 500% in the past seven years, and that is staggering.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Autism is not a rare disability; it is the fastest growing  developmental disability. The number of individuals with autism now exceeds the  combined number of those with Down&rsquo;s syndrome, Parkinson&rsquo;s disease and multiple  sclerosis. The prevalence rate that I mentioned reflects the previously  accepted rate of 1:100, but the rate is now 1:50. If you have ASD and an IQ of  70, as an adult you are not entitled to any services.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Autism affects four times more males than females.  Approximately 25% of people with ASD have a learning disability, and  approximately 75% of people with ASD fall outside the DHSSPS programme of care  model. Individuals with autism find transitions particularly distressing. Some  50% of parents with autistic children are on long-term medication; 65% report  illnesses linked to caring; 80% of families report feeling overwhelmed and  helpless; and 57% report acute anxiety and panic attacks. Furthermore, 90% of  parents experience sleep difficulties, exhaustion and fatigue as a result of  trying to deal with the issue; 70% of parents report feeling isolated in their  home; and 85% report a lack of understanding from the community. Mothers of  children with ASD show higher levels of stress than mothers of children with  other disabilities.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Some 75% of adults with autism rely on their family for  financial support, and 13% of adults with autism live independently. Ninety per  cent of the public do not know how common autism is. Although 87% of the public  have heard of autism, only 40% have heard of Asperger&rsquo;s syndrome. Sixty-two per  cent of the public interviewed believe that people with autism have special  abilities, such as in maths and art. If those are not reasons for an Autism  Bill, I do not know what is.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Autism is not a physical or mental condition, as reflected  by the amendment that the Bill makes to the Disability Discrimination Act,  which, at present, does not cover those suffering from autism. The Bill will  amend the definition of disability in the DDA to include social communication,  which includes the inability to take part in normal social interaction or form  social relationships.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The second aspect of the Bill requires the Department of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety to publish an autism strategy within  two years of the passing of the Bill. It also requires all Departments to have  strategies in place. That will force Departments to work together, which is  something that is sadly lacking at the moment. In fact, it is one of the main  reasons why I supported the Bill. To date, parents and sufferers have been sold  a weak and incoherent strategy that has not put those in the sector in control  of their future. They have been dictated to, not assisted. In my view, the  Autism Bill, as I repeatedly told Mr Bradley, does not go far enough. However,  it is a useful tool that will, hopefully, develop over time. I, therefore,  welcome that aspect of the Bill, commend it to the House and hope that it can  be progressed further in future.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Girvan</strong>:  The Bill has my personal support and that of my party. At the outset, I put on  record a word of thanks to Dominic Bradley for introducing his private Member&rsquo;s  Bill. I appreciate that the Bill came about through lobbying from support groups  associated with autism. They must be congratulated on the way in which they  pursued their goal, the reason for which is obvious: as the condition was not  being recognised, they had identified a definite need.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I appreciate that the Department of Health, Social Services  and Public Safety has a strategy to deal with autism, but it is not  cross-departmental. That is part of the issue that had to be addressed. We need  to go forward. It is good that, this afternoon, there is a sense of unanimity  in the Chamber as we deal with a trying condition with which some families and  carers have to live. The only way forward was the pursuance of the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I was not present at every evidence session, as I joined  the Health Committee relatively late in the day. During those sessions, there  was evidence of reluctance on the part of the Department of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety to go down this route. It was imperative that the  Committee viewed the issue objectively rather than looking at it in isolation.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>:  Does the Member agree that the Health Department tried every trick in the book  to scupper the Bill?<span class="SectionMarker"><span style="font-size:14.0pt; "> </span></span></p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">5.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Girvan</strong>: I  agree. All sorts of human rights legislation aspects were thrown up, which were  probably going to be in relation to the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, as  obstacles to the Bill progressing to the next stage. I am happy that Mr Bradley  and the support groups were willing to accept amendments to allow the Bill to  progress. Rather than create division, it was important to get that forward.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are other aspects that we need to consider, such as  how the Bill will affect other Departments. I appreciate that the Department of  Education works with children with autism and has put together programmes to  deal with the issue. The Bill will only strengthen the support given to  families that are affected.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I support the Bill, although I had a very small part to  play in it. Many people whom I met in my time as an elected representative and  councillor, and in my work for Dr McCrea, told me what they have to live with  from a family point of view. They have been neglected because some Departments  do not wish to recognise them. Now that we have the autism spectrum and all the  conditions associated with it, they will have some protection under the law to  ensure that they get care and provision.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Reference was made to the costs associated with the Bill;  however, according to the explanatory and financial memorandum, costs are  minimal. There will be training, but only some. It does not mean that every civil  servant will have to be trained in how to deal with those with autism. People  with autism speak of their frustration when accessing benefits only to find  that those they are dealing with do not seem to want to recognise autism as a  problem. That must end. There must be advocates able to deal with problems in  those areas.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">This has been a momentous day for the Northern Ireland  Assembly. It has brought forward a piece of legislation that will help many  families in this Province. I support the Bill and put on record my thanks to  Dominic Bradley for introducing it.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Callaghan</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. As an Irish-language teacher, Mr  Bradley will be aware of the terse maxim: t&uacute;s maith leath na hoibre &mdash; a good  start is half the work. That comes to my mind today in relation to the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Ba mhaith liom mo chomhghairdeas a dh&eacute;anamh le Dominic &Oacute;  Brollach&aacute;in agus le gach aon duine a ghlac p&aacute;irt i gc&uacute;rsa&iacute; an Bhille.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I congratulate Dominic, the all-party autism group, the  people from Autism NI &mdash; including Arlene, David and their colleagues &mdash; and the  families and individuals around the North who have played a role in advocating  this change in our law towards the Bradley Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill comprises two main legislative parts. The first is  the broadening of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 to give more people  more assurance of protection in our anti-discrimination law; and, secondly, to  deliver better co-ordination of services for people on the autistic spectrum  through the statutory duty on Departments to co-operate and co-ordinate in  devising and rolling out a strategy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I would not often imagine myself quoting this individual in  support of something that I was arguing for, but, in a previous debate, Lord  Morrow talked about the need for more Ministers to have their heads knocked  together so that they would work together. If he did not use that exact  expression, he used words to that effect. We need more examples in the House of  legislators and the community working together to deliver more joined-up  outcomes, and the Bill is exactly that sort of example.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On a number of occasions, the phrase &ldquo;hierarchy of  disability&rdquo; was bandied about in the Chamber, and, more particularly, in  Committee, where witnesses who were mainly from those Departments with primary  responsibility for dealing with people with autism used that phrase. I became a  Member of the House and member of the Committee for Health, Social Services and  Public Safety in November, and the one thing that has struck me, especially  about this debate, is that I have never seen any evidence or heard any  testimony to back up that assertion. Indeed, when people were challenged to  substantiate that claim, they failed to produce any substantive evidence. Not  only was it not proven but we had the ruse of people running to the Attorney  General in an attempt to deflect or scupper the Bill and its objectives. Most,  if not all, Members are pleased that that came to naught.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I cannot comprehend how realising the rights of a certain  group of disabled people in our community would create a hierarchy of  disability, and I think that most Members share that view. As Mr Bradley  pointed out at the top of the debate, Departments have recognised that people  with autism have particular and bespoke needs that must be addressed through  tailored governmental actions. We saw that through the various task forces that  have been created over the years, the various strategies that have been rolled  out and the different centres that have been developed and all the rest.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When I reflect on some of the things that I heard during  the deliberations on the Bill, not least in the Committee, I realise that there  is a more worrying point. The disability law in this part of the island is  based on the understanding that not all disabled people are the same. They need  different protection in our law. That protection is dependent on their  particular requirements and circumstances, and the whole legal principle of  reasonable accommodation in the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 is founded  on that understanding. When I think back to some of the testimony that was  provided to the Health Committee, it strikes me as a little worrying that  Committee members were lectured by civil servants about the creation of a  hierarchy of disability. That is especially the case, given that those civil  servants are responsible for upholding that law in its various guises. It seems  to me that the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety and  other Departments do not have proper institutional cognisance of what our  disability law is about. If nothing else, I hope that the debates on the Bill  in the Chamber and elsewhere will help to reinforce some of the principles that  may have been forgotten or set to one side in the mindsets of some of our  Departments. To that extent, I hope that we have brought a little bit of sense  to sensory services here by providing an opportunity for better co-ordination  and more joined-up thinking.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As Mr Bradley also pointed out at the start of the debate,  the Bill will provide for the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 to be broader  in its application here. Instead of creating a hierarchy, we will get rid of  hurdles that are in the way of protection for those who need it. Therefore, we  will remove barriers to better services.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">From the point of view of the public purse, and from the  point of view of the Assembly, which is charged with getting better value from  how we spend the public pound, the Bill will deliver better and more joined-up  services, which should result in better value for money for the House,  government and the taxpayer, as well as providing a more appropriate spectrum  of services for people on the ASD range.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">With regard to the Civil Service again, something that  strikes me when we talk about hierarchies of disability is that in some ways  this Bill should never have had to come before the House. Since 1998 we have  had a law, section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998, that charges  Departments with a statutory duty to promote equality of opportunity for people  with disabilities. If the various Departments, not just the Department of  Health, had really stepped up to the mark in terms of the challenge laid down  by that duty, people would not have felt the need to lobby for better and more  appropriate services. Nor would they have felt that they were treated as though  they were the first family that ever had an autistic child.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The story that I have had relayed to me over and over is  that many families felt that they were waiting for a service to reinvent the  wheel, as though no other child had ever had autism and no other parents or  parent had ever had the stresses and strains that they had been through. Maybe  all Ministers should reflect on the point about section 75. However, credit to  Dominic and his colleagues on the group for stepping up to the challenge and  filling that void in our law.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Obviously, not every Member is on the Health Committee, so  they did not hear all the arguments and testimony put forward to us. One thing  that struck me, particularly as a new Member, was the institutional resistance,  particularly from the Department of Health but also from other Departments. The  Department of Education was not very far behind it in wanting the Bill to go  off the rails. Never have I seen so many grown men and women so terrified of  three pages of legislation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is a bigger lesson here for the House, where it goes  and how it interacts with the Civil Service in this region. I hope that civil  servants, not just those who came before the Health Committee but other civil  servants who appear before other Committees, draw some lessons from this  experience. I hope that they consider more carefully what they say to a  Committee, ponder more fully and comprehensively the position that a Department  adopts, and bear more in mind the views and opinions of people out on the  streets and roads of the North.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I also hope that they come to Committees with better  arguments than some of those that were brought before us, stand up a little  better to scrutiny and challenge, and stay engaged once they give their  evidence. That goes right up the line to ministerial level. I concur with my  colleague Mr Ramsey that it is disappointing that the Minister of Health has  not seen fit to be here for the Final Stage. If he is not the Minister of  Health after the election, I very much hope that his successor sends out a firm  message early on that he or she wants his or her officials to engage robustly  and fully to fulfil the promise that the Bill holds for the strategy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My experience of the testimony of public servants with  regard to the Bill, and some of the written evidence presented, is that if they  put in half the effort in implementing the Bill and the strategy that emanates  from it as they did in conjuring up arguments against it then the people in the  Public Gallery, those at home fortunate enough to watch the debate on the  Internet or by some other means, and those who do not have that dubious  privilege, will be well served by that capacity and energy being deployed in  that way.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I concur with some of what was said by Members on the  opposite Benches. In some ways, I would go as far as to say that, for autism  services, today is the end of direct rule in this region. We said that we were  going to do things differently and have devolution make a difference. The days  when civil servants could provide a briefing to a Minister who flew in and out  of here in a helicopter and perhaps did not have an awful lot of time or  inclination to read up on the particular interests of people here are now over.  People need to get accustomed to that new reality.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">5.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It has been a very long road. After my short time on that  journey, I express gratitude to and admiration for my colleagues on the Health  Committee, who approached their task with diligence and determination. The Bill  is one example of the naysayers who claim that nothing good can come from this  place being proved wrong. We can work together and come up with good solutions  when we set our minds to that task. T&aacute; m&eacute; f&iacute;or-bhu&iacute;och mo thaca&iacute;ocht a  thabhairt don Bhille seo, agus do Dominic, ina Ch&eacute;im Deiridh sa Tion&oacute;l inniu.  Today is a day for celebration. Autism is no longer the Cinderella of the  disability sector, and, tonight, it can go to the ball.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Robinson</strong>:  I apologise for not being in the House for the beginning of the debate. I give  my full support to the Autism Bill, and I am delighted to see it finally coming  to fruition in the Assembly. I give my full support to the Committee and the  sponsor of the Bill for their diligence and hard work in getting it to its  Final Stage. I say a sincere &ldquo;well done&rdquo; to all involved, and I mean &ldquo;well  done&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Autism affects the way in which a person communicates with  and relates to other people, and it is, I stress, a lifelong condition. It is a  serious condition that has a significant impact not only on individuals but on  their families and carers. It is therefore important that all of us in the Assembly  give the Bill the support that it so richly deserves on behalf of all the  sufferers.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The central and most important element that I fully support  is the strategy to address autism. That is long overdue and will hopefully  ensure that every individual sufferer gets the help the help that they so  richly deserve. I also welcome that the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 will  be clarified to resolve any vagueness as to whether the term &ldquo;disability&rdquo;  applies to autistic spectrum conditions. Those two points will result in real  and significant changes for the better for sufferers and their families.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Autism is a rapidly increasing neuro-developmental  disability in modern society. The Assembly already knows that neurology  services have been cut, so it was important that we ensured that autism got a  fair deal in funding. I acknowledge that this is a difficult economic climate  for all Departments but, with the Autism Bill, we are giving some of the most  vulnerable in society proper protection and ensuring that there is a credible  strategy to get each individual whatever help they richly deserve. That must be  a welcome and positive change.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I accept that the Bill has not been unanimously welcomed  across the board, as was mentioned by some of my colleagues, but I welcome the  fact that moves are being made to address the distressing condition. Those are  the reasons why I fully support this very worthwhile and much needed Bill.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  As citizens, people need to feel connected to this place. They need to know  that we, as elected representatives, are listening and responding to their  needs. This Bill is proof of that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I congratulate my colleague Dominic Bradley and the  all-party Assembly group on autism on bringing the Bill to this stage. They  could not have done so without the advocates and the assistance of the wider  autism family and their supporters. I was a former member of the Committee for  Health, Social Services and Public Safety and had the opportunity to meet and  listen to many of those individuals and groups as they raised their concerns  and challenged us as elected representatives to create legislation and a  framework for the care and treatment of people who suffer from autism.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am sure that some Members will recall the film &lsquo;Rain  Man&rsquo;. It was only after the release of that film that many people learnt about  autism. I am sure that many Members here this afternoon are, like me, inundated  with families and carers of children and young people with autism as they  struggle against the establishment and the system. Although I acknowledge the  role that many fathers have in championing and working for their children and  young people, the caregivers are, predominantly, the mothers. They fight like  lionesses for the protection, improvement and well-being of their young. I  commend them all, and I hope that the legislation will go a long way towards  easing their struggle as they seek out a better future for those for whom they  care.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>:  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. You will be pleased to hear that I am the last  Member to speak on the subject. We are getting closer and closer to the Bill  becoming law.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to speak not only about the Autism Bill but about  those who suffer from autism and how important this day is for them. Although  we can all promote our own self-importance as regards the issue, the Bill  brings much-needed recognition for parents and, more importantly, to those who  suffer from autism. It has been a struggle for decades for those individuals  and their families to get some form of recognition for what their children are  suffering from.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">For many in the House, that journey began with the  experience of individuals, and I am no different to many other Members in that  respect. I wish to put on record the name of the individual who brought the  subject of autism into my life, an important person called Jacqueline McGill,  whose son William suffers from autism. Members may wonder why that individual  is so important to me. She is a critical person in my life because she is my  childminder. Without her, I would be in severe difficulties, especially in this  type of employment. As you can understand, Mr Deputy Speaker, the hours are not  exactly normal working hours.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Jacqueline&rsquo;s son suffers from autism, and I used to hear my  children talk about some of the issues that she had with her son. On many  occasions, I took the opportunity to speak to her about autism, and we had many  a tearful conversation about the difficulties that she was having with  education and getting proper treatment for her child. That led to me choosing  autism as my charity when I was mayor of Lisburn five years ago, and one of my  former council colleagues mentioned that issue. It is unfortunate that she was  not there the year that autism was centre stage in Lisburn City Council.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That year was used to raise funds for Autism NI,  and we were reasonably successful in doing so, as we raised almost &pound;40,000 for  the charity. I did not go as far as some people did in raising money. My  colleague Michelle informed me that she climbed Ben Nevis to raise money for  autism. I have to be honest, Mr Deputy Speaker: I did many a thing for the  charity that year, but I did not climb a mountain.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  Shame.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>:  Shame, indeed. I have no head for heights. Had I got up there, I probably would  have rolled back down because of exhaustion.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, more importantly, that year was used to raise the  whole profile of autism in our society.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  Does the Member agree that the advantages of the legislation, which I support &mdash;  I congratulate Mr Bradley for bringing it to the Floor of the House &mdash; are that  it raises the level of consciousness about autism and means that areas such as  the one that I represent, which has the worst record for autism services, will  have to now provide those services for children and young adults in need? That  is and will be the real success of the legislation.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>: I  thank the Minister for raising those issues.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  I was not speaking as Minister.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>:  She may be sitting on the Back Benches, but I will still call her &ldquo;Minister&rdquo;,  and I agree with her on those issues.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We succeeded to a degree in raising the whole profile of  autism at that time. I want to pay a personal tribute to individuals who play  their part locally in the Lisburn branch of Autism NI. First and foremost, I  pay tribute to Dr Claire Hughes, who was the chairperson at that stage, and to  her assistant Anne Hayward, who is the current chairperson. They work  diligently for families on a day-to-day basis. They assist other families whose  children have been diagnosed with autism and help them to get through the  difficulties that they, too, had to fight. As both women know, even in my role  as an elected representative, I referred a number of families to them so that  they, too, could avail themselves of that help.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That leads me on to my role as a member of the all-party  group that looked at bringing this legislation to the House. I pay tribute to  all of those who took part in that group. I heard other Members referring to  the &lsquo;Bradley Bill&rsquo;, but I take that with a pinch of salt. I agree that &mdash; there  is no getting away from it &mdash; Dominic has played a predominant role in the  development of the legislation. I thank him for that and for the work and  effort that he has put in. However, many other members of that group also assisted.  We all played our part in ensuring that the legislation got to where it is, and  we need to pay tribute to all the members from all the parties who worked on  that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">More importantly, I pay tribute to Arlene Cassidy from  Autism NI for forcing that group forward. I have Arlene&rsquo;s number on speed dial  now, and I can recall several occasions when I actually thought that the phone  was going to go into meltdown because the conversation was that long. That is  what happens when someone gets involved in and becomes passionate about moving  a cause forward. Arlene is passionate about this cause, and the very fact that  she is here today even though she is ill and recovering from an illness speaks  volumes about her passion.<span class="SectionMarker"><span style="font-size:14.0pt; "> </span></span></p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">5.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Other Members have referred to how Arlene as an individual  was maligned by others. I ask other parties in the House to reflect on how some  of their Members referred to that individual and to Autism NI. It did not help  the debate and it did not move the cause of autism forward one inch. In many  respects, it caused deep division within the autism sector, and it is  regrettable that that happened.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Despite all that, and despite the cajoling that had to take  place within certain Departments, today we have reached a goalpost. I suppose  we all wondered whether we would ever get here before this Assembly finished.  It is good for autism and, more importantly, good for autism sufferers and  their families that we have reached this day. Eventually, we reached a day on  which equality of treatment will be recognised for those in Northern Ireland  who suffer from autism. Equality is what the Bill is all about; it is about  equal treatment for those who suffer from autism.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As an elected representative, I could never understand, and  to this day cannot understand, why some Departments refused to recognise what  is recognised elsewhere and what is as clear as the end of your nose, the  suffering of children from autism. Today, we have reached the point where that  excuse melts into the background, hopefully forever, in Northern Ireland. We  have put on statute that autism is a recognised disability.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank all members of the all-party group on autism, and  its chairman, for bringing this to the House and getting us to this stage. I  commend the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I begin by thanking all Members  who took part in the debate today. It was a very positive debate. The Bill is  the product of the work of many people throughout Northern Ireland; those with  autism, their families and those who care for them. Many of those people have  come in person to our constituency offices or through the advocacy groups that  represent them to ask us for the type of provision that the Bill, hopefully,  has the potential to deliver. I am confident that the Bill will deliver for  them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As Sue Ramsey said, today is the end of one phase of our  work and the beginning of the next. If the electorate is well enough disposed  towards us to return us to this House, it will be our duty to ensure that the  measures in the Bill are fully and properly implemented and enacted.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank all those who helped bring the Bill to this stage.  I thank the members of the all-party Assembly group on autism, some of whom  Members heard speak very eloquently today: John McCallister, Ian McCrea, the  deputy chairperson Michelle O&rsquo;Neill, Kieran McCarthy, Jonathan Craig and Alex  Easton. All members of the group believed passionately in ensuring that the  services needed by people with autism, their families and their carers were  provided for by the work of the Assembly. The group was explicitly established  to advance the case for autism legislation. Today is testament to the work of  the group during the mandate of this Assembly. Once again, I thank all Members.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I also thank the officials from the Bill Office, especially  Eilis Haughey, who was always available to advise us on the formal aspects of  legislation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank in particular the autism charities in Northern  Ireland, which very much encouraged us along the way; Autism Northern Ireland, the  National Autistic Society, PEAT, CEAT and SPEAC. I especially thank Autism  Northern Ireland; its chief executive, Arlene Cassidy; its adviser Eileen Bell;  and its chairperson David Heatley. I also thank the Health Committee, which  scrutinised the Bill and came forward with positive suggestions for amendments.  The Bill is the result of positive collaboration between the voluntary and  community sector and the Assembly. It is an example of what we, in the House,  can achieve through positive co-operation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The National Autistic Society launched its &lsquo;You Need To  Know&rsquo; document in the Long Gallery last week. It contains nine recommendations,  one or two of which I will read out to give an example of the gaps in services:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;We recommend more training for educational  professionals such as teachers and classroom assistants to enable them to  implement strategies and create an ethos of understanding which will benefit  children with autism. We recommend that the ASD strategy being developed by the  Department of Education includes protocols to facilitate joint working between  children and adolescent mental health services and schools. We recommend that  the RASDN identifies a CAHMS work stream to reform the provision of mental  health services for children with autism.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The document is an indication that the Bill is  needed, that the strategy is needed, and that we need to continue this work.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I express my admiration for the work of the Department of  Health and the Department of Education. We have the foundation of the strategy  for which the Bill makes provision. We need those Departments&rsquo; work to be  linked, co-ordinated and joined by the work of other relevant Departments.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In commenting on the contributions to today&rsquo;s debate, I  will try to include most Members who spoke. The Chairperson of the Health  Committee was the first to speak. He outlined the Bill&rsquo;s progress through the  Health Committee and detailed the amendments that it recommended. Michelle  O&rsquo;Neill, the Deputy Chairperson of the Health Committee, emphasised the fact that  the Bill will not have a negative impact on the rights of people with other  disabilities or those with special needs.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr John McCallister said that he could not give his full  support to the Bill at all times but said that he would not cause a division.  He underlined the fact that there is a commitment from everyone in the House,  from the Minister of Health, the Minister of Education and the Minister for  Social Development, and from others to ensure that people with autism are well  served by Government here. Kieran McCarthy referred to the Assembly&rsquo;s Research  Services and the evidence that is overwhelmingly in favour of legislation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Paul Givan welcomed the Bill on behalf of the DUP and  underlined the need for early diagnosis and intervention. Sue Ramsey described  this as a truly historic day. She said that it had been predicted that the  Assembly would be a battle a day and that a battle is certainly needed to  change mindsets in some Departments. Ian McCrea expressed his delight at seeing  the Bill reach this stage and welcomed the fact that there would be no Division  today.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Pat Ramsey welcomed the fact that the Bill had reached  Final Stage and said that he was delighted and honoured at being present today.  He said that the Bill was long overdue and he hoped that the loved ones of  people with autism will have the equality that they have longed for.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Alex Easton, who has been one of the strongest supporters  of the Bill, gave us a variety of statistics on autism. The current prevalence  is one in 50, which equates to about 30,000 in the population. He said that he  would have liked the Bill to go further: he wanted the creation of an autism  commissioner&rsquo;s office to be included in the Bill and he regretted that that  proposal had been removed. He expressed the hope that that provision could be  accommodated in the future.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Paul Girvan mentioned the work of the advocacy groups. He  praised the work of those involved in the Health Department&rsquo;s action plan, but  said that it was not part of a cross-departmental approach, which was what was  needed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">P&oacute;l Callaghan mentioned the Irish proverb, t&uacute;s maith leath  na hoibre &mdash; a good start is half the work. By that he meant that the stage that  we have reached is possibly only the beginning and that further work is needed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">George Robinson spoke very strongly in support of the Bill,  as did Dolores Kelly, who said that the Bill connects citizens to the Assembly  and that she hoped that it augurs a better future for people with autism and  their families and carers.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Jonathan Craig outlined his experience and said that the  position of many of us on the Bill was arrived at through contact with  individuals and by hearing first-hand stories from parents and carers of people  with autism. Indeed, that is how I got to this point. I am sure that many  Members will identify with the experience that Jonathan had with his  constituent &mdash; his babysitter &mdash; who outlined for him the difficulties faced by  people who have children with autism, such as accessing education services and  getting a suitable intervention that works for their child. He also praised  Michelle McIlveen for her mountaineering exploits on Ben Nevis. Although  Michelle has climbed Ben Nevis, I suppose that many parents thought that they  would have to climb Mount Everest to access the services that they needed for  their children. We hope that that climb will not be necessary in the future.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Arlene Foster said that the Bill should help people to  access the services that they need. I hope that that will be the case.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Once again, I thank all those who contributed to what has  been a useful debate. I hope sincerely that the Autism Bill, and what it  provides for, will be used by Departments in a positive way and that, in the next  mandate, Members will work hard to ensure that the Bill is implemented and that  the services that it promises are delivered effectively and efficiently to  people who have autism and to their families and carers.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">That the Autism Bill [NIA 2/10] do now pass.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. During yesterday&rsquo;s questions in the  Assembly to the Minister for Social Development, I tabled a question that was  listed as question 12. We did not get to it, which was understandable. However,  even today, I have not received an answer to that question. Standing Orders are  explicit on what should be done in such an event.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Standing Order 20(9) states:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Where &ndash;</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">(a) the member who submitted the question is not present  to ask it; or</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">(b) the question is not reached in the time allocated  for questions;</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">the Minister or member representing the Assembly  Commission to whom the question is addressed shall give a written answer. This  question and answer shall be published in the Official Report (Hansard).&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">5.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">At 5.45 pm the following day, I still have not got  that answer. I would like to know why I have been singled out for this  treatment. The question was straightforward:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;To ask the Minister for Social Development for an  update on phase 1 of the public realm scheme for Dungannon town centre.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I am still waiting for an answer today, and I  understand that the Minister is out of the country. I would like a ruling on  that.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Thank you for that point of order, Lord Morrow. You are fully  entitled to an answer under Standing Orders, and I will bring that to the  attention of the Speaker. Hopefully, that will draw attention to the question  and the Department will respond.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Adjourned at 5.46 pm</p>
