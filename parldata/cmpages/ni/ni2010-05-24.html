    <p class="H4StageHeading">Ministerial Appointment</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I advise members that I have been notified that Ms Margaret Ritchie has  tendered her resignation as Minister for Social Development to the First  Minister and deputy First Minister in accordance with section 18(9)(a) of the  Northern Ireland Act 1998. The resignation is effective from today.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In accordance with section 18(10) of the Act, Mr Alex  Attwood has been nominated to hold the office of Minister for Social  Development. Mr Attwood affirmed the terms of the Pledge of Office, as set out  in schedule 4 to the Act, in the presence of the Clerk to the Assembly/Director  General and me this morning. I therefore confirm that Mr Attwood has taken up  office as Minister for Social Development. As a result of his appointment as  Minister, Mr Attwood ceases to be a member of the Assembly Commission. A  vacancy now exists on the Commission.</p>

    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I advise Members that I have received Mr Dominic Bradley&rsquo;s resignation as  Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for the Environment, which took effect from  21 May 2010. The nominating officer of the Social Democratic and Labour Party,  Ms Margaret Ritchie, has nominated Mr Patsy McGlone as Deputy Chairperson of  the Committee for the Environment with effect from 21 May 2010. Mr McGlone has  accepted the appointment. I am satisfied that that correspondence meets the  requirements of Standing Orders, and I therefore confirm that Mr Patsy McGlone  is Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for the Environment with effect from  Friday 21 May 2010.</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading"><a name="3"></a>Assembly Commission</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The next item on the Order Paper is a motion to appoint a Member to fill the  vacancy on the Assembly Commission. As with other similar motions, this will be  treated as a business motion. Therefore, there will be no debate. Before we  proceed to the Question, I advise Members that the motion requires  cross-community support.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved (with cross-community support):</p>

    <p class="Q3Motion">That, in accordance with Standing Order 33(4), the period  referred to in Standing Order 33(2) be extended to 17 June 2010, in relation to  the Committee Stage of the Welfare Reform Bill [NIA Bill 13/09].</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Welfare Reform Bill passed its Second Stage on 20 April  2010. The Committee for Social Development has received around 20 substantive  written responses and heard oral evidence from seven key stakeholder  organisations as part of the Committee Stage. Members indicated that they were  concerned about certain provisions in the Bill in relation to, for example, the  abolition of income support, the introduction of mandatory &ldquo;work for your  benefit&rdquo; schemes and changes to community care grants. However, despite  reservations, the majority of members wish to see the legislation go forward so  as to maintain parity with the rest of the United Kingdom in respect of social  security matters. Nonetheless, the Committee asks for a little extra time to  consider the numerous responses and the complex welfare issues that have been  raised.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">To allow sufficient time for the Committee to consider the  views expressed and to compile its report on the Bill, I ask the House to  support this brief extension of the Committee Stage of the Welfare Reform Bill  to 17 June 2010.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>

    <p class="H4StageHeading">Caravans Bill: Second Stage</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That the Second Stage of the Caravans Bill [NIA 17/09] be  agreed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The legislation in Northern   Ireland pertaining to caravan sites lags significantly  behind that in the rest of the UK,  particularly where the caravan is an individual&rsquo;s primary or only residence. In  Great Britain,  caravan owners are protected by the Caravan Sites Act 1968, as amended, and the  Mobile Homes Act 1983, as amended. There are no similar provisions in Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are approximately 14,000 static caravans in Northern Ireland,  and the majority are used as holiday caravans. An estimated 300 caravans spread  over three or four sites are used as their owners&rsquo; primary residence. Those  caravans are generally referred to as mobile homes or park homes. Existing  legislation relating to caravans in Northern   Ireland is limited to the Caravans Act (Northern Ireland)  1963, which makes provision for the licensing and control of caravan sites and  authorises councils to provide and operate caravan sites.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is no statutory requirement for written agreements to  be provided by site owners to caravan owners, and many caravan owners appear to  rely on verbal agreements, often made many years ago. That lack of written  agreement has caused problems in some instances, particularly when ownership of  caravan sites has changed hands, and a substantial number of disputes have  arisen over the years. An imbalance of power has been created between the site  owner and the caravan owner, with some unscrupulous site owners having used  that imbalance to exploit their position to the detriment of caravan owners. In  2007, the issue was brought to my attention and that of colleagues from South  Down. We were invited to a public meeting where concerns were raised by  disgruntled caravan owners who were being subjected to the imposition of new  conditions without any prior notice or consultation. Subsequent research into  the subject highlighted the fact that that was commonplace across Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Some of the issues highlighted were the absence of formal  agreements, making it difficult to enforce basic consumer rights; a lack of  basic tenant rights for people living in caravans specifically designed for the  purpose of providing a permanent residence; a lack of protection from  harassment by a site owner through withholding essential services, such as  heating and water; having to sell the caravan back to the site owner at a much  reduced market value, with the site owner taking as much as 40% of the sale  price as a commission; site owners retaining full annual pitch fees, which were  paid in advance, despite the agreement&rsquo;s being terminated a short time into the  new licence term; and having to use workmen provided by the site owner to carry  out work, sometimes at an inflated price.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In 2008, I embarked on a consultation with a large number  of stakeholders, including, among others, the caravan industry&rsquo;s trade  organisations, organisations that represent caravan owners, and owners of  permanent residential and static caravan sites. The National Caravan Council  was particularly helpful. The initial consultation generated a positive overall  response to my proposals to implement a statutory written agreement containing  prescribed clauses that would protect the rights of and provide a basis of  negotiation for caravan owners and site owners alike. Most of the responses  from caravan owners drew attention to the key areas of concern which I have just  outlined. It was clear from the responses that there was overwhelming support  for the implementation of a statutory written agreement and for legislation  similar to that which exists in Great    Britain to protect the permanent residential  sector.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">12.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The first draft Bill, which circulated in 2009, attempted  to provide a level of protection for owners of static caravans on holiday sites  similar to that being proposed for permanent caravan residents on protected  sites. It was quickly brought to my attention that that would be too  prescriptive and unworkable and that it would cause unnecessary detriment to  owners of caravans on holiday sites. Following those responses, the decision  was taken to rely on the considerable body of existing consumer law, which, in  conjunction with the Bill&rsquo;s requirement for written agreements, provides  sufficient protection for owners of static caravans on holiday sites.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In November 2009, I had separate meetings with the Minister  of Enterprise, Trade and Investment, Arlene Foster, and the then Minister for  Social Development, Margaret Ritchie. Subsequently, a way forward was  identified and agreed with Minister Ritchie, who offered her support and that  of her officials in redrafting the Bill. I put on record my thanks to Minister  Ritchie and her departmental officials, whose support and guidance in getting  the Bill to Second Stage was crucial.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill is designed to afford protection to two particular  groups of caravan-users. The first group is those whose static caravans are  permanently pitched on caravan sites that are licensed for holiday use, which  are referred to in the Bill as &ldquo;seasonal sites&rdquo;. The second group is those for  whom the caravan is their only residence. The so-called park home is pitched on  a site with a licence that authorises year-round occupancy, and such sites are  referred to in the Bill as &ldquo;protected sites&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill also brings the definition of a caravan into line  with the rest of the United    Kingdom. It consists of five Parts and 17  clauses.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Paisley Jnr</strong>:  The Assembly would find it helpful if the Member were to state the limited  number of caravan park homes in Northern    Ireland to which the Bill applies.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I am grateful to the Member for his intervention. At the start of my speech, I  estimated there to be approximately 300 or 400 park homes. However, it is  important to say that, increasingly, people are making the lifestyle choice to  move into caravans, and, therefore, the Bill does not legislate for  circumstances that affect only a small number of people. It is vital that  people who live permanently on those sites have the protection of the law.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 1 sets out the purpose of Part 1 and to whom it  applies, namely the permanent residential caravan sector. It covers any  residential agreement that is made before or after the Bill&rsquo;s commencement with  regard to an owner-occupier of a caravan who is entitled to station it on a  protected site and to occupy it as his or her only or main residence for more  than three months. A protected site is one for which planning permission and  site licences are not restricted to holiday use and the times of the year  during which the site can be used are not restricted. The three-month period is  necessary to ensure that sites that are used to provide temporary accommodation  are not brought inappropriately into the scope of Part 1.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 2 requires that the owner of a protected site must  provide the owner-occupier of a caravan on that site with a written agreement,  within a specified timescale, which covers a range of issues, including the  express terms of the agreement. The clause gives DSD the power to make  regulations that extend the range of requirements for the written agreement. It  also provides caravan owners on protected sites with a mechanism by which to  seek redress through the courts, should a site owner fail to provide a written  agreement in accordance with the clause.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>:  For the sake of clarity, will the Member assure the House that the requirement  will be retrospective and that the right to a contract will apply not only to  people who move onto sites from now but to everyone on every site, regardless  of how long they have been there or whether they had a contract?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I am happy to give the House that assurance. Even if a caravan owner&rsquo;s current  contract is verbal, it is still a contract. Clause 2 takes that to a new level  by requiring contracts to be put in writing. Therefore, a term that is deemed  unfair, even if it was part of a previous contract, cannot be enforced.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 3 refers to Part 1 of the schedule, which sets out  the terms to be implied in any residential agreement. Clause 3 also describes  the powers of the court when dealing with matters relating to residential  agreements. Either party can make an application to the court within a time  specified by clause 3.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 5 deals with successors in title and provides  mechanisms for the residential agreement to continue and apply when ownership  of the caravan is lawfully assigned or inherited on the owner&rsquo;s death. That  will ensure that the rights of those who live with the caravan owner are  protected. Where the deceased caravan owner lived alone, there is no automatic  right or requirement on the successor in title to live in the caravan as their  main or only residence.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 7 sets out the purpose of Part 2 and to whom it  applies; that is, to the seasonal holiday sector. It covers any seasonal  agreement made either before or after the Bill&rsquo;s commencement relating to  caravan owners with entitlement to station their caravan on a seasonal site for  more than 28 days. The period of 28 days is specified to ensure the exclusion  of touring caravans, camper vans and holiday motorhomes, for which the  requirements of the Bill would be wholly inappropriate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 8 requires seasonal site owners to provide caravan  owners using their sites with written agreements, within a specific period of  time, that cover the terms and conditions on which the agreement is based. Any  express term of the agreement not included in the written agreement will be  unenforceable by the site owner. The purpose of that is to give site owners an  incentive to comply with their duty as stipulated in clause 8 and to protect the  caravan owner from the application of terms that have not been given in  writing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Part 3 deals with the protection of residential occupiers  on protected sites from eviction and harassment. Clause 9 clarifies to whom  Part 3 applies; namely, owner-occupiers entitled to station their caravan on a  protected site and those who rent a caravan on a protected site where, in  either case, the caravan is the person&rsquo;s main or only residence.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 10 provides protection for those living in caravans  on protected sites by making it an offence for the owner of a protected site or  their agent to withhold or withdraw services; to carry out any act likely to  interfere with the peace and comfort of the caravan occupier or anyone living  with them with the intention of causing the occupier to abandon their caravan  or remove it from the site; or to prevent access to their rights or a form of  redress. The penalties for someone found guilty of such an offence are set out  in subsection (8). Subsection (9) creates a defence where the accused:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;had reasonable cause to believe &hellip; the occupier of the  caravan had ceased to reside on the site.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Subsection (10) creates a defence where the  accused:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;had reasonable grounds for doing the acts or  withdrawing or withholding the services or facilities in question.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 11 establishes the courts&rsquo; powers in relation to  proceedings for enforcement or eviction and the factors that they should have  regard to before exercising such power &mdash; for example, if:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;the occupier has failed &hellip; to observe &hellip; any terms or  conditions of that agreement &hellip; or &hellip; any reasonable rules made by the site owner  for the management and conduct of the site&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Part 4 relates to the meaning of the term &ldquo;caravan&rdquo;. Clause  13 updates the definition of &ldquo;caravan&rdquo;, bringing it into line with England and Wales. Clause 14 applies the new  definition to the existing caravan legislation, the Caravans Act (Northern Ireland)  1963.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The schedule applies to agreements made under Part 1 &mdash;  permanent residential agreements on protected sites &mdash;and is broken into three  parts. Part 1 sets out the terms to be implied in a residential agreement. It  deals with the agreement&rsquo;s duration and how it can be terminated by either the  occupier or the site owner. The occupier must give at least four weeks&rsquo; notice in  writing, and the site owner must seek termination through the courts. Part 1  provides the mechanism for the caravan owner to recover overpayments for a  period following the termination of a residential agreement. It establishes the  process for the sale of a caravan on a protected site and creates entitlement  for the site owner to receive a maximum commission of 10% on the sale. That is  the same process as is used across the rest of the United Kingdom.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The site owner&rsquo;s right to resite the caravan to conduct  essential or emergency repairs or to apply to the court to move the caravan to  another comparable pitch is explained in Part 1. The site owner will meet all  the costs associated with such moves. Site owners are entitled to charge a  pitch fee, and the conditions for changes to and payment of the pitch fee are  set out in Part 1. There is provision for establishing a qualifying residents&rsquo;  association on a protected site, and the site owner must consult that body on  certain matters such as, for example, a change in pitch fees.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Part 2 sets outs in full the terms that a court is allowed  to order as being implied in a residential agreement. Part 3 relates to the  sale of a caravan on a protected site and deals with the circumstances in which  a caravan owner makes a request to someone other than the site owner to approve  a person to whom they wish to sell their caravan and assign the residential  agreement.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Paisley Jnr</strong>:  I thank the Member for giving way once again. Will he confirm that that point  relates solely to the very small group of caravan owners whom we talked about  earlier and not to holiday caravan owners?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I am happy to confirm that. The Bill deals primarily with two groups. The first  group is the seasonal sector. It is much bigger than the other group, with  13,000-odd pitches in Northern    Ireland. However, only a small percentage &mdash;  25% to no more than 30% &mdash; have a written agreement. The Bill will allow them to  have a written contract. However, Mr Paisley Jnr&rsquo;s point was about protected  sites for permanent residential occupiers, which is the second group. It is  right and proper that we give people in that group enhanced protection, because  their caravans are their only place of residence. Therefore, it is crucial that  they have the highest level of protection.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In summary, permanent residential caravans or park homes,  if you prefer, provide an important housing option, particularly for older  people in Great Britain.  They have become an increasingly popular lifestyle choice. I said in response  to Mr Paisley Jnr&rsquo;s point that people in Northern Ireland have used that  option to release equity from their existing bricks and mortar. That lifestyle  choice allows people to feel protected and secure and enables them to downsize  and release equity from their homes. However, the number of people doing so has  remained small because, as we have discovered, there is no legal basis for  taking that option in Northern    Ireland. That is the crux of what the Bill  seeks to address. By bringing Northern Ireland  legislation into line with the Mobile Homes Act 1983, which applies in the rest  of the UK,  businesses can now move forward with confidence. Citizens who want to buy into  that lifestyle choice can also move forward with confidence because they will  have legal protection.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">With regard to holiday caravan owners, a statutory  requirement for site owners to issue written agreements will provide the  necessary mechanisms to prevent abuse by either party. A written agreement is  good for the caravan owner and the site owner.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>:  The Member knows that I broadly support what he is trying to do, because it is  very relevant to South Down. However, am I right in thinking that implicit in  that agreement is the right of the caravan site owner to demand that the  caravan owner sell the caravan back to them? Alternatively, will what the  honourable Member is suggesting allow the caravan owner to get the best price  for their caravan on the open market?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  We have been debating that point. We are trying to strike a balance with the  written agreements. A caravan owner has the right to sell their caravan to  whomever they like. However, they do not have the right to sell the pitch with  it. Individuals can sell their caravans but not necessarily the pitch. That is  the balance that must be struck.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The reason why site owners still need to have some  control over who moves onto their pitches is that the majority of our holiday  sector is aimed at the mums, dads and young kids who want to enjoy a summer  down by the coast.</p>

    <p class="TimePeriod">12.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><span class="BoldText">Mr A Maginness: </span>The Member  raises an interesting point. However, although the occupiers of sites are given  the opportunity to sell their caravans, the problem is that they are not  permitted to sell them on site. The Member says that owners have the right to  sell their caravans at large. However, that is a very constrained right,  because, in most situations, caravans cannot be moved. Even if a caravan can be  moved, a lot of disruption is caused and the transportation costs are very  high, particularly if it is an old caravan. Therefore, the right that is being  established is very limited.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I accept the points made by my two colleagues. What Mr Maginness said is absolutely  true. However, I argue that there cannot be a system in which anyone has the  right to sell a pitch. Caravan owners do not own the pitches. I accept that the  right is limited due to the fact that a caravan can be sold but only to someone  who has been approved by a site owner.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Let me clarify this point.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That is important. Given the type of holiday that is  envisaged by people going to a caravan park, caravan owners cannot have the  right to sell to just anyone as that could bring someone unsuitable into a  family-friendly holiday environment. It is about accepting the balance between  two competing identities.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  I am sure that Alban did not mean that people who may behave badly would be  brought on site. However, the fact remains that if someone who leases a pitch  buys a caravan, as is usually asked of people leasing a pitch, and then moves  off site, most caravan owners will not allow that person on to another site.  People are caught no matter what way it goes. Obviously, there would be  regulations to ensure that people who may behave badly are not allowed on site.  Surely, however, people who want to sell their caravans should, in agreement  with site owners, be allowed to do so in a way that does not result in a big  financial hit.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  The majority of the caravan sector is made up of people who hand down second-  and third-generation caravans and who enjoy their caravans. There are issues  arising from the sale of caravans. However, a balance has to be found. We do  not want a set-up in which anyone can buy a pitch because, as Mr McCann said,  people buy a caravan but lease a pitch. Therefore, they can sell their caravan  to whoever they chose, with all the associated costs of moving it. That is the  hold that caravan owners have over site owners in trying to bargain a fair  price. However, there cannot be a free-for-all on caravan sites.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have consulted all sides on this matter, and the one area  of consensus among site owners and caravan owners was that they did not want a  free-for-all in the caravan industry whereby anyone could move on site.  Families with young children want some degree of control over who comes onto a  site and, as such, buyers have to come with a recommendation. For example,  people could sell their caravan to a friend or relative, but it is up to the  site owner to approve or disapprove of that person.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  Will the member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>:  Mrs Bradley is looking to intervene as well.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We are perhaps being a bit rough on the Member for South  Down, but we are simply sharpening our knives for the incoming Minister&rsquo;s  contribution; it is good practice.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McCallister is saying that a site owner can buy a  caravan back and is not allowed to make more than 10% commission on that sale.  Is that only for the permanent residential sector?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Yes, it is.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>:  Even so, what the Member is suggesting still puts the site owner in a very  strong position. In my contribution, which I will probably not make until  teatime given the way that we are going, I will quote many examples where a  site owner has used that power to charge a purchaser a ridiculous price for a  caravan, buy the caravan back for a ridiculously low price when that person  sells, perhaps because of health reasons, and then flog it on at an exorbitant  price later.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I do not see anything in the Bill that stops that abuse,  even though it is one of the main issues in the industry. For instance, if one  gives a dealership the franchise to sell all the cars in a certain town, that  dealership has the right to charge what it wants for the cars. It can demand that  people use them to sell the cars back and can charge whatever it likes for the  second-hand vehicle. Obviously, that dealership would sell a huge number of  cars, because it would have sole control of the market. If someone in the town  wanted a car, he or she would have to go to that garage.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We are giving similar powers to site owners. I have heard  some very unsavoury examples of those powers being abused. How does the  Member&rsquo;s Bill tackle that abuse?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  The simple answer is that the Bill is addressing that by making everyone have a  written agreement. The commission fee would need to be specified in a written  agreement. I am speaking only about the holiday sector, because that is where  the issue arises. The 10% limit on commission applies to the permanent  residential sector.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the holiday sector, the commission fee will be in the  written agreement, so people will know what it is when they sign the agreement.  The industry standard commission in the holiday sector is 15%. However, I know  of many examples, as I am sure Mr Wells does, in which the commission is more  inflated than that. A balance must be found between those competing issues. The  best way of doing that is through a written agreement, which brings openness  and transparency to the situation. Most of the problems arise due to a lack of  openness and transparency.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Trading Standards Service has received between 70 and  80 complaints each year over the past 10 years. Most of those complaints could  be dealt with through written agreements so that people would know that there  could be no problems with workmen charging inflated prices. With a written  agreement, a person would know what the commission fee is when selling a  caravan. People could also negotiate the terms on which they might refuse to  let someone buy a caravan.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">How a caravan is sold on needs to be looked at in the  written agreements. For example, if I were selling a caravan to Mr Wells, would  the site owner refuse him permission to buy it? If the site owner&rsquo;s only reason  for withholding permission was that Mr Wells is a member of the DUP, it would  be deemed unfair. However, denying him permission for that reason could be fair  enough. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span> I see that the Member is  getting a lot of support from his colleague Mr Paisley Jnr, who, he will be  relieved, is going to Westminster.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Paisley Jnr</strong>:  Does the Member accept that his Bill must contain a protection for the holiday  caravan park owner who, for years, has built up a credible business and  established a quiet area where people can enjoy a particular standard of  holiday? A willy-nilly selling of caravans on sites and pitches to anyone whom  the person exiting the site wanted could destroy overnight the fabric of that  caravan park and the enjoyment that many people get from it. That would put to  naught the tens of years that the site owner has invested in making his holiday  park what it is.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There must be that guarantee and protection, otherwise our  holiday businesses on the coast could be ruined. In my constituency, caravan  parks at Ballycastle and Bushmills could be ruined overnight by unseemly people  being allowed to buy a caravan. Many such people would line up to buy a  caravan.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member will know that drug dealers have attempted to  buy caravans on holiday sites, which could destroy parks overnight. It is  essential, therefore, that the Bill contains protections. Like the Member, I  believe that the person who cares most about a holiday park is the person who  owns the park, makes a living from it and has a vested interest in ensuring its  future success; it is not necessarily the person who is exiting a park.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I agree with Mr Paisley. It is about trying to balance those positions. It is  my firm belief, in introducing the Bill, that giving a legal basis, through a  written agreement, to every caravan on a holiday site is good not only for the  caravan owner but, as Mr Paisley rightly said, for the site owner. We  considered the issue and worked with Minister Foster, who, in the Department of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment, is in charge not only of tourism but better  regulation. How do we get the balance right between those competing needs?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There was no difference of opinion between caravan owners  and caravan site owners on whether site owners should have some control over who  comes on and off their sites. Mr Paisley gave the example of drug dealers. A  potential buyer could also be on the sex offenders&rsquo; register. Families come on  holiday, and they should be protected, as well as the investment by the  businesses that run caravan sites. It is about getting the balance right.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I accept the points made by Mr Wells, Mr Maginness and Mr  McCann. The Bill will get the balance right between caravan owners and site  owners. There could be slightly unscrupulous site owners who could seek to  abuse that arrangement. If two or three people whom a caravan owner recommended  bringing onto a site were turned down, is there a mechanism, and a need to  challenge a site owner, through the courts? That could be an option, because a  site owner&rsquo;s behaviour could be deemed unfair.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, caravan owners cannot simply sell to the highest  bidders and then move off site, with no regard to the residents who are left  behind or to how suitable or unsuitable the people buying their caravans might  be. The Bill requires a written agreement for everyone in the holiday sector,  so the balance is there. I am confident that the balance is right between those  two competing needs, because I consulted widely with the industry and the  relevant stakeholders.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>:  As the Member is aware, I have been interested in the issue for a considerable  time. I have a concern that I do not think is addressed in the Bill. At  Seahaven in my constituency of North Down, some elderly couples moved into a  caravan park, intending to live there for the remainder of their lives and  believing that they would stay in specific caravans. A couple of years later,  they received letters from the site owner telling them that they had to upgrade  their caravans at a cost of hundreds of thousands of pounds, which would be  bought back at a fraction of the cost. Will the Member reassure me that the  Bill will contain protections for people who are told that they have to upgrade  their caravans or they are out?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  The issue in Mr Easton&rsquo;s constituency refers primarily to permanent residential  parks. I assure Mr Easton that the Bill contains strong protections for  permanent residents. As I said earlier, that is right and proper, because those  people need a level of protection for what is their main or, in many cases,  only residence.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">12.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">All those people will have a written agreement and will  have the right to form a residents&rsquo; association, with which the site owner will  have to work. The Bill will provide robust protection for permanent residents &mdash;  the very people for whom the Member has campaigned since restoration in 2007.  The Bill&rsquo;s protections are much more robust than those afforded to the holiday  sector.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>:  The Member has been extraordinarily generous in giving way. Mrs Bradley has  been waiting to get in for a long time and has not been able to catch the  Deputy Speaker&rsquo;s eye.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to follow on from what Mr Easton said. A major  problem, particularly in South Down, is that many caravan site users are  instructed to change their caravans every 10 years, regardless of their  condition. Some of them are little palaces. Who are people instructed to buy  their new caravans from but the site owners? Moreover, they are offered a  derisory amount for their old ones. We may reach a situation in which everyone  has a written contract, but it will contain those unreasonable terms, as well  as conditions that specify that insurance must be obtained from, and  maintenance provided through, site owners. In other words, people may have a  written contract and know where they stand, but they will still not be happy.  However, they can do nothing about that because they have a contract.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I am happy to respond to that point. Mr Wells used the word &ldquo;unreasonable&rdquo;. Any  term if it is deemed unreasonable, is, by its very definition, unenforceable.  Even as legislation stands, under the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts  Regulations 1999, a site owner cannot enforce an unreasonable term. That  protection is there.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">One of the big advantages of the Bill, if we move towards  having written agreements across the holiday sector, is that the protections  will be there in black and white. An individual can send a copy of the contract  to the Trading Standards Service for it to determine whether the terms of a  contract are unfair or whether the user is liable.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Wells mentioned workmen charging inflated prices. The  Bill gives an individual the right to employ whomever he or she wants to carry  out works &mdash; for example, to install gas or electricity &mdash; as long as they are  properly qualified and registered. The site owner will have no control over  that right, provided that the work is carried out to a suitable standard. That  is where the written agreement comes in.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have spoken over the past number of years to Trading  Standards Service representatives and to Minister Foster. A written agreement  in the holiday sector will solve more than 90% of the problems that arise over  unfair terms and agreements. As I said, some of the verbal agreements that were  made date back to the caravan user&rsquo;s grandparents&rsquo; time and have rolled on  without changes being made to them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Wells mentioned pitch fees. Any agreement will have to  set out in black and white what the pitch fee will be. He also mentioned the  10-year rule. That period will have to be established at the start of the  contract so that caravan owners know what they are signing up to. The site owner  will not be able to appear suddenly in nine and a half years&rsquo; time and claim  that a caravan owner agreed to change his or her caravan after 10 years. As I  said, the agreement will be in black and white so that caravan owners know what  they are signing up to and the contract is fair to both sides. If either the  caravan owner or the site owner does not like the agreement, he or she does not  have to sign it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The consumer has the protection of being able to go to the  Trading Standards Service. My interest in the Bill has led me to refer several  cases to the Trading Standards Service, and I have been assured that it is  taking robust action against site owners. In one case, a written agreement has  been drawn up. Where a written agreement exists, it can be examined and can  provide advice, and it gives Trading Standards the power to enforce the terms.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I believe that Mrs Mary Bradley wants to intervene.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  I had almost forgotten what I wanted to say. The Bill should not just be for  site owners. It has to protect people who pay money in good faith to use those  sites. The agreements need to cover instances such as resale, so that an owner  does not have to sell his or her caravan to a site owner for a measly sum.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Around four years ago, I was made aware of the case of a  family who wanted to sell their caravan on a site in the North of Ireland as  they could no longer go there because of the husband&rsquo;s disabilities. They  wanted to sell their van on the site and leave it where it was. That was not  allowed to happen. They were not allowed to sell their van unless it was to the  owner of the site. He wanted to give them &pound;3,000 for their van, but he had  found a buyer for it and was charging him &pound;12,500. That is the kind of thing  that the Bill needs to stop.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I would not back the Bill if it was only to protect site  owners. As that couple would not sell the van to the site owner for &pound;3,000,  knowing that he would charge the people moving into it &pound;12,500, the site owner  made them pay &pound;150 to move the van 400 yards to the gate of his site, and they  then had to pay a haulage firm to move the van off the site so that someone  else could buy it. I see that as abuse. The Bill cannot cater only for site  owners. They have been as much at fault over the years as the people who hire  space on the sites.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I agree. We are trying to find a balance between those two competing factors.  There is no point in having 13,500 people who want to have a holiday caravan  experience if we drive all the site owners out of business. We have to find the  balance between the two. It is not in site owners&rsquo; interests to excessively  abuse families and to put people off having caravans.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The issue that Mrs Mary Bradley raised is one that we have  pressed and that the Trading Standards Service is now helping with. That is  that site owners have to display the asking price on caravans for people who  are looking around. If someone is selling a caravan, he or she can go to see  the asking price and does not have to rely on hearsay to find out what it  fetches. It is important to stop that practice of a site owner buying a caravan  for, for example, &pound;3,000 and selling it on for &pound;12,500. We have to keep  pressure on the Trading Standards Service to ensure that it is doing that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have to find a balance between the competing needs of  caravan owners and site owners. The two are not so far apart. One has to make a  living from a site, and the other needs to have a safe, secure place to bring  their families on holiday, where they can enjoy the peace and comfort of the  coast or lakeside or wherever it happens to be. The important point is to reach  a balance between those. I firmly believe that a written agreement in the  holiday sector would give that balance. It would be good for both sides because  it would bring clarity, openness and transparency to the issue. It would  explain what a caravan owner is signing up for without putting an excessive  regulatory burden on a site owner. It could also help site owners because if  people were to sign up, they would be agreeing to maintain their caravans to  the standard that people want in caravan parks.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>: If  the Member was getting paid for every intervention, he would be a wealthy man  by the time the debate is finished.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  He could buy a caravan.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>: He  certainly could buy a caravan.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I congratulate Mrs Bradley on her incisive contribution. Mr  McCallister still has not reassured me. He said that the Office of Fair Trading  would rule any term or clause in the contract to be unfair or unreasonable.  However, the same office has deemed that it is reasonable for a site owner to  insist that a 10-year-old caravan must be changed, even if it is kept  immaculately and like a palace, otherwise its owner can be thrown off a site. A  site owner can insist that a replacement caravan is bought from him or her at  whatever price is deemed appropriate. What assurance is there that the Bill  will cover that issue?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  It goes back to the written agreement that a caravan owner will have signed up  to. If a caravan owner agrees in an initial contract that he or she will change  a caravan after 10 years, 12 years or 15 years, the caravan will have to be  changed.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>: I  cannot let the Member away with that, and I can assure him that it is not a  case of local rivalry. It is important that we get this right.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The person who has had the contract slapped on his or her  table is not in a strong position. As has been said, a caravan may have been in  a family for several generations, and it may be the holiday home of the entire  extended family. The family, therefore, will want to keep it rather than move  out. What is the owner to do when he or she is issued with a piece of paper  stating that caravans must be changed every 10 years? The owner must sign that  contract, otherwise the whole tradition and the holiday home that the family  has had for years will be lost. The knowledge that it was an unrealistic contract  that was imposed is no consolation. The owner had no choice about whether to  sign it. The Office of Fair Trading, in its wisdom, has said that owners must  accept having to change caravans every 10 years. Where does that leave people  who are stuck on sites already?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  It leaves them a lot further forward. At the minute, those people do not have  security of tenure of any more than a year, because they sign an annual site  licence. The very group that Mr Wells speaks about have nothing more than a  year&rsquo;s guarantee. There is nothing to stop a site owner coming along today and  telling Jim, for example, that he is not going to renew his site licence after  this year because he does not like his caravan or he does not like Jim. There  is no protection to prevent that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although Mr Wells says that 10 or 15 years is not enough,  it is an awful lot better than caravan owners have at the minute. Site licences  are issued annually, so caravan owners have protection for only one year or  maybe even less if a contract runs alongside the holiday season. It goes back  to the balance between a site owner and a caravan owner.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Wells referred to caravans that are kept in immaculate  condition, but what about a 20-year-old caravan? A site owner may have granted  a resident the use of a caravan but may eventually tell that resident that it  is beginning to look a bit scrappy. Who wants to reside in a caravan park that  looks as though it is falling down? That is not good for business, and there  needs to be a mechanism to deal with such situations at some point.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Most site owners and caravan owners whom I have consulted  on the issue want some level of control. I have debated with various groups at  length on the issue of a 10-year rule and a 15-year rule, as they are known in  the business. There is support for the striking of a balance between the two,  because there cannot be sites that have a front row that is like a shop window,  along the seafront at Cranfield, or wherever, but the rest of which is falling  down. Owners of &pound;40,000 caravans will not want to stay beside caravans that  take away from the value of their own. Similarly, we would not want someone to  open up a car-breaker&rsquo;s yard beside our home.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Leonard</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Yes.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Apologies to Billy; I was up first.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I congratulate the Member on bringing forward the Bill,  which has provoked an awful lot of discussion. I listened to the points that  were raised by Mr Shannon and others, and I seek the Member&rsquo;s assurance that he  has consulted widely with all interested parties. This is the Bill&rsquo;s Second  Stage, and, therefore, Members will have plenty more opportunities to raise  important issues. I am sure that the Member welcomes support, intervention and  contribution from the other Members who are present. They can raise particular  issues at other stages of the Bill, and I am quite sure that the Member will be  willing to entertain what they have to say.<span class="SectionMarker"><em><span style="font-size:14.0pt; "> </span></em></span></p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">1.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">We look forward to more than rhetoric coming out. I  do not doubt that some Members feel passionately about this, but perhaps they  might translate some of that passion into a positive contribution to help to  develop a Bill that will look after the interests of all parties, including those  of the people who the Member referred to.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I am grateful to my colleague Mr McCrea.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that we are about to go into Committee Stage and  subsequent stages, and we are happy at any time in the process that Members  should have many opportunities to raise valid points. However, this is about  getting a balance that meets the needs of the industry and those of the  individuals who are involved.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Leonard</strong>:  I thank the Member for giving way yet again. He has been extremely generous  with his time. I realise that his colleague is trying to offer him some  protection. This point is not just about rhetoric or anything like that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I suggest that the Member looks at a local authority on the  north coast, if he has not already done so. It runs large caravan sites at a  profit. On those sites, people are not told to buy after 10 years or 15 years.  Standards are high; the quality of caravans and other items is high; there is  no dilapidation; no one suffers because neighbours do not look after their  units; drug dealers do not run riot; and families enjoy excellent  family-orientated holidays. In that lie some lessons. Why does any caravan park  owner need to have a monopoly? The primary protection that is needed is for the  men, women and children who put their hard-earned money into getting a quality  holiday. There are lessons in the example that I gave that challenge many of  the premises on which the Bill is based.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I take great exception to the idea &mdash; it was not the  Member&rsquo;s idea, but it was voiced in the Chamber &mdash; that we must protect the  caravan park owner because of the threat of undesirable people coming onto a  site. That is the case to some degree, but the organisation that I referred to  has a waiting list, and it ensures that those coming onto the site do not ruin  the enjoyment of others. So, there are examples out there that challenge the  very premise of monopolies, which I loathe.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I assume that the Member refers to Coleraine Borough Council. Pitch fees in  that council area are at least &pound;300 a year higher than those in other areas.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Leonard</strong>:  We had that debate because there was a move to sell off the sites, which was  resisted by the majority of councillors. People were involved in the debate  about how they would be restricted by the privatisation of the Coleraine  Borough Council caravan parks and how they would pay thereafter. Regardless of  the fee that the Member referred to, there is still a waiting list for those  sites.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  The existence of a waiting list is probably due to the unique setting rather  than any other factor. My wife comes from the East   Londonderry constituency, which is a beautiful part of the  country. That explains the waiting list. However, there was a major row some  years ago when pitch fees were increased.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">One of the differences between the Ulster Unionist Party  and Sinn F&eacute;in is that Ulster Unionists do not believe that government or local  government should run every service. I have an issue with the fact that the  local authority issues the site licence to itself, because that means that it  effectively polices itself. That is most unsatisfactory. There is a balance to  be struck.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">One of the ideas that Mr Leonard mentioned was that there  could be some vetting of a newcomer to a site. This is about getting the  balance between the two parties. There is no major disagreement between site  owners and caravan owners about having that level of control. People do not  want just anyone moving onto a caravan site. It is as simple as that. People  may think of caravan owners and park owners as being on opposite sides;  however, both sides agreed on that, and there was a meeting of minds around the  idea that some level of control was necessary. However, we have to find a  mechanism, and that can be done through a written agreement. Terms for selling  a caravan or reselling it can be discussed and entered into through a written  agreement. That agreement could include recommendations about who constitutes a  family friend. It could become unreasonable for a site owner to refuse three,  four or five people; not all of them could be bad. Maybe he is refusing them  because they are all in the DUP. Of course, I would say that that was  reasonable, although others might question it. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span> I am at least getting support from my colleagues.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On a serious point, the scenario that we want to reach is  to use that approach to find a balance between the two. I repeat that we do not  want a free-for-all to sell caravans, with all the associated problems that we  know can occur.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I see that the Chairperson of the Committee appears to be  leaving for his lunch. In closing, I say that the Bill provides a high level of  protection for permanent residential caravans, which is important because such  caravans are some people&rsquo;s main residence. It also provides a level of  protection for the owners of static holiday caravans that we have not  previously had in Northern    Ireland. I commend the Bill to the House. I  welcome the new Minister for Social Development, and I thank his predecessor  and, I hope, him for his supportive remarks. Perhaps I should wait to hear his  speech. However, the Bill&rsquo;s principles are right and proper, and it will afford  protection to those who have not had it in the past. We must ensure that  protection, which is why the Bill is so important.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Before we continue, I remind Members that the general principles  of the Bill are debated at Second Stage. As Basil McCrea indicated, I am sure  that long debates lie ahead in the further consultative stages of the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Social Development (Mr Hamilton)</strong>: Thank you, Mr Deputy  Speaker. I hope that future debates on the Bill will not last too long.  However, I welcome the opportunity to speak. I join Mr McCallister in welcoming  the new Minister to his position.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The procedures that allow individual Members to introduce  private Members&rsquo; Bills that are debated in plenary, such as this Bill, and  amended using the same process as for legislation intro&shy;duced by a Minister is  good, positive and a sign of a properly functioning democratic institution. As  in this case, when the Bill in question applies to a niche subject that affects  groups of individuals, families or communities, it signifies good, mature  debate in the Assembly. I praise Mr McCallister for being among the first MLAs  to get a private Member&rsquo;s Bill to Second Stage.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Anybody who has observed today&rsquo;s debate thus far will have  seen for themselves that issues such as this can elicit good, heated discussion  among Members. Who would have thought, Mr Deputy Speaker, that it would have  taken a subject such as caravans to get Members so excited? The considered  debate between Members, exchanging views, as they have, is another good sign  that a democratic institution such as the Assembly is functioning properly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee for Social Development considered the  principles underpinning the Caravans Bill at its meeting on 4 March 2010. The  Committee gave a general welcome to the Bill and looks forward to further  scrutiny of its provisions after Second Stage. I am pleased that the Bill has,  as Mr McCallister indicated, undergone some redrafting since First Stage. If it  had not been for that redrafting, only God knows how long and heated the debate  would have been, so we give thanks that that happened. The Department for  Social Development has played an important role in that process, and the  Committee anticipates further useful and constructive engagement with it and Mr  McCallister as the Bill moves forward.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I shall now make a few remarks on the principles of the  Bill. As has been indicated, the Bill is in several Parts. The first Part,  which is of particular interest to the Social Development Committee, refers to  statutory protections for those who own or occupy a caravan as their main  residence and who rent a pitch on a protected site. As we have heard, the Bill  is intended to extend to those individuals and families the kinds of protection  available in the private rented housing sector. The Bill will introduce written  statements of residential agreement, which will set out the key obligations of  the caravan owner-occupiers who rent the pitch and the caravan site owners who  own the pitch. During the anticipated Committee Stage, Members will wish to  explore precisely who will be affected by those provisions and also how and,  importantly, by whom those aspects of the Bill will be enforced.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill includes provisions to limit the commission that  caravan site owners can earn on the sale of an owner-occupier&rsquo;s caravan and on  the gifting and inheriting rights associated with caravans. Those issues have  already been the subject of some concern among site owners, and it is  anticipated that those questions will be scrutinised further in Committee, as  they have been today.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The proposed residential agreements include protections for  caravan owner-occupiers from harassment and eviction. The agreements are also  expected to reference rent-setting mechanisms. The Committee is keen to review  the workability and appropriateness of the proposals to ensure that rights are  protected and that a good balance is maintained between the interests and  duties of caravan owner-occupiers and caravan site owners.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Part 2 refers to seasonal sites and includes consumer  protections for caravan owner-occupiers who remain on a seasonal site for more  than 28 days. When the provisions were originally mooted, they understandably  caused more than a little concern among caravan site owners. As I said, the  Committee is grateful to the Department for redrafting the Bill and for  clarifying the applicability of those provisions. As it is anticipated that the  enforcement of the provisions will fall to the Department of Enterprise, Trade  and Investment, I expect that the Social Development Committee will willingly  agree to seek the views of the ETI Committee on the relevant clauses. I am sure  that the House will hear today from the Chairperson of that Committee on those  clauses.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Part 4 includes a legal definition of &ldquo;caravan&rdquo;. Given that  provisions to allow the amendment of the definition will fall to the Department  of the Environment, I expect that the Social Development Committee will be free  to seek the views of the Environment Committee on the relevant clauses. Again,  we are likely to hear today from the Chairperson of that Committee on that  matter.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I said, the Committee for Social Development generally  welcomes the Bill. It is anticipated that the Committee Stage will provide an  opportunity to review the protections for caravan owner-occupiers while  considering the workability of the provisions in respect of the Northern  Ireland caravan industry.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Before I close, I shall speak briefly in a personal  capacity. I represent a constituency with a great many caravan sites, perhaps  one of the largest concentrations of caravan sites in the whole of Northern  Ireland. In fact, more than 20% of holiday caravans are located on the Ards  Peninsula, which is dotted with caravan sites. They are an important aspect of  the tourism industry in my constituency, where most holiday accommodation is  caravan-based. Unlike other parts of Northern Ireland, we do not have a  plethora of hotels, but we have a lot of caravans, and they are an important  aspect of the tourism economy in Strangford. It is not just the employment that  the sites provide, which is relatively small; it is the employment that the  industry supports in the wider community. In towns and villages along the Ards  Peninsula, particularly in the summer months when sites are well occupied,  small shops and businesses get a huge boost in trade because of the people who  visit caravans and stay in them on a semi-permanent basis. As a constituency  representative of an area with such a high concentration of caravans, I want to  see that strong caravan sector maintained, and I will oppose anything that  undermines it. I am against anything that harms that important part of our  tourist economy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the Strangford constituency, we, too, have experienced  the park homes phenomenon, and anything that tightens up or closes loopholes so  that, as Mrs Bradley said, people cannot be abused is very important. I am glad  that holiday caravans will not be subject to many of the restrictions that  there will be for park homes, although that will be tested during Committee  Stage.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee expects numerous responses from stakeholders  during Committee Stage, and it will welcome further engagement with the  Department and the Bill&rsquo;s sponsor. I support the Second Stage of the Caravans  Bill.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">1.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for the Environment (Mr Boylan)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a  LeasCheann Comhairle. Mar Chathaoirleach an Choiste Comhshaoil, cuirim f&aacute;ilte  roimh an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht ar Bhille na gCarbh&aacute;n.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the introduction of the Caravans Bill. I commend  the Member for introducing the Bill and wish him well. After that line of  questioning today, he deserves a caravan holiday to boot.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill will introduce statutory protections similar to  those that exist in England, Scotland and Wales for those who occupy a caravan  as their main residence on sites that have been approved for that purpose. The  Bill will also create a level of protection for caravan owners on seasonal  sites by introducing a requirement for written agreements to be in place  between site owners and caravan owners.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">According to the National Caravan Council, in excess of one  million people in the UK regularly take caravan holidays. Many people say that  it is a leisure and lifestyle choice. Research has shown that the overriding  reason why people love caravanning is that it represents freedom. In 2002,  caravanning represented 19% of all holiday nights. Therefore, it is a  substantial industry that, no doubt, will blossom further in the tough economic  environment in which we find ourselves today. The Bill will ensure that people  in the North will receive similar protection to those in other jurisdictions,  and that is welcome.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Thankfully, with all the legislation that the Environment  Committee is dealing with at the minute, it has only a minor role in the Bill.  Clause 13 covers the meaning of the word &ldquo;caravan&rdquo; and seeks to update the  definition in line with that which applies in England and Wales. The current  legal definition of a caravan is contained in the Caravans Act (NI) 1963 under  the section that deals with district council caravan site licences. The DOE has  administrative responsibility for that Act. To qualify for a caravan site  licence, the applicant must have planning permission to use the land as a  caravan site.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are also planning implications for structures that  are regarded as caravans for the purposes of planning control, as the  stationing of caravans on land is considered as development that requires  planning permission. We have been advised that the Department of the  Environment supports clause 13, which also provides the Department with the  ability to adjust the maximum dimensions of caravans in the future should it  decide to align those dimensions with future revised standards for caravan  manufacture.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Similar powers exist in the Department for Communities and  Local Government in England, and there is seen to be advantage in having  control over maximum dimensions for caravans when it comes to planning control.  That power will be introduced by subordinate legislation, subject to consultation  with the people whom the Department determines to be stakeholders, and it is  proposed that that power should be subject to negative resolution through the  Assembly. The Environment Committee will be happy to look closely at that  clause and the delegated power in particular on behalf of the Social  Development Committee and report back to that Committee with its views.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee also looks forward to receiving a briefing  from Mr McCallister at its meeting on 1 July 2010. No doubt, he will receive as  many questions as he did today. On behalf of the Committee, I support the  principles of the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Investment (Mr A Maginness)</strong>: I  welcome the Caravans Bill. I also take the opportunity to welcome the new  Minister for Social Development, Mr Attwood. I know that he will do a great job  and that he will distinguish himself as well as the previous occupant of that  office, Margaret Ritchie. I wish him well.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Investment is  generally supportive of the Bill. It is appropriate to congratulate Mr  McCallister on bringing the Bill to the House. A great deal of work has  obviously gone into preparing the Bill, with a great deal of consultation  taking place with many different bodies and Members. Mr McCallister has also,  importantly, won the support of the Administration.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clearly, there is an absence of regulation for caravans, a  lack of legal protection for the occupants of those caravans and, in a sense,  an absence of certainty in the law, which could, equally, protect caravan site  owners. Therefore, it is important for us, as a legislature, to consider the  situation carefully and to draw up sensible provisions to give statutory  protection to the occupiers of caravans on residential and seasonal sites. This  private Member&rsquo;s Bill is an important and significant piece of work, and I  congratulate the Member on introducing it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill applies mostly to occupiers of residential  caravans and is, therefore, mainly a matter for the Committee for Social  Development. However, clauses 7 and 8 apply to occupiers of seasonal sites,  and, for that reason, it is anticipated that agreement will be reached with the  Committee for Social Development to allow the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and  Investment to consider those two clauses during the Committee Stage. I welcome  my Committee&rsquo;s participation in this important Bill, which will introduce a  level of protection for occupiers of residential caravans that is similar to  that in Britain. It will also give much greater protection than exists in  Britain to caravan owners on seasonal sites. That is important to note.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The discussion has been interesting so far. Although we  have strayed into the Bill&rsquo;s greater detail, Second Stage debates are supposed  to consider merely the general principles of the Bill. The robust, skilful and  informative manner in which Mr McCallister has dealt with the points that have  been raised means that there will be fruitful debate and dialogue on the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I again commend Mr McCallister for introducing the Bill,  and I wish him well as it progresses through the Assembly. There may be details  on which the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Investment may take a  different or more critical view, but there is general support for the Bill  among Committee members, and I welcome it.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  Like other Members, I support the Second Stage of the Caravans Bill. I  congratulate John McCallister on bringing it to the Assembly and withstanding  the barrage of questions that he received earlier. It all makes for a very  interesting debate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">All Members agree that improvements are necessary to ensure  that caravan and caravan site owners get a fair deal. It would appear that, in  the recent past, some felt that they were not getting a fair crack of the whip,  and that has led to many disappointments and disagreements. The Caravans Bill  is designed to legislate for Northern Ireland so that safeguards are in place  for everyone in the caravan industry.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am delighted to represent the constituency of Strangford  where there are magnificent caravan sites. Those sites are in locations that  stretch from Portaferry on the tip of the Ards Peninsula to Cloghy, Portavogie,  Ballyhalbert, Ballywalter and Millisle on the eastern Irish Sea coast and into  our neighbouring North Down constituency to Donaghadee and Groomsport. With so  many idyllic caravan site locations in my constituency and nearby, I want  nothing but the best for everyone engaged in the industry.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill will specify the definition of a caravan and will,  as I understand it, bring Northern Ireland into line with best practice across  the water. The aim is to provide protection for owners of caravans, mobile  homes or park homes who rent their pitch from a site owner by making it an  offence to harass or to interfere with the peace and/or comfort of the  occupiers. It also places a statutory duty on the Department for Social  Development. I am delighted to see in our presence our new Minister, Mr  Attwood. I congratulate him on his appointment, and I am sure that he is  anxious to get his teeth into the Caravans Bill as his introduction to the  role. I am sure that he will fill the office well.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department for Social Development will require that the  owner of a caravan, mobile home or park home site gives a written agreement &mdash;  John made much of that written agreement &mdash; to all existing residents who own  their caravan, mobile home or park home and rent their pitch from the site  owner by a specific date. In the case of proposed occupiers, a written agreement  will be required before an agreement on letting stance is made. It will be a  requirement to ensure that the terms of such written agreements are approved by  the Department. The Bill aims to empower the Minister to make all necessary  regulations and to enable the enforcement of responsibilities for caravan,  mobile home and park home residents and site owners.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Much more could be said, will be said and has already been  said on the subject. I conclude by saying that my party supports the Bill and  wishes it well through the House. The end result must be that caravan owners  enjoy their caravan and site owners provide them with a first-class service. I  support the motion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>: I  welcome the Bill, which offers caravan owners not only protection but clarity.  I have a couple of concerns, which I will mention at the end of my speech.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Caravanning is popular in Northern Ireland, especially at a  time of recession. The Bill will provide a protection similar to that afforded  to those who live in rented accommodation. It will also clarify a number of  issues, which is beneficial to caravan owners and the many caravan enthusiasts  throughout Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome Part 1, which gives owners and occupiers of  caravans the necessary protection in stationing a caravan on a protected site  to use it as a main residence for periods exceeding three months. Caravan  owners will be provided with a written agreement from the owner of the land  that includes details of where they are entitled to station their caravan and  the terms and conditions of using the site.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the details listed under clause 10, which gives  owners or occupiers protections similar to those for people who face eviction  from their normal home. It upholds the law by requiring owners of protected  sites to follow the process of the law through the courts. The Bill outlines a  number of acts that are deemed illegal, including the removal of a caravan from  a site without lawful reason and refusing the use of caravan site facilities to  any of the occupants of a caravan. I welcome that clarity. Clause 5 deals with  what happens to a caravan should an owner or occupier die, and that clarity  also has to be welcomed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr McClarty] in the Chair)</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill provides protection for owners of protected sites  and sets out what actions they can take for non-payment of rent but, overall,  upholds the law.<span class="SectionMarker"><em><span style="font-size:14.0pt; "> </span></em></span></p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Once again, that is similar to the laws under which  landlords of houses operate.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">1.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome particularly the definition of a caravan, which  is set out in Part 4, clause 13. Clause 13(1) states:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;In this Act &ldquo;caravan&rdquo; means any structure designed or  adapted for human habitation which is capable of being moved from one place to  another (whether by being towed, or by being transported on a motor vehicle or  trailer) and any motor vehicle so designed or adapted&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the Bill in principle, but I have some concerns.  I mentioned already my concern that caravan owners will be forced to upgrade  their caravans even if they are in immaculate condition. Perhaps the Committee  will delve further into that issue. I also have concerns about the proposal to  allow caravan owners to sell their caravans to people other than site owners.  Although I welcome that, I have discovered that some site owners refuse to  allow anyone on to their sites to take caravans away. That, in effect, forces  caravan owners to sell their caravans to site owners, so that issue must also  be considered.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Overall, I welcome the Bill. It is a good start, but some  tweaking may be needed, which we will undertake during Committee Stage.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr W Clarke</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. First, I congratulate Alex Attwood  on his appointment as Minister for Social Development. I hope that he will  enjoy the job.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the Bill and what it endeavours to do. I thank  John McCallister for persevering with the Bill. As he said, it has been a long  process. One Saturday afternoon in 2007, John and I went to a public meeting at  a church hall in Newcastle that was attended by angry caravan owners. We  expected a quiet meeting, but TV cameras and Stephen Nolan were there.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Things have moved on since then, and a lot of the issues  have been outlined by Members from the other side of the House during the  debate. John McCallister talked about getting the balance right between caravan  owners and caravan park owners. I will not rehearse the arguments concerning  static homes. It seems that arbitration is needed on the price of a caravan  that has been sold. There is a need for park owners to maintain the quality of  their sites, to ensure that certain celebrities do not get on to the sites, and  that they have a say in who obtains a caravan. That has to be monitored  closely, and, as has been outlined, drug dealers, people who run brothels and  sex offenders might seek to exploit weaknesses and to look for loopholes in the  legislation. I do not think that this is just rhetoric. The Committee will have  a greater opportunity to consider the issues in detail during Committee Stage  and will be able to hold evidence sessions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The majority of caravan owners are good businesspeople, and  they have a great relationship with their clients. It must be understood that,  in the majority of cases, it works extremely well. The biggest issue relates to  the contracts and written agreements that are mentioned in the Bill. If people  know what they are getting into, everything is clear and above board.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mary Bradley discussed depreciation in the value of  caravans and that people felt that they were being ripped off. I do not know  whether some form of independent valuation of caravans takes place when they  are being sold, but it might help in some way if an independent valuation was  printed and made available at caravan sites, so that it can be seen by anyone who  comes to buy a caravan. The amount for which a caravan was sold should also be  clearly displayed, so that people can see the margins that are at play. It is a  matter of balance. A huge number of caravan site owners operate in South Down,  and they have said that if they do not get a better margin with regard to the  sale of caravans, they will have to increase their site fees. We have to take  people at face value in that regard.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I remember other issues that were raised at the public  meeting. People felt that they did not have a right to complain, that their  voices were not being heard and that they were being bullied. The ethos of the  Bill is about trying to enshrine the rights of both the caravan owner and the  caravan park owner. There was talk even that people who were raising genuine  concerns about utilities, for instance, and the quality and pressure of the  water were being called troublemakers. Some people were not able to get a  shower, and people with young children were also being affected. Those are some  of the genuine issues.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Caravan park owners ended up telling caravan owners that  they knew what they could do if they did not like the arrangements. A caravan  owner was told to take himself off, and the park owner told him that he would  tow his caravan to the bottom of the park and leave it there, giving him one  week to take it somewhere else. For that privilege, the caravan owner was  charged &pound;500, and then he had to hire a haulage contractor. There were a number  of concerns, and things got out of control.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Billy Leonard made a point about public authorities having  a role above and beyond their current one, which relates more to environmental  health and fire and public safety. There is an argument for a greater role, and  it should be explored at the next stage.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">During the Committee for Social Development&rsquo;s evidence  session with John McCallister, there was discussion about the Travelling  community, and questions were raised about whether that community would have  greater protection with regard to contracts with the Housing Executive. Perhaps  it would be more appropriate for the Social Development Minister to talk about  that. Will there be a similar agreement and a bit more recognition of both  sides of the argument in that regard?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The servicing of caravans is another issue, and I do not  want to get into it too much. However, will the servicing arrangements in  relation to utilities such as water and electricity and the likes of patios,  decking and storage provision be bought through owners, or will it be possible  to purchase them from qualified people off site from whom they may be cheaper?  I would like some clarification on that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I agree with John McCallister that we need to strike a  balance, and we will have a greater opportunity to do that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">People buy caravans to use for holidays or for retirement;  that is their choice, and that is what they do. They want to have peace of  mind, because they are putting vast amounts of money into their purchase. Some  of the people who choose to buy a caravan are recuperating from illness; some  are trying to get away from it all; and some are looking to retire. Life  savings are put into the purchase, so if the Bill is endeavouring to provide  peace of mind, it has to be welcomed by everyone in the House.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Perhaps Mr McCallister will expand on the procedures that  will be followed in cases of antisocial behaviour. Will PSNI evidence be  required? Will there be written agreements or contracts? Will it be a matter  for councils&rsquo; environmental health services?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I do not want to hold up the debate any longer. I could go  into a lot more detail, but I have covered the broad principles of the Bill. I  am happy for the Bill to proceed to the next stage, and I look forward to  making further contributions. I thank John for bringing forward the Bill. Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>:  This debate has shown that when the vice-like grip of a five-minute ceiling is  removed from debates, this becomes a true debating Chamber, where those, such  as Mary Bradley, who have been shrinking violets, suddenly become great  orators, because they know that they have a chance to expand on their arguments  and will not find you, Mr Deputy Speaker, constantly badgering them and telling  them that they have to stop. Maybe we have learnt a lesson here today that we  need to lift the ceiling more often in debates so that we can tease out  arguments.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I congratulate Mr McCallister, and I hope that he will not  quote that back at me in next week&rsquo;s &lsquo;Mourne Observer&rsquo;. He stood there for a  good hour and defended his Bill with great rigour and strength of argument. We  may not agree entirely with what he said, and no doubt we will pick holes in  his arguments in Committee, but it was a lesson in how the Assembly should  perform. People will turn on their televisions and not be bored out of their  minds, as they are when some Members rattle through five-minute speeches at 100  mph and then hand them straight to &lsquo;The Coleraine Chronicle&rsquo;, &lsquo;The Newtownards  Chronicle&rsquo; or the &lsquo;Mourne Observer&rsquo;. Those Members might as well write out  their speeches and hand them to the newspaper editors. What are we doing here  if all we do is stand up and read out speeches?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Today&rsquo;s debate has been quite refreshing, and I know that  the incoming Minister, Mr Attwood, is enjoying it. We have spent most of the  past two hours sharpening our teeth and our knives ready for his first  appearance as Minister at the Dispatch Box. He will discover why his  predecessor, Ms Ritchie, resigned at 9.00 am this morning rather than 4.00 pm  this afternoon, because she has left him right in it, as it were, to defend the  Bill. Therefore, it is a baptism of fire for him.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I went to Queen&rsquo;s University with Mr Attwood. I remember  him as a rookie fresher in 1977, and I know that he is more than able to answer  any points that are made. Who would have thought that that young lad from west  Belfast, who came to Queen&rsquo;s University in his short trousers all those years  ago, would rise to the exceptionally powerful position of Minister for Social  Development? What a massive rise. A plaque will probably be erected on the  Falls Road to say that Alex Attwood lived there 40 years ago.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Will the Member return to the subject?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>: I  knew that the vice-like grip would once again return. I think that I have been  got for deviation rather than for repetition.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">To return to the issue of the private Members&rsquo; Bill, we  gave Mr McCallister a difficult grilling earlier, but I welcome the Bill, and I  wish the Member for South Down every success because he has dealt with an issue  that has caused a lot of concern. Some 13,000 people in Northern Ireland have  some form of caravan, whether it is a static caravan in a holiday park or a permanent  dwelling, but not everywhere is affected by the issue. It is very much an East  Londonderry, North Antrim, South Down and Strangford issue, where the vast bulk  of the caravan sites are located, and it is an extremely difficult issue for  people who own or rent those caravans.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will give a few examples of some of the abuses that I  have encountered. It is no exaggeration to say that people sign away all human  rights the moment that they go through the gates of some caravan sites, while  other sites are extremely well run, have a family atmosphere and do not seem to  need any of those draconian powers. Mr Leonard quoted an example that I concur with.  I know the site that the Member referred to because my mother has a pitch on  it, and I spent many happy days there. It is run by Coleraine Borough Council,  although I noticed that Mr Leonard did not declare an interest, and it is run  effectively. Everyone is happy there; there is a wonderful family atmosphere  and it is very well maintained, yet it does not seem to want to call upon the  rules that private site owners in other parts of Northern Ireland feel that  they need in order to maintain the same atmosphere.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My first introduction to the misuse of rules on caravan  sites was when I met a lady in Dundrum. She purchased her caravan two years  earlier for &pound;18,000. However, sadly, she was diagnosed with a serious form of  cancer. As a result of those changes in circumstances, she had to sell her  caravan back to the owner of the site. She was offered &pound;11,000, so it had depreciated  &pound;7,000 in two years. It was a palace; it was immaculate. However, she had no  option other than to sell the caravan back to the site owner. She did so  reluctantly. She called by chance to the caravan site a few weeks later and, to  her horror, found the same van for sale at &pound;17,500. If that is not abuse of a  monopoly position, what is?</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">1.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I visited another caravan site in South Down where a lady,  who had kept her caravan immaculate for nine years, received a letter from the  site owner that told her that she must change her caravan by the end of next  year; that the only person whom she could buy her new caravan from was the site  owner; that the site owner would decide how much she would pay; and that the  site owner would buy her old caravan off her at a price that he deemed  appropriate. She would have to pay a king&rsquo;s ransom for a new caravan. There was  no indication of the caravan&rsquo;s condition in that judgement.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I listened to Mr McCallister&rsquo;s comments. I notice that he  has been silent during my contribution. He has obviously been pinned to the  wall by the force of my argument. He made the point that a site&rsquo;s character  must not be destroyed by a row of dilapidated caravans that are 30 or 40 years  old and in poor condition. I agree with him. I think that everyone agrees.  However, the 10-year rule is entirely harsh because it takes no account of a  caravan&rsquo;s condition. That really perplexes me.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Now, we are really paying the price for lifting the five-minute ceiling on  speeches. The Member referred to remarks that I made. My point is that the Bill  improves the situation for caravan owners because they will have those terms in  black and white and will, therefore, know what they sign up for.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Does the Member accept that the caravan industry relies on  caravan sales and not on pitch fees alone? If the right to trade caravans were  removed, pitch fees would rise exponentially. I support the idea that we look  at what mechanisms can be used to minimise the type of abuse that the Member  highlighted.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>:  That is the same as the owners of a Ford dealership in Kilkeel saying that if  they are not allowed to increase their servicing fees, they must increase the  price of their cars, or vice versa, in a situation in which there is no  competition. The difficulty is that those people are trapped in caravan sites.  There is no fair, level playing field or open market. I do not like that idea,  particularly when councils can run their sites without invoking such strict  controls. I am unhappy when people, who are effectively in a monopoly position,  argue that if they must reduce a certain income, they must increase other  charges. They could, in fact, reduce their profits.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I mentioned the elderly couple who had to buy a new caravan  from a site owner. They got a derisory fee &mdash; around &pound;3,000 &mdash; for their old van.  It was moved off the site. However, the couple were not that slow. They googled  and checked the local press. The found the van on resale for three times the  price that they were paid for it. That happens time after time. No one can tell  me that that is a reasonable return or that that should be tolerated.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have discovered that more insidious activities go on. For  example, at one site in my constituency, caravan owners are charged &pound;400 each  to insure their caravans. I can accept why insurance is compulsory. However, I  find it extremely difficult to accept that the same caravans can be insured  with the Caravan Club for &pound;130 each. Indeed, if the site owner had gone to the  Caravan Club and bought a group policy, he could probably have got it for  around &pound;90 per van. Yet, he charges each van owner &pound;400 per annum. Where does  the profit go? Obviously, it goes to the site owner.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  One difficulty that we encountered when we looked at insurance is that the level  of cover can vary. As you probably know from your experiences, Mr Deputy  Speaker, insurance companies are keen to get out of paying. Sometimes, cheaper  insurance covers a caravan only for a limited time. Caravans must be insured  for the entire year in case something happens during the winter months. For  example, a roof could be blown off and could damage other caravans. I agree  that caravan owners should be able to shop around. It is perfectly reasonable  for site owners to want to see copies of people&rsquo;s insurance certificates. I  strongly support caravan owners&rsquo; right to shop around and to get the best  insurance deal. I have no issue with that whatsoever.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>: I  am relieved to hear that. However, the couple who I dealt with, after receiving  a bill for &pound;400, asked elsewhere for identical cover to that which was provided  by the site owner and were quoted a figure that was &pound;270 less per annum. It  does not take a genius to work out how lucrative it can be if there are more  than 100 caravans on a site and the owner is making at least &pound;300 on each of  them on insurance alone.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have come across a further ploy &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Will the Member accept that that is one of the great strengths of a written  agreement? If a written agreement stated that one must buy insurance from a  site owner, it would be deemed unfair.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>:  Yes. However, that is the Rubicon between the honourable Member and me. If I  were presented with a contract at the door of a caravan site, I could read it  to ascertain whether it was fair and whether I was happy with it; if not, I  could walk away. The problem is that the vast majority of those who will get  contracts are the 13,000 people and their families who might have been on a  site for decades. There is a huge inertia, because they do not want to move off  a site.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I do not know how long my family has been on the Coleraine  Borough Council site, but it must be at least 30 or 40 years. It would have to  be a horrendously onerous contract to force my family to leave that site.  Established occupants are, therefore, not in as strong a bargaining position as  new customers. The only consolation that many of those people may have is that  although it may be horrendously onerous, at least they have a contract. That is  no reassurance. The contract could say that they must move every 10 years, that  they must insure through the site owner, and sell the caravan back and buy a  new one from the site owner. The only consolation that the poor caravan owner  will have is that at least they have it on a piece of paper that they are being  fleeced. However, that offers no consolation. I am trying to tease out from the  honourable Member how his Bill will solve that problem.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  By putting it in black in white. If the terms of a contract are deemed unfair,  they are not enforceable by a site owner and will not stand up in any court  judgement or with the Trading Standards Service. A site owner does not have the  power to write a wish list into a contract and to say that a person must sign  it or get out. The terms of a contract have to be deemed fair and reasonable. I  hope that that provides Mr Wells with the reassurance that he needs that a  contract is a good thing, as people will not have to rely on a conversation  that might have been held 10 or 15 years ago; they will have it in black and  white. Site owners cannot put unfair clauses in contracts; if they do, the  contracts will be unenforceable.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>:  The honourable Member can frame this: for the first and only time, he will find  me agreeing with Mr Willie Clarke in the Assembly. Mr Clarke gave an example &mdash;  I know the one that he means, because I was involved in the case &mdash; where a  gentlemen was making what, in my opinion, were very reasonable representations  about the state of the swimming pool at a site. Because he gathered together a  group of residents of the caravan park, which will remain nameless, and met  both Mr Clarke and Mr McCallister at a public meeting &mdash; perhaps that is where  he went wrong &mdash; he arrived a few days later to find his caravan across the road  in a field, with a sign on it stating that he must take his caravan away and  that he was a troublemaker.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The difficulty with Mr McCallister&rsquo;s suggestion is that  those contracts will be produced and there will be what most people regard as  unreasonable terms. What is to stop a caravan site owner telling people that  they must sign the contract or get off the site? If there is no contract,  nothing can be enforceable.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Leonard</strong>:  Does the Member share my concerns about the references in the Bill to the  detail of possible contracts? That would have to be tied down, and a great deal  of guidance would have to be given about the nature of contracts. Does he  further agree with me that there may need to be an arbiter to consider  contracts&rsquo; fairness? If it is left open to the market, different views will be  taken by different site owners.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>:  Absolutely, and that is the beauty of Committee Stage. Unfortunately, the  Chairperson of the Committee is no longer here, but I understand that the  Committee for Social Development has drawn the short straw and will be  scrutinising the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Somewhere along the line, the Department may recommend a  definition for a reasonable contract. That will be the yardstick against which  everything is measured. At the moment, I have a difficulty with the fact that  of the 13,000 people who will get a contract, some will regard it as reasonable  and some will think that it is absolutely diabolical. Unfortunately, those who  do not want to move will be stuck. If they refuse to sign a contract, they will  simply be shown the door. What is the solution in that case?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  We are debating the broad principles of the Bill, so I do not want to get too  bogged down. The contract provides a solution in that site owners cannot simply  impose terms. As we have heard, site owners run businesses. Therefore, they  will not want to disenfranchise 10,000 of their customers in one year. Measures  must be brought in by degree. The Trading Standards Service also has the power  to review contracts, so caravan owners will not even have to seek expensive  legal advice to deal with that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member referred to a case in our South Down  constituency. The person whose caravan was removed would have had the power to  take court action had a contract been in place. In fact, I think that that  person could take court action at this stage, even before the Bill proceeds any  further, because what happened may be deemed unfair under consumer regulations.  That individual should, therefore, pursue a case. A written contract will put  caravan owners in a much stronger position to take legal action.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>: I  accept the Member&rsquo;s point that a written contract is a good thing, because at  least people will know that they are being fleeced. It is good to know that  that will be written into a contract. A contract will provide no reassurance to  the little old lady who is just about to be evicted from her caravan site.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I still feel that the Department should give broad guidance  about what constitutes reasonableness with respect to the content of a  contract. We must ask ourselves why many people are holidaying in caravans. No  doubt, the honourable Member for South Down and his young wife jet off to  Lanzarote or Florida for their holidays and can afford to have a holiday  abroad. However, caravanning is the only form of holiday that lots of families  in Northern Ireland and South Down can afford. Those folk often tend to have  quite low incomes and are not in a position to acquire the knowledge or resources  to take a case to court. Those difficulties and burdens will always have to be  overcome.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Earlier, I quoted the case of a lady who was given a  ridiculous price for her caravan. It was only by chance that I met her during  election time and was able to refer her to the Office of Fair Trading. She was  able to get some redress through the office, and that was very good. However, I  do not think that it is particularly good to put people in a position whereby  the only way out of their predicament is through court action, because 90% of  citizens will run a mile if they are forced to do that. Perhaps the Committee &mdash;  again, this is the beauty of Committee Stage &mdash; should look at getting some  guidance from the Department about the 10-year rule, which is not reasonable.  The reasonableness test should be based on the state of the caravan, not its  age. Charging three times the market rate for insurance is also not reasonable.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Another issue concerns a practice at some sites in South  Down. Until recently, if a caravan had a leaky roof or needed rewiring, the  owner rang a local spark or plumber and said, &ldquo;Fred, come down and fix my  caravan.&rdquo; Now, owners cannot do that. Instead, they have to go, cap in hand, to  the site owner to be told which contractor they must use. The contractor will  then charge for the work, and the caravan owner will pay the site owner for it.  The problem is that that way of doing things will always involve a site owner  placing a significant mark-up on the cost. Everything seems to be arranged  against poor caravan owners, who are often not the sorts of people who are  articulate enough to voice their concerns, and they, therefore, feel  intimidated.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Let us not throw the baby out with the bathwater. We have  given Mr McCallister a difficult time, but he is more than capable of taking  it. He voluntarily decided to introduce the private Member&rsquo;s Bill. His Bill  will be all the better for having been tested in the fires of the Floor of the  Chamber and in the Social Development Committee. Let us send it off with our  blessing to the Committee, which can tease out the crucial issues.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">All our difficulties with the Bill concentrate on the  uneven relationship between a site owner and a caravan owner.<span class="SectionMarker"><em><span style="font-size:14.0pt; "> </span></em></span></p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am slightly worried about the main thrust of Mr McCallister&rsquo;s  argument, which is that site owners must be given incredible, Genghis Khan-type  powers of control over their empires in order to stop the mythical undesirable  family from moving on to a site. There must be some mechanism achievable  whereby the type of people &mdash; be it a family or an elderly couple &mdash; coming on to  a site can be controlled while still affording other caravan owners decent  treatment. I ask the Committee to consider that difficult issue to see whether  it can be dealt with in some way. As it stands, the Bill gives far too many  powers to site owners in order to prevent what is an occasional situation from  arising.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">To be fair to Mr McCallister, I accept that that situation does  arise. I know of two such examples in my constituency, one of which involved a  gentleman who had been accused of child sex abuse, and who was subsequently  convicted, moving on to a caravan site in South Down. Under the existing  powers, the owner was able to move him off the site immediately at the behest  of 99% of site owners. The other example involved a caravan site on which a  group of young gentlemen were trading in substances that are not yet legal and,  hopefully, never will be. Again, the owner had the power to remove them. It is  important in those circumstances to have those powers. However, I do not  believe that that justifies the huge control that the legislation will give to  site owners.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Apart from that, there is a great deal of merit in the Bill.  Private Member&rsquo;s Bills at Westminster do not have a tremendous success rate,  and I do not know of too many that have been successful here. However, I wish  the Member well and I will be very interested to see what the Committee comes  back with on this important matter.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kinahan</strong>:  It may surprise some Members, but I, too, am very pleased to speak to the  Second Stage of the Caravans Bill. There is a caravan site on the lough shore  in South Antrim that is well worth considering for a visit or a holiday.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">This matter is extremely important to very many people,  especially those for whom a caravan is the only way of being able to enjoy the  freedom of living in their own home. In many cases, we are talking about a  person&rsquo;s only home. We are also talking about people&rsquo;s ability to enjoy a  holiday without any stresses and strains, which is how one wants it when having  a break.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I congratulate my colleague, his team and the Department  for their hard work. We have seen, through today&rsquo;s barrage of questions and  queries, that John knows his facts and details. Yes, many issues need to be  sorted out at Committee Stage, but we know that the Bill has been looked at  thoroughly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill is essential, because there are issues with  caravan sites that desperately need to be resolved. I am pleased to see this  type of matter being dealt with in the House, which shows the very best of our  legislative system. However, there have been moments today when the five-minute  rule might have been worth applying. During a legislative stage of another  Bill, I listened to a certain Member speak for three and a half hours, only  half an hour of which was worth listening to, the rest being point scoring and  petty innuendo. I agree that we should be more lenient in allowing Members time  to speak, but mainly when there is no political point scoring to be done.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill provides, for the first time, a statutory  requirement for a written agreement between site owners and caravan owners. It  lays down certain provisions that must be included in that agreement and  protects the rights of both sides, as is its intention. It improves  transparency so that both sides know what is in the document and what they are  signing up to. As was raised in a key question at the beginning of the debate,  the Bill would apply to contracts that are already in place as well as to those  that are signed in future. Some unscrupulous site owners had more influence  than caravan owners, and the Bill redresses that imbalance. I say again that  the Bill is designed to protect both sides.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill also provides for clear succession rights, both  within the family and to others who may be nominated. That is a vital  provision, because, as Members know, some caravans are extremely expensive.  That was hinted at earlier, with references to people paying &pound;40,000, &pound;50,000  and &pound;60,000, which are huge sums, for caravans. In the tragic event of an  owner&rsquo;s death, it is essential for such succession rights to be clear.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Caravan owners must be free from harassment by site owners,  and, equally, site owners must be confident that pitches will be maintained to  a certain standard by suitable owners. The Bill makes it an offence for a site  owner to withhold any service or to carry out any act that would interfere with  the enjoyment of a caravan for the purpose of intimidating an owner to the  extent that he or she leaves the site.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will not go into the Bill&rsquo;s many other important clauses  today. I look forward to examining the Bill at the Environment Committee,  although our role will be small. We will examine the definitions of a caravan  and consider the Bill&rsquo;s implications for the work of councils. I am concerned  about instances in which a council owns a site and its caravans. The Committee  will have to examine that issue. Today has shown that there will be some debate  on what is reasonable or unreasonable as far as the law and the Departments are  concerned. Therefore, we need more guidance on that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Again, I congratulate my colleague John McCallister and the  Committee for Social Development on their work. I particularly commend them on  their thorough consultation, which demonstrates to all Members that  consultation means meeting people, listening to them, taking their points on  board and, if necessary, changing legislation. I support the Bill and look  forward to Committee Stage and thereafter.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  I commend John McCallister for placing the issue into a modern legislative  framework, which should offer protection to caravan owners and establish their  rights as contributors to the life of holiday parks and the economy. Reasonable  site owners will work with their residents to create a better environment and  to install better facilities for everyone.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Today&rsquo;s debate has been extremely intense. John was subject  to a heavy grilling and defended his Bill well. The Bill, when it incorporates  the changes that I hope will be made after today&rsquo;s discussion, will increase  the number of people who invest in holiday homes. Over the past few years, the  abuse of an unregulated system led many people to give up their holiday homes.  The most recent legislative changes happened in 1963, which was some 47 years  ago. In light of that, changes must be made to the system, but they must  benefit the owners and users of the sites. All I ask for is a Bill that  protects people&rsquo;s rights on both sides, so that everyone can enjoy caravan  sites. Northern Ireland has some lovely sites, and it is a shame that certain  situations mean that people cannot rest easy on some of them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I look forward to the next stage of the Bill. I hope that  the Bill is successful and that everyone supports it.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I call the Minister for Social Development, Mr Alex Attwood.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>:  Time.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development (Mr Attwood)</strong>: That was the first &ldquo;time&rdquo; of many, I am  sure.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Jim Wells accurately referred to John McCallister&rsquo;s taking  of interventions during the debate as &ldquo;extraordinarily generous&rdquo;. The way in  which the Member for South Down handled himself was not only extraordinarily  generous, but enormously competent. He gave a fine parliamentary performance.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Boylan suggested that, after today&rsquo;s debate, Mr  McCallister may want to go on a caravan holiday. Once Mr McCallister has taken  the Bill through all its stages, I suggest that we perhaps have a collection to  offer him more than just a caravan holiday, welcome though that would be.  Indeed, we may see that in subsequent times.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I also thank everyone who contributed to the debate. Mr  Wells reflected on the fact that the debate was one of quality and robust  exchange. Indeed, there has been good consideration of some of the many  material issues that arise from the Bill. It reflected well on the Assembly  that the quality of the debate measured up to the importance of the issue that  is under discussion.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank Mr McCallister for his opening remarks and for  bringing forward this important piece of legislation. I am delighted and  pleased that the Department was, as Mr Hamilton said, able to assist in  redrafting the Bill. I commend Margaret Ritchie for her work in helping the  Bill to reach this stage, and I look forward to playing an equivalent role in  moving forward.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I ask whether I could take a little time to acknowledge the  contribution of the former Minister for Social Development not only to this  Bill but to politics in the North over the past three years. I also acknowledge  her role as the Minister for Social Development. She has demonstrated, perhaps  more than any other Minister, what it means to go into government and into  power and what it means to try to address the needs of those who are in need,  be they caravan owners or people who are in poverty or disadvantage. The  fearlessness that she demonstrated throughout her three years as Minister and  her tireless service, as well as her commitment and conviction to politics  addressing the needs of the powerless, will stand the test of time. I hope  that, in some small way, I can measure up to the legacy that she has left.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I also thank other Ministers and their officials for their  support in bringing the Bill to its Second Stage. I thank in particular the  First Minister and deputy First Minister for providing access to the expertise  of the Office of the Legislative Counsel. I also thank Ministers Foster and  Poots for their contributions to Parts 2 and 4 respectively of the Bill. Just  as I think that the debate reflected well on the Assembly, the way in which the  Bill came before the Assembly, with the assistance of three other Departments  and four other Ministers, demonstrates a coherent, cohesive and productive way  of managing business on behalf of the people of Northern Ireland. The Bill is a  good expression of democratic practice and good government on behalf of the  people of Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As we heard from all the contributions, the Caravans Bill  is a much needed piece of legislation that is designed to protect the rights of  caravan owners and residents. I intend to touch on some of the issues that  Members raised.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill will provide residential caravan owners and  occupants with the same rights as their counterparts elsewhere in Britain.  Although there are only a small number of residential caravans in Northern  Ireland &mdash; an area that is subject to Part 1 of the Bill &mdash; there are signs that  that number is growing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I trust that the Bill will do much to generate a new  confidence in the park homes sector that will benefit caravan owners and park  owners alike. I also trust that it will create new discipline among those caravan  site owners who have committed error in the past or who have been on the wrong  side of best practice. The Bill will also provide holiday caravan owners with a  level of protection beyond that which holiday caravan owners elsewhere in the  United Kingdom enjoy. The measures represent a balanced approach, giving a  degree of peace of mind to the estimated 14,000 holiday caravan owners in  Northern Ireland, without imposing any undue burdens on good caravan park  operators.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The main interest of my Department in the Bill is in Parts  1 and 3, which relate to residential caravans. Such caravans are commonly  referred to as mobile homes, or park homes.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Part 1 of the Bill provides a detailed statutory framework  for protecting the rights of residential caravan owners who live on approved  sites. That framework centres on a requirement for written agreements to be in  place between site owners and caravan owners, for a series of detailed terms to  be applied in any agreements and for courts to have the authority to hear a  range of matters relating to residential agreements.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As mentioned earlier, Part 1 is based on the Mobile Homes  Act 1983, as amended, and it reflects recent changes in the law in England,  following reviews of its park homes industry. It is good legislation; it has  been proven to work, and I trust that when the Bill passes through all its  stages, it will be proven to work here as well.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Part 3 of the Bill offers protection from harassment and  unlawful eviction to those who own or rent a residential caravan on an approved  site. Part 3 is based on the Caravan Sites Act 1968, as amended, and it  protects the rights of residential caravan occupiers to peacefully enjoy their  homes. All Members will agree that advances in that regard are to be welcomed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The holiday caravan sector is dealt with in Part 2 of the  Bill. There is already a considerable body of existing consumer protection law  that applies to that sector. Unfortunately, many holiday caravan owners do not  have written agreements with site owners, and that has made it difficult to  ensure effective enforcement of the existing law. The requirement in Part 2 of  the Bill for written agreements to be in place will address that gap. It  represents an important step forward that will put Northern Ireland ahead of  Britain on the issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Part 4 of the Bill updates the definition of a caravan in  line with the definition used in England and Wales. That change is an important  building block, which will provide clarity and help to ensure the effective  application of the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to make some comments on the individual  contributions of Members, which produced a wide-ranging narrative about the  Bill and issues that it may yet seek to address following its Committee and  Consideration Stages. I congratulate Ian Paisley Jnr on being elected to  Westminster in the recent election. He made a number of interventions, which,  curiously, captured attentions in and around the Bill. He rightly pointed out  that Part 1 may extend to only the smaller sector of caravan owners in the  North. At the same time, however, he recognised that it was not desirable to  have what he referred to as the &ldquo;willy-nilly selling of caravans&rdquo; without  licence or control, giving rise to further problems in caravan sites. He  captured the tension between trying to create the maximum degree of protections  for all caravan owners and the need to ensure that there is not a free-for-all,  as was referred to by other Members.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That theme was taken up by Jim Wells, Alban Maginness, Fra  McCann and Alex Easton, who touched on the issue of the right to sell a caravan  and the control of a pitch vested in a caravan site owner. Mr Easton, as did  Mary Bradley, Willie Clarke and Jim Wells, referred to a number of cases &mdash;  which, in my view, are not simply hard cases &mdash; in which a caravan site owner  has engaged in what can only be deemed as exploitative behaviour towards  caravan owners, and, particularly, as Jim Wells pointed out in one case,  vulnerable caravan owners. Mary Bradley and Willie Clarke captured the essence  of that issue by referring to people being ripped off and charged exorbitant  fees for moving a caravan a few yards and to others being refused access to  sites for the purpose of removing their caravan.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Basil McCrea rightly pointed out that all those matters can  be subject to amendments in the Bill when it goes through its Committee and  Consideration Stages. I am not in a position to commit the Department for  Social Development to any further amendments to the Bill. However, I will be  very attentive to its scrutiny by the Social Development Committee to determine  whether reasonable measures can be taken that get the balance right and can add  more to the Bill, if that is deemed necessary.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I will, Mr Wells.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>: I  am honoured to make history by being the first Member to seek an intervention  from the new Minister. Will he and his Department consider issuing guidelines  on what constitutes a reasonable contract? The problems that we have been discussing  could be solved if there were guidelines, possibly non-statutory, indicating  what the Department believes to be a reasonable contract. Those guidelines  could be for the entire industry, and would, it is hoped, get round many of the  problems indicated. Having been Minister for only 12 hours, he may not be able  to give us a categorical view on that point on the hoof, as it were, but it is  something that I think is worth consideration.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I will correct the Member on one point: I have been a  Minister for five hours, and, therefore, I am even more cautious to what  commitments I enter into. If he could come back to me by teatime, I may be able  to make a more generous response to his intervention. I also have to be mindful  that enforcement of regulation falls more to the Minister of Enterprise, Trade  and Investment than to me, but I will commit to having a conversation with the  Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment to consider issues around  contracts in the holiday sector, which were mentioned by Mr Wells and others.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will also ask officials to provide me with a briefing to  capture the current regulations, protections and laws, including those enforced  by the Trading Standards Institute, to create certainty about the rights and  entitlements of caravan owners, especially in the holiday sector, so that  people entering into contracts have a fuller view and insight into their  current protections, guarantees and legal entitlements. I will not make any  particular commitments beyond that at this stage. However, I will take up the  matters that Mr Wells mentioned in his intervention with my officials and with  the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I also thank Mr Wells for his comments on my taking up  office. We share a number of things going back some years. Not only are we of  the same vintage, but we were at college together, we make the same length of  speeches, and we have the same youthful looks. However, unlike me, Mr Wells is  known for his sound and well-judged contributions to debates, which is  something that I wish to follow in the future.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I know that we are pressed for time, but I will respond to  some issues that were touched on in the debate. If there are any other matters  that I have not replied to, I will deal with them by way of correspondence.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Clarke raised the issue of protection for Travellers. I  want to comment on that so that certainty is created. The situation, as I  understand it, is that all Travellers living on NI Housing Executive sites will  have the right to protection from harassment and eviction under Part 3 of the  Bill. However, those rights will be given only to Travellers who live in park  homes; in other words, those who are living in them permanently or nearly  permanently. They will have the protections of Part 1, which is where the meat  of the Bill is located.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Travellers who are on transit or halting sites, given that  those facilitate temporary accommodation, will not have the protections of Part  1 of the Bill as drafted. They will be entitled to other protections in  legislation, but not to the enhanced protections in Part 1 of the Bill. Those  matters can be revisited when the Bill enters its Committee Stage.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am mindful that Question Time is almost upon us. I will  conclude by making particular comments about John McCallister, who has been the  alpha and the omega of the legislation and the debate. I welcome the Bill and  the fact that Mr McCallister has been its architect and its sponsor, and has  taken it to its Second Stage.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As other Members said, Mr McCallister deserves warm  acknowledgement for his work heretofore. After today&rsquo;s debate, he will probably  need much warm encouragement in doing what is required to get the Bill over the  line to Royal Assent.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It may be the only private Member&rsquo;s Bill to get over the  wall and be passed as law during the current Assembly mandate. If that proves  to be the case &mdash; Ms Purvis&rsquo;s private Member&rsquo;s Bill may yet achieve that status  &mdash; it would reflect the importance of the issue and demonstrate the Assembly&rsquo;s  response to the identifiable needs of the communities in the North. It would  also reflect Mr McCallister&rsquo;s personal integrity and authority and, by  association, the work of Margaret Ritchie and other Ministers who helped him to  get the Bill to its current state of preparedness.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill is much needed and, even before amendments, does  much to protect the rights of caravan owners and residents. On behalf of the  Executive and, in particular, the ministerial colleagues to whom I referred, I  welcome the Bill and commend it to the House.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: As Question Time commences at 2.30 pm, I suggest that the House  take its ease until that time. On resumption of the debate after Question Time,  the next Member to speak will be John McCallister, who will respond to and  conclude the debate.</p>

    <p class="OralAnswers-H2DepartmentHeading">Office of the First Minister and  deputy First Minister</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. Question 2 has been withdrawn</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">OFMDFM: Arm&rsquo;s-length Bodies</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">1. <strong>Ms J  McCann </strong>asked the First Minister and the deputy First Minister, given the  possibility of Budget cuts by the new Administration in London, whether they  will ensure that bonuses will be restricted for senior civil servants and  senior personnel in arm&rsquo;s-length bodies for which their Department is  responsible. (AQO 1270/10<a name="AQO1270/10" id="AQO1270/10"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister (Mr P Robinson)</strong>: Pay awards to senior civil servants in the  Northern Ireland Civil Service are determined by the Minister of Finance and  Personnel. No bonus payments were made to senior civil servants as part of the  2009 pay award; a decision has yet to be made on the pay award for 2010. There  will be implications for many arm&rsquo;s-length bodies whose senior staff  contractually follow that award. If no bonuses are awarded to SCS staff for the  2009-2010 reporting year, that policy could be extended to the wider public  sector. Such a decision would need to be agreed by the Executive. In the past,  separate pay and bonus arrangements were in place for the Strategic Investment  Board; however, those are now being brought into line, and no bonuses will be  paid. It should be noted that a key feature of implementing pay policy is the  need to honour contractual entitlements.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  I thank the First Minister for his answer. Given that we now know that there  will be &pound;120 million worth of cuts, does the Minister agree that front line  services and the most disadvantaged and vulnerable should be protected from  proposed cuts?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: I agree with the Member. However, I warn the House that there is  some concentration on the &pound;120-plus million of cuts in this financial year,  should we decide not to defer. Significantly more than that is planned over the  three years of the comprehensive spending review period that will follow. One  of the decisions that the Executive will have to take is whether we defer all  or part of those cuts in this year, remembering that we would have to bear a  heavier burden in the following year.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kinahan</strong>:  Given concerns about cuts, I wonder whether the First Minister and other  Ministers will follow the example of the Prime Minister and his Cabinet and  take an immediate 5% pay cut.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: That sounds like a good idea for the Assembly as a whole; I am  sure that the Member will want to join in such a proposal. If he tables such a  motion, I will support it.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Does the First Minister agree with the  Minister for Social Development that there should be a thorough review of the  number of senior civil servants? Does he further agree that his own Department  should be examined to see whether it justifies having more than 20 senior civil  servants?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: The average across all Departments is about 20 senior civil  servants. The number of such civil servants has remained steady in Northern  Ireland since the mid-1990s, whereas at Whitehall the number of senior civil  servants has increased by 39%.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">If the Member wants as good a comparison as I can give him  from the Irish Republic, the middle and higher levels of the Irish Civil  Service have increased by 82%. Therefore, Northern Ireland has maintained its  levels, and, compared with Great Britain and the Republic, it has done very  well.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member is aware that, as a result of recent efficiencies,  we reduced the number of civil servants in OFMDFM by 51, two or three of whom  were, I believe, senior civil servants.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>: How  does the Northern Ireland Executive&rsquo;s position on bonuses last year compare  with that of Whitehall? What is the First Minister&rsquo;s Department doing to ensure  that arm&rsquo;s-length bodies are following the Senior Civil Service position?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: Whitehall did not introduce a policy of stopping the bonuses of  senior civil servants. This Administration has led the way in that respect. In  relation to the pay of employees outside the Civil Service, the Strategic  Investment Board is the one body that lay outside that policy in OFMDFM and, as  I said at my last questions for oral answer, it is proposed that it should be  included.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Question 2 has been withdrawn.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">OFMDFM: Community Engagement</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">3. <strong>Mr  Hamilton </strong>asked the First Minister and deputy First Minister what plans  their Department has to engage with hard-to-reach communities across Northern  Ireland. &nbsp;(AQO 1272/10<a name="AQO1272/10" id="AQO1272/10"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: With your permission, Mr Speaker, I will ask junior Minister  Robin Newton to answer.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister) (Mr Newton)</strong>:  I thank the Member for his question. The Executive are fully committed to  moving society forward and making a real difference to the lives of all our  people. We are also committed to working towards building a fair and inclusive  society that is at ease with itself, a society that is integrated and cohesive  and in which everyone is regarded and treated equally. All our Departments&rsquo;  policies aim to be inclusive and to consider the needs and rights of all  section 75 groups. One of the legacies of the past is that poverty and violence  have combined to leave many areas with problems of multiple deprivation. Those  communities can be the hardest to engage.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">OFMDFM supports good relations work across all 26 district  councils, each of which produces an annual action plan that is tailored to  address the most important good relations priorities in its area. The  Department also works with community empowerment networks and a wide range of  interface regeneration groups to find ways to address particular issues faced  by people living in interface areas. In addition, we are working in partnership  with the Police Service, education and library boards and city councils. OFMDFM  delivers approximately &pound;500,000 per annum to assist with the provision of a  range of relevant and effective interventions and summer diversionary projects  in Belfast and other identified areas of need.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I thank the junior Minister for his response. He will know that many  disadvantaged communities across Northern Ireland have not always responded  positively to intervention in the past. Will he spell out whether his  Department is examining any new ways or models of engaging with those  traditionally hard-to-reach communities?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Mr Newton)</strong>: It is vitally important that we address that  question. We first need to recognise that there is a problem and have done so.  We need to engage with and listen to the concerns of those who are  traditionally regarded as being in areas that are difficult to reach. If we are  to move the peace process and society forward, we cannot ignore those areas. We  would do so very much at our peril.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We are always keen to look at new and innovative ways to  reach out to those who traditionally have not engaged. We will be looking  across the UK and further afield at what has worked in other jurisdictions,  while fully taking into account our own unique circumstances. We can also look  at evidence of best practice across Northern Ireland to see what has been  effective and to see whether we can apply that to hard-to-each groups in  individual communities.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Discussions have taken place at political and official  levels in the Department on how to address those difficult issues &mdash; and they  are difficult, Mr Speaker. However, as we move forward, we are determined that  no community in Northern Ireland will be set apart or not be part of the  success of the devolution initiative.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: In my  experience, the best way to engage hard-to-reach groups is by having designated  staff go out to meet them. With the cut in the equality unit of OFMDFM, will  the junior Minister explain how that will happen?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Mr Newton)</strong>: I thank the Member for her question. I suppose that,  yes, obviously, there is concern across Northern Ireland that good relations  should be an aspect of everything we do. However, funding for the promotion of  community relations and good race relations has been increased by one third in  the period 2008-2011 and from &pound;21 million in the previous CSR period to almost  &pound;30 million in the current one. In addition, funding for youth and interface  workers has increased by one quarter.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Last summer, OFMDFM&rsquo;s community relations unit provided  &pound;400,000, via the Department of Education, to the five education and library  boards to fund a range of diversionary activities for young people who might  otherwise be drawn into antisocial behaviour or rioting in interface areas. In  addition, &pound;100,000 was provided for diversionary activities over the summer  specifically in north Belfast interface areas.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Approximately &pound;3 million was spent on the district council  community relations programme to operate community relations-based programmes,  such as small grant schemes for community groups engaged in cross-community  activities. There is a range of similar activities, and, rather than taking up  the Assembly&rsquo;s time with a verbal answer, I am happy to forward a written  answer to the Member if she is happy for me to do so.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Does the junior Minister believe that  there is a need to develop additional resources and greater cross-departmental  working to address the historical and interrelated nature of deprivation,  particularly for those who live in deprived areas?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Mr Newton)</strong>: I am sorry, Mr Speaker, I did not quite catch the  Member&rsquo;s question.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member should repeat his question.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>:  Does the junior Minister see a need to develop additional resources and greater  cross-departmental working to redress the historical and interrelated nature of  deprivation, particularly that experienced by those who live in deprived areas?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Mr Newton)</strong>: There are a number of issues at the heart of Mr  Molloy&rsquo;s question. A number of cross-community and cross-departmental  initiatives target child need, child poverty and deprivation in general. In many  ways, those initiatives have still to reach fruition. Nevertheless, I shall  outline one cross-departmental pilot initiative. I think the Member will agree  that one of the big problems in deprived areas is the community debt  accumulated by individuals and families. I commend an initiative that aims to  tackle the problem of those who are in the clutches of moneylenders. The  initiative is being piloted, but I believe that it could make a significant  contribution to the debt problem and help get people out of the clutches of  illegal moneylenders. Of course, there is a desire across all Departments to  address levels of deprivation that, unfortunately, exist in many communities.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Local Government Reform</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">4. <strong>Mr B  McCrea </strong>asked the First Minister and deputy First Minister what discussions  they have had with the Minister of the Environment regarding the local  government reform process. (AQO 1273/10<a name="AQO1273/10" id="AQO1273/10"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: Last week, along with the deputy First Minister, I met the  Minister of the Environment and agreed that certain matters should be explored  in greater detail. We expect to meet again shortly.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Given the collapse of local government reform and the fact that we do not have  the ESA, will the First Minister tell us how many more of the Executive&rsquo;s key  policies are expected to fail? In addition, how much has been invested in local  government reform, and will he estimate how many millions of pounds of  taxpayers&rsquo; money have been wasted?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: I am surprised to hear the Member being so critical of his party  colleagues, who, after all, introduced the policy, even though they did so at  an Ulster Unionist Party conference, which seemed to be a strange place for the  Minister to make his statement. However, having accepted that the Ulster Unionist  Party policy is moving forward, I would not be as critical as him about how it  is proceeding.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We recognise that, in this day and age of politics, we  should attempt to get the highest level of consensus possible on moving  forward. In this case, that does not mean just getting consensus in the  Executive and the Assembly. Because this relates to local government, it  requires consensus among those who are in local government. In this case, the  Minister&rsquo;s proposals were rejected in some key aspects and, therefore, he  entered into dialogue with local government.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The purpose behind the reduction in the number of councils  was to gain efficiencies. Therefore, if the policy does not gain efficiencies,  it is not worth proceeding with. Local government was asked whether it could  produce proposals that would bring forward the same savings as the Minister&rsquo;s  proposals. It believed that it could, and it has now been asked to have those  proposals identified and tested. The Minister is anxious to have those checks carried  out so that he can be sure that we do not invest the more than &pound;100 million  that it would be necessary to invest in order to effect around &pound;438 million of  savings. It would be very silly of the Minister to proceed to spend the money  before he was absolutely certain that he was going to get the stated  efficiencies.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Will the Minister clarify whether the  elections to local councils will proceed on the 26-council model? Like Mr Basil  McCrea, the SDLP has major concerns about the millions of pounds that have been  squandered on RPA to date.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: It may well be that the Ulster Unionist Party&rsquo;s Minister  squandered money on RPA. I have not looked particularly at the detail of it.  However, the present Minister is ensuring not only that we make efficiencies  but that we do it in such a way that those efficiencies are brought to the fore  as quickly as possible. That is particularly important given the climate within  which we have to work. Simply having 11 councils rather than 26 is not the only  way to make efficiencies. Members might want to wait a few weeks, because the  policy will have to be considered by the Executive, but it is possible to have  some of the transitional benefits of the efficiencies that are being considered  by local government under the 26-council model, just as it would be under the  11-council model.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. T&aacute; ceist agam don Aire. Does the First  Minister believe that the recommendations of the Boundaries Commissioner should  be respected by the Environment Minister and be free from party political or  partisan constituency considerations?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: They certainly should be free from party political consideration.  That is essential. The Minister must always act in a capacity that raises him  above that level, and, therefore, the Minister must come to the issue with  clean hands. However, the law gives a role for the Assembly to determine  whether it accepts the results of the Boundaries Commissioner&rsquo;s work, and it  has the power to change it on foot of a recommendation from the Minister,  supported by the Executive. That is what the law requires, and the law must be  carried out impartially without any party political considerations.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Neeson</strong>:  Has the First Minister discussed with the Environment Minister any possible  conflict of interest, bearing in mind that the Department of the Environment is  in control of local government and the Minister continues to be a councillor on  Lisburn City Council?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: We need to look at the ministerial roles of a number of Ministers  from different parties where there would be a similar conflict. That is one  reason why my party has indicated that all Ministers will be standing down from  local government. The Member will have noticed that some of my party colleagues  have already started that process.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">UK Government</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">5. <strong>Mr  Hilditch </strong>asked the First Minister and deputy First Minister what  discussions have taken place with the new Government at Westminster. (AQO  1274/10<a name="AQO1274/10" id="AQO1274/10"></a>)</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">9. <strong>Mr  McQuillan </strong>asked the First Minister and deputy First Minister to outline the  outcome of any meetings they have had with the new Prime Minister. (AQO  1278/10<a name="AQO1278/10" id="AQO1278/10"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: With your permission, Mr Speaker, I will answers questions 5 and  9 together.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The deputy First Minister and I spoke to the Prime  Minister, David Cameron, immediately on his appointment, and we met him last  Thursday during his visit to Northern Ireland. In the past week, we also held  separate meetings with the Secretary of State, Owen Paterson, and the Northern  Ireland Office Minister of State, Hugo Swire. During those discussions, we  outlined the unique circumstances in Northern Ireland, including the need to  address the historical imbalance between the public and private sectors and the  link between economic stability and continued political progress. More  specifically, we explored options for dealing with the announced public sector  cuts; raised the issue of corporation tax; enquired about the publication date  of the Saville report; and stressed the importance of finding a workable and  speedy solution to the ongoing problems of the Presbyterian Mutual Society.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In response, the Prime Minister acknowledged the political  progress that has been made here in recent years. He indicated that he wants to  develop an impartial relationship with the devolved Administrations, based on  the principles of what he describes as respect, and offered all three devolved  Administrations the option of deferring cuts until the next financial year.  That may seem an attractive option, but it would have implications for future  Budgets and would require careful consideration by the Executive. He is also  committed to producing a paper examining options for reducing corporation tax  here, recognises the differences between each of the devolved regions and  expressed a wish to use the Joint Ministerial Committee more effectively to  address disagreements in an environment of mutual respect.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hilditch</strong>:  I thank the First Minister for his answer and the comprehensive list he has  before him. Will the First Minister tell the House what the &pound;6 billion of cuts  will mean for the Northern Ireland block grant? How do the Executive intend to  address that?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: The Treasury provided the Department of Finance and Personnel  with a communication today that indicates that the Barnett consequentials of  those cuts will be &pound;142&middot;027 million. However, additions resulting from recycled  savings amounting to &pound;14&middot;128 million must be factored into that figure, meaning  there will be a net reduction of approximately &pound;128 million. It will be for the  Executive to determine the extent to which those reductions are applied during  this financial year or are carried forward.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am delighted that the Scottish and Welsh First Ministers  are with us today. With them, we will seek a common approach that will give the  devolved Administrations the widest flexibility in dealing with fiscal matters.  Hopefully, that will include the ability to switch between capital and revenue  and automatically draw down our EYF, both of which would be helpful in the  current circumstances. However, we have not yet been given the division between  the capital and resource departmental expenditure limits by the Treasury. Until  those are announced, it is difficult for us to assess whether and by how much  matters should be held over until the next financial year.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McQuillan</strong>:  What does the Prime Minister intend to do about the plight of Presbyterian  Mutual Society members?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: During the election campaign, spokespersons for the Conservative  Party indicated a high level of sympathy with the plight of the savers in the  PMS. I raised that matter during the telephone call I had with the Prime  Minister. The deputy First Minister and I also raised it when we met him  recently, and he indicated that work is urgently going on in the Treasury. In  the run-up to the election, we placed a proposal before the Treasury. That  proposal was endorsed in principle by the Executive, but it requires some items  to be cleared in relation to state aid from the EU and also requires the  approval of the Treasury. We will continue to contact the new Administration in  Westminster to see whether progress on those matters can be made as urgently as  possible.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McKay</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. It would be an understatement to say that  there is a great deal of public concern about the cuts, the possible effect  that they will have on our local economy and particularly the effect they will  have on front line services. What will the Executive and the Office of the  First Minister and deputy First Minister do to ensure that the cuts will not  have an immediate short- to medium-term effect on front line services?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: The prospect of &pound;6 billion of Conservative and Ulster Unionist  Party cuts strikes dread into many people in Northern Ireland, which relies  heavily on the public sector. Furthermore, as we move forward into the much  greater cuts that will arise from the CSR period, the Executive will have to  take hard decisions. I agree with the Member that, given that we have little  choice if cuts are imposed on us, we must do everything that we can to protect  front line services. We need to remember that the option of simply cutting jobs  out of the public sector will have an impact on recovery in Northern Ireland.  The prospect of holding back on capital programmes will have an impact on the  construction industry in particular. If we have recovered from the recession,  jobs will be created in the private sector to offset any jobs that are lost,  but they will be net losses if we were to take those cuts in the current  financial year. The Executive will have to weigh up those types of issues.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">OFMDFM: Absenteeism</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">6. <strong>Mr Bell </strong>asked the First Minister and deputy First Minister to outline the levels of  absenteeism in their Department over the past three years. (AQO 1275/10<a name="AQO1275/10" id="AQO1275/10"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: The level of absenteeism among staff in our Department over the  past few years has been consistently lower than the average across the Northern  Ireland Civil Service. During 2006-07, 10&middot;7 working days were lost for each  member of staff in OFMDFM compared with an average of 13&middot;7 across the service.  During 2007-08, 9&middot;7 working days were lost for each member of staff in OFMDFM  compared with an average of 12&middot;9 across the service. During 2008-09, OFMDFM  absence rate figures reduced again to 6&middot;8 days, which was the lowest in the  Northern Ireland Civil Service and compares with 11 days for the rest of the  service.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We are not yet able to report the final absence figures for  2009-2010, but the provisional figures indicate that we should continue to have  a lower than average level of absenteeism in the Department. We expect to see  finalised headline figures for 2009-2010 later in the year. We also expect a  substantive report on sickness absence across the Northern Ireland Civil  Service to be published by the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency  in the autumn.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>: The  whole House will commend the First Minister for his Department&rsquo;s leadership in  this area. In light of OFMDFM&rsquo;s good performance, is there a case for setting  more ambitious absenteeism targets for the Department?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: In my view, yes. I always regard targets not as something that  must be reached but as something that is just out of reach. Therefore, we have  to stretch to get the best from our programmes and, indeed, the various areas  in which we set out targets in the Programme for Government. When I was Finance  Minister, absenteeism figures were appalling. Some Departments in which  permanent secretaries had given attention to the matter had much better  statistical evidence. We have now raised the level of concern about absenteeism  to the extent that we can see a reduction in Departments across the board, and  the overall figures are reducing substantially. However, our figures are still  much higher than those in the private sector, so there is more work to be done.</p>

    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Living over the Shop Scheme</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">1. <strong>Mr  Savage </strong>asked the Minister for Social Development what progress has been  made across Northern Ireland in relation to the Living over the Shop  initiative. (AQO 1284/10<a name="AQO1284/10" id="AQO1284/10"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development (Mr Attwood)</strong>: I thank everybody who acknowledged  Margaret Ritchie&rsquo;s great work as Minister and congratulated me on my  appointment. I am tempted to say, Mr Speaker, that your loss is, perhaps, Mr  Robinson&rsquo;s gain, but we will know about that on Thursday.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank Mr Savage for his question. The Living over the  Shop initiative was introduced on a pilot basis in 2002.<span class="SectionMarker"><em><span style="font-size:14.0pt; "> </span></em></span></p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Only properties in a designated town centre living  initiative area are eligible for funding. Twenty-one towns or cities have been  designated in the past three years alone, and 94 applications have been  approved to date, with &pound;1&middot;8 million spent on the initiative.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">3.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Savage</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his answer. Will he explain the potential impact on the  Living over the Shop scheme of not following through with local government  reform?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank Mr Savage for his supplementary question. My  predecessor, Margaret Ritchie, made it clear that the initiative is very  suitable to be devolved to local councils. Local councils are best informed and  best placed to make judgements on local solutions to local commercial issues. Therefore,  my Department under Margaret Ritchie was anxious that the scheme cross over to  local government. Given that &pound;2 million to date has been spent on the  initiative, which has worked in 21 designated areas, one would like to think  that, in the fullness of time, it will be rolled out elsewhere. However, if the  initiative is frustrated by a lack of funding, a lack of political will or a  lack of ability to get around the issue of the RPA, not only will we as  politicians and as the Government have let people down but people&rsquo;s needs and  hopes for the regeneration of their local area will be frustrated. That would  not be a healthy sign for the Assembly to send to the community, and I hope  that the RPA issue gets resolved.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Browne</strong>:  What progress has been made on the Living over the Shop initiative, which forms  part of the redevelopment scheme in Newtownards Road in east Belfast under  NRd2012?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: At present, 21 areas have been so designated. My mind  and that of the Department is open to looking at other areas where the scheme  might be rolled out. I shall have to come back to the Member with detail about  the Newtownards Road scheme. Whether it is Mr Savage&rsquo;s reference to Banbridge,  Lord Browne&rsquo;s reference to east Belfast or any other Member&rsquo;s reference to an  area in his or her constituency, the initiative is worthwhile. The budget is  currently limited, but the initiative is worthwhile in making our town centres  more attractive, not only for commercial activity but for residential activity.  Therefore, with the RPA, money and the development of the scheme, there will be  an opportunity to do more business.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Will the Minister confirm that his  Department is prepared and ready to transfer the functional delivery of the  LOTS scheme to local government, whether or not the proposed reform of public  administration goes ahead? We have heard some uncertainty around that. Can he  confirm that the necessary funding for that transfer will similarly be  guaranteed from departmental budgets?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank the Member for his question, and I am pleased  on both counts to be able to give him an affirmative answer. There is no doubt  whatsoever that my Department wishes full responsibility for the initiative to  be transferred to local councils, and, in the event that that happens, we are  also committed to transferring the budget. I am prepared to give those  guarantees. However, just as the initiative has worked well for people in some  parts of the North in the past three years, I hope that, in the next 10 months,  the Government of which I am now a member will deliver much more for  communities in the North that are in need, including for town centres. That  includes the rolling-out of the initiative in other parts of the North.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Community Funding</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">2. <strong>Mr  McDevitt </strong>asked the Minister for Social Development for an assessment of the  budgetary and financial outlook for community funding in the next Budget round.  (AQO 1285/10<a name="AQO1285/10" id="AQO1285/10"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank Mr McDevitt for his question, which is very  important, for reasons that I shall explain. My Department currently has &pound;38  million available to complete a number of community projects. I do not intend  to rehearse what all of them are, but substantial funds are available across a  range of initiatives.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On many fronts, considering the budget that we have and on  the basis of what we currently have &mdash; in making that point, I am mindful of the  announcement of the Treasury in London this morning &mdash; it appears that the  funding commitments that the Department has entered into are satisfied by the  budget that has been allocated, save for one issue, namely the single biggest  challenge that has been left to me by Margaret Ritchie under the current  budget: the almost total absence of any capital funding for regeneration  activities this year.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is a history to all of that with regard to how the  Royal Exchange initiative is supposed to be funded. We are aware that that  project has not been taken forward at this stage. The consequence of that is  that substantial funds in respect of the Royal Exchange initiative may be  returned to the Department of Finance and Personnel in the very near future.  Given what I said about the almost total absence of capital funding for  regeneration activities in the current financial year and given that my  predecessor and the Department have rightly entered into some commitments in  that regard, I trust that my Executive colleagues, in the event that Royal  Exchange money goes back to DFP, will recognise the importance of regeneration  and will allocate substantial moneys from those funds back to my Department to  enable me to take forward various initiatives.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his answer and wish him well in office. Financial  pressures notwithstanding, will the Minister consider the reorientation of  future community funding towards shared future projects as against single  identity community funding?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I recognise that a lot of very good work has been done  over the years and decades in the North in respect of single identity work. If  we are to stretch ourselves as a Government and live up to the ambitions of our  community and if the hopes and needs of our diversity of people are to be fully  satisfied, we need to have a gear change when it comes to a shared future. A  shared and reconciled future is not only the right way to go but the  sustainable way to go. At a time when there is the potential that less money  will be available, if we can do more about a shared and reconciled future for  the people of the North, it will result in better services for all our people,  because they will be able to share services and, in doing so, there may be less  duplication.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When it comes to shaping the North over the next phase of  government, therefore, a step change on a shared and reconciled future is  required. In taking forward my ministerial responsibility, I would like to see  that step change work itself through when it comes to community funding, and I  would like to see greater emphasis on community and shared future development  as well as on what the honourable Member referred to as single identity  community funding.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I refer Members to what Duncan Morrow and Mike Morrissey recently  reported. They said that the least segregated areas tend to be the least  deprived and that the worst 10% of areas in Belfast are at least 80% segregated. That is  not a healthy position to be in. However, we got to that place, and we need to  correct it. I believe that this funding stream is one means to begin to do so.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Campbell</strong>:  I join in congratulating the Minister on taking up office. With regard to  community funding, the Minister will be aware of the difficulties of the  hard-to-reach communities, particularly where they exist in working-class  housing estates across Northern    Ireland. They have been mentioned on  numerous occasions in the House and elsewhere. In the course of this financial  year, will he undertake to examine how community funding can best be targeted  to produce better results in the communities that are, by definition, hard to  reach?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I agree with the Member, and I am mindful that he  speaks for a constituency in which there have been some particularly appalling  and tragic circumstances over the past 18 months. The answer, in principle, is  that I agree. I agree because more and more people in this country are  beginning to realise that, if devolution is to fully measure up, it has to  measure up to what the Member referred to as hard-to-reach communities. That  applies not only to community funding but across the range of government  activity, economic activity, INI, the shared future strategy and interventions  by the Education Minister that have made very valuable contributions to dealing  with people who are in hard-to-reach or severely disadvantaged communities.  Therefore, I agree with the principle. If the Member has proposals for  directing community funding in his constituency or in the North in general to  fulfil that purpose, I would like to hear them.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Armstrong</strong>:  What discussions has the Minister had with the Minister of Enterprise,  Trade and Investment about developing social enterprises in Northern Ireland?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I can say categorically that, in the five hours that I  have been a Minister, I have had no such discussions with the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment. I want to dispel any doubts in the Member&rsquo;s mind about whether I  have had any such conversations. When I was taking forward the Caravans Bill  earlier, I made a commitment to meet the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment about a  particular enforcement regulatory matter around residential caravans. I can  confirm to the Member that, when I have that meeting with the Minister of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment, I will explore the issue that he raised.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Town Centre Regeneration</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">3. <strong>Mr  Hamilton </strong>asked the Minister for Social Development how much the Department  intends to spend on town centre regeneration in the 2010-11 financial year.  (AQO 1286/10<a name="AQO1286/10" id="AQO1286/10"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank the Member for that question, which touches in  part on the answer that I gave a short time ago. In the current financial year,  my Department has &pound;19&middot;8 million gross to spend on town centre regeneration.  That will cover a wide range of projects, including site maintenance,  Laganside, front line staff, Ilex, Peace III match expenditure and some public  realm projects. As I said, I do not have sufficient capital funds to complete  the regeneration projects that it is essential to complete this financial year.  That is why I know that I can rely on the Member to urge his colleagues in the  Executive to support the bid that I will make for Royal Exchange moneys to come  back to the Department in the June monitoring round. The consequence of that is  that there will be projects across the North, including the Member&rsquo;s  constituency, that will be committed to and completed this year.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his reply. The Minister will know that many towns  across Northern Ireland  are already out to consultation or are preparing master plans for the  regeneration of their town centre. Will he ensure or examine how he can ensure  that, when those consultations go out to the public, they will have all  available information about any planned shared surfaces that there might be in  town centre regeneration schemes, so that people who are visually impaired or  disabled can reply and respond positively and properly to those consultations?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank the Member for his question. If he knows of any  regeneration plan that has gone out for consultation or which is yet to go out  for consultation where there may be an issue about whether there has been full  consultation with relevant groups, including those with a disability or the  partially sighted, I would welcome hearing that. As far as I am aware, all DSD  schemes are quality-assessed and involve consultation with an array of  interested groups and organisations, covering all relevant matters such as  delineation, lighting, position of street furniture etc. When my Department  commissioned an access mobility study for Belfast  city centre, it specifically considered the needs of people with disabilities,  including those who are blind or partially sighted.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At the moment, the urban regeneration unit in my Department  does not have any plans to develop shared surface schemes in Northern Ireland.  However, my colleague Conor Murphy advised me that, in January 2009, the  Department for Transport commissioned a wide-ranging, two-year research project  on shared surfaces and DRD is represented at project board level. The purpose  of that research, among others, is to investigate how shared surfaces can be  made to work for people with disabilities, particularly those who are blind or  partially sighted. Therefore, if my Department is missing a trick and if there  are gaps in our consultation, let me know, and I will try independently to join  up with what my colleague Conor Murphy is doing to ensure that, when it comes  to shared surfaces, the needs of those with disabilities and those who are  partially sighted are properly and fully addressed.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  I wish the Minister well with his new portfolio. What specific assessments have  been carried out and what hard evidence is there of the impact that his  Department&rsquo;s town centre regeneration programme has had on economic value and  trade in those areas?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I cannot address that question fully, although it is  very relevant: if my Department and others invest heavily in regeneration, does  it make a material difference to economic opportunity?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There were previous questions on living over shops. When  town centres are regenerated and given life and activity and when people occupy  properties, that in itself might create shops to service neighbourhoods. All  regeneration expenditure has to be assessed against whether there is material  change to the environment and whether it produces more opportunities for housing  and economic and commercial activity. If the Department has made specific  assessments of regeneration schemes in various parts of the North, I will  ascertain that information and convey it forthwith to the Member.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire as na freagra&iacute; a thug s&eacute; go dt&iacute; seo. Tr&eacute;asla&iacute;m a  cheapach&aacute;n leis agus gu&iacute;m gach rath ar a chuid oibre san am at&aacute; roimhe. I  congratulate the Minister warmly on his appointment and wish him the best of  luck in the work that lies before him.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I noticed that in several of his answers the Minister  referred to the Royal Exchange budget for urban regeneration. What kind of  projects could be lost to DSD if it is not permitted to retain a reasonable  proportion of that budget? Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank the Member for his kind comments. Go raibh m&iacute;le  maith aige astu go l&eacute;ir.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A public realm of &pound;27 million could be lost, including  projects in Belfast, Downpatrick, Dungannon, Clooney, Waterloo Place and other  schemes throughout Northern Ireland, as well as neighbourhood renewal projects  that total &pound;6&middot;9 million and urban development grants that total &pound;5&middot;4 million  and cover schemes in Belfast and regional towns, including the development of  former military sites at Fort George and Girdwood. It is incredible that  projects of that scale and potential impact on communities, to which Mr Elliott  referred, could be put in jeopardy. That is why I am confident that the  Minister of Finance will hear the argument and understand the needs of Belfast as an urban centre and the needs of his own  constituency of East Antrim, which is urban  and rural. Given that, I am confident that in conversations in the days and  weeks ahead we will be able to get that over the line in a way that allows all  those projects &mdash; and more &mdash; to be rolled out during the coming year.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Savills Report</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">4. <strong>Mr  Doherty </strong>asked the Minister for Social Development for an assessment of the  rent convergence set out in the Savills report. &nbsp;(AQO 1287/10<a name="AQO1287/10" id="AQO1287/10"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank Mr Doherty for his question and look forward to  his supplementary question. The Savills report is worth reading as a  stocktaking exercise of the state of social housing in the North, an area in  which there have been many successes not only during the past three years under  Margaret Ritchie but during the past 30-odd years under the Housing Executive  and housing associations.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although the report does not make any particular proposals  on rent convergence, it advises the Department that a complete examination of  the rental system is beyond its brief. It recommends that a complete review of  the rental system be carried out for Housing Executive and housing association  properties. My predecessor Margaret Ritchie commenced that work, and, in the  fullness of time, we will determine what the empirical evidence is.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are those outside this Chamber &mdash; I am not suggesting  that the Member is one of them &mdash; who casually suggest that somehow Housing  Executive rents are too low. I do not accept that that is a working presumption  for the review of rent convergence that the Department has undertaken. I  believe that, when we complete the review, given that we do so in a transparent  and comprehensive way, the evidence will rebut those who casually and wrongly  suggest that Housing Executive rents are too low.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Doherty</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his answer and wish him well in his new office. Does  he agree that any move towards rent convergence would have a detrimental impact  on those least able to pay? Can he give an assurance that, when the review is  completed, that will not be the case?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: Yes, I can reassure the Member that, in the fullness of  time, when the rent convergence review has been completed, I will share that  information with the Assembly and the Committee. I repeat that I do not  necessarily accept that the evidence shows that Housing Executive rents are too  low, whatever housing association rents may be. Indeed, I draw some reassurance  from the fact that, over the last couple of years, Margaret Ritchie and the  Housing Executive were able to constrain the increases in rent for Housing  Executive properties. In fact, the evidence that we have &mdash; it is only  preliminary at this stage &mdash; suggests that, by and large, the housing  associations followed the lead of Margaret Ritchie and the Housing Executive,  though there may be exceptions. That is what the evidence suggests to date, as  far as I am aware.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to give a further reassurance to all Members. Given  that Housing Executive rents are substantially discharged by housing benefit,  which confirms that it is people on low pay or state benefits who are living in  Housing Executive properties, it would be simply intolerable if the range of  Housing Executive tenants were in any way further burdened, given the burdens  that they already experience in their lives.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burns</strong>: I  congratulate the Minister on his appointment. Will he tell us what he considers  to be the main findings that can be drawn from the Savills report to assist the  development of housing policy in Northern Ireland?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: As I said earlier, I recommend that Members read the  Savills report, which is the most comprehensive survey of its kind ever  undertaken here. It was a stock condition survey of over 90,000 Housing  Executive properties. Therefore, given that range, it gives us a very detailed  evidence base to develop a new maintenance investment strategy, and, in  particular, it will enable the Housing Executive and the Department to target  its resources where they will have most impact and most benefit.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am proud of the fact that, because of the investment in  the Housing Executive stock over the years, the Savills research team was able  to conclude that the condition of the housing stock was the best that it had  ever seen. That is a very powerful testimony to the work of the Housing  Executive since its formation. That is not to deny that there still remain areas  of need, that there are still issues of overcrowding and that there are still  37,000 people on the housing transfer waiting list. However, the conclusion I  draw from all of that is that, if we have successfully invested in the housing  stock so that the Savills team was able to draw that conclusion, we must  maintain that and protect it, not put it in jeopardy. We must invest our money  in the best possible way; however, budgetary negotiations must not in any way,  shape or form put in doubt the historic achievement of turning round the  housing situation in this part of Ireland.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Social Housing</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">5. <strong>Mr  McCarthy </strong>asked the Minister for Social Development for an update on the  Department&rsquo;s current social housing deficit. (AQO 1288/10<a name="AQO1288/10" id="AQO1288/10"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank the Member for his question. I do not intend to  rehearse the arguments about the deficit in social housing. Margaret Ritchie  made and won those arguments in government, in and outside the Chamber, and  among the population. Given that the housing budget relies on house and other  property sales, the collapse of the land and property market created unforeseen  pressure and had a severely detrimental impact on housing and on the Department  for Social Development more than on any other Department. As I said, Margaret  Ritchie deserves immense credit, because it is widely acknowledged by people  involved in social housing that she turned the situation around.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My target is to improve on Margaret Ritchie&rsquo;s achievement  of building more than 1,800 newbuild starts in the past financial year by  building 2,000 newbuild starts in the current financial year. I also have a  wider target in respect of new housing starts over the lifetime of this  mandate, as set out in the Programme for Government. That is the priority.  Given the Assembly&rsquo;s good work in achieving outcomes such as building more  houses this year than in any other year in the past decade, I trust that none  of the funding for such work will be put in jeopardy in future budget  negotiations.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Ultimately, however, if Housing Executive or social housing  depends on land sales rather than on guaranteed budget lines year on year, the  number of new housing starts will be put in jeopardy. Therefore, as Margaret  Ritchie regularly said &mdash; I endorse her comments &mdash; until and unless the housing  budget is put on a sound financial footing and is not subject to the vagaries  of the market in the sale of houses and other property, there will be a  hand-to-mouth existence. That is not a clever way of doing something as  important as providing affordable social housing for people in need.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his answer and congratulate him on his appointment. I,  too, commend Margaret Ritchie for her work.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I know that the Minister has been in office only a few  hours, but, given that he spoke repeatedly this afternoon about a shared and  reconciled future, will he tell the House whether those new houses, which will  hopefully be built, will be allocated to just one section of the community or  whether they will be made available to everyone?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank the Member for his comments and his question,  although I do not have time to address all the issues that arise from it.  However, I have made it clear that the need to put housing on a secure  financial basis remains a priority and that we must stretch ourselves when it  comes to a shared future, including shared housing. I will not ride roughshod  over the practices of past decades in allocating housing on points. However,  the allocation of housing and the ways in which housing moneys are spent in  various parts of the North need some further consideration. A review of the  Housing Executive is due, so let us see through that whether there are ways and  means of thinking smarter, building more, helping people and, at all times,  dealing with the need that exists in the North.<span style="font-family:'ITC Franklin Gothic Demi'; "> </span></p>

    <p class="H4StageHeading">Caravans Bill</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Second Stage</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Debate resumed on motion:</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That the Second Stage of the Caravans Bill [NIA 17/09] be  agreed <span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; ">&mdash; [Mr McCallister.]</span></span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I thank my colleagues from across the House for their contributions. The  five-minute ceiling on contributions having been lifted, the debate has, as Mr  Wells said, been very useful, even though Mr Wells pushed that to the limit of  our endurance. However, it is useful to see that there has been co-operation  between Departments and between former Minister Ritchie and Minister Foster,  Minister Poots and now Minister Attwood. We heard from various Committee  Chairpersons, so it is useful to have seen the co-operation that exists between  the Committees and in the House. That demonstrates the level of scrutiny that  Bills are receiving, and it is an example of when the House is at its best and  when we do what we are sent here and paid to do.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Dallat] in the Chair)</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will touch on some of the contributions. The Chairperson  of the Committee for Social Development, which, of course, is the main  Committee that will focus on the Bill, offered the Committee&rsquo;s support. Having  presented the Bill to the Committee in March 2010, I am grateful for its  interest in pursuing it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It was great and very encouraging to see the House,  including Mr Hamilton, so excited and enthusiastic about what could, on the  face of it, be considered a mundane subject. Mr Hamilton talked about the boost  in trade, the enhancement to tourism and how we can build on that economy. We  have to get this legislation right so that we get the balance between  encouraging site owners in their business endeavours and securing the rights of  caravan owners.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Boylan gave support from the Committee for the  Environment. He mentioned that it had a small, but, I would argue, very  important, role in looking at responsibilities in road traffic legislation and  the definition of certain planning terms. That Committee may also want to look  at the role of local government and how the powers of license could be extended  to it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Maginness gave the Bill a general welcome on behalf of  the Committee for Enterprise,  Trade and Investment. I am grateful to him for that support, following my  presentation to the Committee late last year. He is now off to a meeting in Brussels, and he  apologises for not being in the Chamber for the full debate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As my colleague Mr Basil McCrea ably pointed out, if the  Bill goes through to Committee Stage, there will be many occasions for Members  to make the representations and amendments that the House would like to see.  The Committees&rsquo; interaction today is a hallmark of the way in which the Bill  will proceed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is always useful to get support from the Alliance Party,  and Mr McCarthy gave that today. However, now that it is in the Government, the  Alliance Party no longer fulfils the role of loyal opposition. Nevertheless, Mr  McCarthy made some important points about people&rsquo;s right to peacefully enjoy  their caravans.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I know that Alex Easton has been involved in this matter  from a constituency perspective since 2007, and I am grateful to him for his  support. He highlighted some very useful concerns and sought clarity on some  issues. Given that he is a member of the Committee for Social Development, I am  quite sure that he will ably scrutinise the Bill as it makes its way through  Committee Stage. Issues to do with the removal of caravans need to be  scrutinised so that the protections that we all want can be put in place.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Willie Clarke talked about getting the balance right, which  is, in essence, what we need to do, especially with regard to the holiday  sector. We do not want to drive down business, and, therefore, we have to get  the balance right. Mr Clarke asked about the Travelling community, and I noted  that the new Minister gave a very comprehensive response and, hopefully,  clarified for Mr Clarke the effect that the Bill would have on Irish  Travellers.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Clarke also talked about other issues, such as  electricity and patios. The price that can be charged on sites for electricity  is regulated.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Wells seemed more concerned about my announcing in the  &lsquo;Mourne Observer&rsquo; that he agreed with Willie Clarke. For Jim Wells, that is a  very serious allegation. He spoke about abuses of the system, and we do have to  find the balance that Mr Clarke spoke about. I assure Mr Wells that on the  issues of insurance and of workmen being allowed on sites, the Bill provides  adequate cover through the written contracts. He spoke about site owners&rsquo;  &ldquo;Genghis Khan-type&rdquo; approach, which, I think, was slightly over the top.  However, we have to strike a balance on who can access sites, because there  will be families and young children present.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My colleague Danny Kinahan from South   Antrim said that he is looking forward to scrutinising the Bill.  He also talked about the big investments that some people make in caravans, and  that has to be recognised. It is crazy to invest so much money without having  some level of protection.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mary Bradley spoke about the length of time since we last  legislated on caravans &mdash; some 47 years. Some Members may have been here 47  years ago, but not many. I certainly was not.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am grateful to the new Minister for his kind remarks  about me and the Bill. I am grateful to him for his support and wish him well  in his new role. I also associate myself with his remarks about his  predecessor, Margaret Ritchie, who is off doing very important work as the  Member of Parliament for South Down.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The debate has highlighted the good relationship between  the executive and legislative branches of government. Those branches are  working to progress the Bill and to enhance the rights of people in the  permanent residential sector and the holiday sector. The Bill and today&rsquo;s  debate are excellent examples of how that is happening.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am grateful to my colleagues, to the Minister for Social  Development, to Committee Chairpersons and to Ministers Foster and Poots for  their support in getting the Bill through the Executive. I commend the Bill to  the House.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText"><span class="Italic">Question put and agreed to.</span></p>
    <p class="B3BodyText"><span class="Italic">Resolved:</span></p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That the Second Stage of the Caravans Bill [NIA 17/09] be  agreed.</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading"><a name="13"></a>Department of Education&rsquo;s Community Relations Budget</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to one hour and 30  minutes for the debate. The proposer of the motion will have 10 minutes in  which to propose and 10 minutes in which to make a winding-up speech. All other  Members who are called to speak will have five minutes.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: I beg  to move</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly expresses deep concern at the Minister of  Education&rsquo;s decision to introduce significant cuts to her Department&rsquo;s  community relations budget for 2010-11; and calls on the Minister to explain  how her Department can now make any meaningful contribution to building good  relations between young people and to an overarching Executive policy on  cohesion, sharing and integration.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister of Education, Caitr&iacute;ona Ruane, recently  announced that she will cut 70% of the Department&rsquo;s community relations budget,  from &pound;3&middot;6 million in 2009-2010 to &pound;1&middot;1 million for this financial year, to meet  her efficiency savings.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department, through its community relations branch, has  responsibility for the promotion of good community relations among young people  from three to 25 years old in the education and Youth Service sector. Previously,  it provided funding for 26 community relations organisations, a schools  community relations programme and two Youth Service support schemes. The 26  core-funded organisations are grant-aided until the end of May 2010, with no  clarification of whether funding will continue. It is feared that the  much-reduced budget will decimate the expertise that has been built up  throughout the school system and in the voluntary sector.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">According to the Minister, the bulk of the funding for this  year will be used in preparation for the implementation of the new community  relations, equality and diversity policy, which she plans to adopt in the  current financial year. However, the draft policy has not yet been published  for consultation, and it will be months before the new policy can be  established to replace the Department&rsquo;s old community relations policy, which  it has now ceased to support. Clearly, there is a vacuum in policy direction  from the Department.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">One of the key strategic priorities in the Programme for  Government is to:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Promote tolerance, inclusion and health and  well-being.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The Office of the First Minister and deputy First  Minister has produced the draft programme for cohesion, sharing and  integration, albeit two and a half years late. We must, therefore, question the  Minister&rsquo;s rationale for slashing funding when there is clear strategic drive  by government to address community relations. Furthermore, the divisions in our  society continue to result in huge social and economic costs. It is vital that  our children and young people have the opportunity to develop an understanding  of different cultural traditions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Despite political progress in recent years, sectarian and  racist attitudes, as well as deep-rooted patterns of segregation and  inequality, remain major problems in our divided society. In addition, new  immigrants continue to come to Northern    Ireland to seek to work and to contribute to  the local economy. Although that is an encouraging sign of increased  globalisation, their presence poses a further challenge to traditional  conceptions of identity.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A recent Good Relations Forum report, &lsquo;Ensuring the Good  Relations Work in Our Schools Counts&rsquo;, recommends that the Minister of  Education and her Department give greater strategic direction to the schools  sector to ensure that the teaching and practise of good relations is  successfully mainstreamed across all schools. It also suggests that the  Department should identify and commit a long-term and appropriate budget to  support all schools in providing good relations modules within citizenship  programmes, thereby guaranteeing its widespread re-prioritisation across the  schools sector. Moreover, it believes that there should be compulsory good  relations programmes in schools, and there are, of course, many good reasons  why that should be so.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Undoubtedly, there are clear links between poverty,  conflict and lifetime opportunities. A number of pieces of research have  highlighted the critical role of schools in contributing to a shared and  peaceful society in Northern    Ireland. The Bain report and research by the  University of Ulster in 2004 show that socially and  economically deprived areas tend to suffer most from the legacy of the past. If  not addressed by society and by services including education, such suffering  tends to be perpetuated and can contribute to trans-generational poverty.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, 95% of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s schoolchildren attend  what is, in effect, a segregated school system, and, therefore, there is  limited opportunity to meet and interact across traditional community  divisions. It is also widely accepted that limited exposure to those outside  their communities consolidates negative attitudes that are passed down through  the generations.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">3.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Outside the formal integrated sector, it is largely up to  individual schools to decide how to promote good relations issues and  interaction. Indeed, the community relations programmes that were funded by the  Department of Education up to March 2010 were voluntary. As a consequence,  there is no consistent approach or sector-wide buy-in or delivery to the  promotion of good community relations.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Sadly, there is also clear evidence of growing sectarianism  and racism in Northern    Ireland. The research paper &lsquo;Too Young to  Notice?: The Cultural and Political Awareness of 3-6 Year Olds in Northern Ireland&rsquo;  indicates that many children and young people continue to regularly exhibit and  experience sectarianism and racism. The report cited that school was one of the  three factors that increased children&rsquo;s awareness of and attitudes to those  matters. The other two are family and the local community. Clearly, what the  report refers to as:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;de facto segregated nature of the school system&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">in Northern    Ireland has helped to create environments  that are overwhelmingly Catholic or Protestant in their ethos.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Northern    Ireland life and times survey 2008 provided  an analysis of responses by age. The results showed that the 18- to 24 year-old  age group&rsquo;s views on community relations in Northern Ireland are less positive than  those held by the overall population. For example, 6% of that age group felt  that relations between Protestants and Catholics are worse now than they were  five years ago, compared with only 2% of the overall population. Eight per cent  of that group expected relations to get worse over the next five years,  compared with only 3% of the overall population.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The latest PSNI crime statistics show that in 2009-2010,  there was a 24&middot;3% increase in sectarian crime in Northern Ireland. A recent report  by the Terry Enright Foundation looked at the views of young people in  interface areas. In particular, it noted that 44% of those questioned had  admitted to being involved in some form of rioting or stone throwing at  interfaces, and 33% had engaged in vandalism. About 10% had been involved with  either the youth justice system or the Probation Service. That is worrying when  it is considered alongside the hardening of sectarian views among young people  that is reported by youth workers.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, I want to address the reluctance of some teachers  and youth leaders to deal with community relations issues. Teachers need the  training, skills and professional support to challenge negative attitudes and  discrimination inside and outside the classroom. However, although all teacher  training colleges have diversity programmes, they do not always make all their  good relations modules compulsory. Furthermore, not all teacher training  colleges give their students work experience in an alternative sector.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Bring your remarks to a close, please.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>:  Feedback from the Equality Commission following a series of seminars held with  teachers and education stakeholders in 2008 identified the fact that many  teachers had concerns about addressing good relations at school.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Time is up.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: That  was due either to a lack of training or a fear of the consequences.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education (Mr Storey)</strong>: I wish to inform the House how  the Committee for Education has sought to ascertain the current situation  around the Minister&rsquo;s cut in her Department&rsquo;s community relations budget for  2010-11 from &pound;3&middot;5 million to &pound;1&middot;1 million, as outlined by the proposer of the  motion.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department of Education&rsquo;s funding for community  relations terminated on 31 March 2010 in preparation for the implementation of  the new community relations equality and diversity policy. However, the  Committee was recently informed that the new community relations policy is:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;due to issue shortly for public consultation&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">It could be well into 2010-11 before any community  relations funding is released to organisations, and that will be on the basis  of one third of last year&rsquo;s budget. I will come back to that, time permitting,  when I speak as a private Member.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee heard from one of the 26 community relations  organisations whose core funding programmes have been directly affected by the  termination of funding at the end of March 2010, and which stands to lose four  experienced community relations staff. That would doubtless be a great loss to  that organisation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Funding has previously supported schools&rsquo; community  relations programmes and a number of Youth Service core programmes. The  community relations sector has highlighted in particular the severe impact of  that cut on its work with young people in interface and rural areas, where  there is little or no provision from the statutory Youth Service. The  withdrawal of that funding could leave young people vulnerable to dissident  groups and gangs, and some could well end up bearing the brunt of a prison  sentence, which would cost thousands of pounds, particularly at a time when  levels of unemployment and deprivation in such communities are on the rise.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The potential costs for society, particularly in conflict  areas, are disproportionate to the relatively small amounts of community  relations money involved. The Committee also heard that the Department&rsquo;s  funding often levers in around four times that amount from non-UK Government  sources. Major uncertainty is hanging over those organisations about when and  if the Department&rsquo;s new community relations programme will provide funding.  Even if funding is provided, it may be at a much reduced level. In the  meantime, staff experience that has been gained over decades will be lost and  valuable youth programmes will cease.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee for Education understands that budget  constraints mean that choices will have to be made. However, I have questions  about the extent of the community relations budget cut and how it will be  managed and about the resulting uncertainty for the sector.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will briefly speak as a private Member. I concurred with  the proposer of the motion, Ms Lo, when she said that there was a &ldquo;vacuum in  policy development&rdquo; in the Department of Education. Unfortunately, under the tenure  of this Minister, the Department either has a vacuum in policy development or  it develops a policy that will sit there for month after month, as we have seen  with the early years strategy, the special educational needs policy, and  others.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I think that there is a more serious issue facing community  relations with regard to this Minister. To use the phrases &ldquo;community  relations&rdquo; and &ldquo;the current Education Minister&rdquo; in the same sentence is a  contradiction in terms. This Minister and this Minister alone has sown the  seeds of dissension. Instead of harmony, there is discord. Instead of  co-operation, there is confrontation. It is regrettable that we have a Minister  who has presided over polarisation in the education sector. Despite her most  repeated mantra that she is looked upon with a great degree of favour in the  education sector, I think that she would have few friends who could defend in  this House her record on community relations.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister must explain to the House today the way in  which funding will be dealt with.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education</strong>: She must also explain what she will do to  repair the damage that she has done to community relations.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  My colleague Mr Storey talked about the Department of Education&rsquo;s policy  vacuum, but a policy vacuum is the best that many people to whom I talk can  hope for. Any policy that comes from the Minister is worse than anything that  they could possibly have imagined. Therefore, perhaps we should ask the  Minister for more policy vacuums.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The message that is being sent out seems to be completely  at odds with the direction that we want to take. Surely the common goal is to  dismiss unfortunate sectarianism. Surely the fundamental purpose of our sitting  together in this Building is to talk and work together. We may disagree, quite  strongly sometimes, but all Members would admit that if, on meeting in the  corridors, they chat and pass the time of day, that makes the discussion of  other issues easier. Does the Minister mean to send out such a contrary  message?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We all have to make decisions on priorities in these  straitened financial times, but the 70% cut that Ms Lo outlined will decimate  much of the considerable good work that goes on. I have been involved in many  issues concerning public achievement, youth interaction and interface areas,  and a huge difference is made on a modest budget. Do we want to destroy that?  Do we really want to throw the expertise and confidence that has been built up  in those communities onto the funeral pyre of some political ideology?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister will have the opportunity to respond, and I  would like her to explain where her priorities lie. During the Westminster election campaign, people from  the Minister&rsquo;s party trumpeted that she had found more money to buy school  uniforms for those who could not afford them. Recently, the Minister also  announced a &pound;2 million investment in accommodation for the Irish-medium sector.  It seems that projects that find favour with the Minister receive funding and  funding is taken away from those that do not.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is no clearer sign of the importance that the  Minister attaches to peace and reconciliation and community relations than her  slashing of their budget. I cannot help but think that there has been a  terrible mistake, that something was lost in the fine detail, that the Minister  will move immediately to tell us that that is not what she meant and that she  will find the money to look after the people who do such a good job.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">During Question Time, the Minister for Social Development  spoke about the amount of segregation in the poorest areas of our society. If  we are to tackle the unfortunate legacy of the past, surely that will be done  through our children and young people. We can talk to the children and young  people and bring them here. Indeed, recently, I had the privilege of bringing  people from the 174 Trust, which is located in an interface area of north Belfast, to Parliament  Buildings. Children and young people from all backgrounds and walks of life  were here, and they were just being children. They simply got on and worked  together as a tremendous unit.<span class="SectionMarker"><em><span style="font-size:14.0pt; "> </span></em></span></p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The Assembly needs to get real. If it talks about  good relations and delivering good for the people of Northern Ireland, it must start  with the children. It must have joined-up government. This Minister has a lot  of questions to answer.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The process of reviewing the Department of Education&rsquo;s  community relations policy began as far back as 2008. That review has had a  staggering impact on community relations schemes ever since. As has been said,  the outcomes of the review and the consultation document have still not been  published, although here we are in May 2010.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Youth and school groups have been affected since 2008  because they do not know where the commitment to a shared future is. Core youth  workers for community relations have been lost because of the drip-feeding of  short-term funding. Community relations workers, in conjunction with youth  workers, are the core workers needed to support youth groups in that very  difficult work. The Department of Education was supposed to bring in short-term  transitional funding arrangements in lieu of a policy but, as I understand it,  that still awaits ministerial decision. We have heard that the size of the cuts  is 70%, which involves a reduction from &pound;3&middot;5 million to &pound;1&middot;5 million.  Instructions were issued from the Minister to run down all community relations  support schemes. As a result, workers in posts have either been on monthly  contracts or on protective notice, or posts have been vacant because there is  no security of tenure.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is a lot of uncertainty in the world of community  relations. Why? Because there is no funding for the hire of premises,  transport, programmes or local groups. How can peace-building in a divided  society be sustained in such a situation? Grass-roots workers are at their  wits&rsquo; end and wonder how much the difficult work that they have done and the  successes that they have achieved were really valued. The rhetoric, they will  conclude, has once again proved to be empty.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Worst of all, the future leaders of our shared society are  being denied the formation that they want and that we need them to have. The  situation has led to chaos at the chalk face of youth community relations, with  teachers and youth workers wondering where they will get support for their  projects. As mentioned earlier, in the most difficult interface areas where  programmes have been developed, the work is now not supported. Young people  have had to be told that there is no financial support to continue their  community relations projects.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I take this opportunity to recognise the work that has been  done with thousands of young people in communities and schools and on  residential courses, which covers extremely difficult issues that must be faced  up to if we are to have a truly peaceful future. That work has been done  quietly and effectively. It is difficult, challenging, valuable and necessary,  and it requires a degree of skill that can only be built up and built upon over  years of commitment. Surely, we should be asking how we can support the formal  and informal education sectors in finding ways of transforming relationships of  hate into those of interdependence and trust. We should not cut funding. A  genuine commitment to building a sustainable peace and a shared society must  include young people. If the devolved Government here do not provide the  required leadership, the initiative will be handed to others with more  destructive intent.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">This is not merely a matter of funding; it is a question of  where we want to lead our young people. Do we want to lead them towards a  brighter, more diverse and peaceful future or allow them to be dragged back  into the darkness of the past?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I call on the Minister of Education to act now to restore  substantial funding so that those valuable programmes will not be lost to us  and will continue to influence the young people in our society in a positive  way. Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hilditch</strong>:  I welcome the motion, particularly on the back of the comments made by junior  Minister Robin Newton during Question Time, which refocused where we should be  with good relations.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The incorporation of community relations into the education  programme is vital. It is crucial to our children&rsquo;s development and leads them  into adulthood. In today&rsquo;s society, anybody aged from three to 25 can gain from  a better understanding of equality, diversity and interdependence becoming  daily practice in our lives. That is why I am concerned by the Minister&rsquo;s  decision to cut her community relations budget &mdash; as has been well reported in  the Chamber &mdash; by some 70% from &pound;3&middot;5 million to &pound;1&middot;1 million. It again appears  that U-turns are being performed on decision-making and on policy, leaving  children, schools, teachers, parents, unions, voluntary groups and their  volunteers, along with the general public, very concerned and somewhat  confused.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We understand that the Education Department and all other  Departments of the devolved Government are in a time of financial hardship.  However, when the budget was considered by the Committee for Education, it was  regarded as unfair to blame it on the ESA delay. The Department of Education  must remember that it is not the only public authority that is struggling at  present.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I understand that there is a return of &pound;4 for every &pound;1  invested in the scheme, which must be considered. I, therefore, ask the  Minister to reconsider her figures and to look at ways in which she can  accommodate the 26 groups that have secured funding. Otherwise, it will be a struggle  to carry out crucial work done by the likes of Community Relations in Schools  (CRIS), Belfast YMCA, the National Trust, and others. How does the Minister  suppose they will fund salaries and meet running costs in the weeks ahead?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We appreciate the work to date to build community relations  in the education and youth sectors. Nevertheless, it is evident that  improvements are needed, and the Department must review its responsibility to  build good relations between the young and their communities. It has become  apparent that the success and the standards achieved by many of the projects  are hard to assess and the training provided for those in the sector is  insufficient. Good relations must become part of the school curriculum: it can  no longer be avoided or regarded as optional.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Schooling can help to counteract negative views, such as  hatred, bigotry and prejudice, which still exist in a lot of our communities. Northern Ireland  society is still divided and many of our housing estates and schools are still  predominantly identified with a single community. Segregation is costly and  financial resources can be duplicated. Contact and network between communities  can be hindered, provoking misunderstanding. That is why I urge the Minister to  review her plans to cut the budget so dramatically.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Our children deserve the opportunity to explore diversity  issues, so that they are encouraged to think about how people who differ  politically, religiously, ethically and culturally can live together in our  community, rather than in fear and misunderstanding. It is time to embrace the  many interesting communities that our society now welcomes. I support the motion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I apologise for not being in the  Chamber for the start of the debate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">First, in relation to the wording of, and my party&rsquo;s  approach to, the motion, the first line of the motion states:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;That this Assembly expresses deep concern at the  Minister of Education&rsquo;s decision to introduce significant cuts to her  Department&rsquo;s community relations budget&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">It is reasonable that the Assembly should be  concerned at any Minister having to severely cut anything in a departmental  budget. My party has no difficulty in supporting that approach. Of course we  are concerned. I suspect that, in the weeks and months ahead, we will have many  such debates around the various Departments under the Executive&rsquo;s control.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The second part of the motion, which is also valid, calls  on the Minister to outline:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;how her Department can now make any meaningful  contribution to building good relations&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">We support that part of the motion as well, because  the Department of Education has a role to play in developing good community  relations, and I look forward to hearing how the Minister will set out her plan  for the time ahead. However, with respect to the people who have signed up to  the motion, I suspect that we are today involved in a bit of sham fight.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I said, especially given today&rsquo;s announcement that a  further &pound;128 million will be lost from the block grant, we will be having many  of these debates in the weeks and months ahead. Each party will roll out how  Minister A, B or C should fund various programmes. However, the next part of  the argument must also be developed: how will they fund those programmes? This  year alone, the Department of Education has lost &pound;74 million from its budget,  not including the &pound;13 million of savings that it must secure for the now  stalled ESA Bill. That is &pound;87 million that will come out of the departmental  budget this year.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have heard much from the Health Department and the  Department for Social Development about the difficulties in implementing the programmes  under their control with restricted budgets. The Department of Education is in  the same boat. We could be debating a new start to the motion, expressing deep  concern at the Minister of Education withdrawing funding from teachers,  schools, buildings, transport, child support or child psychologists. In all  those areas of the education budget, difficult decisions had to be made.  Indeed, I recall the Education Committee being asked to forward to the  Department any suggestions on how the Minister should manage this year&rsquo;s  budget. The Committee did not forward a response.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although I respect the motivations of those Members who  tabled the motion, and, as I said, my party will support it, reality is hitting  hard and hitting home. There are decisions to be made about where budgets will  be spent. On this occasion, unfortunately, we are talking about severely  cutting back a community relations budget. However, under the Department of  Education, a range of other community relations work is ongoing. I welcome the  fact that the youth budget received only a minor adjustment and will continue.  One need only think of local youth groups and community organisations that are  involved in cross-community work in our own areas every day of the week. In my  constituency and, no doubt, every other constituency, through area learning  communities, schools are involved not only in titled community relations  programmes but in sharing resources with schools and in enabling pupils to  cross boundaries that were never crossed in the past. I welcome that work.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Sometimes &mdash; and I am not suggesting that this was the case  with the Department of Education&rsquo;s community relations budget &mdash; the  touchy-feely stuff of community relations becomes an industry. To ensure that  community relations improve, people must work genuinely together on issues of  common purpose and cause. Although the time ahead will be difficult, resources  are still available to schools, through the Department of Education and the  education and library boards, to allow real cross-community work to continue.  For example, the GAA and the IFA are working together on a scheme to promote  soccer and Gaelic football in schools.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Bring your remarks to a close, please.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  That is also cross-community work. Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Every Member knows that the Northern Ireland Budget is under extreme pressure.  Savings have to be found in all Departments, because successive Finance  Ministers have failed to identify and deal with Northern Ireland&rsquo;s budgetary black  hole. We have warned consistently that that was going to cause problems.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have to work at and improve community relations, and we  must not take it for granted. Unfortunately, doing her own thing for her own  people is a hallmark of the Minister of Education. She does not make a genuine  effort to cross the bridge and bring people together. She does not deal with  the cross-community issues that confront us every day in our constituencies. We  live in a divided society, although some places are much more divided and  polarised than others.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">How are we going to fix that situation? We know that  community relations is a long-term issue, but the short-term budgetary decision  that the Minister has made will have a long-term effect on those community  relations. That is a serious difficulty that will build up and store problems  for the future. We must find the resources to tackle the polarisation in  communities that I and others spoke about so that we can bring communities  together.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr O&rsquo;Dowd talked about the youth budget, and I am grateful  that the cuts in that budget have been small, although there could have been  adjustments. I have been involved in youth work in rural areas for many years,  and I support the need for that work to continue. I recognise the need for good  community relations right across Northern Ireland, whether that is  in South Down or wherever. We need to try to build on that and not take away  the money that funds those types of programmes. It is vital that we do that,  because we have heard today how important such programmes are across all  communities. I hope that the Minister thinks about that again.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Is the Member aware that during the election campaign, a meeting took place at  W5 at which the community relations budget was discussed and at which members  from all parties were present, including Daith&iacute; McKay of Sinn F&eacute;in? All were  shocked at that. Will the Member join me in wondering whether the Minister has  discussed the matter with Daith&iacute; McKay or with the community relations  professionals, all of whom feel that their professionalism has been completely  undermined?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I agree with my colleague. We have to consult, and the Minister&rsquo;s hallmark is  that she neither consults nor listens, and neither does she want to engage with  the people who are involved in the programmes.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  No, I will not, because you never take interventions from any of us.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>: I  do certainly.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Once he learns to take interventions, I will of course reciprocate &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. Members should make their comments through the Chair.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I agree with my colleague that it is vital that the Minister engages with those  professionals. I agree that she should speak to the Member for North Antrim and hear what commitment he gave at that  meeting on the importance of community relations work. Perhaps she might take  some advice from him on where she should go on that important issue. The Minister  needs to start a process of listening and learning, because she has failed to  do that in all the other policy areas that she deals with. It would be good if  she could start to listen and learn and to act on that now.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  The Department&rsquo;s decision to cut funding for school cross-community projects by  70% on top of cuts in our intercommunity youth work is a worrying development.  If we are to create a society that is based on a shared future, we need to  recognise that schools are in a unique position in that they can help to  counteract negative views such as the hate, bigotry and prejudice that exist in  our society. They are also in the unique position of being able to promote the  healing of community divisions. They are uniquely placed to provide hands-on  leadership in the work of achieving a shared future, and they have an important  role to play in shaping people&rsquo;s views and their relationships with others. The  Minister has often said that we should start everything in the early years.  That also needs to be looked at. We should support our schools as much as we  can, because they can help our young people to share with one another.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The desire for a shared future is a cornerstone of SDLP  policy, and we must all learn the value of working and living together. The  SDLP will strive to construct a shared and equal society that is free of hate.  However, cross-community projects are essential to drive forward change in the  elimination of hate and the promotion good relations. The decision to cut  funding to the community relations budget will have a detrimental impact on the  work that cross-community projects do in promoting and encouraging real,  meaningful and sustained contact among our children and young people who are  from diverse backgrounds and cultures.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP also fears that the cuts will end up costing more  in the long term. Cross-community work pays multiple dividends in hard cash  saved as we gradually reduce the impact of division and sectarian violence.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Community Relations Council (CRC) has described the  importance of cross-community projects. They can provide our young people with  the skills to resist the sectarianism and racism that unfortunately still exist  in our society. The council strongly believes that teaching and practicing good  relations in all schools is something that can no longer be avoided or seen as  optional. It has also said that the school sector and its many stakeholders  require greater leadership, encouragement and co-ordination to mainstream much  of the good practice that exists. That will require greater sharing and  collaboration between communities and schools, with the support of the  Department of Education.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in grudgingly produced a cohesion,  sharing and integration strategy, which provides no practical leadership at  all. Indeed, all it really did was push responsibility back to Departments for  the production of ideas on a shared future. We now know what Caitr&iacute;ona Ruane&rsquo;s  contribution will be: a 70% cut in the community relations budget from &pound;3&middot;5 million  to &pound;1&middot;5 million. She and her Department have no intention of taking their  responsibilities seriously.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">If our society is ever to be free of the legacy of the  past, the Minister must reconsider her decision and reintroduce to the  community relations budget what is due to it to do the work that we need for  our young people.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  am grateful for the opportunity to take part in the debate. I apologise for  missing the earlier contributions, but I have followed the debate from another  place.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mary Bradley made a point about the cohesion, sharing and  integration strategy. I and my party welcome the progress that has been made by  the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in on that. We look forward to the forthcoming consultation  on the strategy, and remain optimistic that a robust policy can be put in place  to deal with the reality of continued division. That is the most important  issue facing our society, and one that carries so many social, economic,  financial and other costs.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Importantly, the CSI strategy must not simply be a document  for OFMDFM to place in a silo or to use as part of a tick-box exercise. If it  is to work, it has to be an all-embracing strategy that stretches across all  aspects of government and involves all Departments. As we speak, the CSI process  is based on inputs coming from Departments. I know that the Department of  Justice and DSD are taking it very seriously, but there is potential for all  Departments in the Administration to make a contribution to it, not least the  Department of Education. That Department is absolutely critical to the creation  of a rounded cohesion, sharing and integration strategy, and I am at a loss as  to how it can make such a contribution to an overarching Executive policy  objective in the context of a 70% cut in community relations funding. Although  a new policy may be introduced, there will be a void in the coming year, and  there is, at best, scepticism as to what departmental policy will follow for  this important area.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As we know, young people are the most impressionable in  society. It is at a young age that attitudes are constructed and framed in  minds, and those attitudes often stay with a person in later life. There is  substantial evidence of people picking up sectarian and racist attitudes at a  very early stage, and it is important that our education system tackles such  problems and that that action is not simply perceived as addressing a negative.  Through wider citizenship and civic lessons, people should be able to talk  about the contributions that they can make to create a positive future as part  of the shared, cohesive and integrated society that we are surely striving to  achieve through the policy. If the Department of Education does not make a  viable contribution, there will be a major void in any community relations  strategy that the Executive take forward.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Other Members referred to vulnerable people being led  astray by violent groups in society. The Minister&rsquo;s party is acutely aware of  the threat posed by the dissidents and of how they can lead young people astray.  Alongside other actions that may take place elsewhere, community relations and  youth work, through the Department of Education, are two elements of how we can  challenge that threat to peace and stability in society and prevent a  recurrence of the situation that wasted so many lives over the past 40 years.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to stress the point about the false economy. I  appreciate that we live in difficult times and that tough decisions must be  taken, not least in the context of today&rsquo;s news. Later this year, even more  difficult news for future years&rsquo; budgets will, undoubtedly, emerge. However,  investment in good relations has to be seen as part of investing to save. Costs  must be reduced elsewhere in the system. A small investment in community  relations means that much deeper costs can be avoided later. Members know only  too well about the costs that accrue from division, through public order  problems on the streets and people being led astray into a life of violence.  Those costs are imposed not only on the individual victims of division, but on  the perpetrators, for whom the cost is a wasted life, and on the system that  has to deal with them.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member should bring his remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  There is much to be achieved from investing in community relations.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Purvis</strong>: I  was baffled, as were other Members, by the Education Minister&rsquo;s announcement  that she was reducing her Department&rsquo;s community relations budget by an  estimated 70%. Essentially, she is gutting that budget. She is a Minister who  claims to be led by a commitment to equality, and, therefore, community  relations should be at the heart of her Department&rsquo;s efforts to improve the  lives of young people.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We struggle to cope with the legacy of violence from the  recent past. The best that we can do is to work earnestly to ensure that the  failings of previous generations do not infect our young people and pull them  in to repeating the pattern. That danger is before us now, and it can be  mitigated only through proactive and innovative measures. Community relations  are central to ending the cycle of violence.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We continue to live in segregated communities, with our  young people attending separate schools and leisure centres, playing in  separate playgrounds and even travelling to school on separate buses. Given  that level of division and the lack of serious investment in community  relations, I am extremely curious about how the Minister intends to achieve  equality in the education system and among young people. Does the Minister  truly hope to achieve parity of esteem or the falsehood of a separate but equal  society?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister may recall that the United States tried the separate  but equal doctrine, and it did not work. The US civil rights movement, with  which the Minister&rsquo;s party claims an affinity, exposed the failings and  falsehoods of the absurd suggestion that communities and cultures that shared  the same land could and should live separately. Mutual respect and parity of  esteem come not from separation, but from understanding. Understanding comes  from exposure, knowledge experience and integration.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Inherent in the Minister&rsquo;s decision, as Mr Farry outlined,  is an economic absurdity. The removal of funding for community relations does  not mean that the need for those programmes will go away. Rather, the demand  will show up as crises in various budgets. It will show up in the DHSSPS budget  as young people struggle to deal with the stresses of living with violence. It  will show up in the DSD budget as communities struggle with the dual penalties of  segregation and deprivation. The Minister is well aware that all the designated  interfaces in Northern    Ireland are in areas where residents already  struggle with the stresses of poverty, deprivation and educational  underachievement. The demand will show up in the policing budget as tensions  develop into a crisis. I cannot understand any economic argument that the  Minister might make to support her decision. The cutting of the community  relations budget cannot possibly deliver any form of economic savings or  efficiencies in the long run.<span class="SectionMarker"><em><span style="font-size:14.0pt; "> </span></em></span></p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Improvements could certainly be made to the way in which  community relations are delivered and managed by the Department. Reviews of  those efforts recommend that a clear policy framework be constructed to ensure  that community relations programmes are focused and constructive and that the  work is not duplicated. Where is the clear policy framework? If there are  problems with the way in which the budget has been administered, changes need  to be made. Improvements cannot possibly be made by gutting the funding stream.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My concern with the Executive is the apparent lack of  deliberate reflection and consultation from Ministers when they make budgetary decisions.  We are entering a period of significant reductions in public spending. The cuts  that Ministers make to their budgets must be extremely precise and based on  careful assessments of where need does and does not exist, not simply on  lopping off figures from a budget line item. It is not possible to argue that  the need does not exist for community relations work among young people in the  education system.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Not only is the need there but it has expanded. We are a  different society now from what we were 10 years ago, and our communities have  grown. There are thousands of new arrivals in Northern Ireland from countries  around the world, and those people have brought their cultures, religions and  ideas. I hope that we have begun to recognise and embrace our gay, lesbian,  bisexual and transgender citizens and the important role that they play in  society. Community relations are not only about Catholics and Protestants but  about normalising our society and recognising the fact that our future is  shared. I urge the Minister to revisit her decision and invest in the equality  that she claims to support.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Your time is up.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Purvis</strong>: I  support the motion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education (Ms Ruane)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I am  taking a strategic approach to addressing community relations, and my decision  must be viewed in the context of the impact of the wider education budget and  plans to introduce a new community relations, equality and diversity policy.  The task for education is to prepare children and young people for living in a  society that is diverse.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The existing community relations policy was originally  developed over 20 years ago, with the focus mainly on promoting contact by  bringing together young people from Catholic and Protestant communities.  However, I concur with the many Members, particularly Anna Lo and Dawn Purvis,  who said that much has changed in our society, including the revised  curriculum, equality legislation, the political environment and the wider  diversity that now exists. For example, in the early 1990s, there were 655  newcomer pupils for whom English was an additional language. By 2009-2010, that  had risen to 7,533 pupils, an increase well in excess of 1,000%.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Given that today&rsquo;s society is much more diverse, any policy  needs to reflect all section 75 groups, not just two or three of them. There  are nine grounds in equality, including persons of different religious belief,  political opinion, racial groups, sexual orientation, gender or age, people  with and without a disability and people with or without dependants. The Good  Friday Agreement and the St Andrews Agreement committed to actively promoting  the advancement of human rights, equality and mutual respect as well as the  United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and the current Programme  for Government. Any community relations, equality and diversity policy must  reflect those commitments.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">To ensure that community relations work in schools reflects  the current environment, I commissioned a review of the policy. In undertaking  the policy review, my Department engaged widely with stakeholders from across  the education sector. I established a working group comprising a range of  expertise and perspectives to assist in the review and to make recommendations  for future policy direction. Members of the group included a school principal;  a youth worker; people from the Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and  Assessment (CCEA); the schools inspectorate; the Community Relations Council;  Ultach; the Council for Ethnic Minorities; the Children&rsquo;s Law Centre; the  Equality Commission; and the Human Rights Commission. The working group  considered detailed evidence, including presentations from key stakeholders; a  literature review; an Education and Training Inspectorate report; an audit of  educator training needs; and responses to over 2,000 pre-consultation  questionnaires.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The results of the review indicated the need for a wider  approach to community relations and identified inadequacies in the existing  policy. The review identified inadequate monitoring and evaluation of the quality  of community relations provision; the restrictive nature of funding criteria,  which limited current practice and did not encourage progression in community  relations; the unnecessary complexity of five separate funding strands;  insufficient in-service training for teachers; and the lack of connections  between community relations work and other education policies, which have led  to this work being seen as an add-on rather than as being integral to the  curriculum.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Drawing on the findings of the review, I plan to bring  forward a new community relations, equality and diversity policy. That will be  supported by guidance, and I plan to bring the policy forward for public  consultation later this year. I want to move away from the dependency on  external organisations in delivering community relations, equality and  diversity, by seeking to embed this work firmly in educational settings by  providing a strong skills base for educators and the teaching resources  required.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The new community relations, equality and diversity policy  will address the findings of the working group by engaging children and young  people on the need to promote equal rights and building a culture of mutual  respect. As such, the policy will align with the direction that the programme  for cohesion, sharing and integration is taking. The new policy will include  clear and meaningful outcome measurements to ensure that its impact can be  measured, something that, it has been clearly acknowledged, the existing policy  fails to do.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Thug m&eacute; r&eacute;imse polasaithe ar aghaidh cheana f&eacute;in agus m&eacute; ag  cur an chur chuige nua seo san &aacute;ireamh, amhail Gach Scoil ina Scoil Mhaith: Ag  Tac&uacute; Le Dalta&iacute; &Oacute; Th&iacute;ortha Eile agus togra&iacute; polasa&iacute; ar an mbealach chun tosaigh  do riachtanais oideachais speisialta agus cuimsi&uacute;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">With a wider approach in mind, I have brought forward a  range of policies, such as Every School a Good School:  Supporting Newcomer Pupils, and policy proposals on the way forward for special  educational needs and inclusion. They contribute to the broader approach that  will underpin the aim of improving relations between communities and promote  inclusion and a culture that welcomes diversity and equality.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Our schools have an important role to play in community  relations, equality and diversity. Teachers and youth workers, often in  difficult circumstances, assist our young people to be enlightened, critical  thinkers who are prepared for the responsibilities and obligations of life in a  changing democratic society.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My policy for school improvement, Every School a Good  School, lies at the centre of the reform agenda and is consistent with article  29(d) of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. Every School  a Good School acknowledges that school premises are a resource that could be  better used by local communities and that providing for increased community use  of school premises can be an effective way of building links between schools  and their local communities. I responded to Members&rsquo; interest on that subject  on 11 May.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">One significant way of achieving better community relations  is ensuring that the 11,000 people who leave our schools without the necessary  qualifications are addressed. We must ensure that the programme that we are  putting in place continues, because that one action will make a significant  difference. We cannot afford a situation in which our young people are leaving  school without qualifications.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Through the revised curriculum, I have sought to embed  community relations, with personal development, mutual understanding and human  rights work at primary level, and learning for life and work at post-primary  level in order to provide opportunities to address equality and diversity  issues and promote good relations. Among the very good community relations and  equality programmes for our schools are those provided by INTO and the Ulster  Teachers&rsquo; Union through their work with Amnesty International.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In 2010-11, current expenditure for education has increased  by 1.9% to just over &pound;1.9 billion, but, faced with meeting the efficiencies  that are required by the Executive, I have had to balance a range of education  priorities against the need to achieve efficiencies. My priority has been to  protect front line services and to ensure that the needs of those who are most  disadvantaged continue to be at the forefront.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As part of the budget process, an equality and human rights  screening was undertaken. It showed that the different needs of the various groups  were not being met fully by the community relations policy. As John O&rsquo;Dowd  said, my Department has suffered significant efficiency savings of &pound;74 million,  on top of the &pound;13 million savings previously withdrawn in anticipation of the  ESA. The best way that both parties opposite can contribute to community  relations and equality is by supporting the establishment of the education and  skills authority, instead of putting their heads in the sand.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Faced with decisions about whether to reduce the community  relations programme or reduce money going into the classroom, where there are  already opportunities to address that work, I have concluded that the latter is  preferable and more sustainable. I absolutely agree with Anna Lo on the points  that she made about poverty; I have no argument with that. We must target on  the basis of need, and the new policy must do that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I remain committed to increasing the relative funding for  primary schools. I have announced that the budget provides for an additional  &pound;90 per primary pupil, which represents a 3&middot;1% increase in funding per primary  school pupil compared to last year. All parties say that they support extra  money for primary schools, but they need to make measured contributions to the  debates, given the current economic climate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have also extended the free school meals entitlement  criteria to include working families with children in full-time nursery and  primary schools, with a household income below &pound;16,190. When fully operational,  it is expected that an additional 20,000 pupils will benefit from the extension  of the scheme, and I encourage all lower-income families to claim their  entitlements. I also encourage Members to spend their time letting their  constituents know about the scheme rather than trying to pick holes in the  community relations strategy in a very ill-thought-out way.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am considering a draft early years strategy for nought to  six-year-olds, and I have set aside &pound;1&middot;5 million to take forward development in  that key area. I congratulate Members who mentioned it, because it is a key  policy that will make a significant difference in future. I have also just  announced up to a further &pound;1&middot;3 million funding to provide additional preschool  places to meet unprecedented demand.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The curriculum sports programme, delivered by the GAA and  the IFA &mdash; organisations that reach out to their communities &mdash; continues to  receive funding, with &pound;1&middot;5 million available in 2010-11. The programme&rsquo;s  emphasis is on participation for everyone and working with working-class  communities.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I remain fully committed to the youth services and their  important impact on our young people. However, in recognition of the continued  need for good relations and equality, I have been able to make provision to  retain a funding stream for community relations work. The previous community  relations funding schemes terminated on 31 March 2010, and the organisations  affected were given notice of that on 3 August 2009 to provide time to bring  existing programmes to a managed closure.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Beidh mo chuid feidhmeannach ag obair leis na  pr&iacute;omhph&aacute;irtithe leasmhara san earn&aacute;il chun beala&iacute; nu&aacute;la&iacute;ocha agus &eacute;ifeacht&uacute;la  &oacute; thaobh an chostais de a aithint lena chinnti&uacute; go n-uasmh&eacute;ad&oacute;far an cisti&uacute; at&aacute;  ar f&aacute;il..</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My officials will work with key stakeholders across the  education sector to identify innovative and cost-effective ways of ensuring  that the funding available is maximised. To facilitate the administration  associated with the winding-up of existing schemes, I have made short-term  allocations to all the organisations affected from the 2010-11 budget. The  funding will cease at the end of May. The focus will be on embedding community  relations in the mainstream education system. Most of the 2010-11 funding for  community relations will be used to secure posts in the education and library  boards and in the Youth Council, which are critical to the implementation of  the new policy. Initially, they will be used to ensure a managed run-down of  current schemes until the end of June and to prepare for implementation of the  new policy.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, significant expenditure of over &pound;200 million  for special educational needs, &pound;8 million for supporting newcomer pupils and  &pound;28 million for youth services contributes to the wider approach to community  relations. It is against that background and the need to take cognisance of the  relevance and impact of other policies in respect of community relations that  my decision to set community relations funding at &pound;1&middot;1 million should be  viewed, not by focusing narrowly on one funding stream.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">With all the work that my Department is engaged in, I am  confident that education will continue to make a vital, meaningful and  sustainable contribution to building good relations and equality between young  people across the nine grounds rather than two or three grounds, and to the  emerging Executive policy on cohesion, sharing and integration.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>: I  thank all Members who have contributed to the debate. It has been constructive.  There has been little disagreement. I noticed that even John O&rsquo;Dowd appeared to  agree with the motion. I am glad to hear it. We all recognise that we are in  difficult financial times and that more lie ahead. The Department of Education  is no different to other Departments. However, there are questions to be asked  &mdash; they have been asked, rightly &mdash; about the degree of the cut and its  disproportionate effect on voluntary groups whose other funding sources are  limited.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I appreciate the Minister&rsquo;s point that the bulk of the  funding that has been withdrawn is being used to prepare for implementation of  the new community relations, equality and diversity policy, which is proposed  to be adopted during the current financial year. However, we are quite well  into the financial year, and the Minister talked about bringing it forward for  consultation &ldquo;later this year&rdquo;. Given that most of the groups that are now  being severely disadvantaged by the cut will expect to be funded under the new  policy, what on earth are they supposed to do in the meantime? In proposing the  motion, Anno Lo stated that they are grant-funded only until the end of May. The  &pound;1&middot;1 million that is left is to cover the entire financial year. The new policy  has not even been produced in draft form. Given the Department of Education&rsquo;s  rather sorry record of bringing forward policy documents, when can  implementation be expected? It seems to me that the best estimate is some time  around Christmas. What is supposed to be done about the 26 community relations  groups, the schools&rsquo; community relations programme and the youth support  scheme?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Anno Lo referred to the Programme for Government commitment  to promote tolerance, inclusion, health and well-being. Is this decision in  line with that commitment? Indeed, David Hilditch made an interesting point  about Robin Newton&rsquo;s comments earlier, which he said refocused the community  relations strategy. The jury is out on that. OFMDFM thinks so little of that  Programme for Government commitment that it has taken almost three years to  bring forward a draft CSI strategy. Frankly, that came only after pressure from  the Alliance Party and as part of the deal to persuade us to accept the Justice  Ministry. Although the strategy is yet to be made public, it is rumoured to be  high on rhetoric and low on substance. Given that it was brought forward under  duress, it is, perhaps, a half-hearted compromise. However, my party colleague  Stephen Farry informs me that there is strong affirmation in the strategy of  the principle of contact.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department of Education seems to be prepared to leave  so many worthy groups in the lurch on the vague promise of a new policy later  this year if they can stay in business in the meantime. I wonder what all of  that says not only about the Department but about the Executive&rsquo;s commitment to  community relations.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to spend a few moments on what Members have said  during the debate. Straight away, Mervyn Storey mentioned one funded body that  he knows of which is in the process of losing four experienced staff. Other  Members made similar points. Mervyn also referred to young people from  interfaces in deprived areas and the possibility of them being turned from the  proper way into more doubtful associations. That point was echoed by Dawn  Purvis and Dominic Bradley.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Several Members spoke about a vacuum in policy development.  That is the problem: we have done away with one policy without replacing it  with another. All that has been said about education sounds familiar. Basil  McCrea spoke about the common goal of trying to dismiss sectarian tensions and  commented that a modest budget can make a huge difference. That is absolutely  correct. He also said that the Assembly needs to get real about community  relations. He specifically referred to comments that I did not hear because I  was not at the meeting in question. However, there seemed to be at least a  difference of emphasis between what Daith&iacute; McKay said at the W5 meeting and  what the Minister is now saying.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Dominic Bradley referred to the review that started in 2008  and the loss of many good people to the community relations sector. He spoke  about staff being placed on protective notice and the fact that there is no  funding for programmes or transport and stated that, in that vacuum, the  initiative was being handed to others.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">John O&rsquo;Dowd surprised me slightly &mdash; I do not know why I was  surprised &mdash; by agreeing with the concerns that were expressed. He did not  appear to disagree with any part of the motion, but I wonder whether Sinn F&eacute;in  will actually support it. We will wait and see. He made the valid point that  the Department&rsquo;s budget is tightly stretched and that &pound;87 million is being lost  to it this year. That is fair enough. We all know that there are very difficult  decisions to be made but, in recent times, the Minister has managed to come up  with extra money that we did not know about for various schemes. She has not  been given much credit for some of those, but I will give her credit for the  reprioritisation of Whitehouse Primary School, the money that has been found  for preschool places and the decision on prep schools. All of that is very  welcome. Today, she mentioned a slight adjustment to the free school meals  criteria and another &pound;2 million for the Irish-medium sector, which will not  please everybody, but it is money that has been found.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  Wasted.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>: No;  not wasted, Mr Storey. It was found.<span class="Italic"> [Interruption.]</span> Sorry? I do not mind giving way if somebody wants to make a comment.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  I hope that it is not another rubbish report that the Member is reading from,  such as the one that he referred to last week in the House.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>:  Lord Morrow will not let me live that one down, but I stand by my view. John  McCallister made a telling comment about short-term budgetary decisions with  long-term effects. He could not have put it better; that is very sound logic.  Mary Bradley spoke about the SDLP&rsquo;s policy, which I think we all share: a  shared and equal society, free of hate. She also mentioned the multiple impacts  of cross-community work. There is no disagreement anywhere in the House about  those matters.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My party colleague Stephen Farry referred to the CSI  strategy being all-embracing and was completely at a loss to reconcile that  strategy, little as we know about it, with the 70% cut to a particular budget.  Dawn Purvis was baffled by that decision; aren&rsquo;t we all? She spoke about  &ldquo;gutting&rdquo; the budget and the failed United States policy of &ldquo;separate but  equal&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister has responded. I agree with what she said at  the beginning of her speech: much has changed in 20 years, and the policy  needed to be reviewed. That is fine. There is not a policy in existence in this  place that should not be reviewed on a more regular cycle than that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">(Mr Speaker in the Chair)</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I like the sound of the new policy that the Minister  described and of all the work that is going into that. She talked about 2,000  pre-consultation questionnaires &mdash; fair enough &mdash; and a wide-ranging review.  However, she said that all that will happen later this year. In the meantime,  those groups have little or no money.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, the Minister referred once again to the ESA &mdash; I do  not know how she could ever get through a speech without mentioning it &mdash; and the  necessity to establish it in order to save some money. For the record, I  completely agree with her. I am just throwing that in during the last few  seconds of my contribution. She talked about a managed run-down of existing  schemes. A managed run-down simply means that existing schemes will run out of  money at the end of May or possibly June. However, until a new policy is  established and some new funding is provided, a gap will exist. I, therefore,  appeal again to the Minister to try to fill that gap so that those schemes are  not detrimentally affected.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly expresses deep concern at the Minister of  Education&rsquo;s decision to introduce significant cuts to her Department&rsquo;s  community relations budget for 2010-11; and calls on the Minister to explain  how her Department can now make any meaningful contribution to building good  relations between young people and to an overarching Executive policy on  cohesion, sharing and integration.</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading"><a name="14"></a>Fortieth Anniversary of Disbanding of B-Specials and  Formation of UDR</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to one hour and 30 minutes for  the debate. The proposer of the motion will have 10 minutes in which to propose  and 10 minutes in which to make a winding-up speech. All other Members who are  called to speak will have five minutes.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to inform Members that a valid petition of concern  was presented today in relation to the motion. Under Standing Order 28, the  vote cannot be taken until at least one day has passed. Therefore, the vote  will be taken as the first item of business tomorrow morning, Tuesday 25 May.  The motion can, however, be debated today. I remind Members that another effect  of the petition is that the vote on the motion will be on a cross-community  basis.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>: I  beg to move</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly notes that April 2010 marked both the  fortieth anniversary of the dissolution of the Ulster Special Constabulary, or  B-Specials, and also the fortieth anniversary of the formation of the Ulster  Defence Regiment; expresses its gratitude to the bravery of the many people who  served in each; acknowledges the sacrifice made by many personnel as they  defended the population against terrorism; and calls on the Secretary of State  for Northern Ireland to mark these two important anniversaries.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Declan O&rsquo;Loan&rsquo;s new party must now be in operation given  the cross-party marriage of SDLP and Sinn F&eacute;in Members in relation to the  signing of the petition of concern. No doubt the SDLP leader will have some  questions to ask Mr O&rsquo;Loan about who will be the new leader of the party. That  is not said to politicise, in any way, what this afternoon is about.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Many people want revisionism at the heart of the way in  which we move forward and, unfortunately, they wish to airbrush from existence  the gallant history of the men and women who served in the B-Specials and the  UDR. That will not happen as long as members of my party are on this side of  the House. Many people have stood between terrorism and the community. Among  them were the members of the Ulster Special Constabulary and the UDR, whose  brave service helped to hold the line against terrorism. The motion  acknowledges their service and sacrifice. It is only right and proper that this  opportunity be taken to applaud the way in which the community was defended  from those who sought to murder by night.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A force of special constabulary was raised under the  Special Constables (Ireland) Act 1832. Recruiting for the Ulster Special  Constabulary opened on 1 November 1920, after a period of unrest and as the  South descended into anarchy and chaos. Between 1920 and 1922, it is estimated  that some 428 people were killed and a further 1,766 were wounded as the IRA  sought to kill the Northern Ireland state at birth.<span class="SectionMarker"><em><span style="font-size:14.0pt; "> </span></em></span></p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">In 1922 alone, 232 people were killed and 1,000  wounded. Just as the IRA would again fail in latter times, so, too, did it fail  in the 1920s.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">5.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When World War II broke out, a ready-made force of 13,000  men was available for Home Guard duties. That would later swell to 40,000 personnel.  In the 1950s, the IRA reverted to carrying out a terrorist campaign. The Ulster  Special Constabulary played an important role in responding to and defeating  that terrorist campaign. It is interesting to note historical author Tim Pat  Coogan&rsquo;s description of the B-Specials as:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;the rock on which &hellip; the IRA &hellip; foundered.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">After that period, and until its dissolution, the Ulster  Special Constabulary continued to give gallant and dedicated service to the  Province. Regrettably, members of the Ulster Special Constabulary lost their  lives in the line of duty. They were ordinary people who placed themselves to  the fore in combating terrorism, and they deserve our thanks.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">This year also marks the fortieth anniversary of the  formation of the Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR). It was formed in 1970 and  incorporated some former members of the Ulster Special Constabulary. Its main  purpose was to engage in guard and patrol duties in Northern Ireland, and it  was a key component in resisting the extreme, cruel and bloodthirsty terrorist  campaign that republican terrorists waged against the entire population. The  depravity, cruelty and brutality of events such as Bloody Friday bear solemn  testimony to the circumstances in which the UDR served this community, and  served it bravely.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the late 1980s, the UDR provided backup for the RUC  across 85% of Northern Ireland. Since its formation, 40,000 people served in  its ranks. It is estimated that the combined total of full-time and part-time  members exceeded 60,000 personnel. Given the sheer number of people who served  in the regiment, the extent of the reach of its duties and the prolonged period  for which it was on active service, the UDR&rsquo;s disciplinary record is nothing  less than exemplary. By the time that it merged into the Royal Irish Regiment,  197 members and 47 former members had been murdered. The UDR was on active  service longer than any regiment since the Napoleonic wars.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Whereas regular troops could usually be attacked only while  on duty, members of the UDR lived and worked in the community. They were almost  always attacked when at home, when at work or when unarmed. Today, we do well  to remember those who lost their lives. Although it would be improper to pick  out any individual, I recall one incident involving a serving member of the UDR  who travelled to work with someone whom he thought was his colleague, but who  was charged a few years later with his murder. How sad that we had a society in  which that was not only something that happened but, unfortunately, was something  that was supported. I trust that we will never again go back to that mentality.  These were ordinary Ulstermen and Ulsterwomen who placed themselves in danger  that we might live in peace. In the worst days of the Troubles, they became the  target of terrorist organisations that we in this House might have a future.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Today, Sinn F&eacute;in sits in this regional Assembly in the UK.  Today, it upholds the British criminal justice system. Today, it gives  allegiance to, and, in many cases, is actively giving evidence to, a British  police service. The republican movement has been forced to deal with  decommissioning; it has been forced to announce the formal ending of its  campaign; it has been forced to issue a formal stand-down order to all its  personnel; and it has been forced to sign up to support the police, the courts  and the rule of law.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In short, as Mr Molloy, a Member of this House, said in  1999:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;We are really prepared to administer British rule in  Ireland for the foreseeable future. The very principle of partition is  accepted, and if the unionists &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. Is it correct for a Member to misquote another  Member in the House? I ask the Member to withdraw that particular quote.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I have often said in the House that Members have to be careful when they are  quoting other Members. Therefore, it is very important that if Members are  being quoted, they are being quoted correctly.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  Mr Speaker, I am quite happy to provide you with the source of the quote.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will complete the quote:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The very principle of partition is accepted, and if  unionists had had that in the 1920s they would have been laughing.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The brave men and women of the UDR, through their  service, gallantry and sacrifice, greatly helped to bring republicans to that  place. They deserve our thanks, and I express my personal thanks to them in the  House today.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Today, our Province is, to a large degree, at peace.  Although the situation is not perfect, and though the institutions in the House  are far from perfect, there is no longer the devastation and death that  happened on a weekly basis when I was growing up.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As we seek to move Northern Ireland forward on that basis,  we must never forget our past or the great price that was paid by so many to  bring us to where we are today. As we reflect upon our past, there can be no  greater contrast than that between the role of the various republican terrorist  organisations on the one hand and the role of the forces of law and order, as  epitomised by the members of the B-Specials, the UDR and other members of Her  Majesty&rsquo;s forces, on the other. The former had a clear political agenda, which  was designed to destroy our Province, its economy, its way of life and its  heritage. The latter had no political agenda; they only sought to stand between  us and those who would destroy our lives and our property.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Will the Member bring his remarks to a close?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  Republican terrorists deserve no praise or commendations; they deserve no  memorials. However, those whom we commemorate in the motion do deserve our  thanks and appreciation.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  It is right that, as far as possible, Members quote other Members correctly.  However, it is not the Speaker&rsquo;s job to sit in judgement about where Members  get their information. Mr Molloy will have an opportunity to correct what has  been said when he speaks in the debate.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  The previous Member ended his speech by telling republicans that they have no  right to remember their dead and they have no right to remember those people  who lost their lives in a conflict that was not of their making.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion is about many things. However, at its centre is  the right of people to commemorate, in their own way, those to whom they felt  close, those to whom they felt loyalty and those who had the same political  views. So, it is difficult when someone gets up and makes a speech about the  right to honour someone, only to tell others at the end of it that they have no  right to do the same.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  It should not necessarily fall to this House to honour such people.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member has an extra minute.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Thank you, Mr Speaker.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I move through my speech, I will clarify my position on  that. I will not be going cap in hand to the British Secretary of State asking  for permission to commemorate anyone. If the unionist parties opposite are  serious about commemorating those who served, fought and died as members of the  Ulster Defence Regiment and the B-Specials, they should be responsible for  organising such commemorations, instead of seeking permission to do so from  someone else.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The previous Member to speak, perhaps rightly, gave a  one-sided version of the history of the B-Specials through to the UDR. All  those organisations were formed for one reason and one reason only: to maintain  the status quo in this state. The way in which they went about that created not  only the conflicts of the 1920s that the Member spoke about but surely helped  to create the intense conflict that we saw from 1969 through until we  eventually reached where we are now.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The actions of the B-Specials bred a fear in the  nationalist community. That not only drove many nationalists physically from  their homes but many others left Ireland simply because the B-Specials ruled  the community in which those people wanted to live. That was no way for any  society to be built.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member moved on to discuss the creation of the Ulster  Defence Regiment. Throughout his speech, he talked about terrorism and terror.  I do not say this to be inflammatory, but many in my community, including  myself, would have seen the Ulster Defence Regiment as a terrorist  organisation. I am not saying that to provoke a reaction or to cause hurt to  anyone. However, as was the case with the B-Specials, the actions of members of  the Ulster Defence Regiment, whether they were in or out of uniform, caused  fear among the broader nationalist and republican community. I do not think  that that is a history on which this House can reflect in common purpose and be  proud of.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The actions of those people did not help to end the  conflict, as Mr Storey said. Rather, they helped to prolong the conflict.  Members of the UDR, and their forefathers in the B-Specials, did not involve  themselves in a campaign of security. I assure you that when a UDR patrol was  seen in the communities that I represent, no one felt secure. When the UDR  stopped you at the roadside, searched you, took your details, asked you where  you worked, and were able to tell you everything about your life, it was not  for your security. When that same information ended up in the hands of  so-called loyalist paramilitaries, it was not for your security. When that same  information was used to kill your neighbours, members of your family and  members of the broader community, it was not for your security. That was terror  in its classical form.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That did not bring us to peace. What brought us to peace  was politics. We can rewrite our own versions of history, but we are on these  Benches today because we decided to make politics work. I am glad that politics  is working, because I do not want another generation to experience the life  that we experienced. I do not want another generation to go off to join  organisations such as the UDR or the RIR, and I do not want another generation  to go off to join the IRA. I want the next generation in this society to make  politics even stronger and to resist those who, whether through words or  actions, choose to bring us back to the days of conflict. That is the way  forward.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want those who wish to remember to be able to do so in a  dignified way, whether they are remembering the B-Specials or the UDR. However,  I also want them to understand that we as republicans have a right to remember  those who were dear to us. Those IRA volunteers and their families have a right  to remember their loved ones in a dignified way. If we can have common cause in  that, it would show a maturity about this society.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  I thank and congratulate the Members who moved the motion. As a former member  of the Ulster Defence Regiment, I take great pride in having served in that  regiment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to deal with a couple of issues that Mr O&rsquo;Dowd  raised. There will never be any similarity between those who served in Her  Majesty&rsquo;s security forces to protect all communities in this Province and those  terrorists who skulked about in the dark of the night or in the light of the  day and murdered the citizens of this Province and the wider community. Indeed,  they murdered not only the citizens of this Province but citizens of the Irish  Republic and Great Britain. There can be no similarity between those two  groups.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to dispel another myth about the B-Specials and  quote directly from the Hunt report, which, at paragraph 3.16, states that the:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;USC were also used in Belfast to protect licensed  premises which, being largely Catholic owned and managed, were at risk from  Protestant hooligans when communal tension was high. Again, they did the job  well &mdash; as is evidenced by the destruction of so many public houses as soon as  they were withdrawn.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That proves that the B-Specials were not sectarian.  When I served in the UDR, I protected people from the nationalist and Roman  Catholic community in the same way that I protected those from the Protestant  and unionist community.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">5.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I recall nights when I guarded the homes of nationalist  politicians in my constituency because of the threat against them; I did the  same for unionist politicians. Mr O&rsquo;Dowd referred to people being searched.  That was absolutely right; I was searched by other members of the security  forces, but I did not complain. Law-abiding people had absolutely nothing to  fear. The difference was that, for decades, some people deliberately murdered  others, bombed the Province and tried to destroy its citizens.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Fortunately, although many people lost their lives &mdash; our  memory should be with them at this time &mdash; the terrorists were not able to bomb  and murder the people of the Province into submission. The peaceful society  that we have today is due in no small part to the B-Specials, the Ulster  Defence Regiment and other security services. But for their actions, the  Province could easily have slid into anarchy many years ago.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Storey said that certain people may not have pulled the  trigger to murder their neighbours who served in the Ulster Defence Regiment or  the B-Specials, but if they did not, they set them up. That caused huge  suspicion and mistrust among communities. When the Ulster Defence Regiment was  first established, there was a huge attempt to recruit as many Roman Catholics  as possible. The fact that that did not happen had nothing to do with the  reasons behind the formation of the regiment. It was because those from the  Roman Catholic tradition chose not to make it happen.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I served with Roman Catholic colleagues. One night, one of  them went out on duty with one patrol and I went with another. That was the  last time that I saw him: he was murdered that night. Another colleague with  whom I served lived in a predominantly Roman Catholic housing estate. The  people who lived there made his life a misery just because he wished to serve  his community. I say shame on those who murdered their fellow citizens, even  though they were of the same religion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member must bring his remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  I say shame on those who made that soldier&rsquo;s life a misery just because he was  serving the community.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. From what we have heard today, we know  that there are deep sensitivities around the motion for people on all sides of  our community. Some unionist people watching the debate will have had family  members who were in the UDR, and some will have had family members who were in  the UDR and were murdered. There are probably Members who, as we have heard,  were in the UDR, and, as Mr Elliott said, knew people who were murdered.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Likewise, nationalist people, as well as Members, have had  family members murdered at the hands of UDR members, sometimes acting in  collusion with loyalist paramilitaries. I would like Members to be sensitive to  both perceptions of the UDR. A sectarian slanging match across the Floor of the  House will not serve well the memory of the dead. It is not what their families  would want, nor is it to anyone&rsquo;s benefit. The families want to know the truth  about how their loved ones died and to have that truth acknowledged.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I do not seek to demonise everyone who was in the UDR, some  of whom were neighbours who lived on the same street as me. It would be wrong  of me to do that, but it would also be wrong to deny that some members of that  regiment acted outside the law, sometimes in collusion with loyalist  paramilitaries.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In my constituency, a group known as the Glenanne Gang,  which comprised loyalist paramilitaries, members of the RUC and its Reserve, as  well as members of the UDR, was responsible for at least 18 gun and bomb  attacks in which 58 people were murdered. The group had its headquarters on a  farm outside the village of Glenanne. One of the gang members, former RUC  Sergeant John Weir, confessed to his part in those activities and exposed the  gang members.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Weir was a member of the RUC&rsquo;s special anti-terrorist  group, the special patrol group. In his evidence, he named a loyalist  paramilitary from Lurgan Robin Jackson and the late Robert McConnell among the  members of the gang. He stated that Jackson and UDR member McConnell were  responsible for the murder of republican John Francis Greene at Mullyash near  Castleblayney.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Dublin and Monaghan bombings were co-ordinated from the  farm, and the explosives were stored there. Weir said that the explosives for  both attacks had been provided by an intelligence officer in the UDR. The bombs  were assembled at the farmhouse in Glenanne. The main organisers of both  attacks had been a loyalist paramilitary and a named UDR captain from Lurgan.  The bombs had been transported in cars by Robin Jackson and the UDR captain,  both of whom took part in the Dublin attack.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The gang was also responsible for gun and bomb attacks in  two pubs in Crossmaglen, after which one man died; the murder of two football  supporters at Tullyvallen; and the attacks on Donnelly&rsquo;s bar at Silverbridge  and Kay&rsquo;s Tavern in Dundalk, in which four people died and others were injured.  Bomb attacks were also carried out in Castleblayney and at the Rock Bar in  Keady, in which three people died.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">UDR member the late Robert McConnell was the common element  in most of those attacks, with the named UDR captain supplying the explosives in  most cases. Gang members were also involved in the Miami Showband killings.  Three of the Reavey brothers from Whitecross and three members of the O&rsquo;Dowd  family were also victims of the gang, as were RUC Sergeant James Campbell and  Ahoghill grocer William Strathearn. Weir admitted complicity in the latter  murder for which he was convicted and imprisoned.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">RUC Sergeant John Weir has been accepted as a credible  witness by Justice Henry Barron, who led the inquiry into the Dublin and  Monaghan bombings, and by the Historical Enquiries Team in Northern Ireland.  The members of the UDR who were involved with the Glenanne Gang were not  defending the population against terrorism: they were doing the opposite. They  were terrorising the community. They acted outside the law in collusion with  loyalist paramilitaries and brought death, injury and destruction to scores of  innocent people. That is why the SDLP has lodged a petition of concern.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Bring your remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  That is why we oppose the motion. Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  The issue is clearly sensitive, and I fear that the middle ground is very  narrow indeed. The Alliance Party tried to table an amendment to suggest a  positive alternative that might have had the potential to unite the House, but  it was not taken forward. We must appreciate that history is rarely a black or  white matter. There will always be interpretation and dispute around it. That  is particularly the case in Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We accept that there is a landmark anniversary in relation  to the standing down of the Ulster Special Constabulary, or B-Specials, and the  creation of the Ulster Defence Regiment, which later merged into the Royal  Irish Regiment. The question is whether we should call on the Secretary of  State to commemorate that. If we do, whether he would want to act on that is  another matter.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As other Members said, there is scope for people in this  society to have their own commemorations. However, we should look at how we can  jointly commemorate our shared history. I may return to that point later.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Alliance Party welcomes every opportunity to express  its gratitude to and respect for those people who have served in the police and  security forces, whether in the RUC, the PSNI or the Ulster Defence Regiment,  to defend this society against terrorism, be it loyalist or republican, and  those who have consistently acted in line with the values of the rule of law,  democracy and human rights. Although I have critical comments to make about the  B-Specials later, I accept what Mr Elliott said about the Hunt report&rsquo;s  reference to their protection of Catholic lives and property. It is also  important that we recognise the significant loss of life among the B-Specials  and the UDR.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That said, in trying to give a balanced reflection of the  situation, it is only right that we acknowledge that there were abuses of power  in policy and practice by the state &mdash; both the Stormont and direct rule regimes  &mdash; during our history. Individuals acting with Crown authority also abused their  power and authority in how they conducted their duty. There are documented  examples of members of the Crown forces who acted in an illegal manner, were  involved in some extremely serious crimes and had links to paramilitary  organisations. That is all on record.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We must also reflect on the fact that different sections of  our community have different perceptions and real experiences of the B-Specials  and the UDR. In doing so, it is important that we draw distinctions between the  B-Specials and the UDR. The context of the two organisations was different. The  B-Specials were part of the RUC and controlled by the Stormont regime, and  there was no balance in their membership. As Mr Elliott said, strong efforts  were made to recruit Catholics to the UDR in the early 1970s, but those  attempts were ultimately unsuccessful.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We must recognise that the B-Specials were drawn almost  exclusively from the Protestant section of our society. That fact was borne out  by a succession of reports; namely, the Scarman, Cameron and Hunt reports. The  point was made that it was almost impossible for a Catholic to be a member of  those organisations. Policing and security are at the heart of the conflict in  Northern Ireland and Ireland. People from the Catholic tradition were regarded  as being de facto subversives, which was a wrong assumption in many cases.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important to reflect on two themes that the Assembly  should never forget. First, we have an ongoing challenge to deal with the past  and the legacy of the past. We have still not come to terms with it, and, in  some respects, we continue to push it away. Indeed, the new Government seem  intent on doing that. We also have to reflect on how we build a shared future  and produce a stable, free and prosperous society. We must take a balanced view  of our history.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Buchanan</strong>:  I support the motion, and I congratulate my colleagues Mr Storey and Lord  Morrow for securing the debate in this important anniversary year. It is only  right and proper that we have the opportunity to place on record our deep  respect for the members of the Ulster Special Constabulary and the Ulster  Defence Regiment. They played a crucial part in the battle against the enemies  of the Province at different stages in our history, and we in the House owe them  a great debt of gratitude.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The republican propaganda machine worked hard to malign and  misrepresent the USC and the UDR over the years, but it was only propaganda.  Republican terrorists regarded members of those organisations as legitimate  targets, and several hundred of their members were brutally murdered in cold  blood. They were easy targets for the so-called brave volunteers of the IRA.  Many were attacked when out of uniform and going about their ordinary civilian  jobs, working on their farms or arriving home only to be gunned down in front  of their family by bloodthirsty gangsters during a campaign that was supported  by Members of the House.<span class="SectionMarker"><em><span style="font-size:14.0pt; "> </span></em></span></p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A table in the book &lsquo;Lost Lives&rsquo; shows responsibility for  deaths, year by year, from 1966 to 2006, and it reveals that 2,152 murders were  committed by various republican terrorist groupings in some of the most vicious  circumstances, so I will take no lectures this evening from the Members  opposite. Their attempts to discredit the B-Specials and the UDR will be  treated with the contempt that they deserve. Republican accusations that these  people were drawn from the Protestant riff-raff must also be strenuously  rejected. Most unionist families, my own included, can speak with pride of  family members who served in varying roles in the B-Specials and the UDR. I am  proud to be able to say that members of my family served and still serve in Her  Majesty&rsquo;s forces.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">5.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The USC played a pivotal role at crucial moments in the  history of Northern Ireland. Tribute has rightly been paid to its members&rsquo;  public-spirited service and selfless devotion. Even the Hunt report, which  recommended its disbandment, paid warm tribute to them. It said that, to a man,  the special constables had devoted themselves to the cause of Ulster and that  they had rendered gallant service.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When Northern Ireland was established in 1921, it faced an  immediate and severe threat from its enemies, and we are eternally grateful for  the contribution of the USC at that time. Not only did Northern Ireland survive  then, but it is still here today as part of the United Kingdom, even though  Barry McElduff, speaking on the radio last week, got very worked up about that  particular issue. Mr McElduff may be in denial, but I remind him that he sits  in the Northern Ireland Assembly within the United Kingdom of Great Britain and  Northern Ireland, where he now supports the police and the rule of law and the  judicial system.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The B-men&rsquo;s knowledge of local areas and local people was  crucial at different stages in our history. They played a key part in the Home  Guard during World War Two and in the defeat of the IRA campaign of 1956 to  1962. Then, in 1969, when militant republicans again attempted to destroy  Northern Ireland, the B-Specials came to the rescue once more, only to be  sacrificed on the altar of political expediency. The Hunt report, which  recommended the scrapping of the Specials and the creation of an unarmed police  service was naive and failed to face up to key realities. As Dr Paisley once  said:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;if you want to destroy a country pull out the teeth  of her defence forces and she will be easy prey.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I have no doubt that the Troubles, which were the  scourge of this Province for many years, would not have lasted as long as they  did had the B-Specials been retained and not disbanded.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The B-Specials were disbanded in 1970 and replaced by the  RUC Reserve and the UDR, and I want to pay tribute to them as well. They stood  in the gap and were not found wanting. Many of their members were murdered,  many more injured, and many carry the scars of physical and mental pain to the  present day. Unfortunately, they too ceased to exist, but their bravery must  not be forgotten. I share the regiment&rsquo;s pride in the award of the Conspicuous  Gallantry Cross by Her Majesty the Queen, and I call on the Secretary of State  to begin his term of office on a sound basis by ensuring that the B-Specials  and the UDR are properly remembered and celebrated in this fortieth anniversary  year.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I close by quoting some words from a poem by John Potter,  which is dedicated to the UDR:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;We did not serve because we hate</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">Nor bitterness our hearts dictate.</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">But we were they who must aspire</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">To quench the flame of terror&rsquo;s fire.</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">As buglers sound and pipers play</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">The proud battalions march away.</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">Now may the weary violence cease</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">And let our country live in peace.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Buchanan</strong>:  I support the motion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat. First, I refute completely the allegations made by Mr  Storey at the beginning of his speech, even though he has left the Chamber.  Misquotes and allegations are easily thrown about without standing over the  facts.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I find it hard to believe that this backward-looking motion  is before the House today. Some spoke of revisionism; this is real revisionism.  I would have thought that even the DUP, at this stage, would have realised that  it was largely the actions of these two paramilitary forces that led to the  collapse of the six-county statelet. They were the real terrorists.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the fact that the B-Specials were disbanded.  Everyone in the nationalist community rejoiced at that event. Unfortunately,  many of them simply changed uniform and moved across to another organisation.  They continued the harassment, the murder of nationalists and the collusion  with others to ensure that loyalist paramilitaries had information to act on.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My early memories of the B-Specials are of being taken out  of the car when I was very young, coming from midnight Mass at 1.00 am, by  these men dressed in long black coats, brandishing guns and asking everyone  their name and address. They asked my father for his name and address, even  though the B-man was a next-door neighbour who knew him better than most &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Moutray</strong>:  He did not shoot him, did he?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>: &mdash;  but that was part of the harassment.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>:  That was part of the harassment to put people in their place and to try to  intimidate them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">For me, the Troubles began when the Tynan platoon of  B-Specials, which I am sure Members sitting opposite would know well, shot John  Gallagher on the Cathedral Road in Armagh. John Gallagher was a young man who  was going home from his work and was walking through a peaceful civil rights  march that was attacked by B-Specials, who shot John Gallagher. For me, that  was the start of the Troubles because that was when the terrorists really  opened up.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The B-men also opened fire on unarmed marches in Dungannon,  Coalisland and across the North. The Protestant militia were at their dirty  work, but this time, the croppies would not lie down; they continued to  challenge. We then had the whitewash of Scarman, when it was found that the  B-men were always carrying someone else&rsquo;s gun, no one was accountable for  anything, and no one admitted playing a part. These were the forces of the  state, being paid by the state, allegedly to keep order. Even the British  Government could not stand over their actions, and the B-Specials were disbanded,  to the delight of the nationalist community once again.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">After the battle of the Bogside, we saw &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Moutray</strong>:<span class="Italic"> [Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>:  After the battle of the Bogside, the B-Specials were completely humiliated by  children on the top of the flats who beat them down with petrol bombs, stones,  bricks and, on many occasions, their hands. The B-Specials had proved to be  useless at anything in such a situation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The disbandment of the B-Specials was welcome but  short-lived, because many of them joined the UVF. I know that in the murder  triangle, where I lived, most of them joined the UVF and became the  paramilitary force that killed many Catholics in that area. Others joined the  UDR. The UDR was supposed to be a regiment &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Moutray</strong>:  Others joined the IRA.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>: I  do not think that any of them joined the IRA.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Moutray</strong>: <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>:  Others joined another paramilitary force, the UDR, which was supposed to be a  British Army regiment with accountability. What followed was collusion with  loyalist murder gangs; bogus patrols, who shot two GAA men who were returning  from an all-Ireland final, including a neighbour of mine, John Farmer; and the  direct murder of Catholics who were shot when they came across them. That is  what members of the nationalist community think about when they hear the name  B-Specials or UDR; they think about murder and paramilitary connections. Those  two organisations have a lot in common: both were Protestant, paramilitaries,  murderers, and they were both disbanded, even by the British Government. Even  the British Government could not stand over them. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>:  By all means.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  I thank the Member for giving way, Mr Speaker.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">First, I resent the fact that the B-Specials and the UDR  are being called paramilitary forces. That is absolutely unnecessary and not  true. Secondly, will the Member accept the fact that I condemn people in any of  those forces who broke the law? However, will he condemn members of terrorist  organisations, such as the IRA, who skulked about at night, shot, murdered and  blew up our citizens? Will he condemn them in the way in which I have condemned  those in the security forces who broke the law?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>:  First, to continue on the lines of what I had been saying: both those regiments  had a lot in common. Both had to be disbanded by the British Army after they  had been used and served their purpose as a cover for loyalist paramilitaries whom  they worked alongside.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will respond to Mr Elliott&rsquo;s point: we are talking about  people who were supposed to be the forces of law and order, the Government&rsquo;s  representatives on the ground, the people who were supposed to be protecting  all citizens &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member will bring his remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>:  Mr Speaker, I think that I have an extra minute.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I warned Members about giving way close to the end of their time.  Unfortunately, Mr Elliott ate into the Member&rsquo;s extra time. When Members have  the Floor and decide to give way, they must be aware of how much time they have  left.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Robinson</strong>:  I support the motion, and I shall attempt to express my admiration of and  thanks to the members of the B-Specials and the UDR for their role in  protecting the entire population from those who desired civil unrest and  planned to commit murder and destruction. The role they played, amid great  sacrifice, has never been acknowledged properly. The B-Specials were part time  and underpaid, apart from a small allowance for service and wear and tear on  clothes. They were expected to do occasional duty, usually one evening per  week, in their home area.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In 1997, in his most recent book, &lsquo;Crisis and Decline: the  Fate of the Southern Unionists&rsquo;, the historian R B McDowell recalled childhood  memories of those years:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;&hellip; one bright evening I stood at a window &hellip; I heard  footsteps and saw a patrol of B Specials, decent, middle-aged men with police  caps and armlets, carrying themselves with solemn determination. I felt  reassured.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Mr McDowell captured the perfect description of the  typical B-Special: a decent middle-aged man.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A former B-Special told me that the work was often dull.  However, the roll of honour for the entire Ulster Special Constabulary tells  the story of just how dangerous the work really was. Between 1921 and 1970, 246  men lost their life while serving their community. In those 50 years of  service, as Drew Nelson stated recently, they helped:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;the people of Northern Ireland in the defence of a  democratic way of life.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The B-Specials&rsquo; major advantage was that they knew who in  their communities would be likely to associate themselves with terrorists. They  had confidence in their local control over terrorists, and they were sure that  the terrorists recognised and feared that knowledge. Sadly, in 1970, the Ulster  Special Constabulary was disbanded and replaced by the UDR. The B-Specials had  become a victim of lies, innuendo and political cowardice. As Dr Paisley said  at the time:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;if you want to destroy a country pull out the teeth  of her defence forces and she will be easy prey.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Like the B-Specials, sadly, the UDR was also disbanded.  Once again, local people, men and women who believed in defending their  country, paid a heavy price in lives lost and injuries. Those are the facts  and, with them in mind, the motion is correct to call on the Secretary of State  to mark the two anniversaries. I join my colleagues in expressing gratitude to  all those who served in the B-Specials, the UDR or any of the forces when  terrorists wanted to destroy democracy and when they inflicted terrible wounds  on our people and our wee country.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Savage</strong>: I  support the motion, and I commend those who proposed it. I stand proud of my 14  years of service in the Ulster Defence Regiment. I pay tribute to the brave men  and women whom I had the honour to serve alongside, especially those who left  their families, tragically, never to return home. As a community, we must never  forget those who risked life and limb to keep this country safe and secure.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Last week, the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure  reminded us that the next decade is strewn with anniversaries: the battle of  the Somme, the Easter Rising, Ulster Day and the birth of Northern Ireland all  have their 100th anniversary. Indeed, the Ulster Special Constabulary was  formed in 1920 and, no doubt, there will be events to mark that milestone.  Today, we call on the Secretary of State to mark the fortieth anniversary of  the disbandment of the Ulster Special Constabulary and the formation of the  UDR, both of which were recommendations in the Hunt report.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">5.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I agree with the proposers of the motion that we should  mark these events. 1970 was a very troubled time in Northern Ireland. The fact  that the Hunt Committee was formed at all was testament to that. Northern  Ireland was not prepared for the campaign of murder that the IRA waged. The  Hunt report was an attempt to make our civil defences fit for the purpose of  keeping the peace.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The fact that such actions were required is an awful  reflection of the situation that prevailed at the time. It will not be possible  to get through the debate without making reference to the fact that some  Members on the Benches opposite were probably sometimes a cause for the concern  that required the UDR to be formed. Several Members have serious questions to  answer relating to their activities &mdash; indeed, their active service &mdash; in  proscribed organisations. Members of the UDR fell at the hands of evil men, and  it is difficult for many to accept that certain people sit in the Government of  this place, given what they have done. However, we have succeeded in forcing  them to move on, and the UDR played its part fully in that process. We forced  them into a position of knowing that their violence would not win and that it  would not achieve their stated aims. We forced them to surrender their weapons,  and we now have them making Northern Ireland work for its people. Today,  Northern Ireland is a different place to what it was in 1970, and I am proud of  the part that my party played in making that happen. I believe that it is right  to mark the part that the UDR and the Ulster Special Constabulary before it  played in that process.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We are entering a decade of anniversaries, and we are  debating one of them today. We need a structured and joined-up approach to  those anniversaries to ensure that the legacy of the sacrifice that was made in  order to bring us peace is never forgotten. We can look back at the time and  dedication that was devoted by so many men and women across our land who  guarded key installations and provided comfort and support to families living  in remote country areas. This was a land of unrest. Hopefully, we have moved  forward to a new beginning in which all our people can live in peace and  harmony. Those who served their country were not doing it for money. They did  it because they loved the country in which they lived.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  In participating in the debate, I am mindful of the fact that 197 serving  members of the UDR and 60 former members were murdered during the conflict. I  am very much aware of the pain and suffering that is still experienced by their  families. However, I do not know why the Members opposite expected this debate  to be anything other than divisive.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Last week, Minister Nelson McCausland talked about how we  must interrogate the past, prevent revisionism and get to the truth of what  really happened. Therefore, I want to refer to the establishment of the Ulster  Special Constabulary, otherwise known as the B-Specials. At a ministerial  meeting in London in 1920, James Craig proposed a new volunteer constabulary  for the Six Counties. He called for a force that should be raised from the  local population and organised on military lines. Craig told the British  Cabinet that the organisation of the UVF should be used for that purpose.  Charles Wickham, chief of police for the North of Ireland, favoured  incorporation of the UVF into regular military units. Wilfrid Spend, head of  the Ulster Volunteer Force &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  Wilfrid Spender.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  OK. Spender encouraged his members to join, saying that there was no reason why  the UVF should not furnish all the numbers required. West Belfast MP Joseph  Devlin told the Commons:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;you are going to arm pogromists to murder the Catholics&hellip;we  would not touch your Special Constabulary with a 40 foot barge pole&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">In a debate in the House of Commons on the Special  Estimates, John Hume welcomed the disbandment of what was a purely sectarian  force.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A special C1 division was created in 1921, specifically to  take in groups of UVF members. Information provided by Assembly Research and  Library Services notes a mother&rsquo;s thanks to Eamon de Valera for the creation of  and what she viewed as the necessity for the B-Specials, so that her sons would  not be conscripted into the British Army. Therefore, joining the B-Specials was  a way in which some people could avoid conscription.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Within months of their creation, the B-Specials were  engaged in organised sectarian violence. In Roslea, members of the B-Specials &mdash;  many of whom were former members of a vigilante gang organised by Basil Brooke  &mdash; burned down Catholic houses. In June 1921, the B-Specials were involved in  killings near Newry, but the worst atrocity happened in March 1922, when five  members of the McMahon family were lined up and shot in their north Belfast  home. A survivor testified:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Four of the five men were dressed in the uniform of  the RIC but, from their appearance, I know that they are Specials, not regular  RIC.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The following week, USC and RIC members were  involved in six further killings in Belfast.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As Mr Molloy recalled, the final deployment of the  B-Specials was in August 1969. When the Scarman tribunal examined the fatal  shooting of John Gallagher and the wounding of two others at Shambles Corner,  Armagh, on 14 August 1969, it found that there was no way that the tales told  by witnesses from the B-Specials could be true.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Other Members&rsquo; contributions focused on the B-Specials and  the UDR. It would be remiss of me, as a representative of Upper Bann, not to  acknowledge that members of the UDR were killed. However, they were also  complicit in and guilty of the murder of some of my constituents and the  shooting of a former party colleague Gabriel O&rsquo;Dowd, of whose murder members of  the UDR were convicted.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Over the 40 years of conflict between 1966 and 2006, some  3,720 people died, the majority of whom were murdered by the IRA. I welcome the  earlier comments of Mr John O&rsquo;Dowd, but it is unfortunate that it has taken  Sinn F&eacute;in so long to recognise what the SDLP has always said, which is that  politics brought about peace. Over the years, John Hume, Gerry Fitt, Paddy  Devlin and their successors in the SDLP made that argument. It is shameful that  so many people were murdered before Sinn F&eacute;in discovered it to be true.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Adams</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. If I may, I will ignore the remarks of  the previous Member who spoke. I have no problem with Members celebrating the  UDR or the B-Specials, but I oppose the motion, because it is inappropriate for  them to do so in the Chamber.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The B-Specials were an armed wing of the old unionist  regime at Stormont. However, I am also conscious that members, former members  and relatives of the RUC, B-Specials and the UDR were killed by republicans. I  am mindful of the hurt involved and want to be measured in what I say. Everyone  should regret the fact that anyone was killed, and I certainly do. At the same  time, there is no avoiding the shameful record of the B-Specials force or the  fact that it had to be disbanded by the British Government. The UDR has a  similar history, and it was also scrapped.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The British Government of the day made no bones about the  purpose of those organisations. They armed unionists to defend the union and  partition, and they equipped them with all the weapons of coercion,  sectarianism and terrorism. That was also the case with the UDR. Perhaps  Members should reflect on the fact that, when the British establishment felt  the need to protect its mainstream regiments, it recruited more expendable,  indigenous people to do its work and founded the UDR as part of its  Ulsterisation strategy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I understand why some people joined those organisations,  and I do not doubt that many of them, such as Mr Elliott and Mr Savage, may  have behaved bravely in the conduct of their duties. However, it is my strong  view that those organisations and their members were used by sinister elements  in the political and military elites here for their own narrow ends, and, when  they had served their purpose, the British Government simply got rid of them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Those who tabled the motion must have known that it would  not get the support of other parties. They must have known that there would be  the divisive type of discussion that we have had. So, what is the purpose? What  is the objective? How do today&rsquo;s debate and the offensive remarks of some of  the Members opposite fit into the effort to unite parties here in the urgent  work of delivering for people on a range of pressing social and economic issues  and building a more inclusive and prosperous future for everyone?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Even a brief glimpse at the history of the UDR or the  Specials would satisfy all but the most jaundiced eyes that those forces were  entirely subversive. The history of the UDR, in particular, is replete with  accounts of its involvement directly in the murder of Catholics and indirectly  in the murder of hundreds more through collusion with death squads. In  addition, British agents such as Brian Nelson helped to procure weapons through  the old apartheid regime in South Africa. Those weapons were secured for the  use of three unionist paramilitary organisations: the UDA, the UVF and Ulster  Resistance, which was founded by leading members of the Democratic Unionist  Party. In the six years following the arrival of the arms shipment from South  Africa, 229 citizens were murdered by unionist paramilitaries. In many cases,  files and photos of nationalists and republicans were passed over to the death  squads, frequently from within the UDR.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As part of the necessary process of peace building and  understanding, I appeal very respectfully to the Members opposite to reflect on  what has been said from these Benches. I appeal to them to resist the  temptation to put forward divisive motions such as this one and to commit  themselves to building peacefully and democratically for the future.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bresland</strong>:  It is not only a privilege but a pleasure for me to rise to my feet to pay a  heartfelt tribute to the gallant members of the Ulster Special Constabulary and  the Ulster Defence Regiment in this important anniversary year. Northern  Ireland has come to a place of peace, but the road has been a long and rocky  one. A high price has been paid to bring us to where we are today.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As we reflect on the journey along that rocky road, all of  us in the House will have our heroes and our villains. There are those in the  House whose open hatred of the B-Specials and the UDR is well known. No one  argues that those organisations were perfect &mdash; there are bad apples in  virtually every organisation &mdash; but they have been condemned by those who are in  no position to judge. Indeed, words such as &ldquo;pots&rdquo;, &ldquo;kettles&rdquo; and &ldquo;black&rdquo;  spring to my mind. Despite what republican propaganda might say, the vast  majority of the B-Specials and the UDR were decent and hard-working members of  society. To me and to thousands of others across the Province, the memory of  the B-Specials and the UDR is warmly revered. Along with the RUC and the Army,  they stood between us and those who wished to destroy us and our way of life.  Most of us on this side of the Chamber have strong ties with the Specials and  the UDR. Many of our family members were proud to wear the uniform.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Today, Northern Ireland&rsquo;s position in the UK is stronger  than ever, and we look forward to celebrating the 100th anniversary of Northern  Ireland in 2021. Those who served in the B-Specials and the UDR played a major  part in the preservation of the union. From the setting-up of Northern Ireland  in 1921 until the force&rsquo;s disbandment in 1970, the B-Specials were the key to  Ulster&rsquo;s survival. The Hunt report states that, during the early days of  Northern Ireland, the Specials bore a heavy responsibility for the preservation  of law and order in the Province.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am not old enough to remember those days, but I do  remember how the peace and prosperity of the Province was shattered in the late  1960s, when those who hated the very existence of Northern Ireland within the  United Kingdom rose up in open rebellion. At that dangerous time, the  Government relied heavily on the B-Specials. But for the B-Specials, who knows  what might have happened? However, as we have seen too often in our Province,  the B-Specials were sacrificed to appease those who would never be satisfied  and would always demand more. I echo the words of the Prime Minister of  Northern Ireland in 1970. He said to members of the USC:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;You have done magnificently. Ulster owes you an  immense debt&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It was not long before those who replaced the USC, namely  the UDR and the RUC Reserve, became the targets of verbal and physical attacks  from republicans.<span class="SectionMarker"><em><span style="font-size:14.0pt; "> </span></em></span></p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">6.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I return my attention to the UDR, I speak from the heart  and from personal experience. It was my privilege to serve as a part-time  member of the Ulster Defence Regiment for 15 years. Some were not happy with  that. Republican terrorists tried to murder me in May 1981, but I survived,  and, with the grace of God, I am here today to see my children and my  grandchildren. The same cannot be said for hundreds of my UDR colleagues who  were sent to an early grave by the enemies of the Province and left behind  loved ones who will carry the burden of their loss to their own graves. The  memory of the gallantry of the members of the UDR and their successors in the  Royal Irish Regiment must never be forgotten.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I join my colleagues in urging the new Secretary of State  to ensure that the fortieth anniversary of the disbandment of the USC and the  creation of the UDR is marked in a way that brings honour to those two gallant  organisations. I support the motion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Moutray</strong>:  I count it as a privilege to take part in the debate and to acknowledge the sacrifice  that was made by members of the Ulster Special Constabulary and the UDR in the  many years that they defended this country from terrorists.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On 8 June 1920, IRA terrorists planned an attack in  Lisbellaw in County Fermanagh. The target was to be the courthouse in the  village, which, some time before, had been stripped of its Royal Irish  Constabulary complement. Information about the impending attack came into the  hands of the local population, and they took it upon themselves to defend the  village. The 50 or so IRA raiders were taken completely by surprise when the  bells of the parish church rang out as an alarm, and several were wounded in  the fighting that ensued.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As a direct result of that and other attacks, a new defence  force was formed later that year, known as the Ulster Special Constabulary. I  am very proud that my grandfather was one of those who was involved in the  defence of Lisbellaw on that night in June 1920. Subsequently, he and my late  father went on to join the B-Specials. That organisation was made up of men who  gave up their time, usually one evening a week, unpaid, to defend their country  from subversion and outside aggression. From the outset, the recruitment of  Roman Catholics was discouraged by the Roman Catholic Church, the Ancient Order  of Hibernians and Sinn F&eacute;in. Indeed, the IRA targeted for assassination Roman  Catholics who did join. There is nothing new there then.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Sir Arthur Hezlet wrote in his book, &lsquo;The &ldquo;B&rdquo; Specials: A  History of the Ulster Special Constabulary&rsquo;:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Special constables had an almost immediate effect,  and police reports from as early as December 1920 show a decrease in outrages&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The Irish historian Tim Pat Coogan stated in his  book, &lsquo;The IRA&rsquo;:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The B-Specials were the rock on which any mass  movement by the IRA in the North inevitably foundered.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That shows their effectiveness.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in and others tried at every turn to blacken the  image of the Ulster Special Constabulary. They sought to distort every incident  and to stir up hatred of the force, even from before it started to function.  However, to the law-abiding people of Northern Ireland, the B-Specials, like  the UDR, stood for law and order against rebellion and anarchy. Today, 40 years  after their standing down, we acknowledge their commitment, thank them for their  sacrifice and praise Almighty God for the men of the Ulster Special  Constabulary, who served gallantly in a time of need. I support the motion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kinahan</strong>:  I had not planned to speak in the debate. However, as I listened to it upstairs  and heard various comments from both sides of the House, I became quite  infuriated. This is a very noble motion, but all that it is doing is giving the  other side the chance to rip apart, blacken and damage the forces. I felt it  necessary to come down to the Chamber, because I have a problem with this noble  motion being used so that the two sides, which are now working together, can  attack each other. I find that very odd.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I agree with my colleague that those who served did so for  the whole community and they were not terrorists. There may well have been one  or two who let the side down, but certainly nothing like all those numbers who  are being blackened at the moment. This should be a chance to remember those  who served and to thank them for serving and for risking their lives,  especially those who paid the ultimate price of being maimed or killed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I served in west Belfast, and I saw myself as one who was  serving the whole community. However, I had an advantage. When I left, I went  back to my base in England and went on to other things, and I could put it  behind me. Those who served here could not do that. They were at risk every  second, minute and hour of their day. Last year, we saw something similar  happen to poor Constable Heffron. They were constantly at risk.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In my previous job, I once went to a house near Dungannon.  The person there had a photograph of himself in uniform displayed inside the  front door, and I asked him whether that was wise. He took me out into the car  park and pointed at 14 houses, and he said that one son or two sons from each  of those houses had been murdered. He carried on until he had been through all  the houses. Then he took me upstairs to his bedroom where, along the wall above  his bed, was a line of bullet holes. He was lucky; he heard them coming up the  stairs, and he rolled out.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is sad that we are here bickering about people who  should be treated as heroes. That is extremely wrong. They fought a fight, and,  yes, one or two individuals did things that were wrong and for which they  should be condemned, but that fight allowed us to have the politics that has  led us to peace today. We should be allowed to mark these occasions, and we  should ask the Secretary of State to mark them. It would be right for Members  not to rise when they are challenged by the other side. Let us remember the  individuals for all that they did.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. As I stand to speak, I am aware that  there are sensitivities in the Chamber and outside of it, and, inevitably, this  debate has reflected those sensitivities. Since we are coming to this debate  from differing sides and perspectives, it is also inevitable that there will be  no agreement on the motion. I sincerely hope that Members will agree on one  thing: it was as utterly wrong and reprehensible, not merely regrettable, that  members of the UDR or any of those regiments were murdered or maimed as it was  for any members of those regiments to have engaged in paramilitary collusion  and to have been involved in murdering or bombing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I engage in the debate, therefore, with some reluctance.  That said, I am not reluctant to oppose the motion. Mr Storey was here earlier,  and he talked about moving the North forward. It is somewhat disappointing, but  not surprising, that the Assembly is debating this motion at a time of utter  financial crisis across Europe and at a time when our Executive are attempting  to negotiate the extent of cuts to be imposed from Westminster and when public  meetings are being held in protest at the cuts that are being made to the  Health Service in our rural areas. I attended one of those meetings at the  weekend in Magherafelt in my constituency. Perhaps the only surprise is that  the party opposite neglected to mention Craig and the 1913 version of the  Ulster Volunteer Force in this historically inclined motion, as my colleague  Dolores Kelly pointed out.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Our society is divided by many things, not least by our  differing views of the past, as has been reflected here this evening. There is  no doubt that the proposers of the motion are sincere in their views, and we  have heard that heartfelt sincerity expressed here this evening. However, many  others, me included, do not hold the named organisations in quite the same  regard as they do, and we have also heard the reasons for that this evening.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Let us not forget that the Governments of the day removed  both organisations from the streets for very good reasons. That is why the SDLP  sought a cross-community vote on the motion. If we are to start making real  progress towards building a better future for all our people, one of the issues  that we must resolve is a reconciliation of our shared past. It is a failure of  the Assembly and the Executive that we have not even been able to attempt to  agree a way forward to deal with that past. The only attempt to do so, flawed  although it may have been, has been abandoned, and the new Government in  Westminster seem unwilling to make any alternative proposals.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We will not resolve our different views of the past in the  Chamber today, and, based on the motion, we will certainly not come anywhere  near doing so. In fact, the debate has probably exacerbated the situation  somewhat. Not for the first time, some Members may think that they can  reconcile views, but they are mistaken in that perception. Any attempt to  airbrush our shared history, as the motion does, is entirely counterproductive.  It is as counterproductive as some Members&rsquo; pretence that they were not there  at that time. Therefore, based on the perception of difference and on the  inability to arrive at agreement on what should be a shared history, I oppose  the motion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>: I  support the motion. It is a noble and honourable motion that respects those who  served the entire community without fear or favour in a noble and honourable  way. Their service required heroism and courage, and it required people putting  themselves at risk for others, as we have heard today, and to sacrifice their  tomorrow so that we could have our today. We wanted to see a stable Northern  Ireland within the United Kingdom, where the rule of law is practised and  upheld.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is no doubt that history will record the service of  the Ulster Special Constabulary and the Ulster Defence Regiment as being key  elements in the business of delivering a stable Northern Ireland within the  United Kingdom, where the rule of law is paramount. Those organisations were  forced to face the most violent and evil terrorism, and it ill behoves anyone  to point the finger at the Ulster Special Constabulary and the Ulster Defence  Regiment, when those who make the accusations ordered the murder of a single  mother of 10: a widow who was taken out, tortured and then murdered. It was  they who planted devices inside the corpses of those whom they murdered, in  contravention of every aspect of warfare and the Geneva conventions. That  terrorism was there to inspire fear, to remove Northern Ireland from the United  Kingdom and to remove Northern Ireland&rsquo;s democratic freedoms.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Thankfully, as has been rightfully pointed out, members of  the Ulster Special Constabulary and the Ulster Defence Regiment did not do what  they did for financial reward, or to have their names written in lights.  Soldiers and greenfinches in the UDR were prepared to give of themselves to  provide the stable Northern Ireland that we enjoy, and it is to them that we  owe a great debt of gratitude.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will conclude by saying that I am the proud grandson of a  grandfather whom I never knew, because he passed away long before I was born.  However, he served as a commandant for the Ulster Special Constabulary in  Tyrone. The service of such men and women cannot be airbrushed from history.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">This is a positive motion. I am fully committed to taking  Northern Ireland forward, but I must recognise the service of members of my  family. Brothers of mine such as Freddie Starrett and James Cummings were  prepared to sacrifice their tomorrow for my tomorrow, our tomorrow, this  House&rsquo;s tomorrow, and for democracy in Northern Ireland. We owe them greatly.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">6.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  I have listened with interest to what Members have said in the debate. I am  amazed at what some people can conjure up, some of the words that they can use  and some of the actions that they seem to justify. I listened to the Sinn  F&eacute;in/SDLP pan-nationalist front take a strident approach to the motion. On the  one hand, those Members tell us that they are sincere. Indeed, Mr McGlone said  that it was with reluctance that he took part in the debate. I look, however,  at the petition of concern and I see Mr McGlone&rsquo;s signature, proud and in bold  print. Mr McGlone had already taken part in the debate long before it reached  the Chamber. Therefore, I am not sure that his crocodile tears suit in this  instance.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Had the SDLP and Sinn F&eacute;in been sincere, would it not have  been much better for them to have shown some backbone and resolution by tabling  an amendment or a motion that they thought could secure support from right  around the House. That was not to be. Instead, they used the blunt instrument  of a petition of concern to jettison the motion that stands in my name and in  that of my colleague Mr Storey. The motion is a genuine attempt to recognise  the services of people who have gone before us.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although I should comment on much of what has been said in  the debate, to comment on everything would be nigh on impossible within 10  minutes. I will, however, digress from the speech that I had prepared to  comment on what Gerry Adams had to say. In his usual belligerent manner, Gerry  Adams stated that, in fact, the USC and the UDR were just forces of a unionist  Government. I know the howls of protest that come from that quarter when Gerry  Adams is reminded that the IRA was just the wing, the cutting edge, of Sinn  F&eacute;in. There are all sorts of protestations that, in fact, the two had nothing  to do with each other. It just so happens, by chance, that a number of those  who sit on the Benches opposite have records of which they should not be proud.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to put on record my profound respect for and  gratitude to the Ulster Special Constabulary and its successor, the UDR. I can  also stand here and say that I was a member of the Ulster Special Constabulary.  I have no apology to make for that, nor did I ever have intent or murder in my  heart when I went out on cold wintery nights. That was not in my make-up at  all.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">May 2010 marked a significant anniversary for the forces of  law and order in Northern Ireland. It was the fortieth anniversary of both the  disbandment of the Ulster Special Constabulary and the formation of the UDR. In  my book, both of those forces of the Crown stand tall and proud in the annals  of history in Northern Ireland. Some of us are not prepared to allow that  anniversary to pass by or their heroism or, indeed, their memory to be  airbrushed from those annals.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Ulster Special Constabulary was made up of ordinary men  and women who wanted to serve their country. Their role was vital in the protection  of people and property, in counter-insurgency, and in helping the noble RUC, as  it was then, to deal with terrorism. Those who stood against terrorists are to  be commended for their selflessness in the face of republican brutality. We owe  them a debt of gratitude.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The shameful treatment that those heroes and heroines  received from the Government in efforts to placate republicans is to be  deplored. They were stood down on the alter of political expediency. They were  vilified for their sterling work and painted as wrong-doers simply for  upholding law and order. It is remarkable that a force of such integrity should  be pushed to one side to facilitate militant republicanism, the real intent and  goal of which has been discovered and made manifest over the past 35 years.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">During the 40 years since the Ulster Special Constabulary  was disbanded in 1970, some 3,600 people lost their lives. That is a powerful  statement in itself. We are left to pick up the pieces and to wonder how many  lives might have been saved had a reckless Government not made those  treacherous and dreadful decisions. Similarly, many were cut down in their  efforts to maintain civil society or while protecting others. They paid the  supreme sacrifice for upholding law and order, but their memories live on  forever.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">After the USC was disbanded, the UDR was formed. I pay  tribute to that regiment of gallant men and women who, through the worst period  of our history, stood between sanity and insanity. Regrettably, many were  called to pay the supreme sacrifice, and graveyards across the Province pay  tribute to the real heroes. Visit practically any graveyard in any border town  in particular and one will see the poignant gravestones that tell us a very sad  story of how some of the finest of this country were taken out by ruthless  thugs.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Those individuals were not afforded high-scale pay or  anything like that; that was not why they found themselves in the forces; they  did not go in to earn lots of money. They enlisted with a sense of duty and  purpose to bring some sanity and to protect their homes and the homes of the  whole community &mdash; and I mean the whole community. I know that there are those  who are reluctant to accept that and those who have it in their minds that the  B-Specials were some sort of terror organisation because of the propaganda  machine that was in full flight at that time. Therefore, many of the facts have  got lost in the myths and hypocrisy that have been trotted out, particularly by  the republican movement.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The republican movement slaughtered the innocent and it  took mothers from their children and left orphans behind, and, yet, sadly, the  SDLP feels comfortable aligning itself with the petition of concern lodged  today. Would it not have been better for the SDLP to state its own position  clearly and to divorce itself completely from Sinn F&eacute;in, whose hands are  anything but clean? The SDLP has missed a trick. Its members should have been  man &mdash; or woman &mdash; enough to say to Sinn F&eacute;in that the SDLP is not prepared to  join with it because of its past and its support for an organisation that was  deemed the most ruthless in the western world. Today, however, the SDLP clasped  hands with that party to vote down a legitimate motion.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Storey warned us that he will not stand by and see the  memory of those two organisations being airbrushed from history, and he is to  be commended on that. John O&rsquo;Dowd deliberately painted a picture that bore  little resemblance to reality. Tom Elliott spoke as an experienced UDR soldier;  he testified first-hand that he had protected not only the Protestant community  but the Catholic community along a porous, difficult and dangerous border.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I commend Tom Buchanan, who made a superb speech today.  Allan Bresland stands today as a survivor who is to be commended for his courage  and determination. He does not come across as a bitter man; he comes across as  a caring man, because he recognises that, but for the grace of God, his life  would have been taken. Why? Simply because he was a serving UDR soldier.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I could comment on others who made useful contributions.  George Savage spoke eloquently of his admiration for the UDR and the USC, as  did George Robinson, Mr Bell and Mr Moutray. I thank all those who spoke in  defence of the motion, and I commend it to the House.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I remind Members that a valid petition of concern has been presented in  relation to the motion. Therefore, the vote will be taken as the first item of  business tomorrow morning.</p>
