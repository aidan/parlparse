    <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="1"></a>Ministerial Statement</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">EU Fisheries Council: December 2009</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I have received notice from the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development  that she wishes to make a statement on the outcome of the December Fisheries  Council meeting.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development (Ms Gildernew)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a  Cheann Comhairle. With your permission, Mr Speaker, I wish to make a statement  on the outcome of the autumn negotiations on various fisheries matters and, in  particular, the Fisheries Council meeting that was held in Brussels on 14 and 15 December, which  determined fishing opportunities for 2010.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On 16 November 2009, we had a useful debate in the Assembly  ahead of the November and December Fisheries Council meetings. When speaking to  the Fisheries Council motion, I alerted Members to the possible impacts of a  proposed technical conservation regulation to be agreed at the November  Fisheries Council meeting. It aimed to promote the conservation of fisheries  and resources by, among other things, laying down detailed requirements for  fishing gear and minimum landing sizes for fish.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The draft regulation included a requirement for a uniform  minimum landing size of 25 mm for nephrops throughout EU waters. At that time,  I explained to Members that there was no evidence to support increasing the  minimum landing size from 20 mm to 25 mm in the Irish Sea for conservation  reasons and that raising the minimum landing size for Irish   Sea nephrops would have a devastating effect on local industry,  both in the catching and processing sectors.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It became evident during the November Fisheries Council  meeting that many member states thought that the proposed regulation was  seriously flawed. Attempts by the Swedish presidency to broker a compromise saw  a new version emerge that made many changes that were designed to accommodate  those concerns. The changes included dropping the proposal for a uniform  minimum landing size for nephrops and a transition period of two years to adopt  technical changes to certain towed gears. Regrettably, the European Commission  felt that it could not support the presidency compromise. In those  circumstances, the draft regulation needed to have unanimous support from the  Fisheries Council to succeed. In the Fisheries Council plenary session, it  became clear that that would not be possible. As a consequence, the draft  regulation was withdrawn.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The fate of the technical conservation regulation is now in  the hands of the Spanish presidency, and, as yet, there is no firm timetable  for when a new regulation will be brought forward. The ratification of the  Lisbon Treaty means that this area of fisheries policy will be taken forward  under the process of co-decision, and the European Parliament will become an  equal partner in the making of fisheries legislation. Therefore, there will be  an opportunity for our MEPs to influence that policy and future fisheries  legislation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">During the December Council meeting, my priority was to  resist the proposed 30% cut in the nephrops total allowable catch (TAC) for  area 7. Prior to the Council meeting, considerable effort was expended by me  and my fellow Fisheries Ministers in Britain and the South of Ireland to  combat the arguments that the Commission used to justify that proposal. Our  efforts took the form of written submissions to and meetings with the  Commission to argue that the latest scientific evidence supported our view that  Irish Sea stocks were being fished  sustainably. The Assembly, other political representatives and the entire local  fishing industry fully supported me in the approach that I took and in my  lobbying of the Commissioner and his officials.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">During the meeting, the first compromise put forward by the  presidency was to reduce the proposed cut to 20%. I argued that that was not  justified, and I told the Commission of the serious consequences that would  have for our local fishing industry. After lengthy negotiations, the Commission  reduced the cut to 9%, but despite further strong representations no further  movement was possible.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I assure Members that the ministerial team in Brussels fought right to  the end to secure a better deal, and, at the final plenary session, the  Commission was again pressed for further movement on nephrops in area 7, but it  would not be moved. A number of further minor concessions on other issues  ensured that there was sufficient support for the TAC and quota package from  other member states to push the proposal through.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I stated following the Council meeting, I was extremely  disappointed with the outcome on nephrops, and I find the annual round of  haggling over fish quotas completely unsatisfactory. I am convinced that we must  move to a different system that gives local fisheries managers and the industry  a greater say in the fishing and conservation of the fish stocks off our coast.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The stocks of nephrops are stable, and the science supports  that view. The only thing that has changed over the past year is the view of  ICES that a different harvest ratio should be used, which in turn led the  Commission to conclude that a lower TAC is needed. However, ICES also  acknowledged that further scientific work is necessary to justify the basis for  the harvest ratio used.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The best way forward would be to put in place a long-term  fisheries management plan, and I want that to be developed as a priority during  2010. The Department and our colleagues in the South of Ireland must take the  initiative. In so doing, we must carry out the further work that is required to  establish a harvest ratio that represents an appropriate level of fishing and  one that is consistent with a management objective of maximising the  sustainable yield of nephrops. We must also consider whether the interests of  the local fleet would be better served by the nephrops quota being set on an  individual stock basis &mdash; such as the Irish Sea &mdash; rather than the present method,  which sets a quota for the whole of area 7 and includes other stocks in  addition to those in the Irish Sea.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">During the negotiations, I also pressed for an increase in  the Irish Sea herring quota, and we again  provided strong scientific evidence to support our case. However, the  Commission was unsympathetic, and the final package did not provide any  increase. The Department has, however, developed a draft management plan for Irish Sea herring that will be submitted to the  Commission. I hope that the plan can be refined and adopted as the basis of  determining future fishing opportunities for that stock.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On other Irish Sea stocks, there was an expected 25% cut in  the cod TAC in line with the cod recovery plan, no change for haddock and a 14%  increase for Irish Sea plaice, which  demonstrates that this stock maintains a healthy condition. Both sole and  whiting stocks remained depleted, and each experienced a cut of 25%, but those  stocks are of little importance to the local fleet, and the quotas remain above  recorded landings.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The cod recovery plan also triggered a 25% reduction in  fishing effort, which is measured in kilowatt days, and, although we were able  to manage that cut last year, the situation is now becoming extremely tight. My  Department has already had a meeting with the industry on developing effort  allocations, and the challenge that we face collectively is to devise an  approach that provides an equitable means of distributing days at sea across  the fleet. That will ensure that vessels are able to fish the quotas available  to them, whether in the Irish Sea, the North Sea or west of Scotland  waters.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We will, of course, use all the flexibility that is  available in the cod recovery plan to buy back effort in return for  conservation measures that reduce cod mortality. As part of that, I am pleased  to inform Members that my Department has made &pound;350,000 available from the  European Fisheries Fund to enable the fleet to modify its nets, to improve  selectivity and reduce discards of juvenile fish. Both our producer  organisations are involved in the co-ordination and delivery of that  initiative. We have agreed to establish a joint official and industry group,  which will meet regularly to manage the effort control arrangement during the  coming year.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In my discussions with Tony Killeen TD during the Council  meeting, I pressed him on the importance of getting a quick resolution on the  issue of post-Council swaps on cod. The Southern authorities will discuss that  matter with their industry soon. We also agreed to co-operate with the banking  of some of the South&rsquo;s unfished nephrops quota for 2009. Under the rules,  member states can bank 10% of the quota from one year to another. The South has  more than 10% left. We have agreed that some of the excess will be transferred  to the North now and that that will be shared between us next year. The amount  in question will depend on the headroom that we have within the 10% ceiling.  That will be resolved during coming weeks.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I appreciate the opportunity to bring Members up to date on  the outcome of the autumn fisheries negotiations as far as they affect our  fleet. I am grateful to my colleagues Huw Irranca-Davies from DEFRA, Richard  Lochhead from Scotland,  and Tony Killeen from the South for their strong support for the nephrops case.  I am also grateful for the support given by the Committee for Agriculture and  Rural Development, Members of the House and local MEPs. I regret that the  circumstances did not allow me to bring a more positive report to the Assembly.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy  Chairperson of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development (Mr Elliott)</strong>:  I apologise on behalf of the Chairperson of the Committee for Agriculture and  Rural Development, who could not make it to the Chamber in time for the debate.  I beg the House&rsquo;s indulgence to allow me to put before it some brief comments  on the outcome of the December Fisheries Council&rsquo;s decision. The Minister&rsquo;s  statement is bleak news indeed for our embattled fishing industry. No matter  how anybody tries to disguise that, it cannot be dressed up as good news just  because the reduction is less than that which was proposed originally.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In 2010, management of the prawn quota will be problematic.  The bigger issue will be the management of days at sea. Behind the devastating  prawn quota headline, the promised cut of 25% in the number of days at sea that  will become effective from 1 February 2010 will bite into the fleet and will,  undoubtedly, mean that long-established traditional family businesses face the  prospect of financial ruin. People who are involved in processing the catch  will be made redundant; and we will have the possible break-up and dispersal of  the proud communities that have been traditionally supported by the industry,  because it is no longer sustainable or viable for them to remain. Those are the  hard economic facts of the situation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At that Council meeting, the Spanish faced a proposal to  cut one of their most important quotas &mdash; hake &mdash; by 10%. The result was to find  an increase of 7%. At the same meeting, the French faced a proposal to cut one  of their most important quotas &mdash; Celtic   Sea cod &mdash; by 25%. The  result was the maintenance of the status quo. Indeed, for Scotland, the Council agreed to a rollover of  the quota for the North Sea prawn industry, which affects part of Scotland&rsquo;s most  valuable fleet, as well as a 10% increase in the megrim quota and a rollover in  the monkfish quota, which are two of the highest-value species. Furthermore,  flexibility in the monkfish quota will allow west coast fishermen to catch an  additional 460 tons.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When the Scottish, Spanish and French were able to secure  such remarkable results, where did Northern Ireland go wrong with the  prawn quota? How can one UK region &mdash; Scotland &mdash; secure such a positive outcome  while another &mdash; Northern Ireland &mdash; which is represented by the same people,  face such devastation? Will the Minister confirm that that is another example  of her allowing the industry to be done over by the European Union?</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">10.45 am</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: Although I welcome the question, I do  not believe for a minute that I dressed that up as good news. In opening and  closing my statement, I said that I was disappointed with the outcome and that  I had hoped for a better result for the industry. Notwithstanding that, we  argued strongly and were able to bring the reduction down from over 30%.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member makes the point that the Spanish and French got  everything that they wanted, but that is not the case. He is not comparing like  with like. The Spanish and French achieved some wins for some stocks, but they  were disappointed in other areas. Although the Spanish made a great deal about  arrangements for mackerel, they did not get everything that they wanted on  other stocks. As I have said in the House before, this was a negotiation, and  the nature of negotiations is that one does not always get what one wants.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The final case for nephrops was pushed as hard as possible  &mdash; right into the final plenary session. No one in the Commission or in the  presidency is in any doubt about the importance of the fishing industry, not  only for our economy but from a cultural and societal point of view, and I have  made that clear throughout my time as Minister. The Commission was heavily  influenced by the ICES advice on harvest ratios. Members should not forget that  it initially suggested cuts of 30%.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The poor state of the stock on the Porcupine Bank was also  a factor, and that made some cut almost inevitable. However, we went in  fighting very hard. Although we did not accept going into the negotiations on  the Porcupine Bank stocks, we went in fighting for a rollover to continue to  work right up to the end. In the circumstances, we achieved the best result  that we could on nephrops.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The 25% cut in fishing effort is a direct consequence of  the cod recovery plan, the introduction of which I opposed strenuously. We have  been able to ensure that the fleet had sufficient days to catch the available  quota in the interim. My officials have already begun discussions with the  industry on how best to calculate and manage fishing effort this year, and a  joint industry/official group has been set up to do that. We are exploring how  to improve the case to exempt certain vessels and the scope to adopt measures  to reduce cod mortality, which would allow extra days to be made available.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr W Clarke</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for her statement  and for her efforts. I also thank her officials, advisers, the Agriculture and  Rural Development Committee and MEPs. I am sounding a bit like Barry McGuigan.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  At least he used to win.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr W Clarke</strong>:  I think that he was knocked out in the end.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I agree with the Minister: haggling over quotas at the  mouth of Christmas is not helpful to our fishing industry or anyone&rsquo;s fishing  industry. Local fisheries have to be managed by local managers, and I look  forward to that being done in the future.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">With regard to the Spanish and the French &mdash; I am sorry, a  Cheann Comhairle, for stepping outside the remit slightly &mdash; they are sovereign  states. If Tom Elliott wants to come in a united front on an all-Ireland basis,  we would have greater bargaining power.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister be considering the case for  decommissioning?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: I welcome the question. I noted Mr  Kennedy&rsquo;s point. Barry McGuigan did not win all the time, and, if Mr Kennedy  wants to step outside, I will show him how well I can box.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I am not normally subject to such kind offers.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: We had a very robust negotiation. When  sitting opposite the Commission and looking into the white of their eyes, I saw  that they were in no doubt about the importance that I placed on the industry.  I made the point that in November the Assembly was united on the debate about  what we needed for the industry, and that was a strong message to take. However,  it would be strengthened by Mr Clarke&rsquo;s suggestion.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Decommissioning is a subject that generates strong debate.  It is an attractive proposition for those wishing to leave the industry, and it  helps to reduce overcapacity within certain segments of the fleet. On the other  hand, the needs of processors and the support sectors must also be considered.  Decommissioning results in reduced availability of local raw material and  impacts on the sustainability of the support services network that is required  to keep our fleet operational. We have commissioned an update of the fleet  futures model, and we will use a methodology that links together the total  allowable catch, fishing effort, costs, fish prices and the acceptable normal  average profit for each vessel in different sectors of the fleet under several  scenarios.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That report is being finalised, and the Fisheries Forum  will consider it at its next three meetings, which are scheduled for the coming  months. The Fisheries Forum will then make recommendations to me. Whatever those  recommendations may be, a robust, sector-wide business case will be required to  justify the investment of public money under such a scheme. I look forward to  receiving the forum&rsquo;s recommendations in order that progress can be made in  that critical area.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for her  statement. She said that a long-term fisheries management plan is a necessity.  How does the Minister rate the initiative? Is it just another piece of window  dressing? How much priority has her Department given to that initiative, and  how quickly will we see the management plan take effect on an all-island basis?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I also welcome what she said about how the technical conservation  regulation will now be taken forward. I am glad to see that her party now sees  merit in the outcome of the Lisbon Treaty. Ba mhaith liom a fh&aacute;il amach an Gaeilge  n&oacute; Ulster Scots a bh&iacute; ann sin.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: I do not know whether the Member was  listening: I did not give any support to the Lisbon Treaty. I did say that, now  that the treaty has been ratified, the making of fisheries legislation will  require a co-decision of the European Parliament and the European Commission.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member asked about the management plan. As I said, I do  not believe that the current arrangements are acceptable. It is not only an  unsatisfactory way for me to do business as Minister of Agriculture and Rural  Development, it is not a good way for businesses, fishermen and processors who  are planning their year&rsquo;s work to do business. It is very difficult to have a  long-term vision for one&rsquo;s business &mdash; to look three, five or 10 years down the  line &mdash; when one does not know what is coming. A working group has therefore  been set up to consider the management plan. We need to find an alternative,  because the current method is not a satisfactory way in which to do business  and is not a good way in which to ensure my ultimate objective of ensuring our  local fishing industry&rsquo;s sustainability and profitability.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her statement to the Assembly, and I congratulate her  and her colleagues on the effort that they made to secure better facilities for  our fishing industry. At least we had a local voice present. I remember that,  not so long ago, we were represented by a cross-channel Minister who did not  even turn up to Fisheries Council meetings. Members will also remember that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister stated:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;the technical conservation regulation is now in the  hands of the Spanish presidency &hellip; Therefore, there will be an opportunity for  our MEPs to influence that policy and future fisheries legislation.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I advise the Member to come to his question.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  Will the Minister inform the House whether our MEPs are working, have been  working and will continue to work jointly, with combined voice and effort, on  behalf of the Northern Ireland fishing fleet so that that voice will be heard?  Can the Minister exert any influence to ensure that that happens?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: I thank the Member for his question. I  know, Cheann Comhairle, that you were hurrying him along, but I was quite  enjoying his contribution. The serious point is that the MEPs now have more of  a role to play on the issue. I have had some useful meetings with the MEPs  jointly. They have a good working relationship with the Department, and arrangements  are in place whereby, when necessary, briefings are given and meetings arranged  throughout the year. To have the three MEPs make joint representations to the  Commission would certainly help to bolster our case, and I look forward to  their doing that throughout the coming year.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  It is important that we thank the Minister for the efforts that she made in Brussels and the amount  of energy that she expended, with the support of our MEPs. What frustrates me &mdash;  Mr Elliott made this point earlier &mdash; is that, despite the energetic efforts  that were made at December&rsquo;s Fisheries Council meeting, we did not get all that  far ahead. The Minister said that the proposed cut in the nephrops total  allowable catch of 20% was reduced to 9%, so progress was certainly made, but  there is frustration that &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member must come to his question.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  Last Saturday, I met some fishermen in Portavogie, among whom there is much  dismay and concern. Scotland  has already paid out three rafts of EFF money, and I understand that we have  not paid out any. When will the money be paid out so that some finance can be  paid directly to the fishing industry at Portavogie, Ardglass and Kilkeel?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister provide some idea on the issue of leasing  and swapping? In Portavogie last Saturday, concern was expressed that no leases  or swaps would be available, so confirmation is needed on that. Mr Speaker, I  appreciate the fact that you have been lenient and gracious. Spain, France,  Germany  and other countries seem to have done not too badly out of that. What can we do  that those countries have already done?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Paragraph 14 of the Minister&rsquo;s statement &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Bring your questions to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I am definitely coming to the end now. I am sorry; I could be here for 20  minutes, but I know that you would not let me.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister referred to a joint official and industry  group. Will the Minister indicate who will be on that joint group, and will it  involve all the local industry? If the fishing industry is to survive, that  group must be up and running. I thank the Speaker for his patience.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: I thank the Member for his comprehensive  questions; I will try to cover as many of his points as I can. I do not have  the details of the group&rsquo;s membership with me, but, obviously, it will involve  producers&rsquo; organisations and processors because they are an important part of  the industry.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">EFF money is now coming on-stream, which will mean some  &euro;36&middot;2 million of further public investment in the fishing industry over the  next five years. There has been a delay in getting EFF payments started in the  North as a result of having to complete measure-level business cases on our  proposals for investment. However, four key measures are now open, and I hope  that two further measures will open early in 2010, with axis 1 coming on  culmination of the work of the Fisheries Forum.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">To date, we have received 28 applications seeking  approximately &pound;3&middot;5 million of EFF grants, and those applications are being  evaluated. Two selection panels were convened before Christmas to consider the applications  that have been received to date. I am pleased to say that initial interest has  been brisk, and my officials are in the process of making a letter of offer to  12 successful projects, which represents an investment of &pound;1&middot;1 million.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to ensure that we use the resources at our disposal  wisely to allow the industry to be more profitable and more sustainable and to  be capable of making a strong contribution to the economies of the coastal  communities in which it is based. At a time when there is significant pressure  on resources, EFF funds are best used to deal with the longer-term issues that  are facing the sector rather than for short-term financial assistance.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Swaps were carried out with the Southern industry towards  the second half of 2009, and I hope that something can be done earlier this  year. I will not make any promises now, but we have had discussions with the  Southern Minister and the Southern industry. I am hopeful that something can be  achieved on swaps.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Doherty</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for her  statement, and I thank her and her officials for their efforts in the  negotiations. How will the results of the negotiations in 2009 help us to  prepare for the negotiations that will undoubtedly happen in 2010? Will the  Minister elaborate on the potential for that, to which paragraph 15 refers?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle.  As I said in my statement, the key issue in determining the nephrops total  allowable catch is the setting-up of an appropriate harvest ratio. That is  where differences of scientific opinion emerged during the year. My officials  in AFBI are already working on how best to ensure that an appropriate harvest  ratio is developed and accepted by ICES. I have also asked my officials to work  with the industry and scientists in drawing up long-term management plans for  the main fisheries on which the industry depends.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">11.00 am</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Again I pay tribute to the AFBI scientists for their  efforts on a collaborative project with the Marine Institute in Galway, because we rushed that work through in order to  have a sound scientific basis for our negotiations. The Commission accepted  that evidence in part, because it reduced the cut to 9%, but we are already  working on ways to improve that figure for next year.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As my statement outlined, member states can bank 10% of  their quotas. Therefore, if we have unused quota this year, we could bank the  extra percentage to fish it next year in the hope that circumstances will be  better. We fish our quota, and we have no room for manoeuvre. However, the  South has excess quota, and if we work with the Southern authorities, we can  ensure that some of that 10% will be made available to our fleet, thereby  reducing the 9% cut to, perhaps, 7% or 6% in real terms. From that point of  view, we worked well with the South. We are very grateful to the Southern  authorities, and we want to expand on that work to ensure that we maximise the  opportunities available to our County Down fishing fleet.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I am relieved that my contribution is not time-limited today, because I wish to  make a brief statement. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span> I thank the  Minister for her statement and congratulate her on going with the sovereign  state and working as part of a British ministerial team.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to make two points. First, although the Minister was  disappointed with the outcome for prawn fishing, will she assure the House that  she will start the process early to try to get a better deal next year and that  she will fight robustly to get a better deal for our fishermen across Northern  Ireland, particularly as fishing, as she will know, is of huge interest in my  constituency?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, how does the Minister hope to change the system,  and what support does she have for moving away from the &ldquo;round of haggling&rdquo;, as  she described it, of the December Fisheries Council? How does she hope to move  to a newer system of managing fishing, and what support does she have for that  from other Administrations in the UK  and in wider Europe?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: I thank the Member for his question. We  want to put a great deal of effort into the management plans this year. If we  can devise a management plan that the EU Commission will accept, there will be  less need for haggling in December every year, and we can have more stability,  which the industry would welcome.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Obviously, we do not leave our efforts on fisheries until  December: work is ongoing throughout the year. A new Commissioner for Maritime  Affairs and Fisheries will be taking up her post, and I look forward to meeting  her as soon as possible to put again our points, to illustrate the size of our  fishing industry and its significance, and to demonstrate that we pose no  threat to the conservation of stocks in European waters. We want to fish in a  way that is sustainable and will protect stock but that will contribute to the  conservation of our fishing villages. To that end, I hope that the new  commissioner will visit at some stage, and I will impress on her the need to do  so.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">This work has been ongoing throughout my tenure as Minister  of Agriculture and Rural Development, and it will continue. We have held  meetings throughout the year to warm up the Commission to the need to minimise our  cuts or to maximise our increases. As I said, we argued for an increase in our  herring quota. We were unable to get that, although we had a good scientific  basis for it. We want to continue to do that work. We achieved an increase in  the haddock quota two years ago, and the rollover that there has been with that  since then has been very useful. Although nephrops are our most important stock  by far, other stocks contribute to the sustainability of our fishing fleet, and  we want to maximise our opportunities right across the board.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burns</strong>: I  thank the Minister for her statement. As a Member of the Committee for  Agriculture and Rural Development, I have heard regular presentations from  fishermen. The fishing industry always seems to be on the brink of financial  ruin.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Those continual cuts make it more difficult for the fishing  fleet to survive. Although we did well to get a 9% reduction this year, if that  is followed by a 9% reduction in 2010 and another in 2011, when will the  fishing fleet become unviable? What efforts will the Minister make to ensure  that the fishing fleet survives?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: A 9% cut next year is inconceivable at  this stage, but the Commission could suggest a 30%, 40% or 50% cut. We do not  know what next year will bring. However, we will continue to make our case. I  heard the same statements from producer organisations and from fishermen and  processors in County   Down. We made the point  to the Commission that we are fast moving towards that line in the sand when  the industry will be no longer viable or the infrastructure will not be there  to support it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have made that case very strongly and will continue to  press it. We will also continue to hope to have the support of the Committee  for Agriculture and Rural Development in helping us to make that case. A  unified voice from this House does resonate in Europe,  and the more that we can prove that we are working together and are on the same  page on this issue, the more helpful that will be. We will make every effort to  minimise the cuts by trying to achieve a rollover next year. We will also be  working with the industry to decide on our list, our top priorities, and what  we will be robustly fighting for in December 2010.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  The mind boggles at the creativity of the Benches opposite when they tried to  put nationalities on prawns and fish. I could not believe that, when we all  know that red, white and blue tastes an awful lot better than green, white and  gold in any species.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister knows that the negotiations are an annual  event. What did she learn from the negotiations that will help to formulate the  arguments next time around? What new and innovative assistance can her  Department offer to the prawn industry in Portavogie?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: Obviously, I do not work on behalf of  just Portavogie; Kilkeel and Ardglass are also fishing ports. This has been my  third year at the Fisheries Council, and we have deployed every tool at our  disposal to try to ensure the sustainability of our fishing fleet.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The two things that are important this year are the  management plan, which we can work on with the industry to put to the  Commission, and the scientific evidence, so that we can ensure that the  International Council for the Exploration of the Sea does not have a different  opinion on harvest ratios. My officials worked very hard throughout last year  in the lead up to the negotiations. That work has already started this year: we  do not wait. As soon as one set of negotiations is over, we are looking to the  next. Those are the key pieces of work that will best help us to minimise the  cuts.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is a very strong environmental lobby in Europe. We have seen robust red lines drawn around cod  stocks. From a conservation point of view, stocks in European waters are not as  sound as those in other parts of the globe. There is strong support in Europe to ensure the sustainability of those stocks, so  we have to find a compromise. Therefore, we will work with officials, the  industry and scientists to try to ensure that 2010 has an outcome about which  we can all be pleased.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P J Bradley</strong>:  Each year after the December talks, we seem to get a report on how well the  other member states have done. We always seem to be bringing up the rear with  little or no results. Nevertheless, I thank the Minister for her statement. I  know that those talks are difficult.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The question being asked in the harbours and processing  factories is why Northern    Ireland has fared so badly, particularly in  recent years. I suggest that it is because all year round the negotiators, Sinn  F&eacute;in and the DUP in particular, are so anti-Europe that they have no chance  over there. If one goes and tells Santa Claus that one does not believe in him,  one cannot expect presents from him.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>A Member</strong>:  Did he come to you, P J?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P J Bradley</strong>:  He came to me twice.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Where was I? I got distracted there. Back in October when  there was talk about 30%, I warned the House that that was only a negotiating  figure. It was never going to be 30%. The processors were concerned that if the  figure exceeded 5%, they would be in deep trouble. Has the Minister visited the  processors since the December talks, and what assessment has she made as to how  the 9% cut will affect them?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: The 9% cut will affect everybody, and I do  not for one minute accept Mr Bradley&rsquo;s now-legendary negativity in his  allegation that we fared badly and have done so in recent years. Nobody in the  Commission &mdash; neither the commissioners nor their officials &mdash; would deny that we  have put a huge effort into building relations with Europe to ensure that we  get a better deal, not just for our fishermen but for our farmers. The Member&rsquo;s  points are petty politicking in the run-up to an election, and they are  starting to be a bit tiresome.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I assure the Member that, like Barry McElduff, I have been  snowed in since I returned from the December talks. We have a lot of work to  do, but hightailing it to visit a processor at Christmastime would only have  been paying lip service. I will continue to work with the processing and  catching sectors, and I am sure that Mr Bradley will continue to be his  negative self.</p>
    <p class="H5StageHeading"><a name="2"></a>Draft Expenditure Plans for 2010-11</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I have received notice from the Minister of Finance and Personnel that he  wishes to make a statement on the draft expenditure plans for 2010-11.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel (Mr S Wilson)</strong>: Mr Speaker, with your permission, I  wish to make a statement regarding the Executive&rsquo;s proposals in respect of the  review of the 2010-11 spending plans for Northern Ireland Departments, which is  being published today for consultation with the Assembly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In light of the changes in the economic situation and the  emerging position for 2010-11, I initiated this review in the summer of 2009,  with the aim of ensuring that public finances remain on a secure basis as we  move into the next financial year. Work on the review has progressed over  recent months, and it examined the best way forward through a series of  discussions at the Executive. I also held separate bilateral meetings with each  of my ministerial colleagues. That has culminated in the proposals that I set  out today, which were agreed by the Executive when they last met on 17 December  2009.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, before I explain the Executive&rsquo;s proposals, I will  set out the public expenditure context. In January 2008, the Executive and the  Assembly approved the spending plans for Northern Ireland Departments for the  three years from 2008-09 through to 2010-11. That included record levels of  investment in our public services and, in particular, investment in capital  projects such as roads, schools, hospitals and housing. In addition, following  the significant increase under direct rule Ministers, the level of domestic  regional rates was frozen in cash terms over three years, with non-domestic rates  restricted to the projected level of inflation at that time. That Budget  outcome reflected the importance of developing our economy as the top priority  in the Executive&rsquo;s Programme for Government in order to take full advantage of  the boost to local business from the transition to a more peaceful society.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, since the three-year spending plans were agreed,  there have been a number of changes in economic conditions, with first the rise  in energy costs and then the economic recession having a serious impact on the  local economy, particularly in terms of unemployment. Although there is  increasing evidence of recovery, the legacy of damage to UK public  finances will have implications for the Executive for many years to come.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the short term, there has already been an impact in  respect of the shortfall in capital receipts that had formed a significant part  of the available funding for the capital investment programme. At the same  time, the Executive have taken a proactive approach in responding to the  economic downturn, including the acceleration of capital investment and the  deferral of domestic water charges. In my Department, the decision to freeze  non-domestic rates in cash rather than real terms for 2009-10, and the  introduction of a small business rates relief scheme, will also provide  significant support to local businesses.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">11.15 am</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I now turn to the public expenditure position for 2010-11.  All those measures have implications for the funding that is available to the  Executive. Although it has been possible to address many of those pressures as  part of the in-year monitoring process, I decided last summer that the scale of  the issues for 2010-11 was simply too large and that pro-active action was  required at an early stage.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A large number of issues are involved, including the  implications of decisions that were taken at a national level and previous  commitments that the Executive made, and they are set out in detail in the  consultation document. However, I wish to touch on the most significant issues,  which are the costs of further deferral of water and sewerage charges for  domestic customers, the need to reduce the level of overcommitment and, of  course, the costs of the Civil Service equal pay claim.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will begin with water charges. One of the Executive&rsquo;s first  decisions was to reverse the plans of direct rule Ministers to introduce  domestic water charges in full from April 2007. In November 2008, that was  extended to the current financial year, following the agreement secured with  the Treasury that the significant amount of non-cash costs involved would not  fall to the Executive for 2008-09 and 2009-2010.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Following the previous deferrals, domestic charges will  also not be introduced in 2010-11. That will provide an additional saving of  approximately &pound;400 next year for the average household that uses those public  services, when compared with the situation under direct rule. Although changes  in budgeting treatment mean that the cost to the Executive of that measure is  less than it could have been, there remains a significant pressure of &pound;120  million for current expenditure and &pound;93 million for capital investment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although the Executive were able to cover the cost of  deferring water charges in 2009-2010 as a result of the June monitoring round,  the experience of 2008-09 and this year to date is that it is becoming  increasingly difficult to source sufficient resources to address emerging  pressures while, at the same time, reducing the level of overcommitment to a  prudent level.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As part of the original 2007 Budget process, the planned  level of overcommitment had already been reduced to &pound;60 million for 2010-11,  compared with &pound;100 million in 2008-09. However, the further decline in the  level of reduced requirements that Departments declared in the first half of  2009-2010, as set out in my December monitoring statement yesterday, means that  there is a need to go further. In response, the Executive have proposed that  the starting level of current expenditure overcommitment should be reduced to  zero next year, which will provide much greater scope to address emerging  pressures.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, although the main focus of the review has been  on the pressures faced in 2010-11, it is important that we begin to prepare for  the future, when resources are expected to be even more constrained. It is for  that reason that the Executive have proposed that &pound;26 million be allocated to  an invest to save fund, which will provide additional support to Departments  for the upfront costs that are often required in order to make savings.  Proposals for invest to save projects have been commissioned from Departments,  and I will provide the Assembly with further details on specific allocations as  part of the finalisation of those draft plans.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The easy option would have been to do nothing on the issue,  which would have reduced the level of intervention required at this time.  However, that short-sighted approach would have shifted the burden to the  2010-11 financial year, during which the Executive would have struggled to  address emerging pressures.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The third significant pressure facing the Executive next  year is the one-off cost of the Civil Service equal pay claim. Although the  overall cost of just over &pound;160 million will be offset by the support that my  predecessor secured from the Prime Minister in 2008, it will still involve the  ongoing costs of additional reinvestment and reform initiative (RRI) borrowing.  That means that there remains an unfunded pressure of up to around &pound;65 million  for 2010-11, depending on the timing of the payments.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Overall, my assessment is that the Executive face spending  pressures next year of &pound;217&middot;1 million in current spending and &pound;149&middot;9 million in  capital investment. Including the &pound;26 million set aside for the invest to save  fund, those figures are equivalent to 2&middot;6% of planned current expenditure for  2010-11 and 10&middot;2% of capital investment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In response to the emerging financial position, the  Executive have considered a range of alternatives. However, the only realistic  option that would generate the level of funding that is required would be to  make adjustments to the existing spending plans of Departments. Although it was  recognised that all Departments could go further in improving efficiency, the  Executive agreed that some Departments would be in a better position than  others to release additional resources next year and that, therefore, a targeted  approach should be adopted, rather than a simple pro rata cut.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, the Executive were critically aware of the  need to protect priority front line services where possible, with, for example,  the lowest percentage level of savings being proposed for the Department of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety. Unfortunately, the overall level of  savings required meant that it was simply not possible to exempt an entire  Department from the process. However, I expect my ministerial colleagues to  seek to reduce the costs of bureaucracy in the first instance.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Inevitably, there will be calls for the savings required of  one Department or another to be reduced because of the impact that they will  have on public services. That is always the case. However, the reality is that  reducing the amount required of one Department increases the burden on others.  As I have said to the Assembly on more than one occasion, I am more than happy  to give a lesson on the concept that is the basis of all economics &mdash; opportunity  cost &mdash; so that we understand that there is no point in demanding more money for  something if we are not prepared to say where that money will come from.  Therefore, although I and my Executive colleagues welcome any proposals from  fellow Members in response to the draft plans that are being published today,  those proposals must include details of where additional savings could be made  and of where they should be lower. Addressing both sides of the equation is  essential if alternative proposals are to be considered credible. The Executive  will also continue to examine areas in which savings could be made on a  cross-departmental basis to minimise the impact on public services.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There will be a more general concern that the overall level  of public spending is lower than that which was originally set out in January  2008. However, it is important to note that most of the savings that are  required will be recycled back into Departments. In addition, although reducing  the level of overcommitment requires &pound;60 million in additional savings now,  that in turn means that there will be much greater scope to address pressures  as part of the 2010-11 in-year monitoring process. The issue is partly one of  timing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Overall, the consultation document shows that the total level  of spending by Northern Ireland Departments would only change marginally under  the Executive&rsquo;s proposals when compared with the original plans. There will be  a reduction of 0&middot;1% in current expenditure to &pound;9 billion, and the capital  investment plans will decrease by 1% to &pound;1&middot;4 billion. That is less than the  rates of end-year underspend that have been experienced in recent years and  highlights that the objective of the review was to reprioritise the funding  available to the Executive in light of changing circumstances, local needs and  priorities.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">One area that was considered as part of the review, but  where the Executive have decided that action should be taken as part of the  2010-11 in-year monitoring process, was the anticipated shortfall in  departmental capital receipts. Although the economic recession has had a  wide-ranging impact on Northern    Ireland, the main consequence for public  finances has been that the planned level of departmental capital receipts has  not been achieved in full. In 2010-11, the main shortfall will be the &pound;200  million that was planned from the sale of the Crossnacreevy site. There will be  further amounts from house and land sales as well as planned disposals by other  Departments. However, there is expected to be a similar amount of funding  available to the Executive from slippage in two major capital investment  projects, which will allow the Executive to provide support to the Department  affected, provided that all available actions are also taken by those  Departments to address the funding deficit internally.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, although there are signs of recovery in the  property market, the position remains volatile. In that context, it would have  been inappropriate to address the pressures at this time, because market  conditions may be significantly different in six months, and Departments should  be provided with the opportunity to address the shortfalls internally in  advance of calling on the Executive for assistance.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will now outline the next steps in the process. It is  essential that the proposals set out today are subject to robust scrutiny and  challenge in the Assembly over the coming weeks. The document that I have  published today sets out details of the public context for 2010-11 and the  Executive&rsquo;s proposed response. In addition, I have asked my Executive  colleagues to publish details of the implications for their individual  Departments on their departmental websites. That is to include details of how  the additional savings are to be made, as well as the improvements in public services  that will still be delivered next year.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I expect that all Committees will wish to review the  position for their respective Departments, particularly on how the savings are  to be achieved. The Committee for Finance and Personnel will have a key role in  that by co-ordinating the views of Committees as well as considering the  overall strategic approach to the exercise.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is unfortunate that more time was not available to the  Assembly as part of the consultation process. However, I hope that Members recognise  that the complex and difficult issues involved required careful consideration by  the Executive in the development of the daft, sorry the draft, proposals that  are before the House today. That was a Freudian slip. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span> I am sure that when we get to the consultation stage, we will have some  response on that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, it is essential that the revised departmental  budgets are confirmed before the start of the new financial year. It would have  been even better if the review had already been completed, as I had originally  planned. Therefore, I have asked that the Committee for Finance and Personnel  publishes its response to the Executive&rsquo;s draft proposals by the end of  February in order to provide the Executive with sufficient time to consider the  views of the Assembly in coming to an agreed final set of spending plans for  2010-11 by the middle of March.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, the downturn and instability in both the  property and financial markets over the past two years has had a significant  impact on the global economy.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">11.30 am</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although we all want a swift recovery, there will be  repercussions for many years to come, particularly for public finances. The  most optimistic scenario for the next spending review is an unprecedented  real-terms freeze in current spending and a reduction in capital funding,  coupled with increases in taxation as the Government seek to reduce the level  of borrowing. Therefore, the proposals that I have published today represent an  early indication that even more difficult decisions must be taken in the years  ahead.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In particular, the review highlighted the clear trade-off  between the continued deferral of water charges and the amount of funding that  is available for public services. However, given the circumstances that I faced,  I am confident that the proposals represent the best way forward for the next  financial year. The proposals recognise the constraints on the Executive and  seek to restore public finances to a more sustainable position while, at the  same time, providing more assistance to households through the further deferral  of the introduction of water charges. I commend the proposals and the report to  the House.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Finance and Personnel (Ms J McCann)</strong>: Go raibh maith  agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his statement. Given that  the Department previously placed considerable store by the in-year monitoring  process as a tool for managing budgetary pressures, does the need for the  revision of the 2010-11 Budget highlight the limitations of the monitoring  rounds and the urgent need to re-establish a formal process for reviewing and  agreeing the Executive&rsquo;s Budget to provide sufficient time for Assembly  scrutiny? Moreover, will the Minister clarify what, if any, additional efficiency  savings over and above the current level of 3% will be required in 2010-11  should the British Chancellor announce additional measures for Whitehall  Departments?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: The Chairman is right; we have relied on in-year monitoring  four times a year to reallocate money that Departments thought that they would  spend but, ultimately, did not spend. However, for the next year, if we reduce  the level of overcommitment to zero, we will offer more opportunity for in-year  monitoring because we will not have to keep our eye on the fact that we have  already put in place spending plans that encompass more money than was  available. In the past number of years, we found that we could not rely on the  fact that, towards the end of the year, Departments would not have spent all  that money. Therefore, on the basis of experience, we recognised that it was  neither realistic nor feasible to continue with overcommitment. However, as I  said in the statement, it will enable us to rely to some extent on the in-year  monitoring process.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have to live with in-year monitoring for the next year.  However, as I said yesterday, every approach is problematic because the whole  point of in-year monitoring and asking Departments to surrender money was to  deal with unforeseen circumstances and inescapable bids that arose because of  unpredictable events. We could do that through a contingency fund, in-year  monitoring or simply by coming to the Executive as events arise and telling  every Department that it must divvy up. All those options have their own  difficulties.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I said yesterday, I am open to the idea of a discussion  in the Committee or the Assembly about how we deal with pressures that arise  that we cannot possibly anticipate. I am happy to consider the options, but we  will find difficulties with each of them. If Members decide that in-year  monitoring is not the best option and there is a forcible case to support that  assertion, the Department will be prepared to consider that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have additional efficiency savings to make next year,  and they are encompassed in the Budget proposals. Although my Department is not  responsible for each Department&rsquo;s efficiency targets, it monitors them. We met  the targets for 2008-09 and we are on target for 2009-2010. All the indications  are that we will meet the efficiency targets for 2010-11.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his statement and I particularly welcome the Executive&rsquo;s  proposals on invest to save. As with any Budget, the key test for a lot of  people will be its effect on individual households, particularly in these harsh  economic times. Will the Minister clarify the position for households in  2010-11 with regard to the regional rate? Furthermore, what is the overall  financial impact on households under this Budget compared with what might have  been the case had we followed the advice of some people outside the Assembly  and actually been under direct rule?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: The impact on households is determined mainly by the  fact that we decided to freeze the regional rate again for another year. Under  direct rule there were increases, on average, of approximately 7% a year. Had  the increase been 7% this year, the regional rate alone would have taken &pound;21  million from households. The further deferral of water charges for this year  represents an average saving of &pound;400 per household.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I know that there have been some criticisms of the draft  expenditure proposals. I am sure that, during this discussion, some Members  will ask whether I should have done certain things. However, there is a balance  between the amount of money that we spend on public services and the amount  that we take out of people&rsquo;s pockets at a time of increased unemployment and  fewer opportunities for people to do overtime at work or to do part-time work.  People are feeling the economic pinch, and households are facing increasing  bills. However, households are better off by not having to pay water charges or  the kind of rate increases that they would have faced under direct rule. The Executive  made that judgement, and households across Northern Ireland will benefit as a  result.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  I sense the Minister&rsquo;s continued realisation of how tight he is being squeezed.  He has outlined very serious and hard-hitting choices. First, is he satisfied  that his statement will represent the sum of spending cuts in the Executive in  this comprehensive spending review (CSR) period, and is he ruling out further  cuts in the next financial year? How frank can he be today?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, does he believe that his planned cuts will have  an impact on front line services that affect vulnerable people? Is he convinced  that his Department has explored all the options that are available to him  before he goes further in requesting from his fellow Ministers the drastic  action that he has said is necessary?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: Perhaps my problem is that, at times, I am too frank  with people. I will be as frank as always in response to the Member&rsquo;s question.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Is this the sum total of the cuts that we are likely to  face in 2010-11? The answer is that I do not know. The reason for that is not  because the plans do not represent the full investigation that we have  conducted into our current financial status, spending plans and the situations  that the Executive know they will have to face. If that were the only part of  the equation, I would be fairly confident that it represents the budgetary  position that we will have to face over the next year.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, an election is planned for the beginning of the  next financial year. The Labour Party and the Conservative Party, one of which  will set the picture for spending in the United Kingdom as a whole and,  therefore, the amount of money made available to devolved Administrations, have  indicated that they will have to administer some fairly robust and hard  economic treatment. I do not believe that Northern Ireland will escape the  consequences of that. I do not know how hard that is likely to be.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I spoke to my counterpart in the Welsh Assembly Government  this morning to discuss our approach when we meet the Chief Secretary to the  Treasury on Thursday. We discussed the implications for budgets across the United Kingdom.  She is in exactly the same position as we are. We must seek to press the Chief  Secretary as to what the next CSR period is likely to bring, and what the  implications are likely to be.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I assure Members that, based on the level of need in Northern Ireland, there is a strong case for  arguing for additional resources and that the reduction in spending should not  impact as heavily on Northern    Ireland as it might in other parts. That is  a case that we have to make, and one that I will make forcibly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As far as the impact on front line services is concerned,  the paper that I published today sets out the global figure for each  Department. I have emphasised in my statement and in the paper that Ministers  should first look at how they can effect those savings by reducing the level of  bureaucracy, administration and so on in their Departments. However, it is up  to individual Ministers to bring forward plans to show what they intend to do  to effect those savings. Ministers will publish those plans on their respective  departmental websites, and the plans will then go to Committees for scrutiny. I  am sure that Committees will examine the choices that Ministers have made,  question the Ministers about those choices and ensure that the choices that  Ministers have made are the ones that impact least on front line services. That  is a job of each individual scrutiny Committee.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">To be frank with the Member, I am not saying that there  will be no impact on front line services. However, when Ministers bring forward  proposals for their Department that have an impact on front line services,  Committees must ensure that there is not something else that could have been  given a higher priority when it comes to savings, thereby avoiding such an  impact. That is a role for all Members in the scrutiny of the Budget.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his statement. We are, of course, receiving a crisis  mini-Budget. Will the Minister reflect on the fact that he and his predecessors  received an increased budget in real terms over this three-year period? The  actual outcome has been a series of cuts. Public discussion has focused on  cuts; that is the reality.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister reflect that the consultation is very much  Committee-based? Committees will consider their individual departmental interest.  Does the Minister agree that a more overarching review of the Budget is  required? I was pleased to see Sinn F&eacute;in moving onto our ground in that regard.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, will the Minister reconcile the figures that he  has provided in his statement? When the two figures referred to in his  statement as spending pressures are added together, the cuts total &pound;367  million. The Minister stated that that is equivalent to 2&middot;6% of planned current  expenditure and 10&middot;2% of capital investment. Those are very swingeing cuts,  particularly in capital investment. Later in the statement, the figures  presented are very much reduced.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is stated that current spending will reduce by 0&middot;1% to  &pound;9 billion and that capital investment plans will decrease by 1%. I notice that  those latter figures are not replicated in the main document. Although it is  important that the public presentation of the plans is accurate, I do not see  how those figures can be reconciled.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">11.45 am</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: The Member is a kind of prophet of doom in the  Assembly. Even when I come forward with the most optimistic and pleasing of  statements, he always finds something bad to say. Maybe he feels that that is  his role as a public representative. I think that sometimes public  representatives should use their role to try to bring a little light and joy as  well as to delve into where difficulties may lie. However, if the Member wishes  to be known as the one with a dark cloud hanging over his head all the time,  that is up to him.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The first thing to say is that this is not a crisis Budget.  Do not forget that I identified early on that there would be an issue over the  next year. All the reasons for that are given in the statement: the changing  economic conditions; the fact that we were not getting the capital receipts  that we hoped to get; and the fact that there were additional demands as a  result of the changing economic conditions. Therefore, we needed to ask ourselves  whether the normal in-year monitoring would be capable of dealing with the  situation. I came to the conclusion that it would not. Therefore, let us have a  considered view and let us look more at how we can deal with it. That is  exactly what the process is about. It is not about crisis management; in fact,  it is the exact opposite of crisis management. It is considered manage&shy;ment of  a changing situation, and we must deal with that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member also indicated that we should look at the matter  in an overarching way. The Chairperson of the Committee made it clear that she  believed that that was a job for her Committee. The process is very clear. Each  Committee will look at what its Minister proposes for the reductions and send  its report and assessment to the Committee for Finance and Personnel, which  will then make an overall assessment of how the Budget pans out across all  Departments. In that process, information is fed from the people who have  expert knowledge of individual Departments up to the Committee that is  responsible for looking at the Budget as a whole. The Committee for Finance and  Personnel will then bring its report to the Assembly for a debate, and that  will give Members the opportunity to look at the Budget in its entirety. The  Member tries to make an issue of that, but I do not know what the issue is.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">He also mentioned figures for the reduction in current spending  and the reduction in capital spending, but I cannot remember those figures  offhand because I did not write them down. He also questioned how those tie  with the 0&middot;1% reduction in current spending and the 1% reduction in capital  spending in the overall Budget. The difference is that the &pound;373 million of  savings is a gross figure; those are the savings that we had to make. However,  the figures for the overall Budget are the net figure. Do not forget that some  of those savings were taken off. The savings were being made, but some were  recycled in other ways and spent in Departments. Therefore, the difference is  between the gross figures and the net figures. The figures of &pound;9 billion in  total for current spending and &pound;1&middot;4 billion in total for capital spending  indicate what the final outcome will be.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member does his job, and he does it very well. However,  I sometimes wish that he would not try to paint the blackest of pictures. If  anything, Members should accept that the statement and the approach that we  have taken are responses to things that I have heard the SDLP say in the past.  It has stated that, in light of the current circumstances, we cannot simply  plough on with what we had planned in 2008 because it was different from 2010.  He is right, and that is exactly what we have done. At least give us some  credit for that.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his statement. I will take up the invitation from Peter  Weir. The Minister talks about a choice between increasing revenue and spending  cuts when, in fact, it should be a balance. I know of no other jurisdiction,  certainly in Europe, if not further afield, in  which governments do not have a balance of revenue and spending cuts. Indeed,  that is the approach of all three of the main parties in Westminster. Does the Minister recognise,  therefore, that the approach that he is taking will favour the people who are  better off in this society? We have to bear in mind that the regional rate is  not paid by everybody and that it is crudely related to the ability to pay.  Water charges may also operate on that basis, with a potential affordability  tariff. In contrast, it is those who depend disproportionately on public  services who will be more affected.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister also address the rationale for economic  Departments bearing the larger burden of the spending cuts, particularly  bearing in mind that we are trying to come out of a recession and trying to  rebalance and modernise our economy?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: First, I will deal with the issue that the Member  raised about whether we should have sought to deal with the situation by  raising revenue rather than reducing the amount of spending &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  Both.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: So that I do not misrepresent the Member, his point  was about giving more emphasis to the raising of revenue than to reductions. On  the surface, that may appear to be an attractive proposition. However, the  savings that we had to find amounted to &pound;373 million. Raising the regional rate  was an option. If it were raised by the level of inflation, that would have  produced somewhere in the region of &pound;9 million. Had we raised it by 10%, that  would have produced &pound;30 million. That would have still left a substantial hole  in the Budget and it would have had a fairly dramatic impact on households at  this time.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A commitment had been given to keep the regional rate  frozen for three years, and that was made at a time when economic circumstances  were even better for households than they are today. Many householders across Northern Ireland  would have asked me to explain why I made a decision to help them when economic  circumstances were a bit better than they are today, and now, when economic  circumstances are really harsh, I decide to take money out of their pockets.  The Member may feel that that is an easy case to make to the electorate; I did  not believe that it was and neither did the Executive. It would not have helped  in a major way to address the issue that we faced. It is an argument that we  could have, but I have outlined the reason why we did not go down that route.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As far as the reductions in the budgets of the economic  Departments are concerned, there was a reduction in the current expenditure of  the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment (DETI). It should not be  forgotten that those reductions were made after I held bilateral meetings with  each of the Ministers and talked to them about where they believed that they  could effect savings in their Departments. The current reductions in the two  economic Departments, DETI and the Department for Employment and Learning (DEL), are 2&middot;2% and 2&middot;4%  respectively. Therefore, they are not overly stringent. Capital reductions,  based on where those Departments believed that capital could be spent in the  future, were 7&middot;2% and 8&middot;2% respectively, which are below average reductions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">If the Member compares the average reductions with those  that were made in the two Departments that are responsible for delivering  economic development in Northern    Ireland, he will find that the latter ones  are lower.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McQuillan</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his statement. Will he give an assurance that the  Civil Service equal pay claim will be paid in the 2010-11 financial year?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: The Civil Service unions have finished consulting  with their members, and they have agreed that the equal pay claim is  acceptable. Work must now be done, and, indeed, my officials have already  started to meet each of the 13,000 people involved to discuss the proposals and  to determine each person&rsquo;s entitlement. The money available from the Treasury  had to be spent in this financial year, but we have been given flexibility to  move it over to next year.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are three imperatives to settling the claim, partly  in this financial year and partly in 2010-11: the flexibility to spread  settlements over an additional financial year; the expectation among those who  are eligible for the payments to be made; and the fact that the money has been  built into our spending plans for next year, and, therefore, we will have to  move on it as quickly as possible.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Anderson</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his  statement. Is the Minister committed to conducting an equality impact  assessment (EQIA) on the proposals for the 2010-11 Budget, and what  preparations have been put in place to take that EQIA forward? I heard what the  Minister said about the level of need here, and the point of conducting an EQIA  would not be to engage in a procedural exercise for its own sake but to  identify changes that could be brought about specifically to assist those who  are most in need.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: Equality impact assessments will not entirely be my  Department&rsquo;s responsibility. The global figures and information on how they  will impact each Department have been made available to all Ministers, who will  then publish how their respective Departments intend to effect those savings.  When a Department has compiled its list of implications, it will be up to that  Department to conduct an equality impact assessment on it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is impossible for my Department to conduct an equality  impact assessment until I know the exact nature of each Department&rsquo;s savings. I  know how much DHSSPS, DETI, and so forth, will have to save, but I do not know  how the Ministers intend to achieve those savings. Indeed, Ministers clearly,  and quite rightly, indicated to me that they did not want me to decide how the  savings in their respective Departments should be made. They want to make those  decisions themselves, and they will have ownership of them. Therefore, once Ministers  have presented their proposals to their respective Committees, it will be up to  them to conduct equality impact assessments on them. When we see the final  shape of how the savings are to be made, a high-level equality impact  assessment can be carried out, based on those hundreds of individual decisions.  That is the proper way to do things, so, initially, I will have no role to play  in the matter.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hilditch</strong>:  The Minister referred to the substantial one-off cost of &pound;360 million that is  associated with the Civil Service pay claim. It is understood that the bulk of  that cost and ongoing additional payments will be made to Department for Social  Development staff. Further to the Minister&rsquo;s reply to Mr McQuillan, will the  ongoing cost of settling the equal pay claim be met totally by the centre, or  will efficiencies be required from the Department for Social Development?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Further to that, will the Minister also confirm whether slippage  in the Royal Exchange project is to be used to provide additional funding for  new housing and maintenance programmes?</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">12.00 noon</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: The Executive took two decisions on the equal pay  claim and its impact on each Department. Departments will face a one-off hit as  a result of the legacy aspect of the equal pay claim. Some people will be due  back payments for as many as six years, and the Executive took the position  that it was unacceptable to expect Departments to meet those payments from  their own budgets. Therefore, a central pot of money will be made available for  the legacy element of the claim. However, Departments will have to meet the  ongoing costs. I accept that some Departments will be hit harder than others.  In fact, my Department will have nearly the same percentage hit on its budget  as the Department for Social Development, because more AA and AO grades work in  my Department than in some others. Therefore, there will be an unequal impact.  However, almost every decision that is made when we make budgetary and economic  changes has an unequal impact on Departments. Some changes, for example, might  impact more on DOE and DRD than on the Department of Education.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We cannot say that every decision that has an unequal  impact must be funded from some central pot. That central pot does not  magically appear from somewhere &mdash; it means money being taken from other  Departments. When a cost is ongoing, how long should that central pot be held  to supply the money? If that is done on the basis of the unequal impact on  Departments, how many factors should be included in that central pot? What does  that do to the flexibility of Departments to change their ways, and what  incentive does it provide for doing so?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">If one Department suffers a major hit because of a  particular issue, but a central pot guarantees that the money will be paid,  there is no incentive for a Minister to find a different way of resolving the  issue, such as considering whether the Department needs as many staff in  certain grades. Therefore, if one Department is hit harder than another and the  money is paid out from a central pot, that Department will continue to act in the  same way for ever. That is not the best way forward, and, for that reason, the  Executive decided that the Departments will have to fund the ongoing costs.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his statement. He noted that there was a shortfall of  &pound;200 million in respect of capital receipts from Crossnacreevy. Who, if anyone,  is responsible for making up that shortfall, and what role does the Department  of Agriculture and Rural Development play in that?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I thank the Member for his question. Indeed, he has  just reminded me of the second part of the previous question, which was also  about capital receipts and the money from the DSD&rsquo;s Royal Exchange project.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At approximately &pound;20 million, the Department of Agriculture  and Rural Development&rsquo;s capital budget is quite small. Therefore, the Member  will recognise immediately that it is impossible to say that, should the  capital receipt from Crossnacreevy not become available, the Department of  Agriculture and Rural Development should fund that from its own resources. That  would not be feasible, as it does not have that much capital spend per annum.  In fact, it would amount to its capital spend for 10 years. That is why I said  in my statement that reduced requirements for other capital spend projects that  will not happen next year could be used to offset the shortfall in receipts,  such as those that the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development had been  expecting to receive from Crossnacreevy. The burden, therefore, would not have  to fall on the Departments.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, in saying that, I outlined two conditions. First,  Departments would have to show that they had made every effort to make up all  or part of any shortfalls in their budgets. Secondly, that would be done  through the in-year monitoring rounds when we have a better picture of the  final likely receipts, costs and consequences. However, it is up to Departments  to demonstrate that they have made every effort in their own budgets to  facilitate any shortfalls.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">If the Royal Exchange project does not go ahead next year,  it will be because it is not yet ready to go ahead; however, it will go ahead  at some stage. Therefore that project is a reduced requirement for the  Department next year, and the moneys for it must be returned to the centre.  Where a Department has been voted money &mdash; not by me, but by the Assembly &mdash; and  decides not to do what has been approved, the process of accountability  requires Ministers to return that money and allow the Executive to re-examine  what they will do with it. No one in the Assembly would be keen on me applying  for and receiving &pound;100 million from the Assembly to do something and then  returning to my Department and saying, &ldquo;Stuff that; I&rsquo;ll spend it on something  else&rdquo; without there being a mechanism to hold me to account. That is why when a  reduced requirement exists the money must be given back and why a Minister  cannot say that he or she will spend the money on something else. It must be  given back, the circumstances must be explained, and the Minister must then  rebid for that money.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The reduced requirement for the Royal Exchange project  involved money being voted to DSD to carry out a regeneration project in the  centre of Belfast,  a project that the Executive and the Assembly felt was a good use of money.  However, if that money is not to be used for that project next year, the  Minister must surrender it and a decision must be made on what to do with it.  Whether it is spent on housing or on offsetting the costs of the receipt that  is not available from Crossnacreevy will be a discussion that the Executive  must hold and at which the Minister must present her case.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>:  In the spirit of light and joy, I thank the Minister for his statement.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister may agree that relying on monitoring rounds to  manage what have increasingly become underlying pressures has run its course.  However, in many ways, today&rsquo;s review is a super monitoring round, which is  really about how the pressures are absorbed and passed out among Departments.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister rightly drew our attention to the fact that  not only is the current squeeze being managed but there is likely to be a  severe tightening in future because of the other factors that he mentioned.  Does the Minister agree that we cannot absorb those pressures in the same form  of exercise that is currently being conducted and that it will take something  more structural and strategic?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, will the Minister reconsider his attitude to  the proposal of some Members for a fundamental recasting of the Budget? That  would involve categorising the different Budget lines into those that wholly  cover front line services, those that mainly cover front line services and so  on, the whole way down to purely administrative categories. The Minister talked  about reducing bureaucracy and protecting front line services, and such a  reclassification would allow us to create an articulate Budget information  service that we could use when lobbying the Treasury and others to defend our  needs and also to prove that we have a Budget system that is targeting and  meeting need and making changes.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: We must live with the situation that we have at  present. We are now in January, and the Budget must be ready by the end of  March to enable Departments to plan their spending in the best way possible,  particularly given the uncertainty that the Member raised regarding what might  be coming in the middle of the year. The Member may want to call our budgetary  process a &ldquo;super monitoring round&rdquo;, but it puts in place plans for such a  contingency.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member also asked about the future. Once we have the  comprehensive spending review for the next three years &mdash; I do not think that it  will be available until after the general election &mdash; it will be examined by the  Assembly, and we can have the debate that the Member requested.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have not mentioned a certain point thus far, as no one  has raised it with me. As far as other preparations are concerned, the Member  is correct: if the reductions that we anticipate are as severe as we believe  that they will be, it will be difficult to manage that by simply tampering  around the edges of departmental budgets. One reason that my Department has set  up the invest to save fund of &pound;26 million is to encourage Ministers to look  ahead now and determine where savings can be made.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Yesterday afternoon, I had a discussion with the Minister  of Agriculture, who drew to my attention a particular problem that, at present,  is costing the Executive tens of millions of pounds. She believes that, if we  spent around a couple of millions of pounds, those kinds of costs could be  avoided. That is where the invest to save fund comes in. Ministers can look  ahead and see where, if they had another couple of millions of pounds to spend,  ten times that amount could be saved in every future year. That is preparation  for the kind of scenario that the Member has described.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It might have been easy for my Department to provide &pound;26  million to help each Department to avoid losing &pound;2 million. However, that would  have been short-sighted. My Department has tried to make long-term  preparations. When the comprehensive spending review takes place, we will look  at the Budget for the next three years. At that stage, we will have an  opportunity to look at the whole budgetary process.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. It would be churlish not to  acknowledge that the Minister had a difficult job. He gave timely warning and  spelled out to the Assembly the significant pressures that were building up,  particularly because the Assembly has a fixed Budget. It does not have a normal  budgetary process in which money that it is possible to generate through  revenue can be balanced against ambitions and spending plans. When the global  economy goes into decline, that has an effect here. When Westminster decides to top-slice some public  spending budgets, that has a direct impact here. The Assembly must take that on  board. The matter will now be referred to Departments and Committees.  Hopefully, they will apply both the equality impact assessment process and the  test of what are true efficiencies, by examining whether the same outputs and  service delivery can be generated with less input.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister remind the Assembly what stocks of both  current and capital end-year flexibility are available to the Executive at  present? It is difficult to get books to balance in that respect. What level of  access has been agreed with the Treasury? A key question is: to what extent  have the current stocks of end-year flexibility already been committed?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I do not carry that kind of detailed knowledge in my  head. Therefore, I will rely on officials to give me the answer to those  questions. I think that the Member opposite sits down and thinks about how he  can catch me out on certain figures. He always asks me these wee questions on  individual figures. I admit that I did not have those figures. My officials  have supplied me with some, which I hope that I have heard correctly. At  present, the stock of end-year flexibility is &pound;30 million of current and &pound;50  million of capital. If I have misheard officials, I will write to the Member  and to you, Mr Speaker, with the correct figures, so that they can be corrected  in the record.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">12.15 pm<span style="font-style:normal; "> </span></p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member also mentioned administration, as did the Member  who spoke previously, who asked whether there could be a Budget picture that  tells us what is happening in administration. We have administrative lines in  each of the budgets that are clear to be seen, and there are 5% efficiency  savings to be made on those. I have regular discussions with ministerial  colleagues about that, and we have adhered rigidly to the proposal that, if  someone wishes to have more money spent on administration, it can only happen  if money has been surrendered by somebody else&rsquo;s Department. No  reclassification is allowed unless money is actually available from somewhere  else to reclassify for people&rsquo;s administrative budgets in another Department.  We have tried to be as rigorous as possible on administrative savings and  avoiding any impact on front line service.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  heard with interest what the Minister said about the invest to save fund. The  example he quoted of spending a couple of million pounds in order to save tens  of millions implies that there is a payback period of about six weeks, which  one would have assumed would have been covered within the Department&rsquo;s budget  for that year. However, given that he has not said very much about the detail  of it, will he give us some idea of the expected rate of return from that sort  of investment and how it would be applied, given that it is a relatively modest  sum? In particular, will Departments be discussing their proposals with their  Committees? Will the Minister give us some idea as to whether he will be  encouraging Departments to consider the costs of segregation and division in  the application of that fund?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I have made it clear that Departments will be  consulting Committees. They will be expected to publish how they will make  those savings and then to discuss that in full with their Committees. I am not  clear whether Mr Ford was asking whether Departments would be discussing with  Committees any applications for the invest to save fund. However, I assume that  Ministers will wish to do that. How will the invest to save fund be applied and  what rate of return do we expect? Mr Ford is right: it is a modest sum of  money. However, if one could get the kind of return that the Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development told me could be made in a year for the kind  of investment that she is talking about, which would then be ongoing for years  after that, the savings could be quite substantial.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We will set criteria and make judgements on the  applications. Ministers will have to show what kind of savings might be made  from their application, how quickly those savings could be found and whether  they will be one-off or ongoing savings. We will also take into account the  pressures on individual Departments. There will be a number of ways in which we  can judge all of that. At the end of the day, the Executive will make the  decision on the applications that are made.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am hopeful that substantial savings can be made. I hope  that Ministers will be inventive when looking for savings with their officials  and that they will look clearly for modest amounts of money that could have  those ongoing savings and quantify them so that we can make the judgements.  Those are the kind of things that I expect. If the Member and the Committees  come up with suggestions about other aspects that should be looked at or what  other criteria we should apply, I will be more than happy to hear from them  when we come to allocate the moneys that are available.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">With regard to the cost of division, I have made it clear  time and time again in the Assembly that, as far as I am concerned, if we are  spending money in such a way that it does not give the best return to the  public purse, we ought to look at that. I do not adopt any ideological position  on the matter. The Member and his party believe that the costs of division  represent an area in which huge savings could be made. Many of the examples  that he gives about duplication are due to social and economic conditions,  rather than the cost of division. We must also recognise that the reality in  Northern Ireland is that some of those things are not easily swept aside, and  we will live with the legacy of them for some time. Of course, where it can be  identified that there is duplication because of the costs of division and that  there is a feasible and workable way of avoiding that duplication and reducing  that spending, I would expect Ministers to bring that to Committees, and I  would expect Committees to endorse it and that it would be part of the Budget.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kinahan</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his statement. He said that he would be able to deal  with the main shortfall from the expected slippage of two major capital  investment projects. He has already mentioned one of those, the Royal Exchange,  and the other could be the strategic waste management project. Will he outline  how definite that slippage is, particularly in relation to the strategic waste  management project, and whether he believes that taking away with one hand to  fill the gap somewhere else is an adequate way to conduct public finances?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: The fact is that, if the money cannot be spent in  one particular year, something has to be done with it, otherwise it would  simply be given back to the Treasury. Therefore, I think that is the adequate  way of dealing with the issue. I am not exactly sure of the degree of time  slippage in the strategic waste management project, but I know that money that  was meant to be spent in the next financial year is not likely to be spent until  2012. Rather than going back to the Treasury, it will be used to offset other  things, such as the lack of receipts from Crossnacreevy or somewhere else. That  is a sensible approach. The Minister of the Environment can probably give more  detail on exactly how much slippage there is.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Of course, the money will have to be spent eventually, but,  if by 2012 or 2013 the economic situation has changed and we can receive the  receipts from Crossnacreevy, then the money will go into the projects that have  slipped. That is the rationale behind our approach. It is a sensible rationale,  and it is much better to reallocate the money to Departments in Northern  Ireland than to give it back to the Treasury, which, I am sure, would  gratefully receive it from us. However, we will do our best to hold on to it.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his statement. What is the read-across between the  revised Budget and the Programme for Government, and what strategic approach  was taken by the Executive to ensure that overarching objectives, such as  modernising the economy and protecting public services, will still be  maintained?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: The approach that we took was designed to do exactly  what the Member asks about: ensure that the Budget still reflects the Programme  for Government. The easy way to have done that would have been to acknowledge  that we had savings to make and decide that every Department should take a  certain hit, a pro rata cut, end of story. That would have saved me  interminable meetings with each Minister and their Department and would have  been a quick and easy solution. No one could have denied that they were being  treated fairly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will be frank: there are Ministers from my own party who  will not be particularly happy with the review, because I have not shown any  partisan approach to the Budget. Indeed, some of the Departments that have DUP Ministers  have been hit harder than other Departments have been. That is a reflection of  the fact that we have adopted a strategic approach, considering how we can  target the cuts so as to keep the spending in line with the priorities that we  have set in the Programme for Government.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That is reflected in two ways. First, the Departments that  deal with economic development have not been hit as hard as the average across  the board, despite the point made earlier by Mr Farry. Secondly, we know that  the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety delivers front line  services for which there is a big demand in Northern Ireland, and its budget  has been cut the least of all.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have sought to protect the economy and front line  services. Moreover, through the invest to save fund, we are seeking to ensure  more efficient delivery of services, which is a priority for many Members.  Departments will be given some money with which they can look at how they might  make efficiency savings.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Savage</strong>: I  was glad to hear the Minister say that he is not adopting a partisan approach.  That is the first time that I have heard a Minister of Finance and Personnel talk  sense in the House.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  Steady on now, George.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Savage</strong>: I  mean what I say; I will give anyone credit where credit is due. The Minister of  Finance and Personnel said, following his discussions with the Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development, that substantial savings could be made. I am  glad that an opportunity exists to cut bureaucracy and red tape and to get down  to business. Much can be done by taking a simple approach, so I am glad to hear  the Minister&rsquo;s comments. The Minister did not fall into the trap that Mr Ford  laid: he would not discuss the details of the invest to save fund before it is  discussed in the various Committees. I am glad to see that the Minister is  taking that approach, and I hope that it &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member must come to his question.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Savage</strong>: I  hope that the Minister&rsquo;s approach will be followed in the House.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I do not think that a question was asked, but I  accept the Member&rsquo;s commendation. The cynic in me means that, when I hear such  comments, I wonder when the boot is coming in. Mr McNarry, who is sitting  beside Mr Savage, is very good at doing that. He makes a lovely statement, only  to put the boot in after, and I am sure that he will live up to that reputation  in future.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that we have taken a sensible approach, despite all  the cynicism outside the Assembly. I suspect that, because of other events, the  debate will not get much coverage in the press, but it has been constructive.  Members have put their points strongly and shown where they have a different  emphasis from mine. I hope that I have given answers as honestly as possible.  Although I was disappointed that the process was slow to get started, the  process leading up to today&rsquo;s statement has shown that constructive work was  done between me and the Ministers, some of whom have radically different views  to me. The process could have been made more difficult by political point  scoring, but, by and large, that did not happen, and, if people dig behind the  facade, they will see that we do good work for which we are not given credit.  Unfortunately, that results in the public seeing a picture of here that is  unfair and distorted.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  That ends questions on the ministerial statement. The Business Committee has  arranged to meet immediately on the lunchtime suspension. I therefore propose,  by leave of the Assembly, to suspend the sitting until 2.00 pm.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The sitting was suspended at 12.29 pm.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">On resuming (Mr Deputy Speaker <span class="Italic">[Mr  Molloy]</span> in the Chair) &mdash;</p>

    <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="3"></a>Ministerial Statement</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">North/South Ministerial Council</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Inland Waterways Sectoral Format</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I have received notice from the Minister of Culture, Arts and  Leisure that he wishes to make a statement regarding the North/South  Ministerial Council (NSMC) meeting in inland waterways sectoral format.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure (Mr McCausland)</strong>: With your permission, Mr Deputy  Speaker, I wish to make a statement in compliance with section 52 of the  Northern Ireland Act 1998 regarding a meeting of the North/South Ministerial  Council in inland waterways sectoral format. The meeting was held at the  Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure (DCAL) headquarters at Causeway  Exchange, Belfast, on 2 December 2009.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive were represented by myself, as Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure, and Conor Murphy MP MLA, Minister for Regional  Development. The Irish Government were represented by &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v TD, Minister  for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. This statement has been agreed with  Conor Murphy, and I am making it on behalf of us both.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The chief executive of Waterways Ireland, Mr John Martin,  presented a report on progress, which included the provision of 99 metres of  additional moorings up to the end of November 2009 and the construction of the  remaining bridge to reconnect the Royal canal to the Shannon. Waterways Ireland  also continued its marketing activities, with the provision of new publications  to promote and support the use of the waterways and the sponsoring of key  events on the waterways in 2009.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In relation to the Waterways Ireland business plan and  budget for 2009, the Council noted that Waterways Ireland has applied  efficiency savings to its 2009 budget in accordance with guidance that was  issued by the two Finance Departments. The Council noted the revised 2009  business plan and budget provision, which was subsequently approved by the  Minister of Finance and Personnel on 7 December 2009 and approved at the NSMC  meeting in tourism sectoral format on 16 December 2009. The Council noted that  the Waterways Ireland draft business plan for 2010 is subject to budgetary  considerations and will be brought to a future NSMC meeting for approval.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A progress report was given by Waterways Ireland to the  Council on the restoration work on the Clones to Upper Lough Erne section of  the Ulster canal. The Council noted that work on the strategic environmental  assessment was due to be completed by the end of 2009 and work on the  environmental impact assessment is due for completion in July 2010. It was also  noted that possible routes and options are being reviewed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council received a presentation on Waterways Ireland&rsquo;s  activities on the Shannon waterway, and it noted that, since 2000, Waterways  Ireland has increased the number of moorings by more than 50% and the number of  vessels on the Shannon by more than 120%. The severe flooding currently being  experienced, particularly along the Shannon, where unprecedented levels of  water have been recorded, was also discussed. The Council agreed proposals for  a number of property disposals in the context of a range of development  projects on the waterways.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It was agreed that the NSMC will meet again in inland waterways  sectoral format at a date to be agreed in the second quarter of 2010.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure (Mr McElduff)</strong>: Go raibh  maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Ba mhaith liom dh&aacute; cheist a chur.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have two questions for the Minister. In May 2009, the  Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure held a meeting at the Waterways Ireland  headquarters in Enniskillen. It was heartening to hear the Minister speak of  recent progress in increasing the number of moorings so that more people can  enjoy our waterways.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister spoke of a revised budget being agreed for  Waterways Ireland for 2009. Will he tell the House how much was cut from the  original 2009 budget? What was, or will be, the impact of that revision on  service delivery?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, the Minister referred to a programme for the  completion of the restoration of the Ulster canal from Upper Lough Erne to  Clones. The Committee has maintained a keen interest in that issue, and we  heard from the Blackwater Regional Partnership about the tourism and economic  benefits that will result from the reopening of the canal. The Minister  mentioned a number of dates for key milestones to be met, but can he indicate a  date for the completion of the overall project?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: I will answer the second question first, on  progress on the Clones to Upper Lough Erne section of the Ulster Canal.  Waterways Ireland has received the physical survey in a format that allows the  preliminary design process to commence. Work on the environmental impact  assessment and the strategic environmental assessment is progressing well, and  the environmental impact assessment is due for completion in July 2010.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Possible routes and options are being reviewed, and when  the preferred options are identified, the tender for a site investigation will  be advertised. Waterways Ireland has met the Department of the Environment and  Roads Service about bridges in Northern Ireland, and has also met Monaghan  County Council&rsquo;s planning and roads sections. A meeting with DOE planners in  Northern Ireland will be held soon.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When a preferred option is identified, it will be developed  to the stage that allows it to be forwarded for planning approval. Planning  applications should be ready for submission in summer 2010. Pending a  successful outcome to the planning process, the land acquisition process will  commence, and the contract for the construction phase of the project should be  awarded some time in 2011. It is impossible to be more precise about a final  date for completion.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member also asked about the 2009 budget. Waterways  Ireland&rsquo;s budget for 2009 was &pound;33&middot;6 million. Waterways Ireland had applied a 3%  efficiency saving to the 2009 budget in accordance with the guidance that it  was given by the two Finance Departments. The situation is always somewhat  complicated by the exchange rate between the pound and the euro. However, the  total 2009 budgetary allocation was &pound;28&middot;61 million from the Irish Republic and  &pound;4&middot;99 million from the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure, making a total  of &pound;33&middot;6 million.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is bound to be some impact on the work of the  organisation when savings are made. However, those efficiency savings were  determined by the Government in the Irish Republic and by the Assembly. They were  absolutely essential, and had to be fitted into the budget arrangements for  Waterways Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his statement. He referred to a 50% increase in the  number of moorings. What is Waterways Ireland doing to raise the profile of  inland waterways as a key tourism product?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: I am pleased that the Member has drawn attention  to the question of raising the profile of waterways as a means to create  additional tourism benefits. The Waterways Ireland marketing and promotion  strategy was launched in 2004.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On 29 April 2009, the marketing advisory group, made up of  representatives of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board, Tourism Ireland, the  Irish Boat Rental Association, Erne Charter Boat Association, the Northern  Ireland Chamber of Commerce and the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland met and  decided that Waterways Ireland staff would undertake a review of the strategy  in consultation with the advisory group. No external consultants are being brought  in, but that revised strategy for marketing waterways and promoting tourism  through them will be available for public consultation in early 2010. The key  elements in the strategy are: awareness creation; development of corporate  identity; promoting greater use of the waterways in partnership with other  bodies; and building a platform for sustained development.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, I hope that the point comes across clearly that  a partnership of various organisations, including the Northern Ireland Tourist  Board and the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce, is involved in this  promotional work. That is important. We have provided additional metres of  mooring in Northern Ireland, and that increases the facilities that are  available. I hope that in due course we will see the benefits of the marketing  and the increased moorings.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire as  an r&aacute;iteas at&aacute; d&eacute;anta aige anseo inniu, agus f&aacute;ilt&iacute;m roimh an dul chun cinn at&aacute;  d&eacute;anta san obair th&aacute;bhachtach seo.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Minister for his statement, and I welcome the  progress that has been made to date. The Newry canal, which is in my  constituency, is one of the most famous canals in the world. In fact, it was  one of the first canals to be constructed in these islands. That canal holds  tremendous potential for tourism and leisure, as it links Carlingford lough  with the north coast via the Upper Bann, Lough Neagh and the Lower Bann. Is  there any strategic view for the future that would bring canals such as the  Newry canal back into use? Will he outline any plans to do that?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: I am aware that four local councils own the  Newry to Portadown canal. The councils have carried out a feasibility study,  but due to lack of capital funding, no further progress has been made towards  reopening the waterway. However, the councils involved have carried out  extensive capital works to provide what has become hugely popular pedestrian  and cycle access on the entire towpath between Portadown and Newry.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  I, too, welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement. I would like to comment on the  success so far of what has been happening on the waterways.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The statement says:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The Council agreed proposals for a number of property  disposals in the context of a range of development projects&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I am a bit concerned when I hear of councils  selling off what are probably assets. As I understand it, there are  communities, including small hamlets and villages along the canals and that it  was the intention to regenerate them. Among any of the properties that will be  disposed of, are there any redundant lock-keeper&rsquo;s cottages that could be  turned into lucrative ventures that would encourage and entice the regeneration  of local communities along the canals?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: I assure Mr McCarthy that he can rest at ease on  that matter. The properties that were disposed of by Waterways Ireland were two  in number, and both were in the Irish Republic. Therefore, it is not a matter  that will give him any cause for concern. None of the disposals was financially  significant.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his submission. We realise the potential that is  locked up in Waterways Ireland. I looked at the figures on the number of extra  moorings and the increase in vessels on the Shannon. I also listened to the  Minister&rsquo;s mention of severe flooding problems along the Shannon. I am a wee  bit concerned that Northern Ireland is playing catch up. We have potential  here, as my colleague on my right and other Members mentioned. For a moment  there, I began to think that Dominic was working for the Tourist Board in  Newry. However, we have tremendous potential here. Can the Minister assure me  that Northern Ireland is playing catch up here and is doing so in a very  positive manner? The potential that lies out there untapped is tremendous.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: I agree entirely with what the Member said about  the potential of waterways. It may be helpful if I gave an update on the capital  works that have been undertaken in Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Up to the end of December 2009, Waterways Ireland had  completed 56 metres of additional moorings on the Lower Bann, which includes 36  m at Portglenone and 20 m at Camus. Other works on the Lower Bann include 36 m  of additional moorings at Hutchinson&rsquo;s quay, which are due to be completed by  March 2010; 36 m of additional moorings at Movanagher quay, which are due to be  completed by March 2010; the purchase of a jetty for Newferry, Ballymena; the  replacement of Movanagher bridge; and the provision of navigational signage.  The cost of the total capital works planned for the Lower Bann in 2010 is  &pound;455,000.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">No additional moorings were completed on the Erne system  during 2009, because 482 metres were completed in the previous year. The cost  of the planned works for the Erne system this year is &pound;460,000. The cost of  planned capital works in 2010 for the Erne/Shannon waterways, to which the  Member referred, is just &pound;97,000. With almost &pound;500,000 being invested in the  Erne waterways and almost &pound;500,000 being invested in the Lower Bann this year,  there will be significant investment in additional moorings and improvements.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Miss McIlveen</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his statement. Why was the 2009 business case plan not  approved by the NSMC until December 2009?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: I thank the Member for her question. The  Waterways Ireland business plan for 2009 was presented at the NSMC meeting in  inland waterways sectoral format on 16 January 2009, and its content was noted  subject to budgetary processes in the two jurisdictions. At that time, the  Budget in the Irish Republic had not been settled, and the two Departments of  Finance were in discussions about applying efficiency targets for cross-border  bodies. In May, Departments were advised by the NSMC secretariat that the two  Finance Departments were to agree a joint paper on efficiencies and offer  guidance for the preparation of business plans. That guidance was issued by  both Finance Departments on 14 September 2009.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The agreed guidance required that the body achieve a  minimum of 3% cumulative cash-releasing efficiencies &mdash; 3% in 2009 and 6% in  2010 &mdash; using indicative budget figures from 16 January as the baseline. The  Department of Finance in the Irish Republic approved the 2009 business plan. On  7 December 2009, the Minister of Finance and Personnel in Northern Ireland also  approved the business plan, which was then brought to the NSMC meeting in  tourism sectoral format on 16 December 2009, when it received final approval. I  think that the Member will probably appreciate that such things are somewhat  cumbersome.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>: I  welcome the statement, which is positive but a little brief. Does the Minister  agree that the development of the Lower Bann is absolutely critical to tourism,  particularly international tourism on the north coast? The Minister  acknowledged the good work of Waterways Ireland. However, is he aware that there  is serious erosion of the Lower Bann&rsquo;s riverbanks? Does he agree that there is  an absolute need for statutory legislation for the management of the river, so that  when the Ulster canal reopens, the river is preserved and can be a Mecca for  the whole of the island?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: I agree that the Lower Bann has potential in the  same way that I think that all the other waterways that have been mentioned  today have potential. The issue of erosion was not discussed at the NSMC  meeting. However, I will bear that in mind and will undertake to write to the  Member about the issue once I know what the current situation is.</p>
    <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="4"></a>Executive Committee Business</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Wildlife and Natural Environment Bill</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Second Stage</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment (Mr Poots)</strong>: I beg to move</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That the Second Stage of the Wildlife and Natural  Environment Bill [NIA 5/09] be agreed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I cannot overstate the importance of protecting, conserving  and enhancing our natural environment, particularly our wildlife, and I am  determined that the legislation will help to ensure that it remains diverse,  healthy and resilient. The legislation will also assist in meeting the  international obligation of halting biodiversity loss.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Wildlife (Northern Ireland) Order 1985 has served us  well and been an important tool in halting biodiversity loss. The Wildlife and  Natural Environment Bill provides greater scope to meet current and future  challenges. Through the Bill, I aim to enhance protection for a larger range of  birds, plants and animals. The changes are reflected in the schedules to the  Order, which sets out various levels of protection.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill is intended to provide more protection for the  species listed through giving the police greater powers to gather evidence. It  introduces custodial sentences for severe and persistent wildlife crime and new  powers to protect areas of special scientific interest. The Bill proposes a new  duty on Departments and other public bodies to further the conservation of  biodiversity. In addition, the Bill abolishes elements of the game laws that  require anyone hunting or selling game to have a licence. Those laws, which  date back to the nineteenth century, are no longer relevant.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill comprises 36 clauses and three schedules. I do not  intend to comment on every clause. However, I will highlight some issues and  expand on those that were mentioned earlier.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clauses 1, 2 and 3 establish a new duty on government and  public bodies. It will require all Departments, including the Department of the  Environment (DOE), to further the conservation of biodiversity when undertaking  their functions. Public bodies, such as district councils, will be required to  fulfil that duty. The conservation of nature is an essential part of the  commitments contained in the Northern Ireland sustainable development strategy,  which was published in 2006 and complements the Northern Ireland biodiversity  strategy that the Executive adopted in 2000.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The introduction of a duty on Departments and public bodies  will raise the profile of biodiversity and promote biodiversity issues as a  natural part of policy-making throughout the public sector. I am aware of the  good work that Departments and public bodies already do through the  biodiversity implementation plan to promote the conservation of biodiversity.  That process is led by the Northern Ireland Biodiversity Group, and an example  of that work is the provision of nesting boxes for swifts in the new library  that is being built in Antrim. Actions to promote biodiversity need not be  complex or expensive. For example, a decision not to cut small areas of grass  in the Stormont estate would encourage wildlife and save money.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I turn now to offences. It is vital that we all act in a  responsible manner when in the countryside. Clauses 5 and 6 extend the scope of  a number of existing offences that are contained in the Wildlife (Northern  Ireland) Order 1985. Anyone who acts in a reckless manner that causes harm to  wildlife will be committing an offence. The Bill strengthens controls on the  use of snares. Snares are used by landowners and land managers to control  pests, and many farmers use snares during the lambing season to capture foxes.  To avoid unnecessary suffering, that practice must be subject to strict  standards, and, therefore, the Bill includes a requirement for snares to be  regularly inspected.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Changes are proposed to the provisions for managing our  wild deer population. In recent times, the numbers of deer have increased, and,  therefore, it is time to provide mechanisms that will allow for the effective  control of the deer population. Accordingly, clause 16 gives my Department the  power to issue licences allowing deer to be taken or killed out of season. That  action could be allowed for purposes such as ensuring public safety or  preventing serious damage to crops. However, strict conditions will apply  before such licences can be granted. Clause 26 extends the season for culling  hinds and does by bringing forward the start of the open season to 1 October.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Robust enforcement powers are necessary to stop wildlife  crime. It is vital that the enforcement authorities, principally the police and  the Department&rsquo;s wildlife inspectors, have the necessary powers. Clause 19  provides stronger stop and search powers for the police. Under the authority of  a magistrate&rsquo;s warrant, police will have the power to access premises to  investigate a wider range of wildlife offences. For the first time, police will  have the authority to avail themselves of DNA sampling techniques to  investigate the ancestry of specimens. Those powers will be subject to relevant  controls, including the requirement that samples from live animal specimens be  taken only by veterinary surgeons. There is also a requirement that police  officers leave premises in the same secure manner in which they were found.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 22 will give the courts powers to impose custodial  sentences for serious offences against wildlife, such as stealing the eggs of  rare birds. The threat of imprisonment should deter persistent offenders from  committing serious wildlife crimes. I am thinking in particular of crimes such  as badger baiting or shooting birds of prey. I want to reinforce the message  that we value our wildlife and want to see it properly maintained and  safeguarded.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Schedules to the Wildlife (Northern Ireland) Order 1985  list different levels of protection for plants, birds and animals. Those  schedules have been reviewed to reflect the current conservation status of many  species in Northern Ireland. Additional species, such as the tree sparrow and  the sand martin, will be given full protection for the first time. Marine  species, such as the basking shark, are also included. My Department will have  a new duty to review the schedules every five years. That will ensure that we  take account of changing population trends.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Irish hare has been the subject of much attention in  recent years, and after careful consideration of the scientific evidence, I do  not propose to change the level of protection to that game species.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Excuse me, Minister. A mobile phone is interfering with the sound  equipment. I ask everyone to check that their mobile phones are switched off.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: Instead, practical conservation actions should continue to  focus on the main cause of population decline, which is the loss of a suitable  habitat. My officials are working closely with landowners and field sport  organisations on methods to ensure that an adequate habitat is maintained for  that unique species. The species action plan for the Irish hare will be  reviewed in 2010. In that review, officials will put forward practical and  achievable actions and targets to assist and maintain a sustainable population  of Irish hares.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am also taking the opportunity to make some amendments to  part 4 of the Environment (Northern    Ireland) Order 2002. That proposal is  designed to enhance protection for our areas of special scientific interest  (ASSI). Clauses 27 to 30 include provisions for new offences in relation to  actions by third parties that damage the futures of ASSIs, such as damage to an  ASSI due to the use of quad bikes on land without the landowner&rsquo;s knowledge. An  offence is also created when public bodies fail to notify the Department of  their consent to operations that are likely to damage an ASSI.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, I propose to amend the laws that relate to the  hunting and trading of game species. Clause 31 abolishes the requirement that  anyone who hunts or sells game has to be licensed. That requirement dates back  to the early 1800s, when it was needed to curb poaching on large estates.  However, it is no longer needed. My Department is responsible for the  conservation and management of game species. Responsibility for administering  game licences rests with the Department for Social Development. Margaret  Ritchie has agreed that the Bill offers an ideal opportunity to carry through  those reforms.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 32 removes the restriction that game can be sold  only at certain times of the year. Modern refrigeration techniques and food  safety standards mean that such restrictions are no longer necessary. I stress  that laws that relate to poaching will remain in place and it will be an  offence to sell illegally taken game.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I commend the Bill to the Assembly. It will have a positive  and practical impact on the conservation of biodiversity and the protection of  our wildlife. It will also bring us into line with the provisions in Great Britain  and further transpose the requirements of the birds directive. It provides the  authorities with responsibility for enforcing the provisions of the Wildlife (Northern Ireland)  Order 1985 by giving them the suitable powers to do so, and it offers an  appropriate level of deterrent to those involved in wildlife crime.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for the Environment (Mrs D Kelly)</strong>: As the Chairperson of  the Committee for the Environment, I welcome the Wildlife and Natural  Environment Bill. This comprehensive Bill consists of 36 clauses and three  schedules and has been introduced to reflect the increasing significance of  protecting our biodiversity and deterring wildlife crime.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In 2007, before my time in the Committee, the Committee  noted its concern about the current provision for protecting areas of special  scientific interest in the Environment (Northern Ireland) Order 2002 and  sought more information from the Department.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The response indicated that future changes to the 2002  Order through a wildlife Bill should address the Committee&rsquo;s concerns. I hope  that, some two years later, the Committee will not be disappointed. I note the  measures that the Minister outlined this afternoon, and I will touch on areas  of special scientific interest later.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In February 2009, the Committee sought the views of the  Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) on the Wildlife (Northern Ireland)  Order 1985. The RSPB stated that wildlife crime is a major issue in Northern Ireland  and outlined that it received 63 reports of wildlife crime between January 2006  and June 2008. It stressed that that number is likely to represent  under-reporting because the public tend not to report on wildlife crime.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The RSPB told the Committee that wildlife laws need to be  comprehensive and that people who commit serious wildlife crime should receive  custodial sentences to deter others. In the body&rsquo;s view, the Wildlife (Northern Ireland)  Order 1985 is long out of date and no longer fit for purpose because it has not  been fundamentally reviewed since it was created. It believes that the Order is  inadequate to protect species in Northern Ireland  and called for a wide range of changes, including the introduction of a licence  system for shoots and a duty on all public bodies and their officers in Northern Ireland  to further the conservation of biodiversity. I note that such provision is  included in the Bill and look forward to scrutinising it in more detail to  determine whether the proposed legislation is up to the task.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee&rsquo;s recent inquiry and report on climate change  recommended an urgent need for Northern Ireland  to produce a climate change strategy that recognises the importance of  biodiversity to Northern    Ireland, the commitments that have already  been made for its protection and the need to halt its decline. The Committee  recommended that the strategy should incorporate guiding principles for  protecting biodiversity. Therefore, the Committee welcomes the provision that  will introduce a new statutory duty on Departments and public bodies to further  the conservation of biodiversity, and we will liaise closely with public  authorities on that area of the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Last year, the Committee agreed with the RSPB&rsquo;s call for  custodial sentences for wildlife crimes and its view that Northern Ireland  should be on a par with Great Britain in that regard. It subsequently wrote to  the Secretary of State to say that stronger penalties, as have been introduced  in England, Scotland and Wales,  would offer an increased and robust deterrent to people who are involved in  wildlife crime and that that must be considered for Northern Ireland. Therefore, the  introduction of the Bill is welcome because it will introduce the measures that  I have outlined.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will touch on several other important areas of the Bill.  It aims to improve the management and protection of areas of special scientific  interest by ensuring that ignorance is no longer accepted as a defence and by  giving the Department the power to issue stop notices. The Committee welcomes  those powers, which will ensure that public bodies are obliged to inform the  Department when they have authorised or permitted anyone to undertake an  operation that may damage any features of an area of special scientific  interest. The Bill will certainly create greater enforcement powers. However,  as always, the Committee will want to know how those powers will be carried out  in practice and the resources that will be dedicated to them. We look forward  to receiving further information from officials at Committee Stage.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee is already concerned about the control of  vacancies in the Environment Agency. Many enforcement officers and not being  replaced, and the Committee will be mindful of that fact. Moreover, the  Committee will seek input into its scrutiny of the Bill from the PSNI, which  will continue to have a crucial role in the protection of our wildlife.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the protection of the nests of certain birds  under the Bill, as called for by the RSPB. I also welcome the introduction of  an offence for anyone who damages or destroys birds&rsquo; nests at any time of the  year. The RSPB states that some of our most familiar birds have been &ldquo;red  listed&rdquo; following long-term declines of over 50%. In other words, for a variety  of reasons, those birds&rsquo; future as an Irish species is at risk. The recent  killing of a red kite highlights the risks that birds face. The Committee  watched red kites flying in County   Down in February 2009,  and members were impressed by the work that had gone into the reintroduction of  the species into the North and the local community&rsquo;s considerable buy-in to the  project.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that the Bill will go some way to better protect  those birds, help to bring the perpetrators of that recent crime to justice and  allow red kites to flourish once again on the island.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee is aware that there is disappointment in some  quarters that the Minister of the Environment has decided not to give full  statutory protection in the Bill to some well-known species such as the Irish  hare and the curlew. The Committee recognises the need to protect those species  and has been involved in the alternative approaches that the Department of the  Environment has taken to protect them while numbers remain under threat.  However, I am sure that the Committee will take the opportunity to consider the  long-term implications of the protection of those species during its  consideration of the Bill. There has also been a surprising reaction to the  proposals laid out to allow the continued use of snares for the taking or  killing of wild animals across the North. I am sure that the Committee will  want to consider that aspect of the Bill in more detail over the next few  weeks.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the provision in the Bill to review the species  lists in schedule 1 every five years. As I said earlier, the RSPB had voiced  concerns that the Wildlife (Northern Ireland)  Order 1985 had not been fundamentally reviewed since it came into effect and  was inadequate to protect species in Northern Ireland. It is to be hoped  that the provision for review will ensure that the lists remain up to date and  accurate in order to protect the most vulnerable living things in Northern Ireland  and in our surrounding seas.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I should point out that not all aspects of the Bill fall  naturally to the Committee for the Environment to consider. Game and game  dealer licensing is, as the Minister said, a function of the Department for  Social Development. The Committee for the Environment will invite the Committee  for Social Development to consider the proposal for the abolition of such  licences and make its position known to us.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As soon as the House commends the Bill to the Committee, we  will call for written submissions from interested organisations and  individuals. Members will be extremely interested to hear their views. Last  week, Committee members received a pre-legislative briefing from the  Department&rsquo;s Bill team, and I look forward to having a good ongoing working  relationship with the officials to ensure that my Committee can scrutinise the  legislation properly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In general, the Bill seeks to strengthen the protection of  wildlife and our natural environment. On behalf of the Committee, which, I  know, wishes for greater environmental protection, I support the principles of  the Bill. If I may go off script, Mr Deputy Speaker, on a personal note, I have  been heartened by the coverage of the issue and the keen interest that the  general public has shown in the protection of birds, particularly during the  recent cold snap. I hope that people will make an effort to respond once our  consultation begins.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  support the Bill, which deals with an important subject. I note that the  lesser-spotted Wells has entered the Chamber to lend his support. There will be  strong support for the Bill on all sides of the House, because it is sensible  and important to protect our wildlife, which is something that we wish to  preserve for future generations. I will address issues of detail later, but it  is important to note that the Bill has been welcomed not only by all parties  but by a range of environmental groups, particularly those that are most  directly connected to its broad thrust, such as the RSPB.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will speak about a few aspects of the Bill that are  particularly welcome. The commitment in clause 1 to the duty to conserve  biodiversity has been put in very strong terms, which are compatible with our  international obligations and will put Northern Ireland at the cutting  edge of that objective. As the Chairperson said, the provisions in the Bill for  the protection of nests are important and are to be welcomed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A range of other issues has been highlighted, in particular  the introduction of new offences that will clamp down on those who would  interfere with our wildlife and try to destroy it. It is important that  environmental crime be tackled strongly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The aim of the Bill is to enhance protection for a larger  range of birds, plants and animals, as the Minister said. We would all strongly  welcome that. Having referred to such a cross-party consensus, I must deny  rumours that my colleague Mr Shannon is locked up in a room, tied to a chair. However,  I see his constituency colleague Mr Hamilton hovering somewhat vulture-like, so  I hope that he is not here as Mr Shannon&rsquo;s representative. He seems to be  washing his hands of that element. There is much to be welcomed in the Bill,  but there is also a lot of complexity. Therefore, I believe that it merits a  lot of scrutiny.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Chairperson has mentioned the RSPB, and that is the key  environmental group with respect to the legislation. I met some RSPB  representatives yesterday to discuss some of the detail of the Bill. I should  declare an interest, as my father, Jim Weir, was a founder member of the RSPB  in Northern Ireland.  He was a member of the pre-existing Ulster Society for the Protection of Birds  when it merged with the RSPB. Perhaps, therefore, I come to the issue with a  degree of bias.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The RSPB has highlighted that some detail will have to be  teased out. Mention has been made of the curlew and how it is treated and  whether it should be included in schedule 1 or schedule 2. There are also  questions around the level of protection that there needs to be around  shooting, and a lot of good work has been done with the British Association for  Shooting and Conservation. The slight complication with that is that not all  groups have signed up to it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Further examination and work needs to be done on a range of  issues, such as with schedule 9 and the issues of non-native species and  temporary stop notices. Although some very welcome protections are offered  through ASSIs, there are questions about the level of protection that can be  offered to areas that fall outside that classification. I understand that the  RSPB and departmental officials are due to meet reasonably soon, and I am  confident that those are elements of detail that can be ironed out.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I was heartened by the approach taken by departmental  officials. The Committee received a very useful briefing at our last meeting in  which it was indicated that each side is keen that there is flexibility, to  ensure that all the details are got right. That may mean tweaking the  legislation or it may mean that we have to consider having subordinate  legislation to deal with certain areas.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although there are elements of detail to be ironed out, the  broad thrust of the Bill is very welcome. I congratulate the Department on bringing  it forward. Providing that level of protection to our wildlife in Northern Ireland, particularly our bird  population, will preserve the best of Northern Ireland for generations to  come. We have all grown up with that level of opportunity. I know that the  Minister has had a strong connection with the countryside throughout his life,  but one of my concerns is that as we move increasingly towards a more sedentary  family lifestyle, the opportunity for people to connect with nature and the  rural community seems to be missing. That is an important link that has been  eroded in our society. We have to preserve the best of our countryside in a  sensible fashion so that the opportunity to connect with nature is preserved  for future generations, and that is what is proposed in the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  Will the Member join me in congratulating the &lsquo;Belfast Telegraph&rsquo; on its recent  publication that showed birds of Northern Ireland? That is of great  educational value, not only to our young people, but to people who appreciate  rural and country life.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  welcome anything that increases our connection with nature. I am sure that the  Member liked looking at the pictures. It is important that our knowledge of  nature is deepened.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Whether such knowledge comes from the &lsquo;Belfast Telegraph&rsquo;  or publications from the National Trust or another organisation, it should be  embraced. It is very much in keeping with the spirit of the Bill, and the House  should unite in welcoming it. I urge Members to support the Bill.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Boylan</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Ba mhaith liom labhairt i bhfabhar  an Bhille.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will speak in favour of the Bill. One would think that Mr  Wells is a bird, given the way that he has just flown into the Chamber. Sinn  F&eacute;in welcomes the Wildlife and Natural Environment Bill and looks forward to  the RSPB&rsquo;s contribution to the Bill process. The Bill will complement and  enhance existing legislation to ensure the protection of our habitats and  wildlife in the North. Thus, it is crucial that the new legislation is  comprehensive, fit for purpose and that it meets future challenges.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Changes must be made to the Bill to ensure that it provides  protection to wildlife and that it is compliant with relevant European directives.  Given the inclusion of a duty to further the conservation of biodiversity, we  must ensure that proper guidance is issued to enable public bodies to conserve  and protect our indigenous species of flora and fauna and habitats. The  introduction of any biodiversity strategy is vital and must ensure the  conservation of our species. However, surely that will be achieved only if  important species are identified through the provision of proper research,  which will ultimately ensure their protection.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As the Chairperson said, the Committee recently saw, at  first hand, the project to reintroduce the red kite to the North, and we hope  that it is a success. However, other bird species that are under severe threat  must be protected through proper monitoring. In particular, the curlew should  be included in schedule 1 under the specialist penalties provision. Several  other species that are declining in number should be considered for inclusion  in the Bill to ensure the recovery of their population. You will be glad to  hear that I am not going to read out lists of birds that require protection,  but we will have a chance to examine those in more detail during the Committee  Stage of the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in believes that, to protect our wild birds, animals  and plant life, appropriate measures should be in place to deal with people who  damage or harm our natural environment and wildlife. We welcome the suggestion  that amendments should be made in respect of the offences clauses. We also  support a complete ban on the use of snares, and I am disappointed that clause  10 falls short of that. Snares are not target specific, and any animal,  including domestic pets, livestock and protected species, such as the Irish  hare, can fall victim to them. In many instances, snares result in prolonged  periods of pain and suffering for the trapped animal. The aim of the Bill  should be to protect and sustain our wildlife. Therefore, it should seek to  introduce more humane methods of control and address undue nuisances,  especially to farm livestock.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I support the introduction of mechanisms for the management  of wild deer in the North. Measures are needed to prevent incidents involving  damage to property and our natural heritage and threats to public safety, such  as last year&rsquo;s incident in Camlough. However, it should be borne in mind that  wildlife viewing is a much-loved recreation activity, and we must seek to  strike a balance. The welfare of animals must be a factor and, therefore, the  type of damage that warrants the destruction of an animal must be clearly  defined.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Hundreds of deer are culled lawfully and humanely each year  to keep numbers down in order to stop damage to farms. However, many more are  being killed cruelly by poachers who seek to sell the meat on the black market.  Apart from the cruelty and illegality, what concerns me most is that many of  those deer may be diseased or contaminated. There are no controls, and people  do not know what they are eating when they buy meat from unscrupulous poachers.  I support the principles of the Bill and look forward to the scrutiny at  Committee Stage.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kinahan</strong>:  I, too, am very pleased to speak on such an important Bill. We all need to find  a balance between how we live with nature in the countryside, and how we manage  our existence. At a meeting last night, I was intrigued to hear that, in 1906,  people struggled to work out how to prevent flax effluent from entering our  rivers and destroying them. Therefore, it is not as though this issue is new;  it is something that we have long been trying to deal with and learning about.  We need to set up a dynamic system, as this Bill does extremely well, so that  we review constantly how we strike a balance and how to best live in the  countryside.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the Bill, which tidies up rather ancient laws. I  was double-jobbing the other day; perhaps those Bills are antiques, although  they are not worth anything. The Bill tidies up many areas. First, it places a  duty on all public bodies to conserve diversity. Secondly, it places a duty on  the Department to produce a biodiversity strategy. There is much more in the  Bill, but I will not go into it in great detail. I am very happy to be a member  of the Environment Committee.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Earlier in the parliamentary year, I spoke about the  Forestry Bill. It is extremely important that the Department and Committee  speak regularly to stakeholders. We should continually talk to all who know  better than us so that we ensure a dynamic flow of information. I am not asking  for a quango, but we should use the experts.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have received an extremely good document from the RSPB,  about which all Members have spoken. It is an excellent brief, and we will  receive many more briefs from other bodies. I too will highlight the case of  the curlew. When I was small, I remember my mother pointing out the call of the  curlew. I have not heard it since then. I was 10 years old at that time, so it  is 40 years since I have heard a curlew on any land on which I have stood. We  need to ensure that the curlew is protected.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We also need to take up the RSPB&rsquo;s point on the need to  explain the biodiversity duty and what it means. We need to look continually at  the placing of wildlife in the right schedules, as I have already touched on  with the curlew. We need to listen continually. In that respect, however, there  are lots of terms that need clarification, such as &ldquo;native&rdquo;, &ldquo;non-native&rdquo;,  &ldquo;wild&rdquo; and &ldquo;wild state&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I declare an interest because I farm a very small herd of  deer. They are not wild in that they are not free to go wherever they want, but  they are of a wild state because one cannot corner them to deal with them. A  sharpshooter is needed to shoot them. They are then taken to a butcher. &ldquo;Wild&rdquo;  and &ldquo;wild state&rdquo; need to be defined, and that is the case in many more areas.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  That is cruel.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kinahan</strong>:  Thank you very much. It would be cruel if I tried to shoot them because most of  Templepatrick would be gone before I hit a deer.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When we are looking at the names of certain species, it is  easy for all of us. Many of us will know the birds. However, when it comes to  plants, how many Members know what a green figwort, or scrophularia umbrosa,  is? There are many more such terms in the Bill, so there is a strong need for  education. We had an idea of including photographs because there is a lot of  education that needs to go alongside the Bill. It is all very well to place the  duty on government and local councils, but we need to educate the general  public. Those terms and names need to be understood fully.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the extra provisions on areas of special  scientific interest (ASSI), particularly the need to know who owns the areas.  When someone moves on, we need to know who the next owner is. Ignorance is not  an excuse. However, I plead that, whatever we set up, we do it softly. Liaison  groups have been established, and we should talk as best we can to the people  who are on the ground and live in those areas. For example, on a National Trust  estate on the border, there is a plant called the sally, which I believe is a  form of salix, or willow. It is totally taking over all of the lakes because it  is protected and cannot be cut back. We do not want to have to wait five years  to get permission. We need to set up a dynamic system so that we can alter  things within that five-year period.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We need to continue, and I will keep making the point,  talking to all the groups that know. I welcome the annulment of Crown immunity.  Although appointing wildlife inspectors is a good idea, I query where we are  going with them and how. Allowing inspectors to enter premises and take samples  is fine as long as there is a means for the people who own the land, and  others, to work well with them and get reparation for any damage that might be  done.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We need to work out where the PSNI is with this. On the one  occasion that I had to deal with the PSNI, when a deer was lost, I could not  find anyone who even knew what a deer looks like. Presently, only one PSNI  officer is trained to deal with wildlife; we will need many more. Therefore, to  ensure that the Bill can work throughout Northern Ireland, we need to look  at training.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the clause on penalties: the six-month custodial  sentence and fines. However, in England,  there was a case in which a whole wood &mdash; five acres &mdash; of bluebells was stolen  in one night and sold for profit. Therefore, the fines should potentially be  extremely large. Nonetheless, the other day in the Committee for the  Environment, we learned that when the Northern Ireland Environment Agency  (NIEA) is successful in collecting a fine, the money goes to the Treasury. We  should try to find a way to hold such money in Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I, too, will mention snares. I do not like the idea of  unnecessary suffering, particularly suffering for 24 hours. If your leg is in a  trap, your suffering is unnecessary from the moment it is in it. We should look  at whether to ban snaring or to introduce strict licensing. Although there are  other ways to deal with foxes, they all pose similar problems. I welcome the  fact that there will be six new offences, and I welcome the idea of  controlling. However, I query whether we will have the resources, funding and  ability to enforce them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">To return to my original point, much education is needed  and we must keep talking to each other. I welcome much in the Bill, but we need  a mechanism for flexibility. The Ulster Unionist Party supports the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Given that Question Time is due to commence at 3.00 pm, Members  should take their ease until then. After Question Time, Mr Ford will be the  first Member to speak.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The debate stood suspended.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">3.00 pm</p>
    <p class="OralWrittenAnswersHeading"><a name="5"></a>Oral Answers to Questions</p>
    <p class="H3SectionHeading">Social Development</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Pension Credit</p>
    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">1. <strong>Mr  McCallister </strong>asked the Minister for Social Development what steps her  Department is taking to ensure that all eligible pensioners are claiming  pension credit.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 561/10<a name="AQO561/10" id="AQO561/10"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development (Ms Ritchie)</strong>: I share the Member&rsquo;s desire to ensure that  everyone entitled to a benefit receives it. My Department provides a range of  services to make people aware of their pension entitlements, including outreach  services; participation in local promotional activity; the production of  specific publications, some in minority ethnic languages, on the Department for  Social Development (DSD) and Northern Ireland Housing Executive (NIHE)  websites; a new online benefits adviser service; and general assistance with  advice and information through our network of local and centralised offices.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In respect of state pension credit, a new, enhanced  telephone claims system that is now in operation results in about 90% of claims  being taken by telephone, without the need for people to complete paper  application forms. When an applicant calls to make a claim for state pension,  they are asked whether they would like to find out more about pension credit.  If interested, they are transferred to a dedicated state pension claim line. In  addition, the savings threshold for state pension credit was increased from  &pound;6,000 to &pound;10,000 in November 2009. People already getting state pension credit  had their award automatically adjusted. I also issued a news release to raise  awareness of that change.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On top of those services, a targeted approach to benefit  uptake was introduced in 2005. About 50,000 invitations have been issued to  older people, offering a benefit assessment through the advice sector; 250,000  mailshots have been sent out to raise awareness of state pension credit; and by  June 2009, those exercises had generated an additional &pound;22&middot;4 million in payment  of annual benefit and arrears. The 2009-2010 benefit uptake programme has  provided almost 20,000 older people with potential entitlement to state pension  credit and the opportunity of a benefit assessment through Citizens Advice. In  addition, a new outreach approach commenced in late November, focusing on  ensuring that older people are aware of their potential entitlement across four  council areas with a high older population but a relatively low uptake of the  main pensioner benefits.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The answer to the question: &ldquo;What are we doing?&rdquo; is &ldquo;Quite  a lot.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I am grateful to the Minister for her reply. With pension credits being linked  to cold weather payments, is the Minister content that the system is effective  in meeting one of her stated aims of tackling fuel poverty and helping those  most in need, particularly given the weather that we have had over such a  prolonged period?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: The Member is absolutely correct. There is a need to  tackle fuel poverty on an ongoing basis, and there are two financial mechanisms  in the benefits system to deal with that issue. The first is the age-specific  winter fuel payments, which are paid automatically to pensioners.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Cold weather payments are a different type of benefit. They  are triggered when the Met Office&rsquo;s observation sites, of which there are about  seven in Northern Ireland, tell us that there has been a temperature of zero or  below for seven consecutive days. To qualify for that payment, a person must  have been receiving state pension credit, income support, jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance  or employment and support allowance for one day in the period of cold weather.  They must also have one of the following: a relevant pensioner or disability  premium; child tax credit, which is not relevant to the Member&rsquo;s question; a  child under five years old; and an applicable amount of employment and support  allowance that includes the support or the work-related activity components.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is interesting that we were able to give &pound;12&middot;5 million  in cold weather payments over the past three weeks to 166,000 people throughout  Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Those payments are over and above the age-specific winter  fuel payments. Therefore, in summation, we are satisfied that we are tackling  fuel poverty through those financial mechanisms. However, if Mr McCallister  knows of specific cases among his constituents, he can refer them to me, and I  will be more than happy to have those cases investigated.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. The Minister referred to support  being given to advice centres to help people with benefit uptake, mainly pension  credit. Will she give details of additional support that her Department will  give to advice centres, which are dealing with a wide range of benefits,  because they are under increasing pressure to deal with the volume of traffic  that they are experiencing as a result of the current economic climate?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I am conscious of the good work that is undertaken by  the advice service network, whether that be citizens advice bureaux, Advice NI  or Members&rsquo; constituency offices. We provide continuous up-to-date information  to people who require benefit advice. In fact, financial assistance has been  provided to citizens advice bureaux to undertake the benefit uptake programme  for us, and carries out that much-needed benefit assessment check, which  enables people to find out to what other benefits they are entitled.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I heard a representative from Age Concern Help the Aged NI  speak about the issue recently &mdash; on &lsquo;The Stephen Nolan Show&rsquo;, I think &mdash; and I  must say that, in addition to ongoing benefit uptake programmes, a new online  benefits adviser service allows people to check anonymously to find out whether  they, or a family member, could be entitled to claim for additional benefits.  That service can be accessed wherever the Internet is available, and people can  contact those advice centres and other offices, such as the Social Security  Agency, by telephone, by calling in or by having a pension adviser call at  their home to assist them with the type of benefit to which they should be  entitled.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I assure Members that I share their concern and desire to  ensure that everyone who is entitled to a benefit should receive that benefit.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  I acknowledge the good work that the Minister&rsquo;s Department is doing to get the  information out to people who are entitled to claim. However, a problem has  emerged for senior citizens during the recent spell of cold weather. They have  worked hard all their lives, and they have put a few bob extra away, and, as a  result, they are not entitled to the cold weather payment. Does the Minister  have any sympathy for those people, quite a few of whom are caught in that  trap? Does the Minister have any intention of doing anything about that?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I assure the Member that I have every sympathy with  elderly people, particularly pensioners, who have had to deal with the  extremely cold weather conditions over the past three weeks. They have felt in  a very acute way the pernicious effects of such cold.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The regulations under which cold weather payments are  prescribed are dealt with under parity legislation with Britain. I have  been in constant contact with my opposite numbers in the Department for Work  and Pensions in Britain,  because, as Members are only too aware, the money for social security benefits  is channelled through annually managed expenditure, comes directly from London and is not part of the Northern Ireland block grant. I  have talked to ministerial predecessors in that Department about the need to  upgrade winter fuel payments and cold weather payments. I have also been  talking to the current incumbents in that Department to ensure that they know  that we have a higher cost of living in Northern Ireland and that people have  had to deal with very difficult weather conditions over the past number of  weeks.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Naturally, I will come back to the House if there is any  change as a result of those representations.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Question 2 has been withdrawn.</p>
    <p class="H5StageHeading">Employment and Support Allowance</p>
    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">3. <strong>Mr A  Maskey </strong>asked the Minister for Social Development for an update on the  review of the administration of employment and support allowance.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 563/10<a name="AQO563/10" id="AQO563/10"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: The House has debated the administration of the  employment and support allowance on at least two occasions. The most recent was  30 November 2009, when I agreed to review the administration of the employment  and support allowance (ESA), which my Department has been doing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Members will be aware that the ESA is subject to the  principle of social security parity with Britain. That principle applies not  only to social security policy, but extends to procedures and general  administration, including having a common computer system. Although parity is  advantageous to Northern Ireland,  in that Britain  contributes to the annual &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Excuse me, Minister. Someone in the Chamber has a mobile phone  switched on, which could interfere with the recording system.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: For the sake of clarity, I will repeat what I just  said: although parity is advantageous to Northern   Ireland, in that Britain  contributes to the annual shortfall in the Northern   Ireland insurance fund, it limits Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  ability to make local changes to systems and procedures. Nonetheless, my  Department is conducting a review, so that, wherever possible, we can revise  the operating procedures in the ESA centre.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Some changes have already been made to improve how the  benefit is administered. Those changes, which include the introduction of  safeguard visits for vulnerable customers, the provision of interim payments,  revised telephony scripts, and arrangements to pay the contributory element of  the ESA claims first, have improved performance and the overall service that is  provided to the vast majority of customers.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On both occasions when the Assembly debated the  introduction of the ESA, it recognised the excellent progress that staff in the  ESA centre have made in introducing the new benefit and the associated  technology. Following the most recent debate on 30 November 2009, I sent a  letter to Members with a detailed response to concerns that they had raised. I  also wrote to Members inviting them to visit the ESA centre at James House. All  of that gives Members information on issues that were raised during the  previous debate. I hope that Members who have concerns will be able to take up  that opportunity to visit the ESA centre.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although I am pleased with the progress that has been made  to date, it is clear that a number of challenges remain to be overcome before  the new benefit has bedded in fully. The areas of the administration of the ESA  that my Department can affect positively will continue to be subject to review,  with improvements implemented accordingly. I assure Members that my officials  will continue to work closely with their colleagues in the Department for Work  and Pensions in London  to further improve the processes, procedures and systems that are used to  administer the ESA.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank Minister Ritchie for her  response and for her assurances to the House. Will she give further assurances  that in the ongoing improvement of the service, focused attention will be paid  continually to the needs of vulnerable members of society, particularly those  who have mental-health difficulties, such as people who suffer from autism?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank the Member for his supplementary question. My  Department is engaged in continuous and ongoing improvement of the service.  There has been sustained progress in the delivery of the ESA, with significant  improvements in the level of service that is provided in such key areas as  telephony, fresh-claims processing, handling medical evidence, and carrying out  medical examinations, with particular relevance to people who suffer from  autism.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That has been a pertinent issue during the past number of  months. I have met the National Autistic Society. I have heard clearly its  concerns, to which I am particularly sympathetic. My Department will deal with  each of those issues in a sensitive, sympathetic manner. Our most important aim  is to help people.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I note that on the previous two occasions when the Assembly  debated those issues, which were raised, by and large, by the Member&rsquo;s party,  the Member himself did not raise particular issues. My Department is happy to  keep the matter under review.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  Given the anticipated additional pressure that will be put on the  administration of the employment and support allowance as a result of changes  that stem from the welfare reform Bill, what assurance can the Minister give  the House and, more importantly, the people outside the Chamber, that the  system will be able to cope with the additional pressure that may result from  the Bill?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I assure the Member that we will keep the projected and  anticipated workload under review. Should additional resources be required, I  would like to think that the Member, as Chairperson of the Social Development  Committee, will be able to use his good offices with the Minister of Finance  and make the necessary representations on our behalf.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her full series of answers. Is she content that the  objectives of the policy are sound and that those issues surrounding the  administration of the employment and support allowance will be addressed?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: The Member raises two particular issues. Naturally, the  legislation was originally devised in Westminster.  Under parity legislation, we simply translated it here. The purpose of ESA is  to help people with an illness or disability to move into work rather than  remain on benefits. I appreciate that many people who are ill will not be able  to progress into work. However, I assure Members that we treat every case with  a great level of sympathy and sensitivity, particularly as many of the people  who come to us have a mental illness or some other type of debilitating  illness.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  We all acknowledge the review of ESA, and it is encouraging to hear that that  is ongoing. With regard to the Social Security Agency in general, will the  Minister tell us something about targets, particularly the administrative and  performance targets that relate to the provision of benefits for the people in Northern Ireland?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank Mr Gallagher for his question. I am fully aware  of his particular concerns about ESA, as he has made several representations to  me on behalf of constituents in Fermanagh and South Tyrone. The Social Security  Agency has delivered excellent performance since I took up office in May 2007.  During that period, the agency faced a particularly challenging environment,  including the introduction of the ESA benefit and the implementation of major  improvements to the way in which services are provided to pensioners. Those,  and other achievements, have been delivered against a loss of 674 staff between  2005-06 and 2007-08 and the requirement to deliver further savings of 5% a year  arising from the 2008 Budget settlement, which equates to a reduction of &pound;53&middot;2  million across the three-year period to March 2011.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Despite those challenges, performance has continued to  improve year on year. The end of 2008-09 saw losses through fraud and error  reduced to 1&middot;2% of expenditure, their lowest level yet; five out of six main  benefits met their financial accuracy targets; all of the six main benefits met  challenging clearance time targets; and the number of complaints received by  the agency maintained its downward trend on the previous year. That performance  has been delivered against the economic downturn, which has led to a dramatic  increase in the demand for the agency&rsquo;s services, particularly claims for  jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The agency has consistently delivered excellent performance  year on year and continues to build on its remarkable achievements delivered to  date. I have every confidence that the agency will strive to deal with the  challenges that lie ahead, while maintaining its high levels of performance and  quality of service for people.</p>
    <p class="H5StageHeading">Social Housing: Laurencetown and Gilford</p>
    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">4. <strong>Mr  O&rsquo;Dowd </strong>asked the Minister for Social Development what action her Department  is taking to provide affordable social housing in Laurencetown and Gilford, County Down.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 564/10<a name="AQO564/10" id="AQO564/10"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: The most recent housing needs assessment carried out by  the Housing Executive for Laurencetown and Gilford identified no intensity of  need over the next five years. The housing need in both locations is, to quite  an extent, being managed through the re-letting of existing homes. It would,  therefore, be inappropriate to divert the housing development programme from  other areas in which the need is much greater. In September last year, for  example, only nine applicants in Gilford were in housing stress, but an average  of 15 homes are re-let in the area every year. In Laurencetown, it is a similar  story; six applicants were in housing stress and, on average, four homes become  available through re-letting each year.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am conscious that the figures do not always tell the full  story, and that is why the Housing Executive will periodically undertake latent  demand testing to determine whether there is an emerging need. During 2008,  Laurencetown was subject to a latent demand test, but that simply confirmed  that there was insufficient need to consider building new homes. The situation  is, of course, kept under review, and, if Mr O&rsquo;Dowd has information to the  contrary, I would be happy to receive it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In both areas, affordable housing is supported through the  co-ownership scheme, irrespective of social need. Any such applications would  need to fulfil the conditions set down for co-ownership.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for her  answer. The figures that she gave come as no surprise to me, but she will be  aware of many debates in the Chamber on the needs of rural communities,  including housing. As a local representative for the area, I find that many  families and individuals do not put their names down for housing in those  areas. They believe that there is no point in doing so because there are no  houses available there. Even when latent demand tests are carried out, that has  a knock-on effect, and the elderly in particular subsequently move on to  Banbridge.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Does the Minister not agree that we must revise how we  measure the latent demand for housing in rural communities? Unless we dispel  the view that there is no point in putting one&rsquo;s name down for housing in rural  communities, there will be a knock-on effect of no new houses being built.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: The Member rightly refers to the chicken-and-egg  situation associated with housing need in rural communities. The same situation  often applies to urban communities, too. We are analysing the definition of  need to determine how it could be redefined. The Member raised with me the  issue of the rural cottages programme in the greater Lurgan area, and I  recently wrote to him on foot of his correspondence to me.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As part of the whole debate about the social housing  development programme, the Member will be aware that the provision of housing  in rural areas is on the list of what I would like to do if I had the money.  The dogs in the street know that housing faces a financial shortfall. If Mr  O&rsquo;Dowd wants more resources to address housing need in the rural community, he  should push the Executive, especially ministerial colleagues in his party, to  put housing on a sound financial footing once and for all and to decouple it  from the whole debate about capital receipts.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her answer. Will she confirm that the Housing  Executive, through some of the housing associations, expressed an interest in  the sale of the former police station in Gilford? Will she also indicate in  more general terms what level of investment is planned for the Upper Bann area this year and over the next three years?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I will investigate the case in relation to the site at  Gilford and come back to the Member on that. The current programme for the year  ending 31 March 2010 contains 11 separate housing schemes. The total number of  dwellings is 191, and DSD&rsquo;s potential investment is &pound;16 million.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Of course, not all of those schemes are guaranteed to start  this year because a number of reasons could delay their delivery. However, any  of the schemes that cannot be delivered this year will automatically be rolled  forward into next year&rsquo;s programme so that, in effect, they will not be lost.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the next number of weeks, I hope to be able to publish  the social housing development programme for the next three years. We have been  building, and hope to build this year, more houses than we have ever built in any  single year for the past decade. Set against the economic downturn, we are  working an economic miracle through the social housing development programme.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Savage</strong>:  How many applicants are on the Housing Executive waiting list in the Banbridge  area, and how many of those cases are related to housing stress?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I do not have that information to hand, but I assure  the Member that I will check that out later today and write to him. The most  important action is to secure the necessary resources to accommodate the  housing needs, particularly the social housing needs, of all the people of Northern Ireland.  Once and for all, we want to put the social housing programme on a sound  financial footing and decouple it from capital receipts. I will come back to Mr  Savage in writing on the figures for Banbridge.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Questions 5 and 6 have been withdrawn. The Members who were to ask  questions 7 and 8 are not in their places. Question 9 has been withdrawn. The  Members who were to ask questions 10 and 11 are not in their places. I call Mr  McClarty. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McClarty</strong>:  I suppose it would be an anticlimax if I say that I have forgotten what I was  going to have to say &mdash; question number 12. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
    <p class="H5StageHeading">Fuel Poverty</p>
    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">12. <strong>Mr McClarty </strong>asked the Minister for Social Development what steps her Department has  taken to help people suffering from fuel poverty during the recent prolonged  cold spell.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 572/10<a name="AQO572/10" id="AQO572/10"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: In addition to the winter fuel payments that are paid  to people who are aged 60 or over at a rate of &pound;250 and to people who are aged  80 or over at a rate of &pound;400, my Department has, to date, made arrangements to  issue three separate cold weather payments of &pound;25 each to all qualifying  customers, regardless of age. In total, approximately 166,000 people will  benefit from the cold weather payment scheme.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As well as providing heating and insulation measures, the  warm homes scheme provides advice on maximising household income by ensuring  that vulnerable people are claiming all the benefits to which they are  entitled. For the first time, working tax credit is a qualifying benefit for  both heating and insulation measures, and the over-60 age restriction for  heating measures has been removed. More than &pound;118 million has been spent on  making in excess of 71,000 households warmer. I have no doubt that all Members  will agree that that has provided magnificent help to people throughout Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McClarty</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her response and for all the work that she has done  over recent weeks to help people to cover the extra cost of their heating to  keep their homes warm. Will she advise the House whether geographical areas  determine the conditions for who qualifies for the allowance?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: There are several geographical areas, which are  dictated by the local meteorological stations, of which there are around seven  in Northern Ireland.  The extreme nature of the cold weather conditions in the past three weeks has meant  that every meteorological station in Northern Ireland triggered the need  for the cold weather payment because temperatures were at or below 0&deg;C for  seven consecutive days. Therefore, there was no difference to the payment  geographically in Northern Ireland.  However, there might be a difference this week, because I am led to believe  that snow is falling in certain areas.</p>

    <p class="H4StageHeading">Wildlife and Natural Environment Bill</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Second Stage</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Debate resumed on motion:</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That the Second Stage of the Wildlife and Natural Environment  Bill [NIA 5/09] be agreed. &mdash; <span class="Italic">[The Minister of the  Environment (Mr Poots).]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: It  is a pleasure to take part in this debate and to welcome the Second Stage of the  Bill. I want to talk about three key areas that the Minister of the Environment  mentioned in his introduction: the biodiversity duty; the updating of the  Wildlife (Northern Ireland)  Order 1985; and the updating of the Environment (Northern Ireland) Order 2002, as  far as it relates to areas of special scientific interest (ASSIs) &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. If Members wish to carry on private conversations, they  must do so outside the confines of the Chamber.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>:  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I was frightened that the Minister might miss my  pearls of wisdom, and his officials are seated even further away.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The development of a duty to promote the biodiversity  strategy must be welcomed as an obligation on all public bodies. Although the Bill  spells out certain aspects of that, it is unclear how the overarching strategy  will be carried through into a specific programme and, indeed, what efforts  will be made by the Department or others to ensure that all public bodies live  up to their obligations in that respect. Although that is welcome as a basic  introduction, I am not sure that the Bill goes as far as equivalent legislation  in other UK  jurisdictions. We may wish to visit the precise detail of that point as we go  through the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Wildlife (Northern Ireland) Order 1985, which  is clearly 25 years out of date, is in serious need of updating. There is an  issue of principle relating to the schedules, in which different species are  listed, about whether there should be a mechanism for updating by Order rather  than primary legislation being required to make every necessary amendment. The  Minister referred to a re-examination of the legislation every five years, but  surely he does not expect the Assembly to seek primary legislation every five years  to deal with that issue. However, we are currently stuck with that mechanism.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Departmental officials told the Committee for the  Environment that the Minister was considering a total ban on snares as opposed  to the detailed proposals, over a number of clauses, which relate to  regulations on the use of snares. The Minister&rsquo;s current proposals to continue  to allow snares do not address significant disquiet among people who are  concerned with environmental matters. If, as is the case, we are told that it is  merely the representation of the Ulster Farmers&rsquo; Union&rsquo;s concerns about foxes  at lambing time, many people will not believe that to be an adequate excuse for  allowing the continued use of snares all year round, given the effect that  snares can have on a number of species, whether or not they are the designated  targets, and on domestic animals.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There will be robust discussion about whether an overall  ban might be more appropriate. If there is an argument that is solely concerned  with foxes at lambing season, primary legislation might be required to spell  that out to ensure that snares are not used on other species and at times other  than the springtime, when there may be concern. We look forward to seeing some  way to address the current indiscriminate use of snares with all the  accompanying animal welfare concerns.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is positive that the proposals to update the schedules  refer to the golden eagle being included. That will be of major interest to  Members such as my friend Jim Wells, who is probably one of the few Members who  has seen golden eagles nesting in County   Donegal. It is, however,  surprising that the golden eagle will be included but that protection is not  being offered to the red kite, whether through a specific programme to  reintroduce it to Northern Ireland  or through the hoped-for movement of eagles from Donegal to Northern Ireland.  Other raptors are similarly in need of protection. Therefore, although I  suspect that the principle in the Bill is correct, others species may need to  be considered.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The RSPB, among others, has noted a number of species of  wader that it believes need increased protection, specifically curlews,  lapwings and redshanks, all of which are in major difficulties compared with  their position a few years ago. That is why it is necessary to look at a way to  update the schedules without requiring primary legislation. It will be  interesting to hear from the Minister whether he sees that as a possibility or  benefit.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I noted with interest and significant concern that the  Minister repeated arguments made by his predecessor in the first Assembly, Mr  Sam Foster, about not doing anything to enhance the protection of the Irish  hare, even though he spoke about the specific needs of the Irish hare and the  species action plan being up for revision this year.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In one of the last acts of the Assembly in its first guise,  an amendment was passed, against the wishes of the Environment Minister, to the  Game Preservation (Amendment) Bill that was before the House. That amendment  sought to enhance the protection of the Irish hare, if only on a temporary  basis. That clearly showed a strong wish in this Chamber that the Irish hare  should be granted higher protection than it receives at present and that there  must be a real need to see that it is moved to schedule 5. It is utterly  lacking in logic that one of the few species for which there is a specific  species action plan is not granted the full protection of the Wildlife (Northern Ireland)  Order 1985, and it is again not proposed to enhance that protection. We tested  this issue before on a limited basis under the game preservation legislation.  The Minister will need to heed evidence that will undoubtedly come in from a  range of environmental and conservation organisations and heed the wishes of  the House. Unfortunately, I did not have time to check the voting records at  the Further Consideration Stage of that Bill in 2001. It may even have been the  case that a then DUP Back-Bencher, Mr Poots, was in the substantial majority  that sought to enhance the protection of the Irish hare on that occasion. I  will look up the Hansard report with interest to see how Members voted when  they had the opportunity to enhance protection for the hare.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Hares are most at risk as a result of habitat destruction,  and the Minister is right to highlight that. However, it is also entirely reasonable  to recognise that illegal coursing and other sorts of trapping and hunting are  also relevant and justify the fullest protection for hares. In that context, it  is good that the Bill proposes significant enhancements to the enforcement  powers that would be used against those who would engage in wildlife crime and  to ensure that legislation does not permit loopholes to allow people to escape  prosecution.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am concerned that the amendments proposed to the  Environment (Northern    Ireland) Order 2002, which replaced three  Bills that were before the Assembly when it was suspended, provide for only  limited improvements to the management of ASSIs and to the duties of public  bodies. Other ASSI issues need to be addressed. The Order that went through Westminster was less than  satisfactory and would not have met the requirements and wishes of the  Committee that was considering that Bill at the time of suspension.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">This is the opportunity to enhance the protection of ASSIs  significantly, not merely to make some modest changes to the duties of public  bodies. The Committee and the House will have to consider seriously the  question of amendments to strengthen those powers, since it is unlikely that we  will get any further opportunity to deal with the matter in the coming years.  Those powers must be strengthened in order to have the highest possible  standards of maintenance of ASSIs.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is also a matter of regret that tree preservation  orders, which were tied into the Environment (Northern Ireland) Order 2002, have  been ignored completely at this stage, even though they would fall entirely  within the principles of the Bill and even though it was the wish of the  Environment Committee to address the issue on that occasion. I remind the  Minister that William McCrea and I sought to make a significant enhancement to  what the Department was proposing under the tree preservation legislation.  William McCrea is a party colleague of the Minister&rsquo;s and a constituency  colleague of mine, and he was the Chairperson of the Environment Committee at  that time. If that enhancement could be seen to be within the remit of the  Bill, it may also have to be considered. However, that is a slightly technical  point at this stage.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On behalf of my colleagues, I welcome the introduction of  the Bill as a first step. However, considerable work is still to be done to  make it the best possible Bill.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Social Development (Mr Hamilton)</strong>: If any Member is as  bewildered as I am as to why the Chairperson of the Social Development Committee  is speaking on wildlife issues, I will do my best to explain in the next few  moments.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Given the Minister&rsquo;s comments and those of the Chairperson  of the Environment Committee, the House is aware already that the Department of  the Environment is responsible for the game laws in Northern Ireland. Those laws  regulate the taking, killing and selling of game, and they provide for the  prevention of poaching. However, the game licensing system is administered in Northern Ireland by the Department for Social  Development under the Miscellaneous Transferred Excise Duties Act (Northern Ireland)  1972. Persons wishing to kill or deal in game require a licence, and, in the  latter case, they require a certificate from a Magistrate&rsquo;s Court. It is  understood that, in August 2007, DEFRA abolished its licensing system for  killing game or dealing in game in England  and Wales.  It was considered that the game licence no longer served a useful purpose, and,  given today&rsquo;s comprehensive food standards and the legislation that covers the  hygiene aspects of game, there was no justification for requiring retailers to  hold a game dealer&rsquo;s licence.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At its meeting on 4 October 2007, the Committee for Social  Development considered the proposal from the Minister for Social Development to  abolish the existing game licensing system in Northern Ireland. The Committee was  content for the Department of the Environment to consult on Minister Ritchie&rsquo;s  proposal, but it agreed to consider the matter further when the result of the  public consultation became known. Following that consultation, responses to  which were generally favourable, the Committee agreed on 18 May 2009 that it  had no objection to the Minister&rsquo;s intention to make legislative provision for  the abolition of the game licensing system in Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">To summarise, the Committee has no objections to the  provisions in the Wildlife and Natural Environment Bill, specifically those at  clause 31, which will abolish game licences and game dealers&rsquo; licenses in Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McKay</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I echo what other Members said and stress that it is  important that all legislation protecting Irish habitats and wildlife is fit  for purpose. This is an opportunity to enhance that protection.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As someone who has seen a basking shark up close &mdash; not too  close &mdash; off the coast of Rathlin Island, I  welcome clause 9, which will create a new offence by prohibiting anyone from  intentionally or recklessly disturbing a basking shark. Basking sharks are an  important element of the marine environment off the north coast of Antrim.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As my colleague Cathal Boylan outlined, Sinn F&eacute;in notes  proposals to strengthen legislation on snares. Indeed, I raised that issue with  the Minister only a couple of months ago. My party believes that snares should  be outlawed altogether, and I look forward to deliberating on clause 10 during  the Bill&rsquo;s Committee Stage. Some groups may foresee difficulties in enforcing  the proposals in that clause, so it will be important to address those concerns.  I welcome the comments that Members from other parties made about snaring.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The negative animal welfare impact of snaring far outweighs  any argument to retain snares as a form of predator control. Snares are  indiscriminate and often capture animals that they are not intended for, such  as domestic pets, farm animals and protected wild animals. A complete end to  the use of snares will end the suffering of animals that are caught but are not  the target, and it will be far easier for the Department to enforce.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">3.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We should also take into account the fact that snares  capture European-protected species as well as schedule 5 species, the trapping  or killing of which is illegal. It is quite clear that there is a lot of work  to be done on clause 10, and I look forward to deliberating on that aspect of  the Bill in Committee.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Obviously, the Wildlife Order 1985 needs updating. The  Committee should also look closely at the inclusion of certain species in the  schedules. An opportunity exists to enhance the protection of birds that are  under severe threat, such as the curlew, lapwing and redshank. Other species of  bird, such as the peregrine, osprey and red kite, reuse the same nest sites  and, as other Members have pointed out, they are at risk if their traditional  nests are damaged. Those species should therefore be added to the list of birds  whose nests should be protected on a year-round basis. I agree with  Chairperson&rsquo;s comments on that issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I believe that the public overwhelmingly support the  introduction of custodial sentences for those involved in targeting and killing  such species of bird, especially given the fact that so much work is being done  to build up the population of bird species such as the red kite. Members are  correct to say that a lot of the legislation being referred to today is out of  date and out of step with public opinion. There is an onus and responsibility  on us, as representatives, to update that legislation accordingly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I look forward to the Bill coming before the Committee for  scrutiny. I welcome the opportunity to listen to the views of the many interest  groups involved and to further strengthen the Bill, because a degree of work  still needs to be done.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>:  Most of what needed to be said about the Bill has been said. However, as a  nature lover, I am more than happy to repeat it. In fact, if encouraged, I  would stay here all day to talk about it. I live in the countryside, and I am  in a privileged position, because I can enjoy and appreciate nature at its  best. There is nothing more wonderful than taking a stroll to experience nature  as it was intended and to soak up its wonders.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I live in Gortmacrane, which means the stony field, and  there is a paradise very close to me, where I can go to appreciate the Foxy at  any time. However, I have to admit that he stole my neighbour&rsquo;s gander  recently, but that is nature. All wildlife co-exists. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.] </span>I could also say that his partner went off laying eggs.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill is very welcome and has my full-hearted support,  and I hope that the enforcing legislation is capable of delivering what is  enshrined in the Bill. I am conscious that, to our shame, cockfighting,  badger-baiting and other terrible things still take place in this country and  that we have not been able to stamp them out.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill also refers to ASSIs. Mr Deputy Speaker, you will  fully appreciate why I want to focus on that. There are proposals to develop up  to four super-dumps near an area of special scientific interest in the  constituency that we share. We must be serious about how we approach ASSIs in  future, and government should be embarrassed by the proposals to try to mix  areas of scientific interest with super-dumps.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Members have already referred to snares. One of my lasting  childhood memories is of finding a fox that had died from loss of blood,  exhaustion or hunger. The poor animal was also missing a foot, which indicated  that it had eaten it to try to escape from the snare. I hope that grotesque  devices of that kind are a thing of the past.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have sympathy for farmers, because I know from experience  that Foxy, who I referred to earlier, is a problem. I say only that surely  there are more humane ways of dealing with wild animals that have gone looking  for the farmer&rsquo;s flock.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Several Members referred to the Irish hare, and I am  delighted to share with the Assembly my experience during the recent snow.  While other people were perhaps experiencing difficulties getting from A to B,  I was out walking my dog when two of the most beautiful Irish hares skipped  across the road. That is the first time that I have seen the animal for several  years. There is every reason to make sure that the statutory rule which applies  at the moment continues, and I encourage the Minister to make it permanent.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill makes it very clear that ignorance of the law  cannot be a justification in the future, and that includes the matter of  custodial sentences. However, I point out that those acts which are already  illegal have resulted in very few people, if any, being put in jail for cruelty  to animals. Therefore, we have to seriously consider how we can get the message  across to people who do not appreciate the wonders of nature about what they  are doing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I believe that, although the Bill makes certain acts illegal,  there has to be a carrot as well. I am very conscious that there are children  living in more urban areas who would not even recognise domestic animals, such  as cows or pigs, because they have never seen them. How much more difficult it  is to get across the wonders of wildlife to the many people who never have the  opportunity that I have to see them. The school curriculum should be enhanced  to ensure that education on this subject is more than just nature walks and  that it gives every child an appreciation of the wonderful planet that we live  on.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We are not yet at the stage were good overcomes evil. For  that reason, enforcement is necessary, and I fully support it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When I go home this evening and take Ralph for a walk, I  can be certain that, all around me, there are foxes, badgers, pigeons and  pheasants, all surviving in woodland that has been protected not by government  but by farmers who, as custodians of the countryside, appreciate how important  they are. Those farmers are the best bastions to ensure that the Bill delivers  what it promises. The Bill is a beacon of light and is very important. In what  are difficult times in the Assembly, we can today celebrate legislation that  will genuinely protect the environment, the countryside and biodiversity.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I call Mr Jim Shannon.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>:  Do not spoil it, Jim.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I have been very keen to speak on the Bill, and I apologise for all my toing  and froing in and out of the Chamber. The Agriculture Committee was meeting  this afternoon and, as there were votes to be taken, I had to make sure that I  was there.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As Members are probably aware, the Wildlife and Natural  Environment Bill is close to my heart. My reasons for saying that may be  different from those of other Members: there is nothing so tasty as duck &agrave;  l&rsquo;orange or a well cooked pheasant.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I declare an interest as a member of the British  Association for Shooting and Conservation (BASC) and a member of the  Countryside Alliance. I am unashamedly a countryside sportsman when time allows.  Therefore, I have looked at the Bill with great interest.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I look forward to the opportunity to speak to the Bill,  especially those clauses relating to shooting sports and conservation. There is  nothing wrong with being a sportsman in the shooting fraternity and a  conservationist. The people who make the biggest contribution to conservation  are those in the shooting community, not those in the so-called green lobby,  some of whom sit in the Chamber.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  The Member will get his chance to speak.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In general, the Bill is well balanced and well thought-out.  However, there are always controversial aspects of a Bill, and it is to those  that I wish to speak. There is no time limit on my contribution, but I will not  take too long.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have corresponded with both the BASC and the Countryside  Alliance, gone through the proposals with them and gauged their opinions. Those  organisations make a significant and important contribution to the countryside,  and, through the actions of their members, ensure that conservation measures  are carried out. I am representing the shooting community through my comments.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to go through the issues clause by clause and hope  that everyone will bear with me. According to the explanatory and financial  memorandum, clause 1 imposes:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;a new statutory duty upon government departments and  public bodies to take action to further the conservation of biodiversity.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">In the main, that should be welcomed, but the  shooting community is well placed to assist with initiatives to achieve that  objective. In other words, why not have the shooting organisations more  involved in the policies that are brought forward? I ask the Minister to  comment on that in his response. The shooting community acts naturally to conserve  and enhance the habitat of animals and ensure that species are not overhunted.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will comment on my experience from my own land in  Greyabbey. The land is actually in the hands of my father, but he is very good  and lets me do things on it; the handover will come through time. We planted  3,000 trees on the land and made sure that there were two ponds, which were  examples of direct conservation to enhance the habitat. We also made sure that  the hedgerows were wide enough, which not only accommodates the bird life that  Mr Dallat talked about but also the flora and insect life, which are important  to the natural biodiversity of the countryside. Those are direct and practical  actions that show that the shooting community does what it says it does. The  shooting community does what it says on the tin. It has produced the goods on  habitats and conservation, which have enhanced wildlife in the countryside. I  would like to know how many Members do their bit to enhance wildlife. We will  hear about that in a few minutes when the green lobby speaks.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">One note of caution is the possibility that, in attempting  to meet their obligations, Departments and public bodies may be overzealous and  create bureaucracy and obstacles that could impede sporting activities. For  example, the Forest Service offers sporting leases. However, rather than simply  entitling the leaseholder to shoot any legal quarry species, as laid out in the  Wildlife (Northern Ireland) Order 1985, the Forest Service has its own  restrictions, such as a prohibition on the shooting of teal. The Forest Service  says that it is not liable to charge for permitting the shooting of species on  the amber or red lists. That is understandable, and I can go with it. However,  the provision is unnecessary, because the Forest Service could simply demand  compliance with the Wildlife (Northern    Ireland) Order 1985 from their lessees,  which would offer it the required protection. It is possible that the new  statutory provision could lead to similar over&shy;reactions elsewhere. I urge the Committee  to safeguard against that at the Bill&rsquo;s Committee Stage. In other words, if the  Forest Service is given power, make sure that it uses it correctly and wisely.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The provisions in clause 10, which concerns snares, are  acceptable. Moreover, it is welcome that the guidance notes reiterate that  snares are an important means of controlling pest species. Let us not be  against the use of snares; it is important that they are available. With regard  to the catching of foxes, in order to control their blood sports, we must make  sure that they, as members of a pest species, are controlled.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.00pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 12 deals with the introduction of new species. The  deliberate release of muntjac deer by shooters is becoming an increasingly  frequent, but almost hysterically reported, issue. All responsible shooting  organisations and individuals totally condemn such releases, and I reiterate  that it is not normal practice in country sports. However, it is good that the  clause addresses the issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome clauses 15 and 16. Clause 15 allows the shooting  of deer from a parked vehicle, and clause 16 allows some deer management, but  only under licence, during the close season. Such licences are not available  without good cause. People are not being given a blanket licence to control,  but they will make the conditions when they are favourable.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>:  The honourable Member raised the issue of Reeves&rsquo;s muntjac; I am sure that  every Member is aware of it. It is a small species of deer that has caused  enormous damage, particularly in England. It has destroyed woodlands  and has had a huge economic impact. Does the Member accept that the fact that  it has been discovered in Northern    Ireland is extremely worrying? Furthermore,  will he join with me and urge the Minister to take urgent action to capture and  remove specimens of the species in Northern Ireland? If we do not do  so and the population increases, foresters and farmers will suffer huge  economic losses. That is to the detriment of all wildlife in Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I am astounded that we agree on something. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span> I agree with the Member 100%; the introduction of muntjac deer will have clear  detrimental effects on people who manage forests. I will leave the decision on  the method of controlling those deer to the people who know best. They may  capture them, put them in a wee van and take them away somewhere, or they may  turn them into a meal.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is a good provision on the use of licences in the  close season, and it rebuts some deer managers&rsquo; attempts to legalise night  shooting. We must have some controls and understanding of how best to manage  wildlife that has many negative elements. At night, calves could be wounded,  lost or orphaned, and we want to ensure that that does not happen.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 26 has the effect of extending the season for  shooting female deer &mdash; that is, the red    deer, the sika deer and the fallow deer &mdash; by starting  a month earlier but continuing to the end of February. I welcome that  provision, which has many positive elements. That clause will allow more  flexible deer management in response to weather conditions, and so on, so that  the cull can be managed without the need for night shooting. It could still  happen even if the weather is bad in February.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, among all the many positives, I must point out a  clause that is of major concern. Clause 28 requires the owners of land in an  ASSI to notify the Department of changes of ownership or occupation. That is an  important issue because it is how the system carries out the management of  firearms, whether that be shotguns or rifles. There are two main causes of  concern. Under the Firearms (Northern    Ireland) Order 2004, the term &ldquo;occupier&rdquo; is  relied upon to permit a person to borrow a shotgun from the occupier, and there  is a parallel for rifle loan. However, the term &ldquo;occupier&rdquo; is not defined in  the legislation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The prospect of the Department of the Environment being  responsible for maintaining a register of occupiers means that the PSNI could  rely on such a list to determine the legality of firearms loans. The list could  not be used for that purpose, because the PSNI would have the list of  occupiers, which can change. However, the legislation does not define the  meaning of &ldquo;occupier&rdquo; and, therefore, major unintended difficulties could be  caused. It is important that we ask the Department and its officials to address  any difficulties that are highlighted. Is the occupier the person who takes the  grazing in conacre, the person who leases the sporting rights or the person who  has rented the land for other purposes? For example, the BASC holds a game fair  in Ballywalter every year. Others are held across the Province at Shane&rsquo;s  Castle in Antrim, in Moira and in the Minister&rsquo;s own constituency.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am concerned that DOE is not staffed to deal with the  matter. The requirement to notify is new, and given the target of listing large  swathes of Northern Ireland  as ASSIs, there is every prospect that the Department will fail miserably in  keeping up with the processing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I suggest to the Minister and his officials that it would  be more sensible and practical for those arrangements to be maintained by Land  Registry, because it is responsible for keeping records of ownership changes  and could much more easily manage the occupier register.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  take the Member&rsquo;s point that the definition of an occupier should be clarified.  I presume that one reason why the term &ldquo;occupier&rdquo; is used is to prevent a  situation in which people might try to use a loophole in order to deny that they  are the owner. A person who is a leaseholder of land does not own that land,  and the term &ldquo;occupier&rdquo; can be used to cover that. The definition must be  clarified, but there may be a concern that simply dropping the term &ldquo;occupier&rdquo;  could lead to a situation in which people frustrate the intention of the  definition. Genuine people might be caught out while those who subvert the  legislation can avoid the proper restrictions.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I thank the Member for his intervention. He has underlined the issue clearly.  It is important to note that names of occupiers, landowners and leaseholders  could be more easily maintained in an occupier register. That could be done  more helpfully by Land Registry.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are other smaller issues that need to be tidied up,  such as the intent of clause 29. The DOE has a target of declaring 8% of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  countryside as ASSIs, and the Minister will respond on that issue. The prospect  of a forest of signage to declare the special status of such land will risk  spoiling the very land that it is designed for. The land is lovely, and is  great to walk through and enjoy, but there must be balance when it comes to  signage, for which a checking system must be put in place.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome clause 31, which deals with the abolition of game  licences and game dealers&rsquo; licences. The requirement for a licence to shoot or  deal in game has been abolished in England  and Wales, and it is not  before time that we should follow that lead in Northern Ireland. Such licences  serve no useful purpose, and clause 31 provides a welcome revision. I thank the  Minister for his comments on that issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 32 deals with the sale of game. The scrapping of the  restriction on selling game out of season, provided that it has been lawfully  taken, is sensible and welcome. We would have liked to make two changes to the  provisions for shooting opportunity. The first is the unification of  wildfowling seasons with the rest of the United Kingdom, which would allow  the extension of shooting of wildfowl on the foreshore until 20 February.  Perhaps the Minister and his officials could respond to that. That would not  affect Lough Neagh or Lough Erne, but it would benefit Strangford Lough, which  is in the area that I represent, Larne lough, Lough Foyle, Dundrum inner bay  and Carlingford lough.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The second change concerns moonlight shooting. We accept  and understand that that has not been universally sought, but nonetheless, it  could have been considered in the proposals for the Bill to bring it into line  with the rest of the United Kingdom.  I have been assured by country sports organisations that although curlew are  still on the quarry schedules, there will be continued promotion of the widely  observed voluntary moratorium to demonstrate that self-regulation is much  better than diktat. How true that is.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>: If  the Member is saying that a voluntary ban exists, what could possibly be wrong  in making it statutory? As we return to normality, more tourists will come and  avail themselves of shooting opportunities. Surely, for clarity, there is  nothing wrong with imposing a legal ban on the shooting of curlew given the  dramatic decline in the population of that species, not as a result of shooting  activity, but of habitat change, particularly drainage. Let us have clarity and  put all those wader species into schedule 1 to the Bill so that people know  exactly where they stand.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I thank the Member for his intervention, but he will appreciate that I have a  different opinion. We will have to agree to differ. To be fair to the Member,  he said that the decline in the numbers of curlew was not caused by shooting.  People in shooting organisations and conservation bodies are making a  contribution.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">For many years, I have considered self-regulation, as it  was referred to earlier, as preferable to diktats, because shooters are not the  problem. The decline in numbers is down to the loss of habitat. I shot curlew,  albeit many years ago, and it was extremely tasty. Were it still on the menu,  Jim, I would make sure that you had some with your potatoes tomorrow morning.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is disappointing that the Bill contains no explicit  provision to legalise the sale of dead mallard. They should be included in  schedule 3, along with wood pigeon, to enable their sale to be approved by  subsequent licence. I was informed that the DOE was receptive to that argument  and considered that it could be approved without changing the Order. The time  to address that issue is now. The intention of such a provision is to allow  estates to sell their duck, a practice that is currently illegal. There is no  intention of allowing truly wild mallard to be shot and sold for profit, but to  enable those that are harvested on land where birds are reared and released to  be shot for sale into the food chain.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We must ensure that the Irish hare remains on the quarry  list &#9472;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Boylan</strong>: <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I must be allowed to make my statement, as I am sure other Members will when  the time comes. The Irish hare should remain on the quarry list. The  all-Ireland species action plan for the Irish hare will end in 2010, and if the  hare population cycle is normal, its target will be achieved. As Members are  aware, the hare population grows and decreases in cycles. The current situation  is that the number of hares in the Province has risen dramatically.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>: As  the Member&rsquo;s time is not limited, I am not cutting into the five or 10 minutes  that he would normally have.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">One of the reasons why many Members support the total  protection of the Irish hare is that they want to abolish the barbaric practice  of hare coursing for ever. Does the Member stand over letting a hare loose in  an enclosed place and allowing two greyhounds to terrorise it by chasing it for  the benefit of spectators who bet on its fate? Morally, is he able to stand  over that?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Do the shooting profession and those involved in country  sports, who are generally responsible people, not understand that if they  continue to support that practice, they will bring field sports in Northern Ireland  into disrepute? Few people in the Province understand how anyone could regard  hare coursing as a sport.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  It is not a sport that I have followed, but the hare population has grown  dramatically. That growth is down to shooting and the conservation values of  such organisations, as well as to changing farming practices and habitat  management. To cite an example, for the past 20 years, the hares on our farm  have not been touched, and, over the past year, we have seen about four hares  on the farm. However, during the summer, as the barley crop was growing, I  noticed something at the top of one of the fields that looked like a bunch of  black crows, but it was not. The four hares had bred, and they had their  leverets with them, making a total of a dozen hares in that field. The increase  in the hare population is, therefore, down to the many people like me who carry  out habitat control.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>:  And then you kill them.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  No, I have not. The farming practices and habitat management that we carry out  have been positive and constructive.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>:  And then you killed them.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  No, I have not, and I ask the Minister to consider my argument.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill is, on the whole, worthy of support. I have asked  the Minister and his officials to consider only a few issues, and I also ask  the Committee to take those into consideration when the time comes. I thank  Members for giving me the opportunity to make my comments. I put on record that  I will support the Minister and his Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We may be different in this world, Jim, but we can still be  friends. I will still be your friend; I hope that you will still be mine.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: After duck a l&rsquo;orange was mentioned, I was not sure whether I had  called Jim Shannon or Jamie Oliver to speak.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I  welcome the basis of the Bill and many of its provisions, which will increase  the level of protection given to the habitats of many endangered animals.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 1 places a duty on public bodies to preserve  biodiversity. A key method of delivering that will be the planning process,  whether through decisions made by the Planning Service or, in future, local  government.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Why is biodiversity so important? I am sure that some  people think that protecting our environment is unimportant. However, it is  important that we protect our fragile environment for future generations. The endangerment  of habitats is a strong sign that something is going wrong in the local area.  It is often the result of certain pollutants being released into the  environment, and it could have a long-term effect on future generations.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Recently, I was struck by two Northern Ireland Environment  Agency (NIEA) local management area information leaflets, one for the Six Mile  Water and one for Lough Neagh. The former deemed that 83% of the surface water  in the Six Mile Water was less than good, owing to suppressed invertebrate  populations and diatoms. The NIEA classed 100% of the surface water in Lough  Neagh as being less than good. Surface water quality is affecting life at the  bottom of the food chain, but we must remember that Lough Neagh is the source  of water for much of the Northern    Ireland population. We would feel much more  protected if we were assured that the water that goes into Lough Neagh was of a  much higher standard.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In creating an increased duty to preserve biodiversity, it  will be incumbent on public bodies to recognise that changes can occur,  provided that mitigation actions are taken to enhance the local environment. As  a local councillor, I came across the owner of a fishery who was applying for  permission to expand his lake. The Planning Service recommended that the  application be refused. When we got to the bottom of the matter, we realised  that the Planning Service&rsquo;s opposition was based on the then Environment and  Heritage Service officer&rsquo;s concerns that the work would endanger habitats.  However, the planning application provided for extensive replanting and  groundwork, which, it was acknowledged, would enhance the environment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Until the officer was forced to answer the question of how  long it would take the habitat to recover &mdash; his reply was that it would take  two years &mdash; he held out against the planning application. Planners will have to  be reasonable and understand that change can occur when appropriate mitigation  action is taken. As we progress the legislation, it is important that there be  a clear understanding that it will not be used to prevent all new development.  New development must be permitted, but appropriate mitigation action must be  taken. Officials must take care in exercising the powers that will be given to  them to ensure that they take balanced decisions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the redaction of Crown immunity in certain articles  in the Wildlife (Northern    Ireland) Order 1985. The protection of birds  and wildlife should and must extend to the state as it does to the citizen. I  am not aware of any reason why Crown immunity should continue to exist in that  area.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am also curious about clause 20, which relates to  wildlife inspectors. It would be helpful if the Minister or his Department  confirmed that, although the clause creates the term &ldquo;wildlife inspector&rdquo;, they  have existed for some time. The 1985 Order includes provision for an  &ldquo;authorised person&rdquo; who appears to have exercised those types of powers in the  past.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Inspectors undoubtedly require powers of entry. However,  when someone other than a police officer exercises those powers, appropriate  controls must be in place so that they are not granted inappropriate access.  The grounds for entry must be reasonable. It would be useful to have  information on specific instances in which that type of power has inhibited the  protection of the environment and wildlife. That would give me and, indeed, the  public a better understanding of the powers that will be granted. However, I  understand how there could be a problem if there are barriers to gaining  appropriate evidence.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I understand that, at present, wildlife crime is largely  handed over at an early stage to the Police Service of Northern Ireland. The  provision in the Bill appears to move towards greater intervention directly by  the Department. Granting powers to any organisation other than the police must  be done carefully and appropriately. As I said earlier, scrutiny mechanisms  must be in place to justify the action. I am also interested to know what  long-term plans there may be in that area. Is the plan to move the  responsibility to local government in the future? I declare an interest as a  member of Carrickfergus Borough Council.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the extra provision in the Bill to protect areas  of special scientific interest. If we are serious about protecting those  special areas, there clearly must be increased powers of protection. It is  important that the Department has the full information about who owns or uses  the land. I hope that that information will be used to help to educate the  owners. Perhaps carrots will be provided as well as a stick; perhaps grant assistance  will be made available to enable improvements to those areas and the duty of  advising who the owner is will be used in a positive manner and not just when  breaches occur.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I hope, too, that the Department will use as light a touch  as possible, particularly in the early stages, when new ASSIs are designated.  There is a need to educate the owners. It is important that we take the public  with us, rather than coming down with a heavy hammer, because that could create  problems. It is much better, through education, to take the public with us.  That would mean that nobody could have the excuse of not knowing what they were  meant to do. It is appropriate that the information is passed and that the  Department should educate landowners about their responsibilities.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will talk briefly about snares. It would be helpful if  information was provided on what discussions, if any, there have been with the  Department of Agriculture and Rural Development. I declare an interest because  I own some farmland and I assist my father on the parental farm, although I am  not involved in snaring. However, as a primary school child, I remember going  out to feed hens in a small hen house, and every single hen had been killed  because a fox had been able to get in. The fox did not simply take a meal; it  killed everything and left. There are pests in the countryside, and there needs  to be a legitimate means of controlling those pests.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>: I  accept the Member&rsquo;s point that there are instances when pests such as foxes and  rabbits need to be controlled. Does he accept that research has shown that 48%  of the animals that are killed by snares are neither foxes nor rabbits and that  17% are domestic pets? The problem with snaring is that it is totally  indiscriminate. There are other ways of controlling those pest species without  killing other species that are either protected or are not targets.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I  accept fully that the continuing provision of snares is questionable. No one  has given me information that indicates why snaring should continue. I look  forward to receiving information in the course of the Bill&rsquo;s Committee Stage.  If snaring were allowed to continue, it would be important that it is regulated  heavily and policed. No reasonable person would wish for cruelty. I heard of a  horrendous instance in which a fox bit off its leg because it was trapped for a  considerable time. I wish that there were a better method of controlling pests.  If such a method exists, the Bill should give consideration to banning snares.  However, I wish to be advised of how else pests could be controlled.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I said, we must bear in mind that foxes can  indiscriminately kill every bird in a hen house and snatch lambs, particularly  in the early stages of their lives, so failing to appropriately control pests  will cause other animals to suffer. A balance is required. Nevertheless, I am  open to the thought of banning snares. I am not aware of anyone who uses them  in my rural community, although the practice may occur to a greater or lesser  extent in other parts of Northern    Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill will update existing provisions and introduce six  new offences, so it would be helpful if the Minister and the Department would  comment on the enforceability of the existing offences cited in the Wildlife  (Amendment) (Northern Ireland) Order 1995. Bearing in mind that we are creating  additional offences, how effectively have the existing provisions been  implemented? When creating laws, it is important that they can be regulated and  their aims achieved, so it would be useful to know how many convictions have  been secured under the Order in the past few years.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 7 limits the defences that are available in relation  to a specific offence. However, once again, how well has that provision been  enforced? I appreciate that I am posing many questions; however, as a member of  the Committee for the Environment, I look forward to receiving the relevant  information after the debate. The purpose of scrutiny is to ask questions and  receive information. I also hope that those who are interested in this subject  will take part in the Bill&rsquo;s Committee Stage and provide the Committee with  information, so that we are well informed about any decisions that we might  make. I look forward to participating in the Committee Stage to improve the  legislation, which will enhance Northern    Ireland&rsquo;s wildlife and biodiversity.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>: I  shall declare my interests in this matter. I am a former employee of the Royal  Society for the Protection of Birds and a former employee of the National  Trust. Indeed, I am a member of the National Trust pension scheme: a point that  is relevant to the debate. I am also chairman of the Northern Ireland Raptor  Study Group, of which I have been a member since 1991. The group consists of  bird of prey enthusiasts who seek to promote understanding and to protect  species such as the peregrine falcon, merlin, sparrowhawk and, more recently,  the red kite.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Not only have I been involved with wildlife in the  voluntary sector, but I had the privilege of sitting in the Assembly in 1983  and 1984, during the scrutiny stages of what became the Wildlife (Northern Ireland) Order 1985 and the Nature  Conservation and Amenity Lands (Northern    Ireland) Order 1985. I remember spending  many months going through and refining that legislation, which has been in  place for 25 years, and the Bill that we are considering is an upgrade of those  laws. That makes me feel extremely old.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Like many Members, I believe that the proposed legislation  is fundamentally sound. It is a refinement of various Acts and Orders, which  brings the legislation up to date. The fact that the debate has honed in on three  or four specific issues indicates that the Department has generally got things  right. However, there are a small number of issues with which we still have to  deal.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Northern    Ireland wildlife is under enormous pressure,  largely due to the trend towards agricultural intensification that occurred  after the war and, latterly, due to EEC grants. I am glad to say that there  have been major changes. The tide in agriculture has turned away from food production  for its own sake to more environmentally sensitive farming. The environmentally  sensitive areas scheme and the countryside management scheme have had a major  impact on habitat loss.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, under cross-compliance regulations for single  farm payments, there is now a list of operations that cannot be carried out  without the Department&rsquo;s consent. I asked a question for written answer about  that around a year ago, and it is noticeable that the single farm payment  regulations have led to a dramatic decrease in hedgerow loss in Northern Ireland.  So, instead of a negative approach having been taken &mdash; farmers being told not  to do something &mdash; they are told that we, as a society, will give them single  farm payments totalling &pound;210 million a year to provide a basic level of income  to sustain farmers and their families on the land. However, in return for that  we expect various environmental standards to be met.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Generally, the news on that looks fairly good. Farmers have  reacted well to that incentive and are beginning to protect habitats.  Therefore, driving down the road in the middle of May, one no longer sees  hundreds of yards of hedgerow being removed or moorland being grubbed up. So,  things are going well.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  The countryside management scheme is an example of how the Department of  Agriculture and Rural Development encourages local farmers to provide habitats,  retain hedgerows, and increase the flora and the insect life. Does the Member  believe that the Department should do more to enhance that?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>:  When it comes to the opening up of the countryside management scheme, my  constituents&rsquo; complaint is not about its existence; it is that they cannot get  into it. Far more people are applying to get into CMS than there are funds  available for them to join. Under the renegotiation of the CAP in 2013, I would  like to think that we will move to a situation in which single farm payments  have been amended, so that everyone can enter the countryside management  scheme. In that sense, things are moving in the right direction, but an  enormous amount of damage was done before that tide turned.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Our countryside is also under the most enormous development  pressure. Until recently, four times more bungalows &mdash; single dwellings &mdash; were  being built in Northern Ireland  than in all of the rest of the United    Kingdom put together. Driving through the  countryside, one cannot help but see the huge urbanisation that has been  occurring, with the resultant disturbance and habitat loss. All is not well  with our wildlife or our countryside; therefore, the legislation should be  brought up to date to deal with those pressures.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  Has the member ever availed himself of the opportunity to have a look at the  National Archives of Ireland website, which shows the population of Ireland in the  1911 census, prior to partition? It is quite interesting to note that, in many  areas that I have looked at to date, the number of dwellings then was  significantly higher than it is currently.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>: As  a member of the party for urbanisation of the countryside, I was expecting that  remark from the honourable Member for Upper Bann.  I do have the answer to that question, Mrs Kelly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">No one is going to tell me that the tiny, one-bedroom  crofts and cottages that were built in the late eighteenth and the nineteenth  centuries, that were made from natural materials, that assimilated into the  landscape and were surrounded by trees, and in which entire families were  reared, had the same impact on the environment as the haciendas that I see  around south Down. I know of one such dwelling that measures 4,500 sq ft, has  nine bedrooms, three garages, a stuffed eagle on the pillar, and it is  inhabited by one person and her dog. That is becoming very common in south  Down. Such people are not rural dwellers wishing to live in the countryside;  they are urbanites coming into the countryside to make a big statement.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Thus, there is pressure on the countryside. Of course,  there is the problem of septic tanks and the road infrastructure that must be  built to service the continuous urbanisation. However, I would not have  expected Mrs Kelly&rsquo;s party to have spotted that the countryside is under  pressure. I am just glad that her party never got the ministerial portfolio for  the environment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The countryside is under pressure. Damage has been done and  strong legislation is required. There has been an exchange in the debate with  the honourable Member for Strangford Mr Shannon about one impact, which is the  dramatic decline in ground-nesting wader species. Members know the species to  which I refer, but, for the sake of the Hansard report, we are talking about  snipe, redshank, curlew and lapwing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In 1987, I was employed by the RSPB, along with other  staff, to carry out a breeding wader survey in Northern Ireland. Even then, it was  apparent that there had been a dramatic decline in our breeding waders. That  survey was followed up on several occasions, and the results are extremely  worrying. Wader species in Northern    Ireland, outside protected areas, are faring  extremely badly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Some of it is due to drainage, some of it is due to  intensification of agriculture, some of it is due to disturbance, and some of  it is due to predation. However, there is no doubt that species such as curlew  and snipe in Northern    Ireland are in deep trouble, and the numbers  of redshank breeding are pitifully small. Therefore, there can be no excuse for  the exclusion of those species from schedule 1 to the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I accept Mr Shannon&rsquo;s point, which is deeply worrying. I  find myself agreeing with several of Mr Shannon&rsquo;s earlier points, which is a  matter of deep concern to me. I was thinking to myself, where have I gone wrong  that I am agreeing with Jim Shannon on anything to do with the countryside? But  I did. He made some valid points, which, no doubt, will look good in next  week&rsquo;s &lsquo;Newtownards Chronicle&rsquo;, where people can always read them if they have  missed them in the Assembly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Nevertheless, on a serious note, I listened to Mr Shannon&rsquo;s  point, and he is right. The dramatic decline in breeding waders has not been  brought about by shooting. The problem is that the population has decreased to  a level where shooting could be the coup de gr&#7853;ce. It could remove the  remaining small breeding population of that species. The population has reached  a level where protection is absolutely essential, and I plead with the  Minister, who I know is an authority on breeding redshank, to add it, curlew  and lapwing to schedule 1 to give it full protection.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I hope and pray that those conservation measures will work  eventually, and schemes such as the countryside management scheme will lead to  an increase in those species so that, one day, they could come back onto the  quarry list, because wader species are natural prey. There is no problem about  that; the difficulty is that we are getting to a stage now where the population  is so small that we cannot afford that luxury.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are already enough species for Mr Shannon to shoot.  There are many species of wildfowl, pigeons, a small number of red grouse and  pheasants. It will not lead to any sportsman being confined to his home, but it  means that we can protect that very beleaguered species.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I must also declare that, in addition to being chairman of  the Northern Ireland raptor study group, I am about to start my thirty-fourth  year of a long-term study of the population of the peregrine falcon in Northern  Ireland. That makes me feel very old. I started in 1977, and I have been  following the fate of the peregrine falcon in Northern Ireland ever since. That  leads to a bit of confusion, because, occasionally, I do interviews &mdash; shy and  retiring shrinking violet that I am &mdash; and I am sometimes dragged onto the radio  airways to do interviews about political activities, be they about health or an  issue in south Down. However, very occasionally, I do the odd interview about  wildlife. Indeed, three years ago, I did a television interview about the  persecution of birds of prey in the Mournes. Someone saw that interview,  recognised me from it, stopped me in the street and said that he really enjoyed  the piece that I did. He said that I spoke a lot of sense, unlike that other  Jim Wells, the bigot up at Stormont. I had to assure him that the person whom  he had seen on television and the alleged bigot up at Stormont were the same  person, but he could not grasp that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is possible to be a politician and to have an interest  outside of politics. How would one make the majority of Members in the Chamber  go silent? Ask them what their interests are outside of politics. I have an  interest outside of politics, and that is birds of prey. Members may ask what  relevance that has to the legislation before us. The legislation needs to be  extended to include nest sites, to give permanent protection to the nest sites  of a range of bird of prey species, the obvious one being the peregrine falcon.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">So many bird of prey species nest in quarries that a  peregrine falcon&rsquo;s nest could be removed through the blasting of a rock face  for quarry operations. However, the raptor study group has an excellent  relationship with the Quarry Products Association, which is the umbrella body  for quarrying. It has a biodiversity officer, and the group has found that  quarry owners are extremely co-operative. However, it is still important that  we have protection.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have also reintroduced species. I believe that I was the  first British person ever to see golden eagles nesting in Donegal. I went up  over the border a few years ago to Glenveagh   National Park, and I was  the first British subject to see the golden eagles nesting. They reared a  single chick that year &mdash; 2007. They failed in 2008, but they reared two chicks  this year. That sequence may not be correct, but I am sure that it is close. I  would welcome an invasion of Irish golden eagles into this part of the United Kingdom.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I would be absolutely delighted if that project took off in  Donegal, the population increased, and golden eagles from one part of Ulster moved into this part and nested in north Londonderry or Fermanagh. That would be fantastic news.  Even though, at present, the golden eagle is not a breeding species that is  native to Northern Ireland,  if that population spread occurred, it would be essential for the Department to  have the power to provide protection for the species&rsquo; nest sites. Golden eagles  nest on the same ledges year after year.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am also delighted that the RSPB has decided to  reintroduce the red kite into the heart of my constituency in South Down. In  the interest of the species&rsquo; security, I will not reveal the exact location. In  2010, we look forward to the first nesting of red kites in Northern Ireland.  That is fantastic news not only for those of us who have an interest in birds  of prey, but also for the tourism industry, because the red kite is an  extremely attractive species which brings people in from a wide area.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A few years ago, I went to Radnorshire in Wales, where a  farmer has diversified by setting up a kite feeding station. On the day that I  was there, 300 visitors had paid &pound;3 each to watch the red kites feeding. It is  an extremely useful addition to that farmer&rsquo;s income. Kite feeding stations are  now quite common throughout the rest of the United Kingdom. I hope that some  day, a farmer in south Down can enjoy the same privilege of a second income as  a result of creating that type of tourist attraction. If that success is to be  achieved, the Assembly must provide protection for red kites&rsquo; nest sites in  order for their population to grow and flourish.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, the RSPB&rsquo;s recommendation that protection be  increased for nest sites of other species, such as the white-tailed sea eagle,  which has recently been seen in north Antrim, is sensible. I suspect that the  reason why it is not included in the Bill is that, at the time of its initial  drafting, there was no realistic prospect of the red kite, golden eagle or sea  eagle nesting in Northern    Ireland. I am glad to say that now that is  very much on the cards.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Indeed, many Members will welcome the fact that in 2009,  despite the presence of Mr Shannon within five or 10 miles of the nest site,  marsh harriers nested for the first time in the Strangford constituency and  reared two young. That is tremendous.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  Just for the record, I understand that those birds are protected. I endorse  their protection, as do all members of the shooting community. We are happy to  see all of those birds of prey. There are some on my land and that of other  people. We wholeheartedly support their being there. Remember that.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>: I  often wonder about Mr Shannon&rsquo;s motivation. Does he want those birds to be  protected so that some day he can shoot them, or does he want to protect their  interests?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I like to see them in flight.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>: It  is remarkably good news that those species are coming back. I think that we are  pushing at an open door on the matter with the Department, which realises that  it is no great breach of compromise or principle to add protections for the  nest sites of those species.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to discuss the vexed issue of introductions. The one  area on which Mr Shannon and I &mdash; and, indeed, all Members &mdash; agree is that the  introduction of a non-native species to Northern   Ireland or anywhere else in the British   Isles inevitably spells disaster. Look at the damage that has been  done by the grey squirrel and the mink. Recently, there has been reference to  Reeves&rsquo;s muntjac. Of course, the other classic example is the ruddy duck. When  those species are introduced to an area, they inevitably cause commercial and  agricultural damage and lead to the driving out of native species. There is no  doubt that there is a link between the decline of the red squirrel and the  arrival of the grey squirrel.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">People may feel that I am being facetious when I raise the  issue of Reeves&rsquo;s muntjac. I am sure that, apart from a few Members on my own  Benches, the first time that anybody in the Chamber heard of Reeves&rsquo;s muntjac  was half an hour ago when I raised the question with Mr Shannon. Reeves&rsquo;s  muntjac is a small species of deer which escaped captivity in England around  50 years ago. It has bred and is now, perhaps, the most common species of deer  in the United Kingdom.  It causes enormous damage to farms and forests. The damage that it has done to  vegetation has caused a considerable loss of wildlife, to the extent that it  has been suggested that Reeves&rsquo;s muntjac are the reason why the number of  nightingale is declining rapidly in the southern counties of England.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have asked the Minister about that species. I say to him  that as an absolute priority, his Department must take urgent action to have  the small number of Reeves&rsquo;s muntjac that can be found in Northern Ireland rounded up and either kept in  captivity or taken back to England.  The Assembly cannot allow that species to spread and cause enormous damage to  the countryside. Therefore, the introduction of species is not an academic  issue. It is an issue that could cost the Provinces&rsquo; economy millions of  pounds. The zebra mussel is another issue; it has got into the Erne and Lough  Neagh water systems and is causing huge damage.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is never good news when an alien species is  introduced. The legislation needs to reflect that and be tightened to ensure  that those species are not introduced. A programme on the mainland of Britain to  eradicate the ruddy duck has already cost more than &pound;1 million, which shows  just how difficult it is to eradicate such species once they are in the  environment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I also share the concern of the RSPB on nature Europa  sites. As Members will know, the basic form of protection for areas of  outstanding scientific interest is ASSI designation, which gives considerable  protection to habitats such as raised bogs and woodlands. However, there are  more extensive areas called special protection areas (SPAs), and I am aware of  two. The SPA that I am most directly involved in is the Antrim Hills and Glens,  which is there to protect hen harrier and merlin. The problem is that those  protections are not underlined by ASSI designation. At the moment, there are  very limited powers to protect those habitats. Damage is being done to the  upper Glenshesk part of the Antrim Hills SPA, and I have referred the matter to  the Department. A large shooting syndicate has moved in and developed the area  with roads, shooting hides and feed stations for partridge, I believe. That is  doing major damage to that part of the SPA, and there are extremely limited  powers in the present legislation to address that issue. I welcome the  increased legislation, but I agree with the RSPB that it needs to be tightened  considerably.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I move on to the two major issues on which there will be  considerable debate and some division in the Assembly. The two issues that have  caught the public&rsquo;s imagination are snares and the Irish hare. I remember  sitting as a rookie Back-Bench MLA where Mr Molloy is sitting, on the extreme  of the Bank Benches, and here I am 25 years later on the extreme of the Back  Benches, so I have not gone too far &mdash; just across the Chamber. However, I  remember arguing vociferously from that very seat in 1983 for the banning of  snares. I lost that vote and we have tolerated the use of snares ever since. We  had a ban on self-locking snares, and it is important that Members understand  the difference. A snare is a piece of wire attached to a solid surface or a  fence post, which an animal can walk into by mistake and become entangled by  its neck. Self-locking snares lock round the animal&rsquo;s neck, and as it struggles  the wire gets tighter and tighter and often strangles the animal. It is an  extremely cruel way to kill an animal.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Ordinary free-running snares do not self lock but stay  round the animal. Under the Wildlife (Northern Ireland) Order 1985, the  gamekeeper or farmer is supposed to check the snares every 24 hours. If the animal  is protected or not a target species, it is released; a fox or rabbit is  knocked on the head and killed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In my capacity of checking peregrine falcon sites in Northern Ireland,  I spend huge amounts of time in the countryside during June and July, and I  have come across the most dreadful scenes of animals caught in snares. I have  found protected species, badgers in particular, but also domestic cats and  dogs. By the time I come across an animal it is usually dead. It is obvious  that no one has checked that snare in 24 hours, and in some cases in 24 days or  24 weeks. The animal had suffered a ghastly death. No one checks snares.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Snares are indiscriminate. According to the Scottish  Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, 48% of the animals caught are  non-target species; badgers, otters and hedgehogs, and, in Scotland, pine  martens are killed. Snares are grossly indiscriminate; they do not  differentiate between protected and non-protected species.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I accept that there are times when foxes and rabbits need  to be killed. I am not stupid. There are times when they cause severe damage to  farmers and to game; however, unlike snares, there are species-specific ways of  killing those animals. It is time to address that issue. An opinion poll showed  that 70% of the people of Northern    Ireland want a total ban on snares.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As things stand, we as a civilised society can no longer  stand over the use of snares. The present regulations are unworkable, and I  believe that we could do something positive for animal welfare by including a  complete ban in the legislation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There may be specific times when, for special reasons, a  landowner needs to use snares. In those circumstances, he or she could apply  for a specific licence to do so. There is nothing in the Bill preventing  someone from applying for a licence to do something that is prohibited at the  moment. That is the way of controlling the system. That means that if farmer  Smith or farmer Jones wish to use snares, a licence can be given, with attached  conditions, and the Department can oversee the use of that licence. I think  that that is the way forward, but in the vast majority of cases snares are no  longer necessary. I plead with the House to consider landing a fundamental blow  for animal welfare by banning snares forever in the Province. Then, if it is  discovered that they are being illegally used, at least we can do something  about it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The ban on self-locking snares has been totally useless.  People are still using them, and it is a dreadful way for an animal to be  killed. It is not always the case that the animal is caught by the neck.  Sometimes it is caught by the leg, or it is cut in two by the snare because it  is caught in the midsection of the body. As the honourable Member for East Antrim has said, that is not a very pleasant sight.  People&rsquo;s views on animal welfare have moved on, and snares are no longer  required.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I also wish to speak on the vexed issue of the protection  of hares. I see that Mr Shannon is back in the Chamber, and no doubt we will  clash on that issue. He is out of line with public opinion, because 75% of the  people of Northern Ireland  have stated that they want a ban on hare coursing. Younger Members of the House  may not even know what hare coursing is, although I suppose the only people who  qualify are Mr Beggs and Ms McCann; the rest of you are probably old enough to  remember.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  What about this gentleman over here?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>:  Sorry, I forgot about Mr Clarke. If one is under 30 years old, there is no  doubt that one will have no idea what I am talking about. The Irish form of  hare coursing as practised at Clonmel or Crebilly, until changes in 1993,  involved two greyhounds being set lose on a hare that is kept in captivity.  That hare runs down an enclosed course and is chased by the greyhounds. Judges  mark the course on the basis of the twisting and turning of the hounds in their  attempt to kill the hare, and, to make it even worse, bookmakers sit at the  side of the track taking bets on which is the more skilled of the greyhounds.  In a civilised society, that barbaric activity should be confined to the annals  of history forever. It is a disgrace that it ever happened in Northern Ireland  in the first place, and that anyone would even contemplate continuing it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I say to Mr Shannon that the vast majority of sportsmen &mdash;  though some people might not accept that term &mdash; are responsible and wish to  ensure a cruelty-free environment, but that any of his supporters, or any of  the organisations that he is involved in, can stand over the possibility of a  resumption of hare coursing is, to me, appalling. I personally think that  people like Mr Shannon are embarrassed, but they do not wish to support a ban  on coursing because they are worried that it may be the thin edge of the wedge.  They say that if hare coursing is banned today, it will be fox-hunting  tomorrow, and then it will be fishing the following day. That was the same  argument that was used when people were attempting to abolish bear-baiting and  badger-baiting many centuries ago. There are certain activities that are simply  so cruel that a modern, civilised society has to make them illegal.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I understand that there is a special protection order, and  am delighted that the Minister, in his wisdom, has confirmed that on several  occasions. That is good news, but the problem is that it is subject to an  annual review. I passionately believe that the Bill should be changed so that  schedule 7 includes a permanent protection to prevent hares being killed,  trapped or removed from their natural environment. That would mean that there  would be no doubt and no grey areas. People would know exactly where they  stand.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When the practice of hare coursing was effectively made  impossible by the special protection order, it was only being practised at two  sites in Northern Ireland:  Crebilly in north Antrim and Eglish in south Tyrone. The special protection  order has stopped it. Does anybody care? Is there anybody who has lost their  job over it? There certainly is not.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The public were 100% behind that and were perfectly happy  with it. I want both of those courses closed permanently, and the vast majority  of people would accept that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In 1982, I stood in Crebilly with Peter Robinson, who was  then the Chairman of the Environment Committee at Stormont, and the late Lord  Henry Dunleath, as we watched hare coursing. I still remember the squeals of  the three hares that were caught, as they were ripped apart by the hounds in  front of several hundred people. Is that something that we want in a civilised  society? It might be argued that the hounds are now muzzled, but one or two  hares die each time because they are beaten by the hounds. However, that is not  the issue; the issue is the terror that the hare must feel as he or she is  coursed down an enclosed area, being watched by so-called human beings who are  baying for blood. That is not acceptable.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The hares have to be captured several weeks before the  event, and they are kept in confined locations. Some of them are kept in boxes,  which is totally inappropriate. It is an extremely stressful thing for a hare  to endure. They are then coursed, and, if they are lucky enough to survive,  they are released back to the natural environment, but the stress must have a  long-term impact on them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is another issue aside from cruelty. I had a wry  smile on my face when Mr Shannon eulogised about the lovely, brown Irish hares  that were bouncing along his estate in Greyabbey, and, almost with emotion, he  told us that they bred and had young hares. But the honourable Member believes  that it is right for someone to capture the same hares and course them at Crebilly.  I notice that he has not asked me to give way, but I will do so, because I  would like to know where the consistency is in that. How can he have a  wonderful, sentimental appreciation of a lovely animal and then say that it is  acceptable to capture and course them? It is simply not on.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">During the debate, Members from every party have said that  the practice of hare coursing has to stop. In 30 years&rsquo; time, the Minister will  not be remembered for the clauses that he moves in the RPA or the minor  amendments that he makes to the planning Order. If he goes down in history as  the person who saved the Irish hare, he will be a national hero and an  institution. No one remembers anything about Margaret Thatcher from her time as  Education Minister except for the fact that she took away the free milk. She is  still known as Margaret Thatcher the milk snatcher. In 30 years&rsquo; time, when the  honourable Member for Lagan Valley will, no doubt, be a member of the House of  Lords and have reached the pinnacle of his political career, would he not like  to then be known as Lord Poots of Lagan Valley, the politician who saved the  Irish hare? I am sure that he would.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I urge the Minister to join with the 75% of people who  support that, and I have no doubt that the proportion of people who support it  in Lagan Valley is even higher. Let us be able to  tell our children that this Assembly took the action that led to the final  death knell for that barbaric so-called sport.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Apart from that, the legislation is generally sound. I have  been critical, but I have homed in on only four or five issues. A few minor  amendments will create an excellent piece of legislation. I mentioned that I  witnessed hare coursing in 1983, which was 27 years ago. That shows when the  next opportunity might occur to change the legislation. Some Members, such as  Mr Burns and Mr Trevor Clarke, are young enough to be back here in 25 years  time, but, for some of the rest of us, this is the last opportunity to change  the legislation. Let us get it right and let us give the best possible  protection to our wildlife. I believe that the people of Northern Ireland  are with us on that.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B Wilson</strong>:  The Green Party broadly welcomes the Bill and the fact that it updates the 1985  Order, which is long overdue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I particularly welcome the introduction of the statutory  duty on government and public bodies to take action to further the conservation  of biodiversity. The UK  signed the biodiversity convention in 1992, so the issue is long-standing. It  is an indictment of government that we have had to wait for so long for such a  duty to be placed on public bodies.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">5.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Molloy] in the Chair)</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The value of biodiversity is hard to exaggerate, therefore,  I am pleased that clause 2 places a duty on the Department of the Environment  to designate and publish a biodiversity strategy. However, I am concerned that  there is no requirement on the Department to report on the strategy&rsquo;s progress  every three years, as was suggested in the consultation document. The Bill  states:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The Department must from time to time publish a  report regarding the implementation of any strategy so designated.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">How often are such periodic reports to be produced?  The Green Party proposes that the Department should report on the strategy  every three years.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 3 calls upon the Department to publish lists of  animals that require particular conservation attention and to take steps to  further the conservation of such priority species. What is meant by &ldquo;take  steps&rdquo;? That needs to be clarified.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Wells and Mr Ford pointed out that one such endangered  animal is the Irish hare. I have been interested in the Irish hare for many  years. In fact, as Mr Wells said, I spent my Boxing Days in the 1970s and early  1980s protesting in the freezing cold at Crebilly. I assure Members that we  were all disgusted that that barbaric practice continued for so long.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have another long-standing interest, because my former  colleague Bertie McConnell, who was MP for Bangor, introduced a Bill to abolish hare  coursing to the Parliament of Northern Ireland in 1970. That Bill was passed by  the House of Commons but was turned down by the Senate. The following year, he  introduced a similar Bill, which was again passed by the Commons. However, it  was delayed by the Senate, and then the Northern Ireland Parliament was  prorogued, so it never became law.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Wells also referred to Lord Dunleath, who also  introduced legislation in the Northern Ireland Assemblies of 1973 and 1982.  Those Bills were passed without division, but, again, the Assemblies fell  before that legislation could be enacted.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>: I  am slightly worried to hear that each time a Northern Ireland Government tried  to ban hare coursing, the Assembly collapsed. I hope that the Member is not  making any prophecies.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B Wilson</strong>:  It is a very interesting sequence of events &mdash; oh gosh, we could see a similar  situation. I hope that this legislation passes before this Assembly succumbs.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>: We  had better be quick, then.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B Wilson</strong>:  Yes.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is clear that the elected representatives of Northern Ireland  have been in favour of banning hare coursing for more than 40 years, but that  willingness has not yet been translated into legislation. The Bill gives us the  opportunity to introduce long-awaited measures to protect the Irish hare.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In recent years, the Department has issued a special  protection Order each year to protect the Irish hare, the numbers of which had  declined significantly in the previous 20 years. Evidence cited in the  consultation document shows that, even since the special protection order was  introduced in 2002, there has been no significant increase in the Irish hare  population. The special protection order has been shown to be ineffective. I  propose that the Irish hare should receive permanent protection and should be  included in the amendment to schedule 5 to the Wildlife (Northern Ireland)  Order 1985, &ldquo;Animals Which Are Protected at All Times&rdquo;. In my view, as long as  the Irish hare continues &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>: On  a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. For many weeks, I have wished to raise  this point, and I must raise it now. The honourable Member for North Down Mr  Brian Wilson was speaking when two Members walked in front of him. They walked  between the Speaker&rsquo;s Chair and the Member who was speaking. I find that  extremely distracting and disrespectful. Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like you to  speak to the Speaker and seek a ruling on the matter. That practice would not  be tolerated in any parliamentary Chamber, including the D&aacute;il, anywhere else in  Europe. It has to stop, because it is  extremely off-putting. I am not being critical of the Members who walked past,  but we need to stop that practice immediately.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Members have to show courtesy to others in the Chamber,  particularly to whoever is speaking. I will raise the matter with the Speaker  to see whether it can be dealt with.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B Wilson</strong>:  As long as the Irish hare continues to be regarded as a game species, its  population will remain under threat. The current situation whereby the Irish  hare is protected only during certain periods of the year sends an inconsistent  message and hampers any enforcement of a protection order. That can be resolved  only by adding the Irish hare to schedule 5, thereby removing that uncertainty.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We also supported the original proposals to increase  protection for the curlew by moving it from schedule 2 to schedule 1. We are  disappointed that that proposal has been dropped. That matter should be  reconsidered, given the parlous local status of the curlew.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Green Party also supports a strengthening of control on  the use of snares, particularly an outright ban on self-locking snares to  prevent unnecessary suffering. However, the Bill does not go far enough. Clause  10(3) states that use of the snare is prohibited where it is:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;calculated to cause unnecessary suffering to any wild  animal&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The issue is whether the snare is likely to cause  unnecessary suffering, and I recommend that the wording be amended to reflect  that. The word &ldquo;calculated&rdquo; provides a loophole that will, in effect, make it  legal to use a device that will inevitably cause suffering to an animal. I do  not believe that the requirement for snares to be checked on a daily basis can  mitigate the suffering that they cause. That is unenforceable and therefore  does not provide adequate protection for wild or domestic animals that may be  caught in those indiscriminate devices. If the Department is serious about  preventing unnecessary suffering, the only viable option is a complete ban on  snares.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department&rsquo;s consultation paper, &lsquo;Review of: The  Wildlife (Northern Ireland) Order 1985&rsquo;, refers on a number of occasions to  preventing unnecessary suffering of wild animals, so the Department clearly  recognises that it has a responsibility in that area. I am surprised,  therefore, that the paper includes no proposal to end the inherently cruel and  barbaric practice of hunting with dogs. Northern   Ireland remains the only part of the UK to allow that barbaric practice, and the  review of the Wildlife (Northern    Ireland) Order 1985 afforded us the perfect  opportunity to end that activity once and for all. The remit of the Wildlife (Northern Ireland)  Order 1985 includes the protection of wild birds, mammals and plants, and my  understanding is that we are here to improve the provisions of that Order. Why,  then, has hunting with dogs been ignored when it is so fundamental to our  discussions?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I turn to the Department&rsquo;s proposal to abolish game  licences. Although it is recognised that the current systems are archaic, the  Green Party cannot support the Department&rsquo;s proposal to deregulate the system  completely. To have no monitoring of those activities is contrary to other  provisions in the Bill to support conservation efforts. The Department  recognises that fact in its own consultation documents, which is why I cannot  understand why no alternative monitoring system is provided for in the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Paragraph 154 of the consultation paper states:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;it is recognised that there may be some concern from  conservationists that the lack of a proper monitoring system could lead to  unacceptable pressures on wildlife&hellip;the Government recognises the need for an  improved system for monitoring the numbers of bird species (game birds and  quarry species) taken through hunting to ensure that hunting practices remain  sustainable.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Why have no alternative provisions been included in  the Bill?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A number of suggestions were made during the consultation,  including the licensing of individual shoots, including an agreed limit on the  number of individual species that could be killed. However, the Department  seems to have ignored all such proposals. I am open-minded on the method of  monitoring, but having no monitoring at all could have a disastrous impact on  the conservation of game birds and quarry species.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Green Party welcomes the two offences that the Bill  creates to protect ASSIs, which are an important part of our environmental  heritage. Reckless and unnecessary damage to those sites is damaging to the  whole community, and it is important that that be recognised in legislation. We  welcome the proposal to give the Department power to erect signs and notices in  those areas to provide information and increase awareness of ASSIs. It is  important that efforts be made to raise awareness of the importance of those  sites. The previous Environment Minister had to be taken to court by Friends of  the Earth to learn the true status of ASSIs, so it seems that there remains  considerable ignorance on that matter.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My party also has concerns regarding the issue of licences  under article 5(6) of the Wildlife (Northern Ireland) Order 1985. Who  is responsible in the Department for granting those licences? Can we be assured  that that is not just a rubber-stamping exercise and that each application will  be properly scrutinised?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My party welcomes clause 13, which relates to the  prohibition of the sale of non-native species, and we suggest that the aquatic  nursery trade deserves special attention regarding such sales. We are concerned  that there may not be adequate staff to police that provision. We support  clauses 18, 19 and 20 on enforcement but are concerned that they may not be  adequately policed. Have the PSNI been consulted, and will special training be  given to the police personnel who are likely to be involved in the enforcement  of the Bill?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 20 strengthens the powers of the Depart&shy;ment&rsquo;s  wildlife inspectors. Are there plans to increase the number of inspectors to  enforce those powers?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My party broadly welcomes the Bill, but we believe that in  certain areas it can be improved to protect biodiversity, enhance conservation  and prevent the unnecessary suffering of animals. We also welcome the  introduction of new offences, but we are concerned as to the policing and  enforcement of the new powers, particularly as it is indicated that no extra  funding will be available.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment (Mr Poots)</strong>: I am grateful for Members&rsquo; contributions to the  debate; they have been both valuable and informative. I will respond to some of  the issues raised.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">After all the hullabaloo of yesterday, we are down to  realpolitik today. These are the issues that, while they might be a bit of a  grind on occasions, affect the public and the community. In this House, we are  supposed to be delivering on an agenda, whether it is on the environment,  health, education or any other aspect. People should take a lot of goodwill out  of this debate and a lot of hope. If we can get Jim Wells and Jim Shannon  agreeing on a number of issues, we might even get the policing and justice  issue resolved at some point. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.] </span>If we  can get that far today, it demonstrates how far we can reconcile opposites on  occasions. It has been a valuable debate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Dolores Kelly spoke on behalf of the Committee and broadly  welcomed the Bill: I appreciate that. I look forward to working with the  Committee, through my officials, on the issues that are of concern to it. The  Committee has additional ideas, which it will want to put to my Department. We  will give those ideas due care and attention, as we have done in respect of  previous Bills. There has been a close working relationship between the  Department and the Committee on a range of issues with respect to previous  legislation. I assure the House that my Department will seek to accommodate and  work with the Committee as far as possible.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The one issue that was of particular relevance today may be  summed up as &ldquo;snares and hares&rdquo;. Nearly every Member who spoke had a comment to  make on that, including Mrs Kelly, and I will deal with those issues in turn.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Peter Weir also broadly welcomed the Bill. He asked about  temporary stop notices. As regards stop notices and reinstatement notices not  included in the Bill, there will be consultation on a new and comprehensive  range of sanctions for application across a number of environmental regimes.  That is currently being held in England  and Wales.  Those sanctions include powers to issue stop and reinstatement notices. It is  prudent to await the outcome of the consultation and introduction of the  proposed measures in England  and Wales before making  decisions on appropriate mechanisms in Northern Ireland. It will be more  effective to make comprehensive regulations from those notices, rather than  limit them to ASSIs.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Danny Kinahan and Cathal Boylan spoke about guidance on  biodiversity. The Department will draft practical and appropriate guidance for  public bodies to assist them in their duties. Most Departments currently embrace  nature conservation measures as a part of their duties. That is something which  we hope will continue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Cathal Boylan also referred to game licensing systems and  appropriate legislation for the sale of venison. The poaching of deer and the  sale of unlawfully taken deer are already offences under the Wildlife (Northern Ireland)  Order 1985, and we should thank Mr Wells for introducing that. He has the grey  hair that demonstrates that he has been here that length of time, and he may  well still be here in 30 years&rsquo; time. He rhapsodises about not eating meat and  says that that is going to make him live a lot longer than the rest of us; so  there might be a young-looking octogenarian in the Chamber in 30 years&rsquo; time,  fighting the good fight for wildlife. However, anyone who is prosecuted for  such offences is liable to a fine of up to &pound;5,000 or a custodial sentence of up  to three months or both, and that will not change.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">5.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The protection of the curlew was raised, and the recent  change in its conservation status on the International Union for Conservation  of Nature&rsquo;s red list of threatened species is something that we wish to  acknowledge. I also acknowledge the positive response by many shooting  interests in Northern    Ireland, who have recognised the increasing  threat to the breeding population and have already engaged in a voluntary  moratorium on hunting curlew. My Department will continue to encourage those  who have not yet made similar commitments to do so. The success of that  voluntary initiative will be monitored.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Brian Wilson said that the hare population had not risen  despite the fact that a special protection order for hares has been in place  for eight years. That does not exactly strengthen the argument that people  should not take or kill hares; it demonstrates that the main problem is  associated with habitat management. On a personal level, I have real  difficulties with the killing of hares, curlews and other species, and I am  happy to work with the Committee to address those issues. However, I want to  make it absolutely clear that a ban on killing those animals will not  necessarily mean that there will be more of them in a number of years, and Mr  Wilson made that point accidentally. It has a lot to do with how we manage  habitats and how we ensure that those species have appropriate habitats.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Why are badgers, which are plentiful, on quarry lists and  protected lists when curlews, hares and some other species which are fewer in  number are not? When I posed that question, I found out that badgers are on the  list in order to try and prevent badger-baiting; it is not because they are  scarce. When one drives down the road, one will see that there is no scarcity  of badgers; they are continually getting knocked down. I have to ask the  question: is this the best way to deal with badger-baiting, or should we be  looking to the legislation here? I welcome the fact that the legislation has  been enhanced in that respect. However, the legislation that we are seeking to  introduce will enable the authorities to prosecute individuals who set out with  spades and dogs, normally lurchers, to hunt badgers.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will tease that out a little more. What powers will the  police have to take such people to court? If the police find dogs and their  owners say that they are hunting foxes, not badgers, the dogs must be examined  at that point. Dogs with scars on their faces associated with badger-baiting  make for a strong case. That is a better route to take, rather than having  badgers on the protected list while other animals such as hares and curlew are  kept off it. That is an issue for the Committee to consider further.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Those are issues on which I appreciate the work of the  Committee because it can carry out wider consultations and hear what others  have to say.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are other difficult arguments on the use of snares.  For example, a group in Glenwherry has, with our support, brought in gamekeepers,  although I do not know how it did that. The group has been promoting species  such as the red grouse, the Irish hare, snipe and curlew. In doing that, it  has, over the past number of years, taken about 600 foxes. That is because, in  that area, one species, for whatever reason, became too prominent, to the  detriment of all other species. I am glad that that group has removed 600  foxes. Some people do not like that; however, removing those foxes will allow  species that are under threat to thrive in the habitats that have been created  and allow them to make a return. We have to recognise that there are  challenges.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On limited occasions, snares may be appropriate, although I  find them very distasteful and have real difficulties with them. I am not unsympathetic  to Members who said that we should have an outright ban on snares. Other  Members said that there should be stiff licensing of snares, and I am not  unsympathetic to that either.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>:  The Minister must realise that the Wildlife (Northern Ireland) Order 1985 did  not abolish anything: it was always at landowners&rsquo; discretion to apply for a  licence to carry out something that would normally be illegal.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister mentioned the situation at Glenwherry, of  which we are all aware. However, I understand that many of those foxes were  shot rather than snared. The RSPB supports the Glenwherry experiment and  provides the group with considerable advice. However, in a special situation  such as that, all the landowner has to do is apply for a specific licence to  use snares and then officials will know on what land snares are being used and  can check to see that the licence conditions are being met. However, that does  not mean that anyone can use snares. I am sure that in Glenwherry snares are  checked every 24 hours, that self-locking snares are not used and that, where a  protected species or domestic animal is caught indiscriminately, it is released  unharmed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That is the solution and the compromise. It is not about  banning the use of snares; it is about using snares under strict control and  through a licence.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I thank the Member for his point. The rapid rise in the  population of foxes could cause problems for people with free range chickens, a  considerable number of sheep or during lambing season.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I will in a moment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is a concern that needs to be dealt with rationally. I  have made it clear how sympathetic I am to an outright ban on snares. However,  we need to deal with the issue rationally and sensibly. People could end up  using alternatives, such as poisoning, which can affect many more animals and  the bird population and can be even more damaging than snares. It is easier to  use unlawful methods in that situation than it is to use snares. Therefore, an  outright ban could be counterproductive. I will be interested to hear the  Committee&rsquo;s views on the issue as well as those of the various parties that  make submissions to the Committee. I hope that we can get a good outcome.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  The Minister is aware, as, I hope, is the Assembly, that the issue is about  more than checking snares every 24 hours. However, those who use snares to  catch foxes check their snares at least twice a day, morning and evening. Snares  can be used correctly and under controlled management.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Wells made a comment about having a licensed system.  When foxes strike, people need to strike right away to ensure that they are  controlled. People cannot wait until they get a licence, which is one of the  problems with the process.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I thank the Member for his point and have no doubt that it  will be made during the discussions. We will seek to arrive at a sensible and  reasonable outcome.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Ford referred to the biodiversity duty and asked how we  ensure that Departments embrace it. The DOE will encourage officials in other  Departments to embrace biodiversity. That work has been ongoing for several  years and has resulted in biodiversity implementation plans. Departments will  report on their compliance with that duty.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Ford also raised the issues of updating schedules and  permanent nests. The updating of schedules can be done at any time through  subordinate legislation. However, I heard what Members said, and we will hear  what the Committee has to say in due course. We will consider the case for  permanent nests for other bird species.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Ford also referred to the Irish hare, an issue that I  have already sought to address. To avoid him giving himself or his researchers  work to do by finding out what my position was on the issue in 2002, I will  outline that position: I stood for greater protection for the Irish hare, and I  want to see greater protection for the Irish hare in 2010. I do not just want  to see the Irish hare conserved; I want to see its population grow  significantly over coming years. Therefore, we will pursue any measures that we  can take to do that. I made it clear that I think that measures to increase the  population will be more based on habitat management than on protection.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Ford referred to the protection of ASSIs, and I look  forward to hearing the detailed proposals that might come from the Committee on  that issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome Mr Shannon&rsquo;s contribution to the debate, because  it was an important one. There are many thousands of people, probably tens of  thousands, in Northern    Ireland who engage in the activities to  which Mr Shannon referred. The views of those people are important, and many of  them are engaged in conservation work. Although Mr Wells may say that they  conserve species to shoot them, many of those people are introducing management  practices. I know that from my own farm, which now has pheasants, because  others introduced pheasants to their estates. Those pheasants have managed to  make their way to my humble property and are very much enjoying themselves on  it safe in the knowledge that Mr Poots has no intention of shooting them. I did  not introduce the pheasants to my property; other people introduced them to  their estates. People who engage in field sports are creating habitats and  engaging in management that allows many species to be reintroduced and to  thrive.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We need to keep the foreshore shooting season consistent  with that in the Republic   of Ireland, bearing in  mind that we share waters at Foyle and Carlingford. We can have that discussion  with our colleagues in the South of Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The issue of liaising with the shooting community was  mentioned. When working on the Bill, officials consulted widely and at length  with the shooting community. We will continue to regularly liaise with that  community; for example, we will be involved with the species action plan.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Forest Service leases were also mentioned. It is for each  public authority to decide how it controls activity on its land; the DOE cannot  dictate to the Forest Service about how to do that. Mr Shannon may want to  raise that in the Agriculture Committee, which he is a member of.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We will consider the details of the duty to notify a change  of ownership and signage in ASSIs in due course.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">5.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Wells raised the issue of the muntjac deer. A control  plan is in place, and officials have been in discussion with local deer  societies about control options. I suppose that one option might be to let Mr  Shannon loose in areas where one becomes aware of those deer and allow him to  shoot away to his heart&rsquo;s content. Jim Wells may prefer to round those deer up  and put them in a home for small deer somewhere. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Beggs raised a number of issues, the first of which was  the biodiversity duty to achieve balance between socio-economic and  environmental interests. He also referred to education on biodiversity, and  NIEA will hold many educational and awareness events during 2010, which has  been designated the international year of biodiversity.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">He raised the issue of increased powers for wildlife  inspectors. They will be given the power to enter any premises, other than a  dwelling, to investigate whether certain offences are taking place, such as the  keeping of captive birds or trade in live or dead birds, animals or plants. A  specific power of entry will be provided for the purpose of obtaining  information prior to processing applications for licences or for checking  compliance with licence conditions, including the power to enter dwellings.  Wildlife inspectors will have power to require the taking of blood or DNA  samples from specimens for evidential purposes, subject to controls that  require that samples from a live bird or animal be taken by a veterinary  surgeon only.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will address the points that Mr Wells made, which, to  some degree cross over with those made by Brian Wilson. Mr Wells highlighted  his concerns about the snipe, the redshank and the curlew. We look forward to  full consideration of that matter at Committee Stage, when we will take account  of the most up-to-date information. Mr Wells made the point that the  introduction of species such as the red kite had moved the issue on. We will  give that due consideration. He also referred to the need for permanent  protection of the nest sites of the peregrine falcon and the golden eagle. We  look forward to considering additional protection for a number of bird species  during Committee Stage. It is our desire to provide protection for the nests of  golden eagles.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Wells referred to several other invasive species, and we  will consider culling those species. He raised the issue of grey squirrels and  red squirrels, although many people find it difficult to accept a cull of grey  squirrels. However, the fact that introduced species subsequently become  invasive leads to all sorts of problems. We might need to consider that matter  in due course.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There was mention of special protection areas that are not  underpinned by ASSI designation. Better protection is needed, and we propose to  review and update the Northern    Ireland conservation regulations. The  treatment of the Irish hare and hare coursing are issues for the Department for  Social Development; they are not DOE issues. However, if the weight of opinion  during Committee Stage favours a ban, that will need further consideration as a  separate policy issue.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>: If  I were an Irish hare, I would feel much happier under the protection of the  honourable Member for Lagan   Valley than under that of  the honourable Member for South Down. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span> There must surely be a rationale for bringing all animal welfare and protection  under the auspices of Mr Poots&rsquo;s Department. It is bizarre in the extreme that  the Department for Social Development is in charge of that issue. Given that  the honourable Member for South Down Ms Ritchie deals with housing, social  security and urban regeneration, I would not think that the protection of hares  is top of her agenda. There seems to be no logic in the fact that she has  control over that matter, and I am sure that she would not feel robbed of a  major part of her Department&rsquo;s responsibility if it were transferred to the  Department of the Environment.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: The Member said that a number of people at Crebilly were  taking bets on which greyhound would do best on the hare course. That aspect  falls under the control of the Department for Social Development, but, of  course, if we put special protection orders in place in Northern Ireland,  those people cannot take the hares in order to pursue that activity. I  understand that people in the Republic   of Ireland continue to  take hares to engage in coursing, so Ms Ritchie may wish to discuss that issue  with her Department.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Wells and Brian Wilson spoke about limiting the use of  snares under licence, and I addressed that issue at length earlier in the  debate. I trust that I have covered most of the issues that Members raised. If  I have not, I will accept written questions or submissions from them. Members  of the Committee for the Environment may also wish to raise issues in the  Committee process.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank Members for their contributions to the debate on  the Wildlife and Natural Environment Bill. It has been a bit of a marathon,  surprisingly enough, but that demonstrates the Bill&rsquo;s usefulness. I am  confident that the provisions of the Bill will help us to conserve and enhance  our biodiversity. The biodiversity duty will reinforce the important role that  government and public bodies can have in that regard.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">To quote a Native American proverb:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;We do not inherit the Earth from our ancestors. We  borrow it from our children.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Let us pass on to our children an environment that  is in good condition. Wildlife crime matters. It has an impact on our  environment and on the ecosystems, habitats and wildlife that support our very  existence. Stronger enforcement powers, including custodial sentences, will  help us to detect and deter criminals.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When I spoke about badger baiting, I should have said that  many of the people who engage in it are also involved in dog fighting. That  fraternity, for want of a better word &mdash; or more appropriately, group of nasty  individuals &mdash; deserves to have the full weight of the law applied to those  activities. It is particularly repulsive that those activities still go on in Northern Ireland.  We must do whatever we can as a legislative body to prevent those activities  and to ensure that the people who engage in them are appropriately punished. I  welcome any assistance that Members can give me in doing that. I am sure that  Ms Gildernew and the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development share that  view, as well as any other Members or Ministers who have a part to play.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My officials and I look forward to working closely with the  Committee for the Environment as it begins its detailed scrutiny of the Bill. I  have no doubt that that will prove to be valuable. I am pleased to commend the  Bill to the House.</p>

    <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="8"></a>Adjournment</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Natural Gas: East Antrim</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The proposer of the topic will have 15 minutes in which to speak.  All other Members who are called to speak will have approximately seven  minutes.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>:  Adjournment debates are, generally, not particularly well attended, so it is  nice to see that we have the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment and  the Acting First Minister in attendance, such is the importance of the issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The cold snap that we are experiencing has brought the  issue of energy into sharp focus. Many people are struggling to pay high prices  to heat their homes, and there have been stories in the national news about  shortages of supply. East Antrim has always  been fairly important when it comes to natural gas. Discussions about gas  storage in salt caverns around Larne lough have been ongoing for several years.  That would give us certainty of supply to a degree, but when natural gas was  first brought to Northern    Ireland in the middle of the 1990s, it was  mainly used for the combined-cycle gas turbine at Ballylumford.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Today&rsquo;s debate is more about the people who live in East  Antrim, and about giving them the choice of energy supply that others already  have. Natural gas is already available in some parts of East   Antrim, but we want to see that throughout the constituency, and  the network extended up toward Whitehead.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the summer of last year, a number of East   Antrim representatives met representatives of Phoenix Natural Gas,  who indicated that they wished to see their current licence area extended up  the coast to Whitehead. We welcomed that and found it very encouraging. People  were quite rightly excited, and there were a number of positive elements: it  would give more choice to our constituents; employment opportunities would  arise; and there are environmental benefits from the use of natural gas.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Gas is a cleaner and more efficient energy source for  homeowners, tenants and businesses, all of whom could avail themselves of it.  Infrastructure would be required should natural gas be extended to Whitehead.  That would consist of road digging, pipe laying, resurfacing work, and system  installation, all of which would provide employment at a time when many people  in the constituency, and further afield, find themselves out of work. Although  constituents complain to us about road building and the upset that it causes,  in this case, it would be because of a positive development.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is good for people to have more of a choice than simply  oil or coal, especially considering the way in which prices for those energy  sources have risen in recent years. Competition can be good for business and  for consumers. In that situation, a private company would put private money  into the local community, and the public sector could also benefit. For  example, the Housing Executive could change some of the heating sources in  existing homes, and newbuild homes could have natural gas as an energy source.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is also the matter of environmental output. The  future will bring carbon taxation. There are already carbon targets, and gas  has its role to play in that because gas-condensing boilers emit far less  carbon than traditional oil boilers.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the wider context, it is important that gas be available  to more people in Northern Ireland  than those who live in the greater Belfast  area. Many Members wish to see more areas availing themselves of natural gas,  and that is consistent with the Department&rsquo;s position. It is encouraging that Phoenix wants to bring  gas to as many people as possible. Unfortunately, in recent months, a number of  difficulties have been experienced in attempting to achieve and realise that  goal.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">5.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Utility Regulator has an important role to play, and  how it does its job will not be influenced by politicians. However, it is important  that the Utility Regulator acts with the best interests of the people of Northern Ireland  at heart. As I mentioned, I originally met Phoenix Natural Gas in July 2009 to  listen to its plans to extend its network. At that stage, I had written to the  Enterprise Minister and the Utility Regulator to voice my support for the  extension of the gas line. I outlined the reasons why the extension was  important and the benefit that there would be for the constituency and anyone  who could avail themselves of the natural gas supply. I also mentioned the &pound;2&middot;4  million that the private sector would invest in the project if the greater Belfast and Larne licence  area could be extended.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On 30 September 2009, I received a letter from the Utility  Regulator saying that it was minded to approve applications for extensions to  both Whitehead in my constituency and Saintfield in the Strangford  constituency. However, in mid-November, it appeared that the Utility  Regulator&rsquo;s conditions were such that Phoenix  felt that it could no longer deliver the project. That was disappointing news  for local representatives and for people living in Whitehead, who were looking  forward to having a greater choice in energy source and the benefits that would  come from that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although it is right and proper that the Utility Regulator  conducted a full economic appraisal, it would be disappointing if the regulator  did not look at all the options for ensuring that the project is successful.  There are issues regarding the economic viability of such a project and whether  extending the network to Whitehead alone is economically viable. However, if  one looks at the entire area to which Phoenix  would be delivering gas, one will see that there is more flexibility. I want to  encourage people that progress can be made. I met Phoenix Natural Gas just  before Christmas to hear about the difficulties that it was having in  completing the project. Phoenix  also reaffirmed its commitment to putting capital into the project if it was  given acceptable and fair terms and conditions by the Utility Regulator. I have  written to the energy regulator. Although I have not yet received anything  back, I remain hopeful that we can find a resolution.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment cannot  interfere with the work of the Utility Regulator in her words this evening.  However, I hope that we will hear the Department reaffirm its commitment to  ensuring that more people, homes and communities in Northern Ireland can avail  themselves of natural gas. I hope that the Utility Regulator will listen to the  views of local representatives in East Antrim,  and those of the Department, and consider those seriously when deciding how to  move forward on the issue. I hope that all the available options will be  examined and that people in Whitehead will be able to avail themselves of  natural gas in the not-too-distant future.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: It  seems quite strange that when the natural gas supply came to Northern Ireland, it came to Islandmagee,  bypassed Whitehead and went to Carrickfergus and the greater Belfast area. The natural gas network has  subsequently been extended to Ballymena and Londonderry,  and Whitehead has missed out again. Of course, it was a high-pressure pipe that  bypassed Whitehead. What is needed is a lower-pressure system and investment in  the necessary infrastructure.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Extension of the natural gas supply to Whitehead was  tantalisingly close and yet not delivered. That option would benefit the  environment and, hopefully, provide best value for consumers. I am still  hopeful that the option will be delivered at some point in the future. Like  others, I was very encouraged when the Utility Regulator contacted me to  indicate that it was minded to allow Phoenix  to make normal profits and that it was hopeful that work would commence in early  2010. Sadly, however, that has not materialised.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the Utility Regulator&rsquo;s discussions, he indicated that  the issues are of an economic nature. Obviously, the pipeline must be paid for,  the company that installs it must consider its economic rate of return, and the  Utility Regulator has to determine that that profit is not excessive. In  reaching an agreement for a price mechanism, a price control agreement will be  set in place, perhaps for decades and certainly for many years.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A balance must be struck between wanting a gas supply but  not wanting it to be supplied at a price that allows excessive profits; the  Utility Regulator has been given the job of achieving that balance. He  considered the rate of return in the business plan to be excessive, and he  wanted Phoenix  to take on more risk, given that the situation is different than it was many  years ago. It is not a complete gas start-up because gas is now a recognised  fuel in Northern Ireland.  Many people have the confidence to use it, and there is clearly a ready market  for it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Utility Regulator has the difficult role of ensuring  that gas is not supplied at a price that allows excessive profits. That is his  job, and we must allow him that space. However, it is right that we ask  questions to ensure that he is certain about his figures so that excessive  profits are not made.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the Utility Regulator&rsquo;s letter to me of 19 November  2009, I noticed that the original Phoenix  proposal was not economic. He proposed to work with Phoenix to find a flexible approach to some  of the issues and to deliver a positive outcome. He suggested a range of  measures to improve the economics of the project. However, the letter stated  that Phoenix  did not wish to amend its original proposals, and it withdrew its application.  It is disappointing that both sides did not continue their discussions and that  a reasonable agreement was not reached. It is certainly in the interests of  local consumers for gas to be available at a reasonable price.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is impossible to talk about gas supplies and extending  the network in East Antrim without commenting  on the proposals for gas storage in the area. As the number of gas users in Northern Ireland  increases, we must ensure that there is confidence in the supply. We are at the  end of a very long European pipeline, and it is right and proper that  opportunities for gas storage are explored, such as those being investigated by  Portland Gas and others for the development of caverns in the deep layers of  salt under Larne lough and the greater Larne area.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that there is continuity of supply. We are  all aware of events in Ukraine  a number of years ago. We are also aware of how, at one point, gas supplies  were very tight. Even in recent times, we understand that companies in the rest  of the United Kingdom  were being restricted in their gas usage because of demand. If the gas pipeline  is extended, it is important that we create a stable supply so that that risk  of interruption is removed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A storage system would also create a more uniform price  structure and more reliable prices. People in Northern Ireland would not be subject  to the peaks in gas prices to which they have been exposed in the past. I  appreciate that there are many benefits to be derived from the development of  an environmentally sensitive method of storing gas, and I hope that that can be  achieved. Through the creation of an improved stability of supply and price  mechanisms, more people will have the choice to switch to gas with the  environmental improvements that come with it. However, we have to understand  that there are risks that must be addressed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that discussions with Phoenix, or any other gas  company that may be involved, will open up again in order that consideration  will be given to supplying a gas pipe network to the Whitehead area so that  local residents will have the option of using natural gas to heat their homes  and so that businesses can take advantage, where appropriate, of the benefits  of natural gas.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Neeson</strong>: I  wish the Minister well in her new post. I realise that it is a temporary  position, but I know and am pleased that she will still devote her energies to  DETI.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have always been interested in extending the natural gas  network to as many areas in Northern    Ireland as possible. Members will know that  I was to the fore in the campaign to extend the network to the north-west. That  has happened, and I believe that opportunities exist to extend the network to  other areas throughout Northern    Ireland. I have raised that issue on a  number of occasions in the Committee for Enterprise,  Trade and Investment. I know that officials will attend the Committee&rsquo;s meeting  on Thursday to deal with the strategic energy framework consultation, and I  look forward to that meeting. Believe it or not, energy issues have been one of  the main subjects that the Committee has dealt with over the years.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">East Antrim is the energy centre of Northern Ireland.  We have Ballylumford power station, Kilroot power station, the interconnector  and natural gas coming into the area. Furthermore, as other Members said, we  are looking at the prospect of gas storage in the Larne/Islandmagee area. All  in all, we have a lot to contribute to energy supply in Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Like other Members, I met Phoenix representatives early last year, and  it was clear that they had carried out their research. As Members know, two  licence extension applications have been made, one for Whitehead and the other  for Saintfield. Indeed, I know that Simon Hamilton has worked very actively on  the Saintfield application. Like other Members, I wrote to the Minister and to  the Utility Regulator. Phoenix  carried out research in the Whitehead area and identified 1,800 domestic and 50  commercial properties that could be supplied with natural gas.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">One of the reasons why I have always supported the natural  gas industry in Northern    Ireland is because I believe that consumers  should be given choice. That is why I want the gas network to be extended to as  many places as possible. I regret that not as many consumers have benefitted  from the extension of the gas pipeline to the north-west as I believe should  have. Hopefully, however, that situation will change at some time in the  future.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The fact that Phoenix Natural Gas was going to invest  somewhere in the region of &pound;2&middot;4 million of its own money clearly shows its  commitment to the project.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The letter that I received at the end of September from the  Utility Regulator seemed to suggest that the company supported the Whitehead  project. I deeply regret that the impositions placed on Phoenix are now making that project more  difficult to deliver. The fact that Kilroot power station recently installed a  natural gas generator clearly shows the importance of the fuel to the area.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">6.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As other Members have said, the Utility Regulator is  independent, and we have to recognise the importance of his independence. In  recent times, he has been very helpful, particularly to the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and  Investment. It is important that the Committee is kept informed. I would like  the Utility Regulator to come to the Committee to explain why those  difficulties have been placed in the way of this major investment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, I continue to hope that consumers in Whitehead  will benefit from natural gas, bearing in mind that the pipeline just passes  them by. Anything that can be done by the Department would be greatly  appreciated.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hilditch</strong>:  I thank my colleague Mr Ross for securing the Adjournment debate. I welcome the  opportunity to support the views of my other colleagues in East   Antrim.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Northern Ireland  has the highest rate of fuel poverty in the United Kingdom, with one in three  households suffering its effects. Given that we are trying to eradicate fuel  poverty for all by 2016, now is a good time to extend the gas network  throughout Northern Ireland  in general and to East Antrim in particular.  That will give people more ways to heat their homes, bearing in mind some of  the latest figures available for that area &mdash; 23% of homes in Carrick and 36% of  those in Larne are unable to heat their homes adequately, which is quite a  statistic for an area that is part of the greater Belfast area.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It seems unfair that those homeowners on benefits and low  incomes are also missing out on applying for the full provision offered by the  warm homes scheme. Simply because they do not have the natural gas option, many  do not meet the warm homes scheme criteria. With its existing limited gas  network, East Antrim has one of the lowest  uptakes of help from the warm homes scheme. That is the remit of a different  Department, but it has an impact.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As has been pointed out by other Members, it is disappointing  that Phoenix Natural Gas will not be extending the licence to Whitehead in the  late spring of this year. However, perhaps some work may be done on that and  the situation will change as the year progresses, and the disappointment  suffered by people in some 1,800 properties may be overturned.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Homeowners and businesspeople in Whitehead are not the only  ones to be disappointed. For the majority of people, particularly those who  live in other rural areas of East Antrim,  heating their house or business with natural gas is not an option. Firmus  Energy has not yet reached the area, giving Phoenix the monopoly in areas that are  connected to the network. High fuel costs have forced people into fuel poverty,  and, if other gas companies were able to extend into the area, Phoenix might be forced to offer some more  competitive tariffs to our constituents.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Historically, natural gas is the most cost-effective fuel  available to more than 20 million industrial, commercial and residential  customers in Great Britain.  It is time that we helped to extend our gas network across constituencies such  as East Antrim. There are also health and  safety benefits to be considered when weighing up the reasons behind installing  gas supplies. In comparison to oil, the gas industry&rsquo;s charges, service  delivery and safety are highly regulated, and, notably, some companies offer  free annual boiler services to all of their customers within 20 working days of  receiving a request.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We need only consider the impact that our freezing weather  has had on oil heating systems throughout the Province in the past few weeks,  during which many schools have been forced to close due to heating system  breakdowns caused by freezing pipes, an impact that might be limited if other  forms of energy were used, including natural gas. In fact, I rarely hear of  anyone who complains that his or her gas system has broken down. However,  people who have oil central heating appear to have endless problems,  particularly in certain environmental conditions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Environmentally, compared with alternative fuels, natural  gas industrial and commercial customers prevented more than 6,250 tons of  sulphur dioxide from entering the atmosphere in 2007. That is equivalent to a  cloud of polluted air over one mile high covering the whole of Northern Ireland.  Domestic customers prevented 1,450 tons of sulphur dioxide from entering the  air. Those figures are not to be laughed at.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Extending our gas network will provide much-needed  employment and give us an opportunity to increase our skilled workforce, as  some Members outlined, and provide opportunities for apprenticeship placements.  Increasing the provision of gas will make Northern Ireland more profitable  for inward investors who are looking to locate their businesses in a  constituency with energy choice. That would be welcome.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, extending the gas network will help to address  fuel poverty. It will make East Antrim a  cleaner, healthier place to live, and it will give customers a reliable and  modern way of heating their homes at a competitive price, while, at the same  time, providing our engineering and construction industries with more  employment opportunities. I look forward to the Minister&rsquo;s response to this  serious issue, and I thank Mr Ross for securing the Adjournment debate.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  I, too, pass on my congratulations to the Minister on her temporary  appointment. However, I have a cautionary tale for her. My former Boys&rsquo; Brigade  captain was appointed temporarily for 25 years, so perhaps she should bear that  in mind.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank Mr Ross for securing today&rsquo;s debate. It is very  timely. Other Members have highlighted the importance of the power industry in East Antrim, with both Kilroot and Ballylumford power  stations situated there. They generate the vast majority of electricity not  only for Northern Ireland  but for the Republic   of Ireland, because  electricity is also transported across the border. That power station&rsquo;s  consumption is based on coal, gas and oil, and, from a security point of view  and a strategic point of view, it is worthwhile for our economy and for our  domestic users that it is so, particularly given the spell of bad weather that  we have just suffered. The availability of those alternative sources of power  is most welcome in the home and at work. This winter has highlighted the need  to retain and to develop adequate strategic reserves of all three fuels.  Therefore, as I said, today&rsquo;s debate is very timely.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Indeed, as we speak, areas of East   Antrim are being surveyed and explored for their potential to  develop underground storage caverns in Larne and Islandmagee, and that is very  welcome. If the predictions are as accurate as they are supposed to be, the  projects will secure the strategic supplies for the gas industry and domestic  distribution for Northern    Ireland into the foreseeable future. In the  event of any emergency situation, we will not find ourselves the hostages to  fortune that we have been in the past, as Members have already said, with  prices rising sharply, then going into a trough only to rise quickly again. The  gas industry should have a bit of stability. Therefore, it appears somewhat out  of step with that to learn that the recent application by Phoenix Natural Gas  to the regulator for the extension of the distribution centres to include  Whitehead has not, as yet, been granted. Surely the opportunity for my  constituents to access an alternative, sustainable and clean source of power  would fit well into the general trends across not only Northern Ireland  but across these islands and western Europe.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It appears that Phoenix Natural Gas had secured approval  for investment in a Whitehead extension from its parent company, and it had  prepared a detailed engineering and business plan to sustain that. In July  2009, it submitted to the regulator its application for extension to its  licences in Whitehead and, as previously mentioned, in the Saintfield area.  Initially, it appears that the regulator indicated in September that he was  minded &mdash; that is a word that I have heard somewhere before &mdash; to grant a licence  subject to certain conditions. Set in the context of DETI&rsquo;s completing its  evaluation across Northern    Ireland, that was perhaps very wise.  However, in October, Phoenix Natural Gas informed the regulator that the  conditions were unacceptable, and it now appears that, reluctantly, Phoenix has, on the foot  of the regulator&rsquo;s interpretation of the situation, formally withdrawn its  application.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I speak on behalf of my constituents in East Antrim &mdash; I am  sure that I speak for all the other Members who have spoken and, indeed, the  absent Member for East Antrim, who, no doubt,  is gainfully employed elsewhere &mdash; when I say that this has come as a bit of a  shock. We felt that being in proximity to the greater Belfast area would have some benefits for us.  Perhaps like Newtownabbey Borough Council, we have learned bitterly over the  years that sometimes it is a bad thing to be close to Belfast, because we can be ignored. I trust  that the folk in Whitehead are not being ignored in relation to this.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am hopeful, because Phoenix  appears to be remaining positive in its desire to extend the system into East Antrim and to include Whitehead. I trust that the  DETI review &mdash; again, we thank the Minister for her presence here today &mdash; will  be completed in a manner that will enable Phoenix to resubmit its proposals for  Whitehead, and that those will be acceptable in the eyes of the regulator.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Perhaps, in the post-DETI-reform era, the regulator&rsquo;s  interpretation of the situation will enable this to be an effective and  sustainable source of energy and to become available for both domestic and, as  has been said, commercial interests in this part of my East   Antrim constituency. I am sure that the Minister, given the other  hat that she is currently wearing, has no doubt that the backbone of our  economy, not just in East Antrim but in Northern Ireland, is the small and medium-sized  enterprises. That is where the most major benefits could be developed, allowing  smaller towns such as Whitehead to develop not just the domestic market but the  potential commercial market that we need to generate life and vibrancy in those  towns.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that the Minister will take on board my comments and  those of the other Members who have spoken and realise that there is unanimity  across the political parties, as there always is in East   Antrim when we are looking out for the benefit of our ratepayers  and our constituents.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment (Mrs Foster)</strong>: First  of all, I congratulate the Member on securing this Adjournment debate at a time  when we are discussing the strategic energy framework for Northern Ireland,  as has been referred to on a number of occasions. One of the chief goals in  that framework is the improvement of the security and diversity of our energy  supply. Alongside a commitment to increasing the proportion of our power that  is generated from renewable sources, the framework highlights the possibility  of extending Northern    Ireland&rsquo;s gas network as a key element in  our planning for the future. I do not want to go into all of the responses that  we have had to the framework, of which there have been many, but that is one of  the areas that has been very much welcomed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As we have heard, natural gas was first brought to Northern Ireland  in the very area that we are talking about today &mdash; in 1996, via the  Scotland/Northern Ireland undersea gas pipeline (SNIP). That was principally,  it must be said, to fuel electricity generation at the new combined cycle gas  turbine at Ballylumford. I have some sympathy with Mr Neeson&rsquo;s view that East Antrim is the epicentre of energy, because we have  Ballylumford, Kilroot and the SNIP there, and we are very much looking at gas  storage. I will say a bit more about that later.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Since 1996, the industry has steadily expanded. In addition  to being Northern Ireland&rsquo;s primary power generation source, gas now brings the  cleanest-burning fossil fuel to a large number of homes and businesses  throughout greater Belfast, including areas within East Antrim, and now,  thankfully, to many other areas of the Province. Over the last 10 years,  Phoenix Natural Gas has constructed significant gas networks and grown its  customer base in its licence areas in greater Belfast and Larne to approximately 130,000  connected customers. This has helped to establish natural gas as a major  competitive source of fuel for both the commercial and domestic energy sectors.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There has been further development of gas infrastructure in  the past five years, with the construction of a major gas transmission pipeline  to the north-west in 2004 &mdash; Mr Neeson made reference to that. It not only  supplies fuel to the power station at Coolkeeragh, outside Londonderry, but  brings gas to businesses and householders in urban areas such as Limavady, Londonderry, Coleraine, Ballymoney and Ballymena.  Construction of a gas transmission link with the Republic  of Ireland through the South/North  pipeline was completed in 2006, and that has provided security of supply in the  event of gas from Scotland  becoming unavailable. It has also led to natural gas being provided in the  towns and cities of Newry, Banbridge, Craigavon, Armagh  and Antrim.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">6.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Firmus Energy was referred to, and it has approximately  6,000 consumers in the areas adjacent to the north-west and South-North  pipelines and continues to roll out the gas infrastructure in its licence area.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, I want to turn to the East   Antrim constituency area. Natural gas been available in many parts  of the constituency, such as Larne and Carrickfergus, for some time. As part of  its original development plan for the greater Belfast area, Phoenix Natural Gas has been  supplying customers in those areas for a number of years. In 2007, Phoenix  Natural Gas applied for, and was granted, permission to expand the gas network  by bringing gas to Comber and to a quarry near Temple  in County Down. Although we have heard that gas is  available in major towns such as Larne and Carrickfergus, Mr Hilditch made the  point that there are parts of East Antrim that are less densely populated, and,  therefore, economically viable gas networks may not be possible. That is the  difficulty with a rural constituency. However, work that we are undertaking to  consider the potential for natural gas roll-out elsewhere will have direct  relevance to the extension of gas networks in the East   Antrim constituency.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am, of course, aware that the industry has been  considering how to have the roll-out of gas increased further, and Members  referred to the application by Phoenix Natural Gas to take natural gas to  Saintfield in County   Down and to Whitehead. As  Members said, applications were considered by the Utility Regulator, who has  the main responsibility for issuing gas conveyance and supply licences.  Unfortunately, it was not possible for Phoenix Natural Gas and the Utility  Regulator to reach agreement on the economic aspects of taking gas to both  towns, bearing in mind the cost for end users &mdash; a fact referred to by Mr Beggs  &mdash; and Phoenix Natural Gas withdrew its application. However, I am hopeful that  agreement can be reached to extend the natural gas network to provide customers  with natural gas as an additional source of energy supply for all the reasons  that Mr Hilditch outlined.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I said in previous debates, and as was highlighted in  the consultation on the new strategic energy framework, the Department is  conscious of the need to encourage the continued development of the gas  network, and it is taking several initiatives in relation to that. The  Department, along with the Utility Regulator, has commissioned consultants to  undertake a study to consider the technical issues and the costs and benefits  associated with extending the natural gas network in Northern Ireland,  including a feasibility study of potential pipeline routes and gas loads in  towns to the west and to the north-west of Northern Ireland, along with the  consideration of the associated costs and benefits. That study is almost  complete, and I am expecting a draft report shortly. It is important to say  that conclusions will provide information not only on those areas being  assessed in the study, but they will have direct relevance in relation to other  areas of Northern Ireland  for which proposals are being considered by the wider gas industry.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are clear benefits to extending the natural gas  network in Northern Ireland  &mdash; some of which have been articulated this evening &mdash; including diversity of  fuel supply and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. To that extent, we must  consider the future development of the natural gas network, where it is  economic to do so, to encourage a shift in the domestic use of oil to the more  efficient use of gas.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">So, in conjunction with the Utility Regulator and the major  gas stakeholders, a gas strategic development group has been established to  consider how the Northern    Ireland gas market can be further developed.  However, it must be stressed that the expansion of gas networks to towns in the  west and other part of the north-west, the East Antrim constituency, or  anywhere in Northern Ireland,  can take place only where it is economic to do so. An important part of the gas  extension study, and any consideration for extending the gas network, must be  an assessment of realisable gas loads in the respective areas. Indeed, there  are locations in the existing gas licence areas where take-up of natural gas  has been disappointing in some sectors. Perhaps we need to look at why that is  the case.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">An extension to the gas network means a greater number of  customers. That ensures that the cost of new gas networks is spread over a  larger customer base; hence that element of all customers&rsquo; gas bills is  reduced. However, we may conclude that it does not make economic sense to take  natural gas to all parts of Northern    Ireland, although were I able to do so, I  would, because gas is a marvellous energy resource. However, we must be  realistic and recognise the financial considerations. Other energy solutions  may be more appropriate for particular locations to which natural gas cannot be  provided.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Neeson</strong>:  Is the Department still committed to the postalisation of natural gas? That was  one of the main issues to emerge from the Committee&rsquo;s energy report about five  years ago.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Someone&rsquo;s mobile phone is switched on. He or she should switch it  off, because it is interfering with the transmission.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment</strong>:  The Department&rsquo;s view is that postalisation is still the way forward. However,  we are now in the consultation phase of the strategic energy framework, and I  am open to examining all those issues.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Many Members referred to gas storage. The further extension  of the natural gas network offers additional fuel choice to consumers, but the  security of energy supply is equally important. I am delighted by the continued  development of, and interest in, the underground gas storage facility in East Antrim, and by the progress in geological research  to establish whether the storage of natural gas in the deep underground caverns  created in salt strata is possible.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As everyone in the Chamber knows &mdash; those of us who are here  at the moment &mdash; we are entirely dependent on natural gas supplied from Great Britain,  with the bulk of our gas being used for power generation. A gas storage  facility in East Antrim would provide significant security of supply in the  event of a failure of the supply from GB, and it would allow for gas to be  purchased for storage during the summer months when wholesale gas prices tend  to be lower, thus creating a competitive advantage.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Recent geological research concentrated on the Larne and  Islandmagee areas. However, in September of last year, my Department completed  an off-shore geological study of rock formations below the seabed off the east  Antrim coast, with a view to providing geological information that might  encourage investment in the off-shore energy storage, including natural gas.  That is extremely positive for the East Antrim  area, and Members appreciate the continuing work being done on that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is encouraging to see how the natural gas industry has  expanded since its inception in 1996. It has done so as a result of the  considerable efforts of the key industry players such as Phoenix Natural Gas  and, more recently, Firmus Energy. I am also encouraged by the ongoing research  by companies into the potential for gas storage in East   Antrim. I fully realise the significant benefits offered by  natural gas; it is the cleanest burning fossil fuel, and it is convenient for  customers.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As the Minister responsible for energy, I am committed to  exploring how the supply of natural gas can be extended to other areas in Northern Ireland.  That would give consumers a greater choice of fuels and enhance the security of  supply. That is evidenced by the ongoing joint work on the gas network study  and by the establishment of a strategic gas network development group.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At the beginning of my response, I spoke about the  timeliness of the debate given the development of a new strategic energy  framework for Northern    Ireland. It is an opportunity for all of us  to contribute to putting in place the vision for meeting our prospective energy  needs. We often talk about the electricity grid infrastructure, but the  extension of the gas network is a key element of our framework for the future,  and I welcome the opportunity to speak about it this afternoon.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Adjourned at 6.24 pm.</p>
