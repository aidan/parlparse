		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The Assembly met at 10.30 am (Mr Speaker in the  Chair).</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Members observed two minutes&rsquo; silence.</p>
	      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="1"></a>Assembly Business</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. I am wondering about the competency of the  motion on the Youth Service&rsquo;s budget, given that one of its main <span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt; ">components refers to cuts that were proposed in  the draft</span> <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt; ">Budget. Now that the Budget  has been finalised, I would</span> like to know whether the motion remains  competent.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  It remains very much a competent motion, and consideration of competency is the  only concern that I have when motions come before the House.</p>
	      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="2"></a>Executive Committee Business</p>
		    <p class="H5StageHeading">Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill: Final Stage</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mr McGimpsey)</strong>: I beg to move</p>
		    <p class="Q3Motion">That the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill [NIA 2/07] do  now pass.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">This new legislation reflects our desire to improve  primary-care services for people in Northern Ireland. It introduces  several measures that will enhance patient safety, and it provides for a new  dental contract that will allow local commissioning of a high-quality dental  service that is responsive to the needs and wishes of patients.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Speaker, as you are aware, the clause in the Bill that  would have enabled smoking by a performer during a performance has been  removed. That clause was inserted into the Bill at the behest of the previous  Administration. Members will recall that I advised the Assembly during the  Consideration Stage of the Bill that, after considering carefully the arguments  for and against a smoking exemption, I was not convinced that it was necessary  for actors to actually smoke in order to portray an act realistically. I tabled  an amendment to the Bill, which Members endorsed. I should point out that the  Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety was also opposed to the  inclusion in the Bill of a smoking exemption.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank those Members who contributed to the Bill&rsquo;s passage  through the Assembly. In particular, I thank members of the Health Committee  for painstakingly considering each of the Bill&rsquo;s clauses and for their comprehensive report, which was published last  October.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As it now stands, the draft Bill introduces provisions that  are broadly in line with those that are already in <span style="letter-spacing:-.2pt; ">force in the rest of the UK.  Those provisions were subject</span> to a wide-ranging consultation exercise in  Northern Ireland,  and I am pleased to say that respondents to that were generally in favour of  the new policies.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mrs I Robinson)</strong>:  When the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill was laid before the Assembly in June 2007, it contained three <span style="letter-spacing:-.05pt; ">main provisions: the first related to the  regulation of th</span>e four family  practitioner services &mdash; general practitioners, opticians, pharmacists  and dentists; the second dealt with proposals to set out a legislative base for  a new contract for dentists; and the third was the proposal to permit smoking  by those taking part in performances.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am pleased that the  proposal for a smoking exemption was  dropped at Consideration Stage; and, as the Minister said, the Committee  can justifiably claim some of the credit for having that clause removed from  the Bill. The Committee listened to both sides of the argument on the smoking  exemption, and all members agreed to oppose the clause.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">During the Committee Stage of the Bill, 24 organ&shy;isations  responded to the Committee&rsquo;s request for written submissions. Although many  views expressed related to smoking exemption, there was also a number of  concerns about the other provisions.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In addition to the written evidence obtained, the Committee  heard oral evidence on the regulation of family practitioner services and on  the future of dental services from the British Medical Association, the British  Dental Association, the Pharmaceutical Society of Northern Ireland and the  Health and Social Services Council.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee noted that the Bill will give the Department  powers to make regulations in a number of areas,  such as the conditions under which the suspension of an individual  practitioner can take place; the details of rights and obligations under the  new dental services contract; and the criteria under which persons not  ordinarily resident in Northern Ireland will not be charged for services.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I ask the Minister to ensure that concerns expressed during  the passage of the Bill, particularly those voiced during the Committee Stage and  recorded in the Committee&rsquo;s report, are taken into consideration when the  Department uses those powers to make regulations.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee is content to support the Bill and looks  forward to receiving policy proposals for the detailed regulations in due course.  The Committee will wish to scrutinise those regulations carefully.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Buchanan</strong>:  I know that the Committee will be scrutinising regulations relating to the  Bill. However, I wish to raise a few points with the Minister today. As regards  suspensions, will the Minister agree that the Department should seek to  facilitate discussions at local level before a suspension is considered? Will  he also agree that suspension should never be a knee-jerk reaction? What  recourse will there be for primary-care practitioners who are found to have  been wrongly suspended, and what will happen in a case in which an individual  is suspended locally but not by the General Medical Council? Does the Minister  accept that those issues must be resolved  before any legislation can be finalised, and will he do what he can to  convey that message as the legislation is developed?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>:  I, too, support the Bill. My question is in the same vein as those of my  colleague. Will the Minister reassure us that suspension of health professionals  will not be based on reasonable doubt or possibilities; that there would have  to be hard facts; and that it would be taken as a last resort? I also support  the removal of the smoking exemption from the Bill.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  I thank the Members who have contributed to the debate for their remarks.  Subject to the Bill being passed, further consultation will take place during the development of subordinate  legislation that will be required to introduce provisions such as those  relating to suspension. I am happy to endorse the points made by Mr Buchanan.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
		    <p class="Q3Motion">That the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill [NIA Bill  2/07] do now pass.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I propose that the House takes its ease before we move on to the next item of  business on the Order Paper.</p>
	      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="3"></a>ASSEMBLY BUSINESS</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order, Members. We are unable to move on to the next two items of business on  the Order Paper because the proposers of the motions are not in the House.  Therefore, I propose, by leave of the House, to suspend the sitting for 20  minutes.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. Can you indicate, when business is resumed in  20 minutes, whether the two proposers who are named on the Order Paper will be  in the House?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  In 20 minutes&rsquo; time, we will move to item 3 on the Order Paper, which is the  motion in the name of Dolores Kelly. I hope that, by that time, the Member will  be in the House.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. Can you clarify that, after 20 minutes, we  will move on to Dolores Kelly&rsquo;s motion &mdash; Exploitation of Migrant Labour and  Human Trafficking &mdash; or are we giving the  proposers of both motions a chance to turn up?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: I  have suspended the sitting for 20 minutes, after which time we will move on to  Dolores Kelly&rsquo;s motion.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. That being the case &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I am not taking any further points of order on the issue. I am trying to help  Members, which is why I have decided to suspend the sitting for 20 minutes.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The sitting was suspended at 10.42 am.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">11.02 am</p>
	      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="4"></a>PRIVATE MEMBERS&rsquo; BUSINESS</p>
		    <p class="H4StageHeading">Exploitation of Migrant Labour and Human Trafficking</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Business Committee has agreed to allow one hour and 30 minutes for the  debate. The proposer of the motion will  have 10 minutes to propose and 10 minutes for the winding-up speech. All  other Members who wish to speak will have five minutes.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I will take your point of order after the motion is read.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Two amendments have been received and are published on the Marshalled List. The  proposer of each amendment will have 10 minutes to propose and five minutes for  the winding-up speech.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
		    <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly expresses concern at the exploitation of  migrant labour and the growth of human trafficking; and calls for the  ratification of the 1990 United Nations Migrant Rights Convention and the 2005 Council of Europe Convention on Action  against the Trafficking in Human Beings.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. I realise that unusual circumstances were  created this morning because of the absence of Mr Wilson at the time when his  motion was due to be taken. However, in circumstances in which an amendment  appears, suspicion will be around, unless  some further explanation is given,  that that creates a precedent whereby a Member can deliberately collapse  their own motion, having recognised the serious flaws and contradictions in  their position that a debate would expose.  In circumstances in which motions  and amendments can only be withdrawn by leave of the House, a dangerous  precedent is being created. That should not simply pass as being one of those  things.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">On a further point of order, Mr Speaker. A difficult  situation could have arisen in which Mrs Kelly would not have been here to  address her motion, perhaps because of another meeting. Where would that have  left Assembly business? That matter needs further and serious reflection.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  If, for whatever reason, the second motion had fallen, I would have dealt with  that appropriately, as I have dealt with the first motion. I am happy to come  back to the Member on his first point of order.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. I know that the leader of the SDLP leads a  difficult party, so perhaps he has become paranoid. He has displayed that this  morning. Can I make it quite clear that there was &mdash; <em>[Interruption.]</em></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. That is not an appropriate point of order.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  On a further point of order, Mr Speaker. Is it in order for the paranoid leader  of the SDLP to make allegations that are not true? I was held up by traffic. I  am here; I am happy to debate the motion, I have no intention of having it  collapsed, and it will be presented again.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. I ask the Member to take his seat. We spoke to the Chief Whip of the  Democratic Unionist Party, Lord Morrow, and he confirmed that Mr Wilson was  held up in traffic.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Is it the same point of order or a new one?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  It is the same point of order. Perhaps it would be better practice for two  Members to table a motion of this character, so that at least one would be  present to move it. The motion related to funding for youth services, which is  a crucial issue, and we needed to debate it this morning.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. On several occasions, the Business Committee has encouraged Members to  put at least two names to a motion. Unfortunately, that did not happen with  this motion.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  Further to that point of order, Mr Speaker. Given that 11.00 am was given as  the indicative time for the motion to be moved &mdash; and I was in the House at  10.45 am &mdash; it should have been moved at that time. Members were in their  places, and we could have remained within the indicative time that was laid  down by the Business Committee.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I have raised this issue before: only indicative timings are provided. It is  Members&rsquo; responsibility to be here in the morning. They should not adhere to  the indicative timings; we all know that we sometimes get through business  quicker than anticipated.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  Further to that point of order, Mr Speaker. Members who have come from rural  constituencies &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. I am not prepared to take any further points of order on the issue; we  have dealt with it well.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  The inspirational civil rights leader Martin Luther King declared &ldquo;I have a  dream&rdquo;, as he articulated the hopes of Black African Americans in the early  1960s &mdash; hopes of equality, tolerance and opportunity. Those were also the words  on the lips of the people who boarded the emigrant ships &mdash; or who now board the  Boeings and Airbuses that have replaced the ships &mdash; to seek their fortune in some foreign land of opportunity.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Ireland  is increasingly becoming the land that emigrants choose to seek their fortune.  However, like many Irish people before them who emigrated to England, they  are sometimes welcome only for the jobs that they take on &mdash; jobs that are too  dirty and low paid for our own people. They are welcome only as workers. The  Germans discovered that when they encouraged many poor Italian and Turkish  immigrants to work in the booming industries of the Ruhr  in the 1960s and 1970s. As Max Frisch said:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;We recruited workers, but got people.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">If we think about the people who have come to our  part of the world, we can bring to mind the Portuguese man who works the night  shift for low wages, shivering in a processing plant in mid Ulster, the  Lithuanian family who pay an exorbitant rent for slum accommodation in  Dungannon, the Nigerian couple who were burned out of their home in Donegal  Pass, and the Chinese girl who was murdered while working as a prostitute in  north Belfast.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">A report that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions  commissioned last year not surprisingly confirmed much of what people knew or  suspected: a growing number of migrant workers in Northern Ireland are being  exploited and experience widespread racism and sectarianism. What land of  opportunity, what fortune to be sought? Martin Luther King&rsquo;s dream has turned  into a nightmare for some. Yet, the actions of Martin Luther King and the civil  rights movement in the States have led to what is happening today, which is  that African Americans may decide who will be the next President of the USA. Indeed,  the SDLP was born out of the civil rights movement.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">That example proves that we do not know what the future  holds, because the pace of change moves so quickly. Enoch Powell, who was  another famous politician of the 1960s, predicted &mdash; unpopularly at the time &mdash;  in his &ldquo;rivers of blood&rdquo; speech of April 1968 that much of what was happening  in Britain related to the arrival of unforeseen numbers of immigrants.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Although Powell was  motivated by a racist perspective on who should and who should not  constitute the British people, he predicted that immigration &mdash; if not properly  managed and catered for with regard to employment, conditions, health and  education, for instance &mdash; would lead to racial conflict between communities  and, ultimately, to bloodshed.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Members are aware of the reasons behind the growing  popularity of the British National Party (BNP) among poor white people in Britain. No one  was prepared for the situations in many English towns and cities today. Where  are the school places, hospital beds, adequate social housing, language  services and community and social workers to cope with the unforeseen  population influx and growth? What problems are being stored up for the future?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Is Northern    Ireland to suffer the same fate? Will we  close our eyes to the low wages, poor conditions, racism and sexual  exploitation that are visited upon our immigrant population? How long will it  be until we also reap the whirlwind? We must prepare for the future and begin  to make proper planned provision for the growing trend of inward migration, and  build that into our projected plans and  budgets for all Departments for the coming years. That must be achieved  and implemented through horizontal measures based upon legislation &mdash; especially  our equality and human rights legislation.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We, as a responsible Assembly, must recognise and  appreciate the difficulties and challenges that have been &mdash; and which will  continue to be &mdash; presented to us in welcoming so many people from diverse cultures  and backgrounds into our midst. The Assembly will set the tone for our future  relationships with those who come to share this island with us.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We must not only plan for the future but ensure that the  present is not a basis for storing up problems for the future through the  actions of unscrupulous and cruel employers, landlords, pimps, gangmasters and  traffickers in inhumanity. The Assembly must send out the message that such  exploitation will not be tolerated and that  where it is found and uncovered, the perpetrators will be brought to book and made to face the full  rigour of the law.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In order that the authorities have sufficient power and  support to address such maltreatment, exploitation and trafficking, we must  seek to press the Government at Westminster to face up to the challenge and  adopt the United Nations Convention on the Protection of the Rights of all  Migrants and Members of their Families, which the motion calls for. The  convention exists to protect migrant workers, and it sets the moral standard to  which its signatory countries should adhere. Ratification  of the convention will mean that lawmakers adopt the terms of the  convention and undertake to incorporate them into our national laws.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The convention on migrants&rsquo; rights is one of the core international  human rights treaties. It is the first international instrument to provide  specific recognition of the fundamental  human rights of all migrant workers and their families. It aims at  unifying the international legal standards of protection for migrant workers  and protects the rights of all migrants. The convention does not create any new  rights for migrant workers; it simply ensures that migrant workers and their  families enjoy the same human rights, equality of treatment, and working and  life conditions as we nationals do.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The rights that will be accorded to migrant workers and  their families in Northern Ireland are: the right to life, liberty and the  right to private family life; the right not to be subjected to cruel, inhumane  or degrading treatment; the right not to be  required to perform forced labour;  the right to freedom of religion and thought and the right to hold  opinions freely; the right to medical care; and the right to education for  their children.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Northern    Ireland has a Human Rights Commission and  legislation on equality that is overseen by the Equality Commission. We of all  people have no reason not to support the terms of the convention. Surely we do  not wish to be exposed as hypocrites for demanding the most progressive  equality legislation under the Good Friday Agreement to ensure equal treatment  across our two communities, only to deny it to other communities who have since  the time of the agreement established themselves on the island.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We are unique in western Europe in that we are emerging  from 30 years of conflict in which people were subject not only to inequalities  but to ongoing breaches of basic human rights, including the most basic of  human rights &mdash; the right to life. From such an experience, we should have  lessons for others and the opportunity to be an example to others. No European  country has adopted the convention. It is easy to find and fabricate all manner  of reasons for procrastination in doing what is, by any standards, the right  thing. What is our excuse?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We know better than  others the true cost of inequality and disharmony between communities.  Therefore, we must call on Parliament to adopt and ratify the Convention  without delay. The Assembly should support the Convention in principle and send  a clear message to Westminster  from this unique part of these islands. Our  message should be that the Assembly wishs to be on record as supporting  the Convention because Members believe that it is our moral duty to do so.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">11.15 am</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In the conclusion to its report, &lsquo;Migrant Workers and their  Families in Northern Ireland&rsquo;,  the Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU) suggests that the Assembly has  autonomy on employment rights and has a unique opportunity to create a model of  best practice. In addition, ICTU suggests that there should be a formal  investigation into the activities of recruitment agencies that recruit migrant  workers to Northern Ireland.  Therefore, the relevant Minister should take on board the issues raised in that  report and, indeed, set about creating a model of best practice. That would be  the most concrete demonstration of the Assembly&rsquo;s support for migrant workers&rsquo;  rights as set out in the UN Convention and would show our earnestness when  pressing the Westminster Parliament to ratify it.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I recall that a report, &lsquo;Migrant Workers in Northern Ireland&rsquo;, was produced in 2004 by Bell, Jarman and Lefebvre from the Institute for Conflict  Research in the University   of Ulster, Jordanstown.  That report was commissioned by OFMDFM&rsquo;s equality directorate. What happened as  a result of that report? Would it be appropriate for the report to be updated  in order to ensure that our knowledge on those issues is comprehensive, up to  date, and can inform policy in the relevant areas?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I will conclude by addressing the closely associated issue  of human trafficking. The European Commission stated that:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Trafficking in human beings as defined by EU law is  not only a crime aiming at the sexual or labour exploitation of persons, mainly  at the sexual exploitation of women and children. It is also a fundamental  violation of human rights.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The Council of Europe Convention on Action against  Trafficking in Human Beings stated that:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Trafficking in human beings is a major problem in Europe today. Annually, thousands of people, largely  women and children, fall victim to trafficking for sexual exploitation or other  purposes.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Given that my time is running out, I will finish by  saying that, although the SDLP supports the motion, it will accept the Alliance  Party&rsquo;s amendment because it adds to the motion. Regrettably, however, the SDLP  does not accept the Ulster Unionist Party&rsquo;s amendment tabled by Mr McFarland  because it dilutes the aims of the motion.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: I beg  to move amendment No 1: Insert after &lsquo;Assembly&rsquo;:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;recognises  that immigration is good for Northern    Ireland and positive for the vast majority  of immigrants;&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">and insert in line 2 after &lsquo;trafficking;&rsquo;:</p>
		    <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;calls on the Minister for Employment and Learning to  introduce a proactive programme of protecting the workplace rights of migrant  workers in Northern Ireland;&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I commend the Member for tabling the motion to debate two  issues that are of growing concern to the public. I would have preferred to  discuss the exploitation of migrant workers and human trafficking as two  separate motions, because they are different issues, each deserving the  attention it would generate in a full debate. However, given the constraints of  the motion, I will begin with the issue of migrant workers.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is estimated that, since 2003, 40,000 to 50,000 migrant  workers have come to take up jobs that could not be filled locally. Various  research findings &mdash; including the Concordia paper, &lsquo;Migrant Workers in Northern  Ireland&rsquo; &mdash; indicate that the overall impact of migration into Northern Ireland  has, in addition to the benefits derived by  having a more inter-cultural society, been positive to both the local  and regional economies.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Migrant workers have not only met our labour shortages in  healthcare and local industries such as construction,  agriculture, food processing and hospitality, but have prevented  hospital wards from being closed and meat plants from being relocated  elsewhere, which would have resulted in job losses for local people. Migrants  do not come here to diminish our prosperity, but to enhance it. The Institute for  Public Policy Research confirmed that, far from being a drain on the public  purse, immigrants contribute more than their fair share fiscally.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Having more people means more tax revenue and service  users. In addition, migrant workers regenerate local economies by paying for food, housing and services. For  example, we can reliably state that several schools would have closed had it  not been for the children of migrant workers.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The argument that demographic change has led to pressures  on public services is fundamentally a matter of inadequate planning by public  authorities. That is what the Alliance  Party meant by highlighting sustainable public services in its response to the  Programme for Government.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">A large proportion of migrant workers have had good experiences  in finding employment and housing and in gaining access to services.  Unfortunately, many Members have had to deal with instances of abuse of  employment and housing rights, difficulties in accessing public services, and  racism &mdash; both direct and institutional. A raft of literature produced by trade  unions, organisations such as Action Now to Integrate Minority Access to  Equality (Animate) and others documents the issue of migrant labour  exploitation.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I support the call for the ratification of the UN International  Convention on the Protection of the Rights of all Migrant Workers and Members  of their Families. It is shameful that the UK and Irish Govern&shy;ments have not  yet signed up to it. In fact, most of the countries that have ratified it are  countries of origin of migrant workers. Apart from the United Nations Convention, a range of international instruments  to which the UK is a contracting party apply to migrant workers, as well as  existing domestic law on employment and equality. It is clear that existing  legislation has not been rigorously enforced.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Although immigration is an excepted matter, the Assembly  should express its concern about the many new immigration policies that focus  on the economic benefit that can be obtained from migrants rather than protecting their entitlement to human rights and  dignity. There is much that we can do. The Executive must urgently  approve the draft migrant workers&rsquo; strategy and action plan produced by the Northern Ireland  racial equality forum&rsquo;s thematic subgroup on migrant workers, which is led by  the Department for Employ&shy;ment and Learning. The key strands of the draft  strategy presented to the forum in 2006 include the development of information;  effective inspection and enforcement of employment rights; research and data gathering; and promotion of best practice.  Furthermore, the Executive must  gather pace on producing the second departmental action plan of the  racial equality strategy, which is almost a year overdue. Both action plans can  address the problems experienced by migrant workers on a daily basis and  improve their quality of life.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is such an irony that although we have just celebrated  the bicentenary of the abolition of the slave trade, the global problem of  human trafficking &mdash; modern-day slavery &mdash; continues. It is estimated that some  4,000 individuals are trafficked into the UK each year for the purpose of  enforced prostitution. The victims are predominantly women and children from  poor countries, or countries experiencing unrest. After bringing them into the  country illegally, the traffickers use violence, threats and coercion to force  their victims to work against their will. In a submission to the UK  Parliament&rsquo;s Joint Committee on Human Rights, which examined human trafficking,  Women&rsquo;s Aid stated that through its research, it had discovered between 50 and  100 women and minors who might have been trafficked into Northern Ireland.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am very pleased that the PSNI now has a special team working on human trafficking as part of a  UK-wide programme. The team recently charged two men in connection with  trafficking. The police are aware of 60 to 70 brothels in the Province, up to  10 or 12 of which are operating in south Belfast.  Police sources have also determined that Northern   Ireland is a transit route from Dublin  to other parts of the UK  and vice versa. It is believed that paramilitary groups with links to overseas  gangs, such as the so-called snakeheads, may also be involved in human  trafficking here.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I support the call for the UK to ratify the Council of Europe  Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings as early as possible,  now that it has signed up to it.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that the British Government set a target  date for ratification and publish an action plan. The protection of victims  should be incorporated into the legislative framework, and trafficked persons  should be treated as victims in need of protection, not as illegal immigrants  who will face immediate deportation.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In its report on human  trafficking, the UK Parliament&rsquo;s Joint Committee on Human Rights made a  compre&shy;hensive list of recommendations, including: prevention in source  countries; measures to reduce demand in the sex trade within the UK; proper  investigation, prosecution and punishment of traffickers; and protection of  victims. It is also important to raise awareness of the problem and to provide  training for immigration and law-enforce&shy;ment officers. Statutory agencies  should work with the voluntary sector to provide support and shelter for  victims. I call on the Assembly to support amendment No 1.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McFarland</strong>:  I beg to move amendment No 2: Leave out all after &ldquo;Assembly&rdquo; and insert:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;urges the Executive to take all necessary measures to  address both the exploitation of migrant labour and human trafficking; and  welcomes the commitment by the United Kingdom Government to ratify the 2005  Council of Europe Convention on Action against the Trafficking in Human  Beings.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank Mrs Kelly for securing today&rsquo;s debate. Exploitation of migrant labour and the growth of  human trafficking are two of the most serious problems facing our  increasingly globalised world. Northern    Ireland is, of course, not immune to those  issues. However, the motion is flawed, as it unhelpfully conflates the 1990  United Nations migrants&rsquo; rights convention with taking action against human  trafficking.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Migrant labour is a  reality in our globalised economy. Indeed, one person in 35 is an  international migrant. The United Kingdom  &mdash; and Northern Ireland,  which is within it &mdash; has benefited from such migration, and it is likely that  it will continue to do so in the future. However, while the majority of migrant  labour is legitimate and beneficial to all parties, exploitation cannot be  ignored. Exploitation destroys the dignity and rights of those who suffer from  it, but the dignity and morality of our society is also jeopardised.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Unfortunately, the Ulster Unionist Party cannot support the  motion, as the UK Government has stated that the 1990 United Nations convention  is not com&shy;patible with UK  immigration law. The main difficulty is that, under the convention, the UK  Government would not be able to control the conditions under which migrant  workers can stay in the country. To quote the official response of the UK  Government to the House of Commons International Development Select Committee&rsquo;s report on migration and  development:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The UN Convention would therefore allow migrant  workers to circumvent current immigration controls and remain in the UK even when they are not fulfilling the conditions  on which they were granted entry into the UK (pursuing the specified  employment).&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The ramifications of the UN convention would put  extra stress on already strained public services. The flaws in the convention  are highlighted by a UNESCO study showing that only 37 countries have ratified  the convention &mdash; the fewest of any of the instruments viewed by the Office of  the High Commissioner for Human Rights. More significantly, not one of the  major migrant-receiving states, including the Republic of Ireland,  is among the parties to the convention. It appears senseless for us to call on  the UK Government to do something that would put further stresses on public  services and place us out of line with the international community.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, the Ulster  Unionist Party urges the Minister to do all in his power to ensure that  the exploitation of migrant labour is stamped out in Northern Ireland. We have been  encouraged by the Minister&rsquo;s commitment, in the recent debate on agency  workers, to crack down on rogue employers  and to increase powers of inspection and enforcement.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Human trafficking is such a serious problem that we must now consider it to be a new form of human  slavery that is too frequently  focused on the sexual exploitation and abuse of women and children.  Trafficking from eastern Europe, Asia and Africa  into western Europe is becoming an increasingly alarming problem. UNICEF has  estimated that 1&middot;2 million children are trafficked each year. Criminal gangs  are making millions of pounds by peddling misery and destruction.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">11.30 am</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">People are often lulled into being trafficked by promises  of a better life, only to end up with a lifetime of desolation. That is an  indictment of both the trafficking gangs and society. Human trafficking will be  tackled successfully only when the demand from the West is in decline. Although  it is not considered to be a major problem in Northern Ireland, that could be  largely due to ignorance. I welcome the fact that the PSNI will take part in  Operation Pentameter 2, which seeks to assess the level of human trafficking in  Northern Ireland.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Human trafficking is a prime example of why all sections of  society should co-operate fully with the PSNI and of how the failure to do so  can lead to the continued suffering of others. Therefore the Ulster Unionist  Party welcomes the UK Government&rsquo;s recent commitment to ratifying the 2005  Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings.  That substantial convention will help to prevent human trafficking and to  protect the rights of its victims.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I urge the Minister and the Executive to work with their  counterparts in London and with the Northern  Ireland Office to do everything that they can to implement effectively the  measures contained in the UK  legislation when it comes into force.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Spratt</strong>: I too thank Mrs Kelly for securing today&rsquo;s debate, and I  support Mr McFarland&rsquo;s amendment. Human trafficking may not strike many people  as a particularly serious issue in Northern Ireland, but it is a major  problem. If we do not take remedial action now, it could become a huge problem  that we will struggle to address.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is 200 years since  the great British parliamentarian William Wilberforce finally secured a  majority in Parliament to make slave-trading illegal in the British   Empire. However, that was not the end of his political struggle,  as it took a further 27 years to achieve a ban on the ownership of slaves. In  the intervening period, Wilberforce brought to the attention of the wider  public the broader issues of slavery: the terrible conditions in which slaves  were transported; the abuses that they had to suffer; and the mental and  physical anguish that they endured.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Today, the Assembly is debating human trafficking, which is, in essence, the twenty-first century  equivalent of slavery in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.  Members have a responsibility to make the public aware of the problems faced by  those trapped by such terrible crimes and to do everything that we can to  ensure that, as Wilberforce brought an end to slavery, an end is brought to  human trafficking.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">My South Belfast constituency has one of the worst records  in Northern Ireland  for human trafficking and prostitution. It is a shameful statistic that the  bulk of brothels that operate using immigrants are based there. New apartment developments provide a perfect  location, short-term leases are available and there are shortfalls in  the rental agreements. The organised gangs who run the brothels create scores  of victims, who are pre&shy;dominantly vulnerable women and children. The Assembly  must send out a strong message to the organisers of the vice trade in Northern Ireland  that there will be a starting point of zero tolerance of their activities.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In the years ahead, Belfast  could become a target for massive levels of human trafficking, particularly for  the purposes of prostitution. With that in mind, steps must be taken to prevent  its further development.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The economy is becoming increasingly dependent on migrant  workers, who make up an invaluable section of the labour market. They play a  massive part in developing the Northern    Ireland economy in sectors such as  agriculture, catering and construction. As such, they deserve to be afforded  the rights that will protect them from exploitation. I am sure that all Members  have been contacted by migrant workers from their constituencies, who were in  great distress due to their exploitation in the workplace.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Many migrants who have work permits receive well below the  wage that is stated in their contracts. They fear  that if they voice their concerns, their work permits will be rescinded; that fear prevents many from  coming forward. It is vital that we protect those workers.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is a poor reflection on the Government at Westminster that the  Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings has  still not been ratified one year after they signed it. That massive step  forward has yet to be taken. I urge the Government to press ahead with a  timetable for ratification, and, indeed, to consider ways to address this issue  further.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Measures such as a UK border police force should be  examined. Stronger punishments for those caught engaging in human trafficking  should be enforced. We must get to grips with this problem and protect those  who are vulnerable to exploitation.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I support the motion as amended by Mr McFarland, and I urge  the Minister to do all that he can with the Government  at Westminster  to ensure that the Convention is ratified as soon as possible.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat. I congratulate Dolores Kelly on tabling the motion, and I  welcome the opportunity to speak about this matter. Protecting the rights of  migrant workers and objecting to human trafficking are important and should be  dealt with by the Assembly.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in believes that the amendments are unnecessary; the motion itself contains what is  required. However, we recognise the  Alliance Party&rsquo;s amendment as it is  recognised that migrant workers are an important aspect of the economy here and that they add to the social fabric  by increasing cultural diversity. The Ulster Unionist Party&rsquo;s amendment is an  opt-out that tries to get away from  protecting the rights of migrant workers.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Migrant workers have been good for the economy. It could be  argued that many businesses in areas such as Dungannon and Cookstown would not  have located there had it not been for migrant workers. Other businesses may  have relocated when they were expanding because they would not have had the  necessary workforce. Therefore, migrant workers are important to the local  economy, the structure of society and for the developments of those areas,  provided that development is monitored correctly.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Dungannon and Cookstown have benefited from attracting many  migrant workers. Dungannon and South Tyrone Borough Council took early action to ensure that those workers were  protected, particularly with reference to the agencies that were employing them. It was important to ensure that  workers were being properly looked after, particularly with regard to  housing. There were instances of too many workers sharing houses, the doubling  up of houses, and the multi-use of houses without any protection for the  workers. It is important that legislation is in place to ensure that councils  and this Assembly can take immediate action when they become aware of such  problems.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Dungannon and South Tyrone Borough Council faced resistance  &mdash; some of the agencies did not want any protections for workers and did not  want the council controlling how many people should be able to stay in one house.  There were situations in which two groups of workers shared the same house &mdash;  those working nightshifts and those working dayshifts. That was total  exploitation of those workers, as they were not provided with proper  facilities.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Planning is important in order to deal with this matter.  Until now, no plans have been in place to deal with new situations, such as the  number of apartments required, the rise in  population, and waste-management structures and their delivery. Such  issues need to be addressed to provide for the extra workers who arrive, and to  ensure that different ideas and cultures are embraced.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that the Assembly sends out the message  that migrant workers are welcome, that they have been beneficial to the economy  and to society, and that we oppose all forms of exploitation.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In some instances, agencies could be accused of human  trafficking because of their failure to look after people whom they brought  here to work and contribute to the economy. It is important to monitor the situation  continuously and to bring our legislation into line with European and international legislation on human  rights. Sinn F&eacute;in calls on the British and Irish Governments to sign up  to such legislation in order to ensure maximum protection for migrant workers.  Too often, the British Government, on  security grounds, have derogated from European and international human  rights legislation, which exists to protect the rights of migrant workers.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We are part of the European Union and recognise the  European Convention on Human Rights, so we must adopt all aspects of human  rights legislation to ensure that workers in future generations are protected,  that this is a friendly and welcoming place for migrant workers and that we  build a multicultural society. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Newton</strong>: I  will take a slightly different approach to other Members. I want to speak about  exploitation, at home and abroad, and the  responsibilities of businesses and individuals, before paying tribute to  police forces throughout the United    Kingdom. I support the amend&shy;ment tabled by  Mr McFarland.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am hugely concerned about the growth of human  trafficking, particularly that involving young children and women, which, like  the exploitation of migrant labour in general, is an evil trade. I am a member  of the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and  Investment, and I encourage those who want to manufacture abroad &mdash; a growing  trend in Northern Ireland  &mdash; to consider the circumstances under which their profits are made. That is not  to say that profit is a dirty word, but profit that is made at the cost of  human misery should be rejected.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I support the Organised Crime Task Force and other UK police forces in their work to address the  worldwide crime empires that control the counterfeiting of branded  merchandise. That nefarious activity &mdash; often likened to Del Boy-type behaviour  &mdash; is a multi-billion-pound, sinister trade. The heavy trade losses that  regional businesses continue to suffer because of the illegal activities of  counterfeiters is not the only price of such activity: child slavery, people  smuggling, gang warfare and terrorism are integral parts of that unlawful activity. That is a large price to pay to  facilitate bargain hunters in Northern Ireland. Everyone likes a  bargain, but if shoppers do business with those who sell phoney goods such as  garments, CDs, sports goods and handbags, they contribute to the exploitation  of children and migrants.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  Does the Member agree that the Home Office figure of 1,420 for the number of  people trafficked into the UK  for prostitution last year is unacceptable? Does he also agree that the 2005  Council of Europe Convention on Action against the Trafficking in Human Beings  is a step in the right direction but that it will work only if the public help  the PSNI to address the issue?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Newton</strong>: I  thank the Member for that intervention and wholeheartedly concur with those  statements.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Innocent shoppers who turn a blind eye contribute to the  global crime wave that is often directed from sweatshops in the Far East.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">11.45 am</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Not only do local businesses suffer the loss of trade, but  purchasing fake goods contributes to the suffering of the children and adults  who live in poverty or who are exploited by unscrupulous gangs. Those gangs  will go to any lengths for limitless profits. All the evils of the  counterfeiting industry are well documented and extreme evidence of cruelty is commonplace. In support of local retailers and manufacturers, more  emphasis must be placed on stamping  out the fake-goods industry. Profits from illegal trade fund at-home  criminals, and para&shy;military groups also gain from that nefarious business.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The justifiable outcry when it became known that the  retailing group Gap &mdash; and I pay tribute to the company and the action that it took  &mdash; had goods made by children in slave-like conditions should be even more vocal  against the counterfeit trade that takes place off the back of a lorry or on  the shifty market stalls that operate in our Province and throughout the UK.  For a shopper&rsquo;s bargain in Belfast,  many children will pay a heavy price in Far Eastern sweatshops.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">My time is almost gone, Mr Speaker. Sorry, I had forgotten  that I had an extra 60 seconds.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">My colleague has already referred to figures. The  Government estimate that there are 500,000 illegal immigrants throughout the United Kingdom,  and other estimates put that figure as high as 870,000. Once migrant workers,  both legal and illegal, have arrived on our shores, many of them are recruited  by criminal gangs and end up in dreadful conditions. We are all aware of the  snakehead gangs that operated in Morecombe   Bay and of the dreadful  incident and the loss of life that happened there.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The exploitation of migrant workers and illegal human  trafficking is a serious issue in today&rsquo;s society. As more countries join the  EU and our borders become increasingly more open to migrant workers, greater  attention must be paid to that dreadful problem.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Anderson</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I apologise to Dolores Kelly for not  being in the Chamber at the beginning of the debate. I had other matters to  attend to and did not realise that the business had moved on.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">T&aacute; m&eacute; ag labhairt i bhfabhar an r&uacute;in. I support the motion  and everything that Francie Molloy said about the amendment. Therefore, I do  not intend to rehearse that.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The issue of migrant workers and the exploitation that they  endure is nothing new, particularly in this society. Women and men have been  leaving their homelands in search of work ever since payment in return for  labour was introduced. Nowhere is that more true than in Ireland. For  generations, oppression, starvation and poverty forced our people to distant  lands in order to survive. That Irish diaspora faced the onslaught of prejudice,  racism, exploitation and discrimination that many migrant workers continue to  face the world over. Indeed, to this day, the Irish community in Britain still  faces an enduring legacy of hardship because of that discrimination.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">A British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body report last year  revealed that the suicide rate in Britain is highest among the Irish  community, life expectancy is lowest and the community also faces high levels  of mental-health problems, and drug and alcohol abuse. Never&shy;theless, despite the hardships that they faced,  the global Irish diaspora is perhaps the best example of how migrants  can assimilate into the host community and make a positive contribution to  their new homes.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Irish migrants became nation builders, statesmen and  stateswomen, military heroes, renowned artists and celebrated inventors. The  foundation stones of many of the world&rsquo;s great nations were laid through the  labour of Irish migrants, and their contribution is still celebrated across the  globe today. If any country should be welcoming migrants with open arms,  therefore, it is Ireland.  We know better than most the hardships that force people to leave their native  land, and we know the contributions that they can make to their new home.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Is this really the land of 100,000 welcomes? How can it be,  when a Ukrainian woman loses her legs after almost freezing to death on a  Coleraine street? What a scandal for the North, and what a reputation to be  afflicted with. How can we be considered welcoming, when migrant workers are being  attacked in their homes in Derry&rsquo;s Waterside  by sectarian thugs, and when human traffickers smuggle vulnerable women and  children into this country and force them into lives of prostitution?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">How can we be considered welcoming, when unscrupulous  employers exploit migrant workers and refuse  to give them the same entitlements as indigenous employees? Migrant  workers should be afforded the same rights  and entitlements as anyone else. Everything possible must be done to  oppose the evil of human trafficking, and every Member has a duty to ensure  that everything is done. Therefore, I support the motion. I hope that the  international legislation that it lists will be ratified and that that will  help end the misery that is being caused by the exploitation of migrants and  the trafficking of human beings.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, I am saddened that it is necessary to bring motions to this Assembly, or to the European  Parliament, in order that migrants  to this land are treated with human dignity. I appeal to everyone to  remember our painful history when we are thinking of migrant labourers. We  should reflect on our forefathers&rsquo; experiences and on the suffering and  exploitation they endured in far-away lands. We should remember their  suffering, and our actions should ensure that no one who comes to this country  should have to endure a similar experience. I support the motion. Go raibh  maith agat.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Simpson</strong>:  I support Mr Alan McFarland&rsquo;s amendment. As a representative of the Upper Bann  constituency, not only in this House, but as MP, I am well aware of the need  for migrant workers in Northern    Ireland. The proposer of the motion, Mrs  Kelly, like others, will be aware that the Upper Bann constituency has the  largest number of employees in the manufacturing industry &mdash; 9,500 people &mdash; more  than East Belfast, which has around 7,300 or 7,500 employees. I am sure that  the Member on the next Bench will know the figure.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Sir Reg Empey</strong>:  You are talking about legal ones.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Simpson</strong>:  Yes, legal ones. Therefore, we are well aware of the need for migrant workers  in the constituency to keep industry moving, whether in manufacturing,  hospitals, or other sectors.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The general public get confused sometimes. On the one hand,  they read stories in the press that Northern Ireland needs more people to come  to work in the manufacturing sector &mdash; which is a good thing because it means  that business is going well. I also agree that migrant workers have rights &mdash;  and I declare an interest as an employer in the manufacturing sector. I have  employed people from that background, and they are very good workers.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">On the other hand, members of the public who walk down the  streets in my, or any other, constituency see migrant people begging, and they  get very confused about what those people are contributing to society. We must  be careful about that as well. I agree that they must have rights and &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: The  people who are begging on the streets are not, generally, migrant workers, but  asylum seekers or illegal immigrants.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Simpson</strong>:  That may be the case in the Member&rsquo;s constituency; however, it is not so in  mine. I could take the Member to places and people in my constituency which  would clarify the position. I take her point, however; in some cases, that may  be so.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We need to expose employers who treat migrant workers  abysmally. They should be brought to book for using and abusing people who come  to this country to contribute and help. As Members know, there is a shortage of  trades here, especially in the medical profession.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I turn to the issue of people-smuggling. In January 2006, I  put down a question for written answer in the House of Commons. I asked the  then Secretary of State for Northern    Ireland:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;what estimate the police has made of the number of  (a) people smuggled illegally into Northern Ireland and (b) females brought into  Northern Ireland to work as prostitutes in each of the last five  years.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In response, Mr Tony McNulty MP, Minister of State for the  Home Office, stated that:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The Police Service of Northern   Ireland has conducted a number of inquiries into suggestions of people-trafficking to Northern Ireland  for the purposes of prostitution. There is presently no evidence to suggest that this is taking place in Northern Ireland.  The Police Service of Northern    Ireland is acutely aware of the problems  experienced in other jurisdictions and they continue to monitor the situation&rdquo;.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">What a big difference 18 months has made. The situation has  changed significantly. Mr McFarland mentioned Pentameter 2, a national,  multi-agency campaign to tackle the trafficking of human beings for sexual  exploitation and forced labour. Launching it, Paul Goggins said:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented"><strong><span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt; font-weight:normal; ">&ldquo;Human trafficking is a modern form of slavery where individuals</span></strong><strong><span style="font-weight:normal; "> and criminal networks seek to profit from the  brutality, misery and suffering they cause to others.&rdquo;</span></strong></p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I support amendment No 2. We will do everything we can in Westminster to push  forward the legislation.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: I,  too, support amendment No 2.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I also welcome the original motion. Mrs Kelly has raised an  important issue, which has been touched on in several debates over the last  couple of weeks. The Assembly held a debate on agency workers, during which the  case of a 23-year-old Polish man in my East Antrim  constituency was raised by Mr Sammy Wilson &mdash; who was on time for the debate  that day. The young man worked for an employment agency &mdash; People Resource &mdash;  which has offices in Poland and England, and it was taking &pound;1,000 each week  from the young man for rental of a house in Larne which local estate agents  have said is worth only &pound;400 a month. That is a key issue. I voiced my concerns  during that debate, and warned against unscrupulous agencies which flout the  laws intended to protect agency workers.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Simpson, the MP for  Upper Bann, made reference to families in his constituency who, on  arrival in Northern Ireland,  were greeted by mafia-type figures who demanded money from them for protection.  That is a sad reminder of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  past. Paramilitary groups used to have a grip on communities here; now,  eastern European gangs are trying to exercise the same control over migrant  families which come to work in Northern    Ireland. My colleague in Upper   Bann has been made aware of the situation and will take it up with  police in the area.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">With the increase in the numbers of migrant workers in  recent years, the opportunity for exploitation has arisen. As a proportion of  the UK  workforce, the number of migrant workers has increased by nearly one third  since 1995. We do not want a situation where they are overworked and underpaid.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I turn to the issue of human trafficking, which has been  described by several Members as slavery. It is an increasing problem, not only  in Northern Ireland, but  throughout the United    Kingdom.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">12.00 noon</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Yesterday, the Assembly endorsed the report by the Ad Hoc  Committee on the draft Sexual Offences (Northern Ireland) Order 2007 &mdash; of  which Mrs Kelly is a member. The report examines the draft legislation on  sexual offences, which aims to strengthen the law on commercial sexual  exploitation, including offences related to prostitution. Sex trafficking is an  obscene activity. Many young women and children are brought to Northern Ireland  and elsewhere, more often than not against  their will, and are sold for sex.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Joint Com&shy;mittee  on Human Rights&rsquo; report on human trafficking, published in October 2006,  highlighted the extent of the problem. It quoted Home Office research that  states that around 4,000 women in the UK have been trafficked for sexual  exploitation. It is important that women in those circumstances are given all  the help available to get out of that situation and to escape a life of  exploitation. The Northern Ireland Women&rsquo;s Aid Federation gave evidence to the  Joint Committee at Westminster and expressed its concerns that smuggling expertise exists in Northern Ireland because  paramilitary groups have operated here for so long. That expertise makes  Northern Ireland  ripe for human trafficking, and that is,  obviously, a concern.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Not only have there have been well-highlighted cases in  south Belfast, to which my colleague referred,  there have been cases in Londonderry, where  several brothels have been uncovered. PSNI figures suggest that more than 70  brothels could be operating in Northern    Ireland, many of which have imported eastern  European girls who have been forced to sell themselves for sex. People who  operate those places have been able to exploit the law in many ways. It is  important that the steps that the House has taken to strengthen sexual-offences  legislation will tackle the problem. Unfortunately, for many years, the focus  has been on prosecuting the women who have been forced to sell themselves,  rather than the men who pay for prostitution. It is important that the law  reflects that and targets the people who use prostitutes.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Although scenes of women being bundled into vans and  smuggled into the country happen more often in the mainland UK than in Northern  Ireland, there is no doubt that measures must be taken to prevent that  happening in future. I hope that the Executive will take those measures and do  all that they can to tackle the problem. I am happy to support the amendment  that has been tabled in the name of Mr McFarland.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning (Sir Reg Empey)</strong>: I thank Mrs Kelly for bringing the motion  to the House and Members for their participation in the debate. The fact that  the Assembly has discussed these issues twice in a relatively short time  illustrates Members&rsquo; concerns.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I condemn any exploitation of migrant workers, who are one  of the most vulnerable groups in society, and the vile trade of human  trafficking. The issues that arise with regard to migrant workers are  wide-ranging; some of those are devolved to the Executive, while others, such  as ratification of conventions, remain in the competence of the United Kingdom  Government.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">For many reasons, it is  difficult to obtain information on  human trafficking; the main one being the clandestine nature of the crime. Home Office research on  organised crime suggests that at any  one time in 2003, for example, there were approximately 4,000 victims of  trafficking for prostitution in the UK. The UK  Government became a signatory of the Council of Europe Convention on  Action against Trafficking in Human Beings in March 2007. The Home Secretary  announced on 15 January 2008 that the UK Government intend to ratify the  convention by the end of the year.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">At the Home Office&rsquo;s request, the Office of the First  Minister and deputy First Minister is engaged in a cross-departmental exercise to gauge the scope of existing  compliance with the convention and to identify the areas that Departments must address, including through legislation, to achieve full compliance. Actions  to prevent human trafficking have  the potential to cut across the responsibilities of several devolved  Departments. The First Minister and the deputy First Minister are committed to  playing their part in ensuring that the convention can be ratified as soon as  possible. I fully support all measures to deal with human trafficking and to  provide assistance for its victims.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The United Nations Convention on Protection of the Rights  of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families dates back to 1990. I have  been informed that the UK Government&rsquo;s position  on that convention is that the Human Rights Act 1998 provides  sufficiently for the rights of all migrants and sets in national law the key human rights that were established in the  six core international human rights treaties.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In the view of the United Kingdom Government, ratifying  that convention would undermine the UK&rsquo;s immigration policy and would  allow migrants fuller, immediate access to  public funds. That would constitute an excessive pull factor. It is  important to distinguish between the two issues that we have been discussing  this morning &mdash; human trafficking and the protection of the rights of migrant  workers. I stress that I am committed to tackling any exploitation of migrant  workers. They play an important part in shaping our communities and in  contributing to a more robust Northern    Ireland economy by helping to overcome  labour shortages. It is in all our interests to ensure that they are not  exploited and to tackle exploitation when it occurs. Member after Member  brought that to our attention this morning.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Substantial inward migration of workers is a relatively new  phenomenon. Since the accession of the A8 countries in May 2004, there has been  a marked increase in inward migration, specifically of workers to Northern Ireland.  That activity resulted from EU citizens exercising their entitlement to free  movement and work, allowing them broadly the same rights as local citizens.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As I said, the issues that relate to migrant workers are,  by their nature, wide-ranging and do not fall under the remit of a single  Department. Matters that relate to, for example, immigration, work permits and  the national minimum wage are not devolved, while others, such as employment rights,  health and safety and education issues, are the responsibility of Northern  Ireland Departments. My Department is the lead Department for migrant-worker  issues, and it chairs the migrant workers thematic subgroup, which was set up  by the Racial Equality Forum. My Department has attempted to be as inclusive as  possible in chairing that subgroup, which comprises almost 50 members. They  include representatives from most Northern Ireland Departments, relevant UK  Departments and statutory <span style="letter-spacing:-.25pt; ">and non-governmental  organisations that seek to represent</span> the interests of migrant workers.  In that subgroup, the non-state sector has been given a clear voice. The forum  tasked the subgroup with producing a strategy and action plan, which it  subsequently endorsed.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The draft migrant workers strategy for Northern Ireland and its associated draft action plan aim to  ensure that the employment-related needs of migrant workers &mdash; and those  who employ and advise them &mdash; are met effectively through the provision of  appropriate information and advice. They also aim to ensure that the relevant  state and non-state systems are effective, complementary and fit for purpose.  Both documents are designed to be flexible in order that they may take account  of evolving situations, and both are subject to annual review.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The thematic subgroup  has identified four key strands of  required action, and it has established complementary working groups to  address the identified needs in each strand. The four strands are employment  inspection and enforcement; information;  developing best practice; and research and data gathering. I will  presently bring to the Committee for  Employment and Learning &mdash; and subsequently to the Executive &mdash; the draft  strategy and action plan that details the progress that is to be made.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The enforcement and  inspection working group brings together bodies that are responsible for  enforcing specific areas of employment law. A range of Departments and their agencies are carrying out consid&shy;erable  employment-related inspection and enforcement activity in Northern Ireland.  However, it is recognised that more co-ordination and better co-operation are necessary to focus that work properly. Bilateral  meetings relating to breaches of employment rights have taken place with  various regulatory bodies. It is important that Members realise the extent of  the discussions. The regulatory bodies that have been involved include the  Border and Immigration Agency, HM Revenue and Customs,  Citizens Advice, the Northern Ireland Housing Executive, the Gangmasters  Licensing Authority, the Health and Safety Executive for Northern Ireland, and the National Employment  Rights Authority in the Republic   of Ireland.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">All those organisations  have shown great willingness to  co-operate and share information, within the constraints of existing  legislation.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It remains a priority for my Department to ensure that  there is a modern and effective employment-rights infrastructure that protects all those working in Northern<span style="letter-spacing:0pt; "> Ireland</span> legally, not least those who may be more vulnerable, such as migrant  workers. Migrant workers in Northern    Ireland have the same employment rights as  all other workers, including the right to be paid the national minimum wage.  Those rights are enforced through the tribunal service. All legal migrant  workers are entitled to avail themselves of the services of the Industrial  Tribunals and Fair Employment Tribunal Northern Ireland, and translation services  will be provided when required.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Many, but not all, migrant workers use the services of, or are employed by, employment agencies. In  the next few months, I will be bringing a package of legislative  measures before the Assembly to increase protection for vulnerable agency  workers, including providing them with the right to withdraw from services  provided by an agency &mdash; such as transport or accommodation, which has been  referred to by Mr Ross &mdash; without any detriment to their position. Agencies will  be obliged to give workers a written statement of their rights to withdraw from  such services. In the meantime, anyone who wishes to make a complaint about an  employment agency should contact my Department.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department of  Agriculture and Rural Development sponsors the Agricultural Wages Board  and funds gangmaster enforcement in Northern Ireland. Those responsibilities offer protection to workers &mdash;  including migrant workers &mdash; in  agriculture, including horticulture and forestry, shellfish gathering,  and the processing and packing of produce deriving from those sectors.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Members have already had a debate in the House on the  national minimum wage. In Northern Ireland,  the national minimum wage is enforced by HM Revenue and Customs through a dedicated team based in Belfast. I am informed that criminal  prosecutions have taken, and are taking, place. Those prosecutions send a clear  message to employers that HM Revenue and Customs will actively pursue those it suspects of flouting national  minimum wage law.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In Northern    Ireland, HM Revenue and Customs recovered &pound;186,560 of arrears for 868 workers in  2006-07. In total, &pound;2&middot;5 million of arrears has been recovered for  workers in Northern Ireland  since the legislation was introduced in 1999. HM Revenue and Customs is  committed to simple, effective enforcement of the national minimum wage that  supports workers and businesses by deterring non-compliant employers from underpaying their employees &mdash; a point that Mr  Simpson referred to &mdash; and removing the unfair competitive advantage that  such underpayment can bring.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Employment Bill [HL], which was introduced in  Parliament in December 2007, will introduce a new enforcement framework, a new penalty for all employers who are  found to be paying less than the national minimum wage, and a fairer method of  calculating arrears. The Bill will also make it a triable offence in the Crown  Court and the Magistrate&rsquo;s Court, under the National  Minimum Wage Act 1998, and will strengthen the powers of HM Revenue and  Customs to investigate criminal offences. It is clear that major steps are  being taken across the board to deal with these matters.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Citizens Advice runs the Northern Ireland national minimum wage helpline, which can handle calls in  more than 100 languages. There is a network of translators throughout  the citizens advice bureaux network to facilitate such translations.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Health and safety is another area of concern; the Health and Safety Executive is increasingly  encountering migrant workers in sectors such as construction, food  processing and farming. There is no evidence that migrant workers are more accident-prone. Nevertheless, the Health and Safety Executive is working very  hard to ensure that all its  assistance and help is understandable and that employees are made aware  of their rights in such matters.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There are issues regarding communication and the provision  of information. My Department has a strategy of providing courses in English  for speakers of other languages as part of mainstream further-education  provision. That work is ongoing, and the money being invested is rising  dramatically. In the past four years, the sum has risen from &pound;300,000 to  approximately &pound;1&middot;5 million.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">12.15 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I turn now to issues that Members raised during the debate.  The House is unanimous that workers &mdash; indigenous and migrant &mdash; should not be  exploited, and the Department for Employment and Learning, under employment  rights, must ensure that all workers enjoy those rights. However, Members are  confusing two issues, a point that Anna Lo  raised in her amendment. Migrant  labour is a national issue, and human trafficking is an international  one.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, we must be careful. I understand Mrs Kelly&rsquo;s  points and her quoting Martin Luther King. Many Members expressed their views  on the type of society that they would wish for Northern Ireland, and I share those  views. However, it is telling that virtually no  receiving states have signed the 1990 United Nations Migrant Rights  Convention. The Republic of Ireland has not signed the convention, and it, like  the United Kingdom,  opened its doors to the A8 accession states in 2004. All those Governments  across the European Union are not racist; they are democratic Governments that  have not signed the convention because they see the danger of creating  additional problems. Members reacted strongly when there was a shortage of  money for social housing in Northern    Ireland, and that was a big issue in the  Budget. If further uncontrolled and unplanned immigration started to bear down  on local services &mdash; including housing &mdash; I wonder whether Members would be able  to speak in the Chamber with the same level of enthusiasm as was expressed  today. We must be careful.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I undertake that my Department will do everything in its  power to ensure that employment rights are enforced. I will introduce measures  in the near future to tighten up regulations.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  I am grateful to Dolores Kelly for tabling this important motion, but,  unfortunately, the motion is flawed because of the linking together of  exploitation of migrant labour and human trafficking. Both issues are  abhorrent, but they cannot be dealt with in one motion. Immigration law is a  contentious issue, which the Ulster Unionist Party does not deny. However, if  the UK Government were to accept the 1990 United Nations Migrant Rights  Convention, it would a place serious strain on public services and facilities,  because migrant workers would be able to circumvent current immigration  controls and remain in the UK,  potentially on benefits, without fulfilling the conditions under which they  were granted entry.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The UK  Government are, therefore, not in a position to accept this convention, and it  would be irresponsible for the Assembly to  propose a contrary position. However, we urge the Minister to continue  to do all that he can to stop the exploitation of migrant workers and to  protect those who are so vulnerable in our society. Members have outlined a  variety of approaches to the problem.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I supported the expansion of Europe and frequently travelled to Poland  to encourage residents from Newtown&shy;abbey&rsquo;s twin town of Rybnik to become involved  in the positive features of the European Union. Therefore, I am particularly  saddened to witness the adverse and negative aspects, to which Members have  referred, experienced by those who are seeking only to improve their quality of  life and that of their families.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Ulster Unionist  Party thinks that human trafficking is  one of the most pressing problems in western Europe. Recent shocking  figures published by the Home Office show that over 4,000 females are victims  of trafficking for sexual exploitation; it is impossible to get exact numbers,  as Mr Ross said.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Members referred to sweatshops, where children are forced  into labour, often for little or no recompense. Criminal gangs are causing  misery and distress for thousands of vulnerable women and children in the UK and  overseas.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">We also saw &mdash; and it has been referred to &mdash; the  tragic outcome when the Chinese  cockle-pickers in Morecambe Bay were overwhelmed by the tide. That was surely an  object lesson in the misery that the exploitation of workers can cause.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Ulster Unionist Party, therefore, welcomes the UK  Government&rsquo;s commitment to ratify the Council of Europe&rsquo;s Convention on Action  against Trafficking in Human Beings. It is crucial that we send a united  message to those who perpetrate such crimes and those who benefit from  trafficking, especially with regard to prostitution and child labour. It is not  acceptable and will no longer be tolerated by society, and it is good to hear  cross-party support for that.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I was, however, somewhat disappointed that the motion did not  take on board the issues highlighted in our amendment. There was an opportunity  to show a united front against both the exploitation of migrant workers and  human trafficking. I, therefore, hope that all Assembly Members will support  our amendment.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">This issue goes right to the heart of the reason for this  Assembly. We are trying to improve life, not only for members of our own  indigenous society, but for those who have chosen to come here, whether for economic, educational or social reasons. Many  Members will have travelled in eastern Europe and seen the gap between  those who, realising that without communism there is no safety net, have struck  out and tried to better their situation, and those who remain in those  countries, still trapped in abject poverty. Perhaps they can understand the  demands of folk from the emerging EU countries to try to get into western  Europe, the United Kingdom  and the Republic   of Ireland.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">One of the saddest things that I witnessed in the early  days of the communist demise was in East Germany, shortly after the  Berlin Wall came down. High-flying Mercedes and BMWs could be seen in the town  square in Dresden,  but people were running around with hardly enough to eat and with difficulty in  finding employment once the safety net had been removed. The warnings were  almost visible.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Look at Czechoslovakia.  Prague, a jewel  in the European crown, has been turned over completely to tourism of the lowest  kind. That city and its people looked forward to the benefits of Europe, but we did not deliver them. As I said earlier,  the same situation exists in Poland.  Are we going to see that process repeated here in Northern Ireland, where folk come  for the very best of reasons, then find that  they are exploited &mdash; sometimes by their own countrymen?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member opposite  referred to the Irish diaspora &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Time is almost up.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  Remember who exploited the Irish when they went abroad and during the famine?  It was their own people.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>: I  thank Dolores Kelly for bringing two very  important issues to the Assembly. They are separate issues, but they  have a common thread. In both the exploitation of migrant labour and the growth  of human trafficking, we are dealing with the abuse of human rights and  dignity.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I also thank her for accepting the Alliance Party&rsquo;s  amendment, which seeks only to stress the positive aspects of migration and the  role of this Assembly in tackling the abuse  of people. Several Members, including Martina Anderson, highlighted the  positive impact of migration and the  benefits sought for our own community as people have migrated to other  places &mdash; whether to America,  Australia  or any other country &mdash; settled and made a well-recognised, valuable  contribution. It would be a shame if we felt that there were no benefits to be  sought here from inward migration.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mrs Kelly, Ms Lo, Mr Molloy and Ms Anderson all identified  a key fact: it is the lack of proper planning and enforcement of decent  standards of treatment that leads to overstressed services, community tension,  and the inhumane treatment of those who come to our shores seeking work.  Migration itself does not cause problems, but not planning properly for it  does, and that must be addressed.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Both Ms Lo and Alastair Ross recognised that many women and  children are trafficked into our society for sexual  exploitation. The focus must be on criminalising the traffickers and the abusers from the local community, not  the victims of the abuse who have been trafficked. Although I recognise Mr Spratt&rsquo;s point on the importance of  criminalising those people, it is difficult for women who have been trafficked to feel confident in approaching the  authorities if they know that immediate deportation is all that will happen. As  a society, we must recognise that when women are trafficked to Northern Ireland and are abused by Northern Ireland  people, we have created victims for whom we have a moral obligation.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We must take seriously our roles and responsibilities for dealing with those victims and with the  consequences of their being abused.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Alan McFarland said, rightly, that issues of dignity and  morality are involved, both for the individual and for society. However, he  expressed concerns about the 1990 United Nations Migrant Rights Convention and  people being able to stay in Northern    Ireland when no longer working. One cannot  have it both ways. We do not bring workers to Northern Ireland; we bring people.  We bring families. We bring people who have emotions, relationships, and  connections to a local community. They may work here for a period, marry into  the local community and build a new life for themselves. It is not as simple as  saying that when the job goes, the person goes with it. That would be a huge  abuse of human dignity.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We need to look at long-term planning. I accept entirely what the Minister said: the UK and the Republic of Ireland have been good at opening their doors. However,  the message that they are sending out is that they want not simply to close the doors when migration is no longer necessary, but to force back out through the  doors people whom they previously welcomed. When times get tough, we have to be responsible in how we treat those whom we have invited into our society. If they contribute to the  boom, surely they should be looked after in the hard times. We need to be  realistic about that.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We also need to look at how that affects those, for  example, whose employment rights are being abused. If they feel that raising  objections with their employer will simply get them sacked and put them in  breach of their conditions of entry, where is their motivation to blow the  whistle on their exploiters? They have to know that if they lose their jobs for  speaking out and standing up to abuse, they will not be repatriated without  recompense from the society into which they have been trafficked.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Robin Newton, rightly, said that we must look not only at  the exploitation of people in our community, but  at how we exploit those in their home countries. The Assembly has to be  conscious of that. I hope that the Assembly will support our amendment and that  it will recognise that when we benefit from inviting people to come and work in  Northern Ireland,  we take on a responsibility. We should be planning for that and committing  ourselves to it, not shirking it.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>:  Some of the best films end where they began. In order to clear up confusion, I  will repeat what my colleague Dolores Kelly said about migrants&rsquo; rights:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The convention on migrants&rsquo; rights is one of the core  international human rights treaties. It is the first international instrument  to provide specific recognition of the fundamental human rights of all migrant  workers and their families. It aims at unifying the international legal  standards of protection for migrant workers and protects the rights of all  migrants. The convention does not create any new rights for migrant workers; it simply ensures that migrant  workers and their families enjoy the  same human rights, equality of treatment, and working and life  conditions as we do as nationals.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">How could anyone possibly disagree with that? I do not  think that it is possible, yet it is purely because some migrant workers did  not have those rights that they have ended up in desperate conditions. One  young girl in my town, who was injured in an industrial accident last July, is  being supported by another Polish family with no rights or money. We do not  have to look too far into the past to know what could have happened if there  had been no support.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am pleased that the  Minister is here, and I understand that he may have been speaking for  the First Minister and the deputy First Minister. I would have been much  happier had they been here. We would, perhaps, have accepted a junior Minister,  and I acknowledge that Ian Junior was here for 10 minutes.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Dolores Kelly referred to Martin Luther King. For those of  us who are following the primary elections in America and remember the days of  John F Kennedy, the first time a white person reached out to a black person was  deeply emotional. It is etched on the minds of older people to this day.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Dolores Kelly mentioned the dangers of extremism, referring  to the British National Party, which tried hard to put down roots here and,  indeed, attacked members of the migrant community in my constituency.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">12.30 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We must send out a  clear message about the problem of exploitation and abuse. We must also  be clear about the importance of the rights  of individuals and families, and about ending human trafficking. Anna  Lo, who has established herself as a champion of the human rights of immigrants, spoke eloquently of the problem. I  accept that she is an authority on the need for Members to support the  motion as amended by the Alliance Party&rsquo;s amendment.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is shameful that Britain and Ireland have not signed the United Nations convention, which they should  have done. Trafficking is vio&shy;lence of the worst kind against human beings &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span> I assure Mr Weir that trafficking is a serious matter &mdash; I am pleased that the PSNI has a team that is  working to establish the extent of the problem.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Alan McFarland explained why the Ulster Unionist Party could not support the Alliance Party&rsquo;s  amendment. The SDLP regrets that, but it welcomes his support for the  Council of Europe Convention on Action against the Trafficking in Human Beings. Jimmy Spratt referred to the slave trade. Indeed, there is evidence  that the slave trade featured prominently at one stage in Belfast. We would  certainly not wish to see that repeated. I agree with a zero-tolerance approach  to the vice trade.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Francie Molloy also  spoke from a position of strength, given the many migrant workers who  are based in his constituency. He talked, in particular, about welfare, housing  and houses in multiple occupation, and the need for legislation. Robin Newton  made a forceful point about the need for people to be mindful that, when they  move their labour abroad, they do not, in fact, stop contributing to the  problem. He also had a go at bargain hunters, who I hope are listening. I also  hope that when we next go in search of a  bargain, we remember that it may be the product of human suffering.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Martina Anderson focused on Irish people. We must accept  that, sometimes, Irish people who chose to live abroad were not good to their  own people. That is also true of some of the  migrant workers who have established positions of power. We must not  forget that. The old adage, put a beggar on horseback and he will trot to hell,  was quoted to me when I spoke to older people from the Irish community who were  living in America.  Therefore, we must be mindful of that history.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">David Simpson represents a constituency that has 9,500 migrant workers, which he claimed is the  greatest number in any constituency. I was disappointed to hear him  focusing on begging. That is not associated purely with migrant workers. It  would be better to find out why people are begging, rather than stigmatise and  label them. More positively, he mentioned the need to end the smuggling of  young girls for prostitution.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Alastair Ross spoke  about agency workers, protection rackets and exploitation. He called for  strengthening the law on prostitution. I was pleased that he also mentioned the  role of Women&rsquo;s Aid, an organisation that is an authority on the abuse of  migrant women and women here at home.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Sir Reg Empey, in his official position as the Minister for  Employment and Learning, covered a lot of positive issues, but I am sorry that  he feels unable to support the motion as amended.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It has been a good debate, and the Assembly has  acknowledged the need to ensure that migrant workers and agency workers are  protected. It is a pity that we will divide on the issue, but I hope that, at  some time in the future, the House will be united and speak with one voice and  see everyone in Northern    Ireland as entirely equal in all respects.  There should be no need to shy away from a piece of law simply to deprive  someone of resources that they may need.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I return to the point that Martina Anderson made: the New World often forgets that the Irish built it. Irish  people built the tunnels in Britain  and the skyscrapers in America.  However, even today, they cannot get the right to come and go as they should.  The Irish people have enough history behind them to know not to do the same  thing to the people who are building this economy. We must stop using the term  &ldquo;migrant workers&rdquo;; we must start calling those people the &ldquo;new Irish&rdquo;. They  have done everything possible to blend into our community, so we must ask  ourselves what we are doing. I did my little bit when I went to Poland over Christmas, and I did not see any  deterioration in the city of Krakow.  I saw a vibrant, youthful city that was not spoiled by the sort of cheap  tourism that was referred to earlier. We are all part of a large European  Union: let us live in it as brothers; let us treat one another as equals.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: The  Business Committee has arranged to meet immediately upon the lunchtime  suspension.

		    <p class="H4StageHeading">Post-primary Education in County Fermanagh</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I remind Members that the Member who tabled the adjournment debate  will have 15 minutes in which to speak, and that all other Members will have  nine minutes in which to speak.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  Education in County   Fermanagh is a very vexed  subject, and it is important that it is debated in this House.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As an Assembly Member for the constituency of Fermanagh and  South Tyrone, I would like the House to acknowledge that the education of our  children is vital. I suspect that many, if  not all, Members will acknowledge that fact. After all, when we talk  about our children, we talk about the future generation who will inherit our  new Northern Ireland.  It is our duty to ensure that they are adequately prepared for that task. If  proper preparation is not made for that journey and the responsibility that it  entails, it will ultimately reflect on  those who make the decisions today.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There must be a framework for education that is fit for  purpose and facilitates an effective transition from primary, through post-primary,  to third-level education and prospective employment. I place on record my  thanks to the Business Committee for agreeing to this debate, because it could  not be more timely.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Tony Blair declared that his  foundation cornerstones were &ldquo;education, education, education&rdquo;, which  became his mantra when he was Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. Alas, County Fermanagh is not on the receiving end of such a mantra.  Instead, it is handed obfuscation, obfuscation and more obfuscation.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Under direct rule, much in Northern Ireland was allowed to  drift. Sadly, under devolution, it seems that education is also drifting,  particularly education in County   Fermanagh. The  restoration of devolution promised the  people of Northern Ireland  a better future. I have not given up hope of that, but some Members must  take cognisance of their responsibilities.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am glad that the Minister is in her place today, and I take some comfort from that. However, before  the debate goes much further, I say to the Minister, and to anyone else  who wants to listen, that every parent, politician and teacher wants only the  best for our children. We want them to develop their academic and vocational  life, and their social and communication skills. That, undoubtedly is, or  should be, everyone&rsquo;s aim.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Matters may become contentious at this point. From reading the Hansard report of the Education  Committee&rsquo;s meeting on Thursday 31  January &mdash; and if I have correctly interpreted media reports &mdash; relations  between the Minister and the majority of the Committee are, to say the least,  disharmonious. In fact, relations seem to be disintegrating daily. The only  casualty of that will be the education of our children.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">While it was being reported in some quarters that the  Minister was neglecting her Committee and the opinions and challenges that it  brings to her, she was neatly sidestepping  her duties in the Fermanagh area, particularly in relation to a  pre-consultation document. That almost leads me to say that Fermanagh has been  forgotten, but, in fact, it has been completely ignored. Concerns raised some time ago have been left to stagnate,  resulting in a crisis, or near crisis. I realise that &ldquo;crisis&rdquo; is a  particularly strong word to use, but it is the only word that adequately  describes the state of play of education in County Fermanagh.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I asked the Minister for her comments on a Western  Education and Library Board document that was produced in County Fermanagh.  It is entitled, &lsquo;Post-Primary Education in Co Fermanagh&rsquo;, and is described as a  pre-consultation document on the future of controlled/voluntary education in County Fermanagh.  With a brush of her hand, the Minister nonchalantly said that it was nothing to  do with her and that she was not interested. That is powerful &mdash; the Minister of  Education is not interested in a document  on education.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I thought that education was her remit and that she would  be involved in all aspects of education and take her role seriously &mdash; but that  is not the case. According to the Minister, it is not her document, has nothing  to do with her Department, and she could not care a less about it. That is  regrettable.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">This piece of paper or  booklet &mdash; whatever terminology one wants to use &mdash; has proved  controversial. Indeed, it is so controversial that it has angered one school to  the point of publicly shredding it in order to send a stern message to its  authors &mdash; the Western Education and Library Board.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">2.30 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is becoming something of an unwanted document as it  appears that no one wants to take ownership of it, even though the foreword was  signed by the chairman and the chief executive of the Western Education and Library Board. However, at several discussion  evenings the chief executive emphatically denied responsibility for the  document.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">If it does not belong to the Western Education and Library  Board, and, as the Minister of Education has disowned it and does not want to  hear about it, who is responsible for taking ownership and acting upon it?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The document had to be  drafted, printed and paid for. After  several attempts, and after requesting information under the Freedom of  Information Act 2000, we ascertained where it originated. Costs were authorised  and by 2007 stood at the princely sum of &pound;6,703. That includes &pound;4,790 for the  printing of 9,300 copies of the document, &pound;1,176 for working meetings and  seminars at various venues, &pound;527 in travel  costs for those attending the  meetings and &pound;210 for the delivery of the document. That is a great deal  of money, and it is time that responsibility was assumed for it.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Oddly enough, it appears that the Western Education and  Library Board is in fact the author. Therefore, I assume that it will take  responsibility, although that has not come out loud and clear in any meetings  that have taken place.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Western Education and Library Board held public meetings  to hard-sell the document, and the chief executive claimed he would answer  questions and take criticisms. However, sadly, just like the Minister of  Education today, that proved difficult.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">One of the most significant matters raised at the meetings concerned the shambolic situation at Devenish College. Boards of governors at several schools &mdash; and I am  thinking specifically of the Duke of Westminster High School, now the Kesh  campus &mdash; were given an undertaking that a new state-of-the-art facility would  be built.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The governors reluctantly took the decision to close the  school on the strength of the board&rsquo;s assurance guaranteeing a new school. They  accepted that until the new school was built, children would be taught in what  was described as good-quality, temporary accommodation. However, children are  still in that temporary accommodation five years later. That cannot be a  long-term solution. How long is temporary? How long can this go on for?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Such conditions are unacceptable, in spite of the high  levels of teaching and professionalism. Were it not for the professionalism of  staff and those around them, the situation would be much worse. The staff have  been put in an impossible position.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The chief executive of the Western Education and Library  Board recently said that although he is sympat&shy;hetic, the Minister of Education  had not released the funds to build the new Devenish College,  even though funds were allocated and cleared some years ago by the direct rule  Minister of Education, Maria Eagle.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The present Minister of Education should tell us why that  has been delayed. Will she tell the House, at the foot of this debate, why she  refuses to release the funds to build that much-needed school?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I have no doubt that  Members will wait for an answer with baited breath. However, rather than  prejudge the answer, we will listen intently to what the Minister has to say.  Does she appreciate the scale of the crisis in Fermanagh? We want her to  address that crisis directly, instead of putting it off, as has happened in the  past.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister explain why the chief executive of the  Western Education and Library Board does not appear to be taking public opinion  on board? Is he acting on her direction or his own? What is going on? Parents  in Fermanagh are confused and concerned about what is happening to the future  of their children&rsquo;s education. Who is really in charge? If the Minister answers  that question, and no other, she will have done us all a service.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The general feeling among parents in Fermanagh is that the Western Education and Library Board  document should be shelved. One parent has drawn attention to the blatant  plagiarism in the options set out in the document, which were copied verbatim  from a consult&shy;ation exercise by the Catholic-maintained sector. That sector  had seven years to get to grips with the issues involved, whereas the  controlled and voluntary sectors had just seven months, which is entirely  inappropriate.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Parents in Fermanagh are not unwilling to engage &mdash; they want to be, and must be allowed to be,  involved in the education of their children. They are not afraid of  change. However, change must be introduced in a constructive, cohesive and  proper manner. The process behind the document is flawed, not least because willingness to take ownership of its inception is  causing much confusion. I look forward to hearing what other Members say  on this important issue and I thank the House for listening to me.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: All other Members who speak will have seven minutes, not nine was  as previously advised.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  I congratulate and thank Lord Morrow for  securing an Adjournment debate on a very important topic for the people  of Fermanagh. I am pleased that there has been reference to education in  general in County Fermanagh  rather than just post-primary education, because one of my main concerns  is the primary school estate in County   Fermanagh.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Over the years, there has been an erosion of the  primary-school estate in Fermanagh; some small rural schools have been closed,  and others have been, almost purposely, run down with a view to closure.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Primary schools, particularly those in small rural areas,  are vital to the communities they serve. Some Members will not recognise place  names such as Drumskinny, Teemore and Stragowna, in which there were small  schools at the heart of the community which provided a service, as well as an  education, for local young people. All of those schools have closed, which  leaves a big void in those areas. A number of years ago, the primary schools in  Stragowna and Teemore had the option to  amalgamate. Unfortunately, agreement could not be reached, and now both  schools are closed, which has left a huge void in the area on the west side of  Lough Erne that will probably never be filled again by a controlled-primary  school.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am pleased that the Minister is here to listen to the  concerns. I want an assurance from the  Minister that maintenance of  controlled primary schools will be secured in County Fermanagh. A further erosion of those primary schools would  mean that pupils as young as four years of age would have to travel up to 22  miles to their nearest primary school.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">An option given in &lsquo;Post-Primary Education in Co Fermanagh&rsquo;  is a proposal to close five primary schools in one area to facilitate a school  for four- to 14-year-old pupils in the Lisnaskea area. I am not aware of any  other area in County Fermanagh, or in Northern Ireland, that has a four-  to 14-year-old school system &mdash; although the Minister may tell me differently.  How would that system work in an area that  would be singled out in the county? How would a four- to 14-year-old  school system work in one part of the county when a similar system did not operate in the rest of the county?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Those five primary schools were not even consulted or told  that their closure was an option until a couple of weeks before the  pre-consultation document was due for release. It is a total disgrace that that  absolutely ridiculous situation was allowed to happen.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Lord Morrow also  referred to the situation of Devenish College. Minister Foster, who was an MLA at the time, and I  fought a hard campaign to secure the Duke of Westminster site in Kesh until the  new Devenish College was built, and we were given promises and clear assurances  on the matter. The board of governors of the then Duke of Westminster High  School were fed a pup; they were given inaccurate information. The board has it  in writing that Devenish   College would have a  newbuild in 2008. It is now 2008, and there is no sign of progress on that  school.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In the past few months, I requested a meeting with the  Minister to discuss progress on Devenish   College to try to develop  it, and, on two occasions, she has refused. I want work to start on that school  without any further delay. I commend the work of the teachers and staff. Pupils  and parents say that the teachers and the school&rsquo;s academic progress are  excellent. They are more than happy with the school&rsquo;s ability. However, the  school facilities are antiquated, and there is a desperate need for new  facilities. I ask for that to be progressed as soon as possible.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The main four post-primary schools detailed in the  pre-consultation document are all fighting for their individual issues, and I  see merit in all their points. However,  instead of the Western Education and Library Board or the Department of Education trying to steam&shy;roller the  process through, there is now an onus on the four schools to work together.  They had started that process, but the  pre-consultation document was published before they could continue it.  However, the onus is now on those schools to continue that process and to find  a way forward. That process must be conducted outside the Western Education and  Library Board, otherwise they may not find the process easy.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The pre-consultation document was premature and was  published before the Assembly and the Minister come to a final decision on  post-primary education after the announcement to abolish the 11-plus. It has  been said that the document should be taken off the table and scrapped, but  perhaps it has gone too far. It may be an option to allow the document to take  its course, and let the people have their say, and it may be got rid of in that  way.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Order. The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  I, too, thank Lord Morrow for raising this issue, which concerns the future of  post-primary education. However, the future of primary education in County Fermanagh  is implicit in that, because of the arrangements for feeder schools, if nothing  else. The issue is more prominent on the controlled side than on the maintained  side, but that is the case only for now. Among the next steps on the way  forward, there will be a wider debate on the future of all post-primary schools  in County Fermanagh.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I agree entirely with Tom Elliott in relation to the site  of the controlled school at Kesh. At least now we can take the matter forward  with an Assembly to provide transparency and accountability. I hope that all  Members will endeavour to ensure that, no matter what authorities are involved,  or whatever side of the divide they come from, the Assembly will see to it that  they are held to any commitments that they might make.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The former Devenish   College campus at Kesh,  which has been closed for a couple of years, is the closest controlled  post-primary school to where I live. I go past it every day as I travel to the  Assembly. For anyone who does not know that school, its recent history provides  a sad commentary on the way in which post-primary education is being handled.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As Members will know,  Fermanagh is a predominantly rural area, and it has a much higher  proportion of small schools than any other area in Northern Ireland. It is very  encouraging to see that Members from other constituencies are attending this  debate. This battle is important, because what happens in Fermanagh will filter  down to rural communities and affect the future of rural schools everywhere.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">An increasing threat hangs over the future of many of Fermanagh&rsquo;s primary and post-primary schools.  Due to curriculum changes, falling enrolments, the rational&shy;isation of  schools and other factors that, lately, have been accelerating rapidly, small  schools are in serious danger of closure.  Schools in Fermanagh are particularly vulnerable. Many people, across  the entire community in Fermanagh, think that the Department and others  involved in education simply no longer see a place for small schools.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Current economic thinking goes way beyond education, but it  is creeping into that area as well. It is considered to be cheaper to bus  thousands of children to schools in large towns &mdash; in Fermanagh, that means  Enniskillen &mdash; to educate them. That seems to be the way forward. When fuel  prices are rocketing, there is traffic chaos and congestion in Enniskillen and  many other towns, and there is growing concern about carbon emissions, surely  the argument that small schools are wasteful is flawed.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">What about the burden of a 3-hour bus journey for primary-school children? Some 4- or 5-year-old  children have to leave home at 7.00 am, or some unearthly hour &mdash; as do  some post-primary-school children &mdash; and they do not return until 5.00 pm or  6.00 pm. What about the costs of that? What about the implications for parents  in rural areas, many of whom must travel for hours to work in another direction  after leaving their children to school?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The needs of rural communities, especially those in  Fermanagh, are not getting a fair hearing.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The present policy on closures will inevitably leave  communities in the county more isolated. People will begin to move away, and the rural areas will be denuded even  further.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The review of public administration, which recommends one  health board, one education board and fewer councils, exemplifies the growing  trend towards centralisation. That trend can also be seen in Invest Northern Ireland, which, according to its latest policy,  wants to centralise all its operations to Belfast  and Derry.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is time that the issue is taken seriously. Schools can  provide support and stability in rural areas. I taught in a post-primary school  in Fermanagh, and I know that all the schools there have excellent educational records. That is borne out in the reports of the  Education and Training Inspectorate. The records of all those schools  are available to anyone who wants to see them. The schools have achieved high  standards, maintained excellence, tackled  underachievement, raised the self-esteem of pupils, increased pride in  local communities, and have given them a strong sense of identity. Despite the rapidly changing environment in which those  schools operate, they have an excellent record in preparing pupils for life and work and in building on their  personal and social development. They now face an uncertain future, and  that is not good enough.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Members may be critical of this debate, but it gives  parents an opportunity to get involved and to make known their views. It is  important that they do so. I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s presence in the Chamber.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I do not advocate that all schools remain open. We live in  the real world; however, the Department needs to recognise the difficulties of  rural communities and make an explicit commitment to children.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. Your time is up, Mr Gallagher.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  congratulate Lord Morrow on securing the debate. Members may wonder why an  Alliance Member for North Down wants to contribute to an Adjournment debate on  post-primary education in County   Fermanagh. I have two  reasons for speaking: first, the topic is of importance across Northern Ireland,  though perhaps for reasons that are slightly different to those so far  mentioned; and secondly, I claim substantial roots in Fermanagh, given that  both my parents were born, bred and educated in rural and urban schools in the  county. Indeed, many members of my family still reside there.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I view the topic from a slightly different perspective to  that of Members who have spoken so far. I, too, am critical of the document,  though for reasons other than those that have been advanced already.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We must recognise that  there is a crisis in the education system in Northern   Ireland, particularly in County Fermanagh.  There are 50,000 empty school places, and that may rise to 80,000 by 2012. Many  schools have low enrolment rates. That has implications for the public purse  and for the education of children. Where there are many small schools, a  disproportionate amount of available funds is inevitably drawn into looking  after buildings, heating and other overheads. That means that those funds  cannot be spread as evenly as would have been possible if schools were larger.  That has financial implications for the ability to invest in the education and  welfare of those children who attend small schools.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In County   Fermanagh, a huge opportunity  has been missed. There is uncertainty in the education system, both with  respect to post-primary education and the transfer system and to a lack of  policy on sustainable schools. Through the education and library boards, the  controlled sector is making decisions in a vacuum, while, in a separate sector,  the Council for Catholic Maintained Schools (CCMS) makes decisions in a similar  fashion.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The implications of that are obvious. We must have proper  area planning and collaboration between sectors and schools to provide a  modern, efficient, up-to-date schools estate that will serve the interests of  children everywhere.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I fear that that is not what exists at present. There are  two parallel processes, each of which does its own thing, and unless those processes  are brought together, there will not be a sufficiently robust outcome. If  Members consider the report that was commissioned under Sir George Bain &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  Is the Member happy for there to be collaboration between different sectors?  His party advocates that there should be an  integrated sector only.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: Mr  Elliott will be aware that the Alliance Party&rsquo;s  preferred option is integrated education, because it believes that that  sector offers the most efficient and effective way of educating young people.  However, my party recognises that the sectors in Northern Ireland will persist for  many years, and we must deal with that reality. Integrated education will  probably be a viable option for only a small proportion of children during  years to come. Therefore there must be much greater emphasis on area planning  and on collaboration between sectors and schools.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  With regard to the point that was made by the Member for Fermanagh and South  Tyrone Mr Elliott, can Dr Farry clarify how  he views the controlled sector? Is it integrated or is it on the fringes  &mdash; the same as the other sectors, each of which has its own ethos? How would he  describe the controlled sector?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  am glad that the Member raised that point. The controlled sector has open  enrolment: its schools are open to all sections of the community. However, its  ethos does not recognise the diversity that exists in Northern Ireland.  Inevitably, therefore, people from  different backgrounds may find that the controlled sector does not  provide the kind of education that they wish their children to have. I draw a  contrast with the integrated education system, which tries to cater for that  diversity.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, controlled schools may be an option for many people. Indeed, several voluntary grammar  schools in Northern    Ireland have a balanced educational intake.  In the same way, schools in the Catholic maintained sector draw students from  right across the community, such as St Malachy&rsquo;s Primary School, St Comgall&rsquo;s  Primary School and St Columbanus&rsquo; College in my constituency. Fundamentally,  however, they retain a Catholic ethos. That is understood. The Catholic Church  wants that to persist.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, I have taken on board the Member&rsquo;s remarks. The  Alliance Party is wary of comments that have been attributed to the Education  Minister with regard to community background&rsquo;s potentially being a factor in  determining admissions criteria for post-primary education. The Alliance Party  believes that that would encourage a situation in which controlled schools will  be de facto for Protestants and Catholic-maintained schools will be de facto  only for Catholics or that people from either religious background will be  given preference in the respective sector. That would be a retrospective step  away from where progress should be made.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important to recognise that Fermanagh is perhaps the  most rural part of Northern    Ireland and that it is under huge pressures.  I fully take on board Mr Gallagher&rsquo;s comment that a situation in which children  must travel on buses for long periods, and the effect that that will have on the environment, must be avoided, as as  should the over-centralisation of provision into Enniskillen. Surely the  solution is that if sectors work with one  another, there is a greater chance of preserving some form of provision  in local communities, whether it is at primary or secondary level. Towns such  as Irvinestown and Lisnaskea are prime  examples of places that can sustain secondary provision. If the Assembly  is imaginative, it can work towards those solutions.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">A hierarchy of provision is needed. The options that were  identified by Professor Bain, such as integrated schools, shared campuses and  better collaboration between sectors, must be considered. Until there is  clarity from the Minister on post-primary education and a sustainable schools  policy, decisions on those matters will be taken in a vacuum. That will be a  huge missed opportunity. I appeal to the Minister for clarity on those issues  so that crucial decisions can be made in the proper framework.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>: I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate, which  was secured by my good friend and colleague Lord Morrow. I want to make it  clear that I am speaking as an Assembly Member and not as a Minister. I also  want to declare an interest insofar as I have three children, who, I hope, will  all progress through post-primary education in Fermanagh; that is if the  schools in the area can be sustained.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As my friend Lord Morrow said, there have been conflicting  claims about the genesis of the report. However, whatever the murkiness of its  origins, one thing is certain: the entire community in County Fermanagh  is opposed to the contents of the pre-consultation document.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">That is no surprise to me when one considers the five  options that have been proposed in that document.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">3.00 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The first option is to maintain the status quo, which is a  pejorative term. It is the only option that is open to people, because the other four options are so wrong and bad for  the people of County   Fermanagh. Tom Elliott  talked about option B, which envisages the closure of all primary schools in  south-east Fermanagh and the transfer of all those pupils to a campus at Lisnaskea High School. That school would then  include children from four to 14 years of age. It is something that was unheard  of by the community, and by the principals of those  primary schools until a week before the document was published. That option is totally and utterly rejected by the  community.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The closing of Lisnaskea High School is envisaged in options C, D and E, with the placing of all  post-primary education in Enniskillen town. Colleagues have commented on  the infrastructure problems that would be associated with such a move. There  would also be transport problems. The  Western Education and Library Board has the highest transport costs of  any board in Northern Ireland, and those  costs are likely to be tripled if any of those options are adopted. It  also means that children in County   Fermanagh will have no  choice about where they go to school. The document informs us that the children  will go to school in Enniskillen if option C, D or E is chosen. Where is the  equality in that for my children, who live in a rural area, if they have to go  to Enniskillen for post-primary education?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The proposals are so limited and closed that many people,  including myself, believe that the board has a preferred outcome for the  pre-consultation. That is what most people in County Fermanagh  think. It is a closed and blinkered pre-consultation, based on a premise that  the equation is: small school equals bad school. I certainly do not accept  that. As far as I am concerned, the premise is flawed. In England, the  view is that the working out of that premise has gone wrong. People there are  moving in the opposite direction, and we need to have cognisance of that.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I refer to Stephen  Farry&rsquo;s remarks when I say that the document takes no account of sharing  across sectors or looking at area planning. There were three meetings to  consider the pre-consultation document. Therefore, he should know that the  post-primary integrated sector, the new South West College and the maintained sector were  not consulted. I know that the maintained sector is concerned about all of those matters. Its representatives came  to see me to discuss the fact that we seem to be moving along two parallel lines. There is no recognition of a  shared future in the document. That is something that all Members should be  concerned about and have cognisance of.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The document does not take into account twenty-first century  facilities such as IT, which would enable pupils to remain in Lisnaskea and  share IT facilities with other campuses. The document presents a closed and  blinkered view. It is littered with references to closures, which is disappointing. We should think of the future and look for opportunities in County Fermanagh,  and we should consider the benefits of the  small schools there. The document is constructed on a negative view of  demography that suggests that the population in County Fermanagh  is getting smaller. In fact, I do not know  why they do not simply close all of the schools in County Fermanagh  and bus all of the pupils up to Belfast.<span class="Italic"> [Interruption.]</span><span class="B3BodyTextItalicChar"><span style="font-size:11.0pt; "> </span></span>Do not say that that is a good idea.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  What about the carbon footprint?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  Absolutely; the carbon footprint is important.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important to remember that small schools are not just  about statistics, education and results. They are also about a way of life for  a lot of children, a matter to which Tommy Gallagher referred. It is about their  countryside identity and about wanting to be at home after school instead of  spending hours on buses. It is disgraceful that the Western Education and  Library Board has not taken cognisance of what happened in Kesh and the  disastrous results of pushing children out of the local school &mdash; where they had  enjoyed good relations and were well looked after &mdash; into a situation in which  they are being bullied. That is no reflection on the school because that all  happened outside of the grounds. Children from the Kesh area have had  behavioural problems since they were pushed into the big school in Enniskillen. They feel that they are inferior  because they are not from the town.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It may sound strange to some Members that Enniskillen  should be seen as an urban metropolis, but if you live in the far reaches of County Fermanagh  it is quite a change to come to Enniskillen  for your schooling. It is disappointing that the board has not learned  from the Kesh experience.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is no surprise that Fermanagh District Council, the  Fermanagh branch of the Ulster Farmers&rsquo; Union, the Chamber of Commerce in  Lisnaskea and County Fermanagh Grand Orange  Lodge have been among those who have rejected the process in County Fermanagh.  Pressure groups, such as FREE and Impact, have been formed. Most significantly,  after the Committee for Education heard evidence from the board and the groups  involved, it asked for the document to be pulled and started again. I am glad  that some members of that Committee are here. There is no difficulty in having  a discussion about post-primary education in County  Fermanagh, but this document makes the issue blinkered  and means that post-primary education will not work for the good of children in  County Fermanagh.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister will be  coming to the House in the near future with her ideas for area planning.  Surely, given all that I have said, the pre-consultation document conflicts  with any area planning documents that she might  bring forward. I urge the Minister to ask the board to withdraw the  process. I ask her to take the lead with the document, rather than doing  nothing about it.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>: I  thank Lord Morrow for securing this debate.  Some might ask what interest I have in education in County Fermanagh.  I am a member of the Education Committee, but, lest it be used against me, I  stress that I am not speaking on behalf of that Committee. I am speaking as a  Member of the Assembly with an interest in education.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>:  Does the Member agree that it is disappointing  that, although the Alliance Party managed to provide a spokesperson in  this debate from the far-flung constituency of North Down, which is the  farthest possible point from Fermanagh and South Tyrone, and one Member called  Michelle has appeared for the debate, another Member of the same name &mdash;  Michelle Gildernew, the MP for Fermanagh and South Tyrone &mdash; not only has not  contributed to, but has not even shown up for, a debate on an issue that  vitally affects her constituency?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  That is a reflection on that Member, and it is for that Member to explain that  to her constituents.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the fact that the Minister of Education is in the  House. I assure her that I am not here as a bully. Assertions were made the  other day that some of us were bullies, but I am not the school bully. Equally,  I assure the Minister that we will not be bullied.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The issue of education in County Fermanagh  is relevant to us all, because it gives an indication of how the education  system has become so divided. As other Members  have said, rather than having a coherent strategy and policy, everyone  is doing their own thing. It seems that the Minister is allowing that to  happen. Therefore, I welcome the fact that the debate has been secured.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Education in Northern Ireland  faces a crisis, but people in County   Fermanagh are  additionally burdened on top of a confusing and distracted system. I am  appalled to hear how funds that were secured by a direct rule Minister have  still not been released for Devenish   College, which is in  desperate need of a new building. Prefabs are sturdy and great, but they are no  substitute for a new building, and they are not a long-term solution. Parents  should not have been guaranteed a new school, because that allowed the board of  governors to make the reluctant decision to close schools when a new facility  was not built. That remains the case five years later. The Minister has taken  her eye off the ball on that issue. When will the funds be released?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">She has often reminded us that she is the Minister of  Education. In the Minister&rsquo;s statement to the House on 4 December 2007, she  reminded us that she is the Minister for all children. She also informed us  that equality is her watchword, but what equality is there for children in County Fermanagh  in how the process is being conducted and how she is overseeing it?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I do not want the Minister to shift the blame, as she did  in the classroom assistants&rsquo; dispute, when she said that it was not she who took the decision but the boards. I do  not want the Minister to come to the House today and abdicate her  responsibilities. She was keen enough to get  the position; therefore, she should be keen enough to accept the  responsibility. She would have been keen enough had there been a call for the  establishment of another sector in County   Fermanagh, which the  Minister has declared a preference for &mdash; namely, the Irish-medium sector.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister&rsquo;s view seems to be that my comments are an  attack on the Irish-medium sector; they are not. The Irish-medium sector has a  right to educate just as I, as a parent, have a right to have my children  educated in the medium of my choice. However, with choice comes responsibility.  To date, the Minister has released funding for the Irish-medium sector. She has  released further funding for the teaching of Irish and Spanish in schools, yet  a problem persists in County   Fermanagh that requires  funding.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">With regard to area-based planning, which is in the  proposed scope of the review of public administration education legislation,  the Department has set out the timetable under which the first and second Bills  will be brought forward. If the Minister wants to be all-inclusive and prove  that she is for equality and does not want the maintained sector to get one  over on the controlled sector or the Irish-medium sector to be ahead of any  other sector, those issues should be dealt with in the first draft of the first  Bill. That is also the case if she tells us that area-based planning is a vital  building block. The Minister will make a statement on those issues some time  this month.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, the consultation document and the outline of the  second Bill tell us that area-based planning will not be addressed until the second Bill has been introduced.  Therefore, all the other arrangements must be put in place before we get to the  nub of the issue, which is area-based planning. Will the Minister give &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  Will the Minister assure the House that area-based planning will be addressed  in the first Bill?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education (Ms Ruane)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I  commend the Western Education and Library Board and the six schools involved in  the working group for exploring options that might best meet the educational  needs of children in the Fermanagh area. Education is facing significant challenges. In order to meet those  challenges, school authorities must examine provision to find out how  they could provide good-quality educational experiences for the future.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">T&aacute; rolla&iacute; i scoileanna san earn&aacute;il faoi chothabh&aacute;il, san  earn&aacute;il rialaithe agus san earn&aacute;il dheonach ag titim i gCondae Fhear Manach; ag  an am ch&eacute;anna caithfidh siad freastal ar riachtanais an churaclaim. Caithfidh  roinnt de na scoileanna a gcuid saor&aacute;id&iacute; a nuach&oacute;iri&uacute; freisin, agus tugann an  r&eacute;amhchomhairli&uacute;ch&aacute;n seans d&uacute;inn na ceisteanna seo a phl&eacute;.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Schools in the  maintained, controlled, Irish-medium, integrated and other sectors in  Fermanagh are experi&shy;encing falling rolls, but at the same time they need to  meet curricular requirements.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Some schools also need to modernise their facilities, and  there is an opportunity to examine those issues together as proposed by the  pre-consultation exercise.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The pre-consultation document suggests a number of possible  options for addressing the challenges faced by  the schools. It sets out important and worthy guiding principles that  have been agreed by the working group: a high quality pupil-centred educational  experience for all; equality of access and parity of esteem for all educational routes; high quality leadership and  manage&shy;ment; collaborative working; and the principles under&shy;pinning  diverse and shared futures. I am sure that Members and the community support  the guiding principles.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I will not comment on the options contained in the pre-consultation  document. It is a consultation with local communities and schools on the future  shape of controlled and voluntary post-primary education in Fermanagh. As the  document states, the options identified are not exhaustive, and other options  might be put forward during the exercise. I will be interested to hear what  transpires.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Western Education and Library Board does not have a  predetermined outcome regarding the pre-consultation process, and the purpose  of the document is to give the community the opportunity to shape the future of  post-primary provision. The board intends to collate  all responses following the end of the consultation on 26 February. The  working group of schools and the board will consider the responses before  advising on the next stages. In considering the options, the Western board has  considered the curriculum changes, the entitlement  framework and the Bain Report conclusions on sustainable schools.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I come from a rural community; I know how important it is  that children have access to the widest and broadest curriculum possible.  Children in rural schools must get the same as children in urban areas. I will  ensure that they do.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">George Bain did not say that schools below the recommended  thresholds must be rationalised. He said that they should be reviewed to see  that they continue to provide a high quality of education for all pupils.  Decisions on future provision are not made simply on the basis of enrolments,  but through the consideration of a range of factors at local level. The consultation  provides an opportunity to discuss those issues.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Lord Morrow mentioned Devenish College.  The Department has granted approval for a newbuild for that school, and that is stated in the consultation document. Devenish College is also part of the working  group that produced the consultation, and it is identified in the options. We  must be clear on the conclusions of the exercise and the way forward in helping  to identify the future accommodation needs for the area.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the debate as part of helping to inform and move  forward the modernising of our education system. In my statement to the  Assembly on 4 December, I explained that we must develop a more flexible and  agile post-primary school system that will take account of the full reform agenda  that is already affecting the education system in the North of Ireland.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I also made it clear that I was not advocating a  one-size-fits-all system. I am seeking to devise an education system in which  all children &mdash; and I mean all children &mdash; in all sectors will enjoy access to an  equal range of high-quality choices at the  critical junctures in their educational development, the most  significant of which is 14. I make no  apology for being the Minister for all children. The way in which young  people will access their post-14 pathway will be determined by the planning of  education in their local areas.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Following a series of meetings that I held with key  educational stakeholders before Christmas, my Department is engaged in a  further round of meetings with the stakeholders that are aimed at achieving  consensus on new post-primary arrangements. I look forward to the Committee for  Education reaching consensus and bringing it to me. I have provided the  Executive and the Committee for Education with information on developments. I intend to be in a position soon  to put to ministerial colleagues an outline of my proposals for transfer after  2010, at which point I will give a further briefing to the Committee for  Education and make a statement on progress in the Assembly.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In that context, it is helpful that we are having this  debate. There must be more public debate about the transfer arrangements, and I  welcome the Commission for Catholic Education&rsquo;s conference in Armagh  today. The commission and other key groups in the education sector recognise  that our children deserve the best that we can give them, and we can only do  that by building a consensus in which children are at the centre of our policy  deliberations.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The commission has also identified the challenges brought  by change, and I can reassure everyone that there will be a cohesive approach  to the many policy initiatives that are being advanced. The changes will be  well managed and not for the sake of change.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the Commission for Catholic Education&rsquo;s focus on social justice for all children and young  people.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I appreciate the  concerns expressed by some Members about consultation on the  post-primary transfer options in County   Fermanagh. That, of  course, is a matter for the Western Education and Library Board. However,  Members should remember that its publication is a pre-consultation document,  the assessment of options is at an early  stage, and there will be ample opportunity for the input of local people.  The working group&rsquo;s approach is to examine how best to meet the post-primary  needs in County Fermanagh.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Area-based planning will be at the heart of my post-primary  proposals. Planning and collaboration can ensure that an area&rsquo;s ability to  offer a range of pathways is related, and  responsive, to individual needs. Some local areas and sectors are  already engaged in area-based planning, which is often prompted by demographic  change and a desire to provide a wider range of choices. For example, if  children in an area are served largely by four schools, two of which select at  the age of 11, what are the options? If applicants, parents and schools can agree the best post-14 education route,  why could one or two of those four schools not offer mainly academic education  for children over the age of 14, alongside two other institutions offering  mainly technical and professional post-14 provision? Why could either or both  of those mainly academic institutions not be for 14- to 19-year-old pupils?  Alternatively, why could such institutions not cater for 11- to 19-year-olds  and offer a clear academic pathway for people in the area aged 14 and over? Why  should Government make such decisions on their behalf?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The oversubscription of particular institutions by either  11- or 14-year-old children is often raised in the Assembly. However, consider  that point on a broader canvas. The North&rsquo;s over-provision is such that nearly  all local areas have too many school places.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council for Catholic Maintained Schools is also undertaking  an examination of the options for the maintained sector in County Fermanagh.  Although the remits of the CCMS and the Western Education and Library Board  extend only to their respective sectors, both bodies &mdash; as well as the  integrated sector and Comhairle na Gaelscola&iacute;ochta, the Irish-medium sector &mdash;  have indicated a willingness to explore the potential for collaboration and  sharing facilities after they have a clearer picture of the local community&rsquo;s  views on the options for the future. For the benefit of all children&rsquo;s  education in Condae Fhear Manach, I encourage opportunities for greater  collaboration and sharing between schools.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Soon, I intend to announce my proposals to explore  restructuring requirements in order to deliver my overall vision for post-primary  schools. The work in County   Fermanagh is in line with  that and will feed into wider considerations. I have no doubt that the school  authorities will carefully examine all the views expressed by local people.</p>
