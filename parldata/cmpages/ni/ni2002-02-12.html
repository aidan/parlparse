                </font></b><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have received notice from the Minister of
                Agriculture and Rural Development that she wishes to make a
                statement on the meeting of the North/South Ministerial Council
                in its agriculture sectoral format that took place on 25 January
                2002 in Enniskillen.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Agriculture and Rural
                Development (Ms Rodgers):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The fifth meeting of the North/South
                Ministerial Council in its agriculture sectoral format was held
                at the Manor House Hotel, Killadeas, in County Fermanagh on 25
                January 2002. The Minister of the Environment, Mr Foster,
                accompanied me to that meeting, which I chaired, and he has
                agreed the contents of this statement. Mr Joe Walsh TD, Minister
                of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, represented the
                Government of the Republic of Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council noted the progress made by the
                various working groups on the programme of work spanning areas
                of animal health. It was noted that the working groups had met
                and produced action plans for future work. The Council received
                an informative presentation by a senior official from the
                Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, outlining
                the current position on various animal diseases in the two
                jurisdictions. The Council endorsed a joint paper on animal
                health on the island of Ireland and asked the animal health
                steering group and working groups to continue their work with a
                view to developing closer co-operation and joint strategies for
                the improvement of animal health on both sides of the border.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council noted that both Administrations
                were committed to conducting a review of the foot-and- mouth
                disease outbreaks and that restrictions on animal movements
                continued to be applied in both jurisdictions. Progress has been
                made in developing a common approach to the identification of
                sheep and pigs and on the introduction of common approaches to
                Aujeszky’s disease.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At a previous meeting of the Council it was
                agreed that a joint approach should be developed to pursue the
                eradication of scrapie among sheep. The Council expressed the
                hope that the joint approach would ensure the ultimate
                eradication of scrapie from the whole island and that, in the
                meantime, normal trade would continue in accordance with
                Community rules.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council reiterated that its priorities in
                the World Trade Organisation (WTO) negotiations should be the
                protection of the ability to export to Third-World countries and
                the retention of the WTO &quot;blue box&quot; exemption for
                direct payments to farmers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since the last meeting of the Council in its
                agriculture format, a new round of multilateral trade
                negotiations under the auspices of the WTO has been launched at
                the WTO ministerial conference in Doha, Qatar last November. The
                Council discussed the key elements of the subsequent declaration
                relating to agriculture and agreed to keep progress under
                review.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council noted and supported the active
                co-operation between the two Departments of Agriculture on the
                implementation of the common agricultural policy (CAP). Recent
                discussions between the two Departments focused on the changes
                to the EU Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS)
                regulations, CAP simplification, the sheep retention period for
                2002, sheep irregularity cases, reform of the sheepmeat regime
                and use of discretionary beef national envelope funds in 2002.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council also noted a progress report
                submitted by the steering committee on cross-border rural
                development and the fact that the committee will advise
                Ministers on appropriate follow-up action regarding the two
                studies commissioned by the steering committee. Those studies
                relate to co-operation between cross- border rural communities
                and cross-border rural development, education, training and
                research. The Council was also pleased to note that the European
                Commission has agreed the Ireland/Northern Ireland INTERREG III
                operational programme.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council acknowledged a positive report on
                the existing liaison between the two jurisdictions on plant
                health matters, which extends to both technical and scientific
                co-operation. It encouraged the relevant authorities to pursue
                the areas suggested for extended co-operation in plant health
                research and development. The secretariat tabled a paper to seek
                the Council’s confirmation of the appointment of a new chief
                executive of Foras na Gaeilge, the Irish language body, and the
                Council confirmed that appointment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The next meeting in agriculture sectoral
                format will take place in the South. However, given the
                proximity of elections in the South, a date has not yet been
                agreed. It is hoped that a firm date for a meeting can be
                finalised as soon as possible. The text of a communiqué for
                issue following the meeting was agreed, and a copy of it has
                been placed in the Assembly Library.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGrady:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister kindly received delegations from
                my constituency and therefore knows of the great concern about
                the proliferation of bovine tuberculosis (TB), particularly the
                clusters in south Down and the border regions. What further
                action will she take in conjunction with her partner Department
                in the South to co-ordinate the eradication of the disease? Will
                she consider the creation of a pilot scheme such as that in
                Monaghan, which seems to be giving positive indications of the
                eradication of bovine TB in that area? Can such a scheme be
                applied to some of the disease hot spots in south Down?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Rodgers:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGrady has been active in pushing me to
                act on the issue. The North/South Ministerial Council received a
                report that action plans had been agreed by the working parties.
                Minister Walsh and I have asked the working parties to produce
                concrete action plans. I hope that joint strategies will be
                agreed by the end of the year. I am well aware of the problems
                of TB and brucellosis, particularly in the hot spots that Mr
                McGrady referred to. The working groups have discussed all of
                those matters. I will have more details about the matter and an
                agreement on a joint strategy before the end of the year.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr J Wilson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I draw the Minister’s attention to the
                statement in the report that the Council noted that both
                Administrations were committed to conducting reviews of the
                foot-and-mouth disease outbreaks. Does the Minister not expect
                that an attempt will be made by one jurisdiction to lay blame on
                the other, particularly with regard to any activity that
                preceded the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease and any activity
                that both jurisdictions engaged in to bring the crisis to an
                end?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Rodgers:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not anticipate that either jurisdiction
                will lay blame on the other. Both worked extremely well together
                throughout the crisis to contain the spread of the disease. In
                the initial stages there was close co-operation between the
                Department of Agriculture and Rural Development and the South.
                Indeed, the quick action of my Department in tracing the missing
                sheep, despite the difficulties, was acknowledged as having had
                a major impact on preventing the further spread of the disease.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The review is being carried out on both sides
                of the border. On this side of the border there will be an
                independent consultative review, which will have its own
                independent secretariat. It will be able to talk to whomever it
                likes, on either side of the border. I envisage that the review
                being carried out in the South will be equally independent, and
                I do not foresee any difficulties between the two jurisdictions
                on this.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McHugh:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I
                welcome the statement from the Minister and the work that is
                being done by the rural development groups and the cross-border
                bodies on INTERREG, the work that is being done by the World
                Trade Organisation — though I am not sure whether I agree with
                the direction it is taking — and the appointment of the chief
                executive to Foras na Gaeilge, the Irish language body.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have two questions for the Minister on
                foot-and-mouth disease and brucellosis. Can the Minister assure
                the House that foot-and-mouth disease cannot now reach Ireland,
                given that there is little change in Britain with regard to the
                import of meat products from susceptible countries? Is there not
                a threat to the disease-free status of the South from the
                increase in the incidence of brucellosis along the border?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Rodgers:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I know that Minister Beckett across the water
                is looking at the threat from Third-World countries and others
                with a view to ensuring that it is dealt with. Our port controls
                in the island of Ireland remain in place. There have been
                complaints about the strictness of those controls, but people
                cannot have it both ways. I am not referring to Mr McHugh —
                but I have been told that I am too strict about refusing access
                to vehicles because they have not been properly cleansed and
                disinfected. I may also be criticised for not doing enough. The
                Department will remain cautious and keep its guard up at the
                ports. That is the best way of guaranteeing that the island,
                North or South, does not import the disease via Northern
                Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Can the Member repeat his question on
                brucellosis?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Could the South lose its disease-free status
                due to the continuing presence of brucellosis in areas such as
                County Armagh?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department has being carrying out a
                review of its disease controls with a view to tightening them.
                Mr McHugh will be aware that it has stepped up its testing, from
                biennial to annual, in the areas that are most affected. The
                Department is doing everything possible to curb the worrying
                increase that has occurred in recent years and to ensure that
                the disease is eradicated.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are several recommendations with a
                North/South dimension in the vision group’s report, especially
                on animal health. There seems to be widespread support in the
                North for an all-island policy on animal and plant health. The
                report also includes recommendations on the potential for
                North/South co-operation on research and development; food
                branding; equine issues; and on representing the interests of
                the two parts of the island on the common agricultural policy,
                particularly in its forthcoming review. I may bring forward
                proposals in those areas to the North/South Ministerial Council,
                once I have completed my assessment of the vision group’s

                evidence that farmers have deliberately spread the disease? Some
                of the material that I have seen indicates that the disease
                cannot be deliberately spread. Has the Minister any definite
                information on the alleged spread of the disease?</p>

                detail on progress on the establishment of an all-Ireland
                scrapie eradication programme?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Rodgers:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Under the auspices of the North/South
                Ministerial Council, I have agreed with Minister Walsh to tackle
                jointly the eradication of scrapie from the island of Ireland.
                The nature of the disease and of the sheep population in Ireland
                make it sensible to have a unified approach. We have agreed that
                that will be pursued by genotyping and culling susceptible and
                affected animals.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While the approaches in each jurisdiction may
                differ in detail, they each involve the removal of scrapie-infected
                and scrapie-susceptible animals from flocks. There will be
                controls on restocking aimed at ensuring that there will be no
                subsequent reinfection from the environment. That approach will
                ensure that scrapie is ultimately eradicated from the island of
                Ireland and that, in the meantime, normal trade may continue in
                accordance with EU rules.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Public consultation on the proposals for the
                Northern Ireland scrapie plan ended on 14 January 2002, and
                officials are considering the responses to it. Our proposals
                include a voluntary scheme that involves genotyping, which is a
                method of breeding resistance to scrapie into the sheep
                population, and other focused eradication measures such as
                slaughtering sheep that are infected with scrapie. Those
                proposals are designed to take advantage of the low incidence of
                scrapie in Northern Ireland. The aim is to reduce incidences of
                scrapie and ultimately to eliminate it from the Northern Ireland
                flock. The all-Ireland strategy is aimed at eliminating scrapie
                from the whole island.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Maginness asked about the policy
                commission. It is important to remember that its remit covers
                only England. The commission has made recommendations on several
                issues that must be addressed at a UK level. The four UK
                Agriculture Ministers will discuss those issues as appropriate,
                and any subsequent action will be subject to collective
                decision. Yesterday I met my Scottish and Welsh colleagues in
                Edinburgh, and such matters were discussed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report is comprehensive, and I wish to
                study it carefully before I make any substantive comments. Many
                of the problems and challenges faced by farmers in Northern
                Ireland are similar to those faced by farmers elsewhere in the
                UK and beyond. Therefore, it is unsurprising that the methods
                proposed to tackle those issues are similar to those measures
                recommended in the vision report, which was geared to examining
                problems and proposed solutions from a Northern Ireland
                perspective.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nevertheless, there may be ideas in the
                commission’s report that we might wish to explore to determine
                whether they could be of benefit to Northern Ireland farmers.
                However, I stress again that the policy commission’s remit
                covered only England; it did not relate to any of the regions.</p>

              of the people regulations to provide for the official recording of
              the receipt of postal ballot papers. A copy of the paper was sent
              to the Assembly. At its meeting on 4 December 2001, the Business
              Committee agreed that the consultation paper should be referred to
              the Committee of the Centre to prepare a response on the Assembly’s
              behalf. The Committee considered the paper on 12 December and
              agreed to seek written views from several bodies on the issues
              raised in the document. Written submissions were received from the
              Information Commissioner, the Northern Ireland Human Rights
              Commission, the Chief Electoral Officer for Northern Ireland, and
              the de Borda Institute. The Committee thanks those bodies for
              taking time to respond to its request for information. The
              proposal is to allow the receipt of postal ballot papers to be
              recorded officially by electoral administrators, and views were
              sought on the principle of the proposal and on the practicalities
              of its implementation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Under present procedures, the electoral
              register is marked to show that a ballot paper has been issued to
              a postal voter. The principal purpose of the mark is to prevent a
              voter who subsequently goes to a polling station from
              double-voting. However, the marked register does not record
              whether the postal ballot is returned. The Committee considered in
              some detail the proposal and its implications. It noted that, if
              the proposal is adopted, those inspecting the marked register will
              be able to identify who has returned a postal vote. Members know
              that the position is the same for those voting in person, as the
              register is marked to show that an individual has been issued with
              a ballot paper at the polling station.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In his response to the Committee, the Chief
              Electoral Officer expressed some concern about the proposal. He
              was concerned about the possible perception that, in noting the
              return of a postal ballot paper, someone could note how a person
              had voted, and that this could lead to a loss of confidence in the
              democratic process. The Committee considered this carefully and
              concluded that the opportunity for noting how a person had voted
              would be limited and that the risk to the secrecy of the ballot
              would therefore be very low.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Inspection of the marked registers is provided
              for under legislation. The principal users are candidates and
              political parties who use the data to establish voting patterns
              and trends. In addition, some electors have expressed a wish to
              have a way of checking that their ballot papers have been
              received. There is currently no way to do this. In its submission
              to the Committee, the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission
              commented that</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;It is unsatisfactory that, at present,
              people who use postal votes have no way of finding out whether
              their ballot paper arrived.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee agrees and considers that
              procedures should be put in place for the receipt of postal ballot
              papers to be recorded officially.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee also examined the practical
              implications of the proposal. The consultation paper proposed that
              the return of an individual’s postal voting documents should be
              recorded when the declaration of identity is checked, and the
              Committee agrees that that is the most appropriate point at which
              to record the information. The Northern Ireland Human Rights
              Commission highlighted that that is an area where Northern Ireland
              legislation differs from that in Great Britain and advised the
              Committee that if a ballot paper is returned without an
              accompanying declaration in Northern Ireland it is immediately
              ruled out, even if a declaration that matches it arrives
              separately. The Committee considered that the same procedures
              should apply throughout the United Kingdom and recommends that the
              legislation in Northern Ireland regarding the matching of
              declarations of identity and postal ballots be brought into line
              with legislation in Great Britain.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The other practical issue to be considered is
              where such information should be recorded. The consultation paper
              sets out two options. The first is to record the information on
              the marked electoral register that is used in each polling
              station, which would result in one consolidated list. That would
              mean that the process of marking the register with returned postal
              votes would have to be completed once the registers are returned
              from the polling stations — that is, after the count.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second option considered in the paper is to
              record the information on the list of postal voters maintained by
              the electoral registration officer. That would result in a
              separate record — a marked postal voters list. That information
              could be recorded as and when the postal votes are opened. It
              would then be up to anyone wishing to inspect the records to
              obtain both sets of data.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee is aware that recording the
              information on the marked electoral register that is used in each
              polling station to produce one consolidated list might cause some
              additional administrative work for staff in the Electoral Office.
              However, according to the Chief Electoral Officer for Northern
              Ireland, the Electoral Office would be able to cope with the
              requirement once its new computer system, with suitable
              enhancements, is installed. The Committee concluded that there are
              advantages in having one consolidated list and recommends that the
              information should be recorded on the marked electoral register.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee considered two related issues
              during its deliberations. In its submission to the Committee, the
              Human Rights Commission expressed reservations about the use of
              the electoral register for purposes not connected with elections,
              such as its sale for commercial use, and suggested that the
              regulations should restrict access to those who can show an
              election-related need for the information. The Committee
              considered this and agreed that individuals should be able to
              choose whether personal information held on the electoral register
              can be used for commercial purposes. The Committee considers that,
              in general, the electoral register should be used only for the
              purposes of public or court administration, and access should be
              limited to those who can show an election-related need for the
              information. The Committee has made reference to this in its
              report.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, the Committee was advised that, in
              Northern Ireland, postal ballot papers can be returned by post or
              handed in to electoral offices. However, there is no provision for
              postal ballot papers to be handed in to polling stations, as is
              the case in Great Britain. The Committee gave some consideration
              to this anomaly and recommends in its report that provision should
              be made for postal ballot papers to be handed in to polling
              stations in Northern Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I commend the report to the Assembly.</p>

              Education in this, Her Majesty’s Golden Jubilee year, to ensure
              provision is made for each primary school pupil in Northern
              Ireland to be provided with a suitable souvenir to mark this
              important and historic occasion.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In any circumstances, whether individually or
              collectively, celebrating 50 years of service is a special and,
              indeed, a unique occasion — and for no one more so than Her
              Majesty The Queen, who has served this nation with dignity and
              responsibility during the past 50 years. Our constitutional
              monarchy has brought stability to our United Kingdom, and Her
              Majesty has provided much wise counsel to the many Prime Ministers
              who have served her during her reign. Today we want to act with
              dignity and mark this special occasion in the manner that I feel
              it deserves.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This motion is not intended to be either
              divisive or offensive to anyone. It is intended to recognise the
              service given to the United Kingdom by Her Majesty, and it calls
              for this special year in our history to be marked in a way that is
              simple, yet reflective. Our children should be given the
              opportunity to receive a souvenir to commemorate the 50 years that
              Her Majesty has spent as head of state, just as children were
              given a souvenir at the time of the Queen’s coronation. I
              suspect that many in the Assembly can recall that time and can
              look back to when they were at school and were given a memento to
              mark the Queen’s coronation. They may not have placed much
              emphasis on it at the time. Indeed, they may not have seen it as
              important. However, having spoken to many who can recall that

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr Speaker. Can you
              explain to the House the use of a Dispatch Box for Members? Is it
              available for all Members to use, or are we setting a new
              precedent this morning?</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Properly speaking, the use of Lecterns, in lieu
              of Dispatch Boxes, is for Ministers when speaking as Ministers, if
              they choose — and not all Ministers choose to use one — or
              Chairpersons of Committees, if they choose, when presenting on
              behalf of their Committees. I see that the matter is no longer an
              issue.</p>

              taking advantage. The Box was there, and I thought it would not
              offend anyone if I used it. I want it recorded that I humbly
              apologise.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That demonstrates that I can be humble.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many types of souvenirs will be created during
              this special year, and I do not wish to be prescriptive about the
              type or design of souvenir. I believe that every primary
              schoolchild should have an opportunity to mark the jubilee
              tangibly, and if the Department of Education wants some ideas on
              what should be used, I am prepared to give it some. I suspect that
              it does not need that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the course of this debate there will be
              those who will say that Her Majesty is the British head of state
              and, as such, is not acceptable, or that many children could not
              participate. That is a poor argument. At the outset, I want to say
              that this should not be forced on every school. The option should
              be there, and it should be available to those schools and children
              who wish to avail of it. The Queen is the head of state of the
              United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, so she is
              the head of state to everyone who lives in Northern Ireland,
              regardless of political opinion, religious belief, ethnic origin
              or anything else that people may feel distinguishes them. We all
              are her subjects by virtue of where we live — the United
              Kingdom.</p>
              <i>

              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no basis for the claim that the
              majority of primary schoolchildren have no interest in receiving a
              souvenir in recognition of the Golden Jubilee. I suspect that many
              schools in the Province would welcome the opportunity to give
              their pupils a suitable gift. Perhaps some Members are opposed to
              the motion because to provide such an opportunity would expose the
              inaccuracy of their claims that children have no interest. I
              suggest that caution be taken. The Department of Education should
              not fall into the trap of restricting history and distorting
              reality. Why should schools not be given the choice of whether or
              not to present their pupils with a souvenir? Those who vote
              against the motion will deny every school in the Province that
              choice. If the Assembly were to reject the motion, it would deny
              the up-and-coming generation the unique opportunity to have a
              memento of the Queen’s Golden Jubilee for years to come.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some said, during the run-up to the debate,
              that the motion involves an element of flag-waving or an attempt
              to get one over on someone. That is not in my thoughts. It is an
              opportunity to recognise 50 years in which the Queen has served
              the United Kingdom with distinction and honour.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are supposed to be living in an era of
              parity of esteem in which everybody’s view is of equal status. I
              hope that the House will seize the opportunity to demonstrate
              tangibly to the Minister of Education that schools should have a
              choice and that the Department of Education should place at
              schools’ disposal a suitable souvenir to mark the Queen’s
              Golden Jubilee. We ask for no more, and I trust that Members will
              support the motion.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I beg to move the following amendment: In line
              2, after &quot;ensure&quot; insert:</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;where the board of governors deems it
              appropriate, that&quot;.</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of my earliest childhood memories is of
              being in a small parlour house in the Falls Road area, watching
              the Queen’s coronation together with many other families. I do
              not remember much about the ceremony, but I remember how the young
              Queen was serious and controlled. She realised that she had a
              demanding life in front of her. That was the general feeling in
              the room, and nothing but tribute was paid to her. As time has
              passed, those thoughts have, in many ways, been proved correct. I
              hope that this jubilee year will be another resounding memory for
              all of us and, of course, for the Queen. The death of the Queen’s
              sister was tragic, but it is to be hoped that she will still be
              able to take pride in her Golden Jubilee year.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I remember the Queen’s Silver Jubilee. I
              lived in Windsor, where we held an enjoyable street party. The
              participating families were of different backgrounds, colours and
              creeds, but were united in their good wishes for the young Queen.
              Again I recall thinking that it would have been great if we could
              have had similar scenes throughout Northern Ireland in celebration
              of a life lived in duty and loyalty towards all citizens.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This year should be celebrated in Northern
              Ireland as much or as little as people wish. Ample opportunity
              should be given to note, or to not note, the historic occasion.
              Therefore, I hope that Members will view my amendment without
              prejudice, if that is possible in Northern Ireland. My reason for
              tabling the amendment is that I have several misgivings about the
              motion as it stands, not least on monetary grounds.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the Department of Education is to ensure
              that a memento will be provided, it must be clear that schools
              will not bear the cost themselves. The Department must refer
              schools to the jubilee fund, which would allay budgetary
              pressures. In addition, district councils could be asked to become
              involved with local schools, because they too have had budget
              specifications for commemorative celebrations this year.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The decision for each school should be made by
              its board of governors, which is responsible to that school’s
              pupils and staff. That board would know the feelings and
              circumstances of the school, its pupils, staff and parents. That
              would not be discriminatory, nor would it contravene equality
              Directives. It would simply be an understanding that each school
              will be different in its observance.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As regards different agendas, I suspect that
              the motion might produce attitudes that have more to do with the
              identity of the Minister of Education than with an acknowledgement
              of the Queen’s work and commitment — I am aware that that does
              not apply to the proposer. I appeal to all shades of opinion in
              the Chamber not to use the Golden Jubilee as an opportunity for
              another instance of intolerance or backward thinking. Rather, they
              should view it as a fitting tribute to Queen Elizabeth II on
              reaching her Golden Jubilee.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I inform the House, Mr Morrow and others that
              it is not the Department of Education, but the Department of
              Culture, Arts and Leisure that is taking the lead in the Golden
              Jubilee celebrations — I am, however, sure that most people are
              aware of that. That was agreed by the Executive some time ago. I
              have a budget line, which the Department has been working on for
              many months. There has been an enormous response from across the
              Province.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">By your leave, Mr Speaker, I intend to make a
              statement next week to fully inform Members of the position in
              respect of the Golden Jubilee celebrations, outlining the many
              applications that the Department has received and the types of
              celebrations planned. I have not done so this week by agreement
              with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport — the lead
              Department in London — and other devolved Administrations
              throughout the United Kingdom, as a mark of respect following the
              death of Princess Margaret last Saturday. None of my colleagues in
              the devolved Administrations or the Government in London will be
              making announcements on the Golden Jubilee this week.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I regret that this motion is being debated this
              week. It is unseemly that we should discuss it at this time. It
              would be unseemly to become involved in divisive political debate
              on the issue. The motion could have been debated next week or in
              previous weeks. It would have been better had Mr Morrow and his
              party followed the lead of the devolved Administrations and the
              Government in London by not getting involved in the issue as a
              mark of respect. For that reason, my party will not be taking part
              in the debate today.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I strongly oppose the motion as a Member of the
              Assembly and as someone with a background in education. It is
              ridiculous that such a motion should come before the Assembly
              today, given that we all know that a variety of identities and
              allegiances exists in this community. I presume that the motion
              refers to one of the two main identities. However, many others do
              not want to receive the souvenir to which the motion refers. It is
              proposed in the motion that that souvenir should be imposed on
              those who do not want to receive it. We should all oppose that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The SDLP is committed, as it has always been,
              to the creation of a just, tolerant and pluralist society. We
              should all know the dangers and drawbacks of imposing things on
              others, especially on those from different backgrounds.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr McClelland] in the
              Chair)</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If I understood Mr Morrow correctly, I heard
              him refer to a pack that was provided for children by the
              education system in the coronation year. That was 50 years ago
              and, fortunately for all of us, things have moved on both
              politically and educationally. At that time, the education system
              discouraged the teaching of Irish history. In hindsight, we all
              know that that was a mistake, and one that we do not wish to
              repeat.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Speaking as an educationalist, I know that many
              subjects, such as mathematics, economics and languages, have a
              place in the education system. However, education in its truest
              sense goes further than that. Education is about the fundamental
              worth of each individual and the common good. It is about
              imparting the values to which I referred earlier — justice,
              tolerance and pluralism. Since education should be about the
              common good, that includes the common good of people of whatever
              identity, whatever their allegiance or political background. That
              is how we should manage education, and we should all aspire to
              that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion threatens that notion, so I oppose
              it. If we want to have an education system that provides a safe
              haven for all, regardless of religious or political persuasion, we
              should reject the motion.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to inform the Minister of Culture, Arts
              and Leisure — and he should be careful about what he says —
              that the motion was tabled weeks ago. It was not tabled following
              Princess Margaret’s death. His party did not approach Mr Morrow
              and ask him to withdraw the motion this week, yet Mr McGimpsey
              castigates the DUP for moving the motion, and is lauded by people
              from the opposite side of the House for doing so. That shows the
              spirit of both the UUP and the SDLP. If they do not get their way,
              they think that they can gag Members of the Assembly. This is an
              elected Assembly, and it is the only part of the Assembly that has
              any degree of democracy. I resent what the Minister said. If he is
              concerned about a motion being tabled, and he feels that he has to
              wait until the following week to tell people what he is going to
              do, that is his business. However, he has no right to castigate
              the Democratic Unionist Party for moving the motion.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Gallagher’s particular belief is that
              schools should be segregated and the people with whom he worships
              should all go to a school that is separate from the state system.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is a fact of life, which we all accept. If
              people want to have a separate school system, they are entitled to
              have it. Some people would say that they are also entitled to pay
              for it. That is a different story, and not for debate today.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also find it amazing that the Minister of
              Culture, Arts and Leisure is so concerned about this matter, given
              that, evidently, he was unconcerned about Princess Margaret’s
              death. He knows that if the First Minister, supported by the
              Deputy First Minister, had moved a motion yesterday, we could have
              paid our tributes to Princess Margaret as they were paid in

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is relevant to what Mr McGimpsey said. He
              should not have brought up those matters. He criticised us for our
              attitude to the death of Princess Margaret. I am entitled to
              defend myself. I am sure that you would be the first to defend my
              right to defend myself. We have to be realistic about this matter.
              I made my views known in the Chamber. We should have had a moment
              of silence. I noticed that they stood in silence in the imperial
              House at Westminster. I thought there would be conformity in all
              places. Evidently, that was not to be.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion is not asking for anything to be
              forced on anyone. It asks that the Department of Education should
              make a memento of this important event available to every
              schoolchild. If Mr McGimpsey has so much money in his kitty that
              he wants to pay for it, that is well and good. Nobody will argue
              with that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It will be a long time before anyone will be
              able to celebrate another fiftieth anniversary of a Queen.
              Monarchs do not usually reign for 50 years. This is an unusual and
              special event. I go back quite a bit — more than 50 years. I am
              sure, Mr Deputy Speaker, that you also go back quite a bit. [<i>Laughter</i>]
              Members of the House should not despise age. If one has a halo as
              a result of one’s age, it should not be despised. Some of us are
              fortunate to hold on to what little hair we have.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I remember the Silver Jubilee of King George V.
              We were all presented with a special mug, which I still have. I
              appreciate the fact that I was alive then and was given that mug.
              Everyone went to Ballymena Showgrounds, where Ballymena Urban
              District Council, as it was called in those days, put on a grand
              display of games and other events, and every child received a
              memento. That was a most acceptable thing to do. People who do not
              want to receive a memento are quite entitled to say that they do
              not want one. I know of one school in Ballymena where, on the
              direction of the schoolmaster, the pupils took the mugs out and
              broke them against a wall. There were different views about these
              issues, even in those days. That will no doubt continue.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is nothing in the motion that states that
              this should be forced on anyone. There was no need for the
              amendment to be tabled. The boards of governors will have control
              over the distribution of such a memento.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Northern Ireland is part of the United Kingdom
              — we are not in the Irish Republic yet. A Sinn Féin Member has
              told us that it already has a majority. In the next election we
              shall see who has the majority in this country. When I was a boy I
              was told that we would be outbred, but Protestant mothers have
              children too. The average Protestant family is much bigger today
              than it was when I was being brought up. The average Protestant
              family had two children, but now the average is four. There are
              those in this country who believe that their children should
              receive a memento, and they are entitled to want that. If that is
              going to bankrupt the education system, it must be almost bankrupt
              already.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those arguments are puerile, but mine is
              sensible. I believe that most people on both sides of the
              religious divide want a memento, and they are entitled to that.
              The parents and the boards of governors should make that decision
              in the schools.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am unconvinced by Mr Morrow’s arguments and
              his protestations of innocence on the motion. The motion is not
              about souvenirs; it is about party political advantage for the
              DUP. I agree with the Minister that this is not an appropriate
              time to table the motion. The SDLP has no problem whatsoever with
              people in Northern Ireland who wish to commemorate the Queen’s
              jubilee; we support that. The former Minister of Finance and
              Personnel, Mr Durkan — now the Deputy First Minister — made
              funding available for that. The Minister of Culture, Arts and
              Leisure will use that money to celebrate the Queen’s jubilee in
              an appropriate fashion.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion is mischievous, cynical, party
              political, unnecessary and inappropriate in the present
              circumstances. It has not been costed, and it is wrong for Members
              to table a motion asking a Department to expend money without
              properly costing the financial impact. There are 174,000 primary
              schoolchildren in Northern Ireland, so approximately £200,000 to
              £500,000 would be spent. The Department of Education could spend
              that money more appropriately by assisting those children in the
              learning process.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The SDLP is unconvinced by the DUP’s
              arguments. We believe that it is an example of its desire to
              impose a view of society upon all the people of Northern Ireland
              without regard to their political tradition or sensitivities.
              Therefore we believe that this is not a good motion, and it is
              inappropriate in the present circumstances. We believe in parity
              of esteem, and the Executive and the Departments should exercise
              that parity of esteem in dealing with the public. The motion does
              not do that. It is not sensitive, and it does not advance, in any
              way, goodwill and harmonious relations in our society.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, despite our misgivings about the
              motion and given the Minister’s announcement this morning, the
              SDLP believes that it would not be appropriate to oppose it in the
              present circumstances, so we shall abstain on the motion. On
              behalf of the SDLP, I believe that that is the most appropriate
              course of action. We shall also abstain on the amendment.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In conclusion, let me emphasise that the SDLP
              has no problems with people who wish to celebrate the Golden
              Jubilee in an appropriate manner. The Department of Culture, Arts
              and Leisure has an allocation for that; it is the appropriate way
              to deal with it, and we support that.</p>

              accession of Queen Elizabeth II, and it is a momentous occasion
              for us all. Only five other monarchs have ever achieved this, and
              it is even more poignant in the light of the recent death of
              Princess Margaret.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is remarkable that the woman who heads this
              nation has weathered the storms of modern life — as a queen and
              as a mother — and also the IRA’s attempt to kill her during a
              parade celebrating her birthday in Hyde Park in the 1980s. It is a
              testament that Her Majesty has had the strength of character to
              carry on despite the trials and tribulations, and the threats to
              her life that have been made over the past 50 years.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Her Majesty’s inspiration to all children is
              of supreme importance so that they can carry out their duties as
              citizens with the dignity and commitment that she has shown over
              the past 50 years. It is for this reason that children across the
              Province — no matter what their religion or political background
              — should have some souvenir to remember a momentous occasion
              that may not be repeated in their lifetime. The occasion should be
              marked by something that the children can keep forever and that
              they can pass on to their children and to their children’s
              children. Although we may have different political outlooks, it is
              imperative that all children are aware of all the traditions of
              this island, and that includes its association with the royal
              family. It would be honourable for the Minister to put aside his
              own political prejudice and doctrine and to think of what is good
              for the whole country. The party that the Minister belongs to
              harps on about embracing other cultures on the island of Ireland
              — let him prove it by giving children a suitable and lasting
              souvenir of the Queen’s jubilee.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yesterday in the Chamber Sinn Féin got its way
              and did not commemorate the passing of Princess Margaret with a
              minute’s silence. However, Sinn Féin Members stood in silence
              for Americans and other nationals that were killed on 11
              September. They stood for a minute’s silence last month for the
              murdered postman, Daniel McColgan. Is it too much for them to
              accept that the royal family is not responsible for their problems
              and to show a little respect for the head of the country’s
              sister?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Perhaps Sinn Féin does not like to admit that
              there is a huge interest in the royal family. One of the most
              popular magazines in the Republic of Ireland is called ‘Majesty’,
              and its appeal is to those who venerate a set of people that have
              everything that we shall never have: the position, elegance and
              lifestyle that we should all like to enjoy. Many residents of the
              Republic are as much in awe of the royal family and its nuances as
              the Unionist community is.</p>

              Ní nach ionadh, beidh mise ag labhairt in éadan an rúin, agus,
              mar a dúirt mé, ní cuid iontais ar bith sin. I rise to speak
              against the motion — which is not surprising. I listened to what
              Mr McGimpsey said about the timing and unsuitability of the
              motion. Given the circumstances of this week, there is certainly
              an issue there.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am charged with interpreting the motion from
              an Irish Republican standpoint, and I am happy to do that. I
              respect the views of others, but, equally, I expect Sinn Féin’s
              views — and those of Nationalists, Republicans and those who do
              not regard themselves as Unionists — to be similarly listened
              to.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have no problem with the celebration of this
              event by people who think that it is important. By the same token,
              I choose to commemorate the Easter Rising of 1916. As I have said
              before, 2003 is the bicentenary of the execution of Robert Emmet.
              Those are important historical events from a Republican
              perspective. We reasonably expect that the same level of
              recognition should be accorded to our historically important
              events.</p>

              that the British monarchy is a relic of Britain’s colonial

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To me, the British monarchy is a relic of
              Britain’s colonial history.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 2002 school-age children come from a variety
              of culturally diverse backgrounds. That was not the case in 1952,
              but it is the situation today. Unionists should take note of the
              reality that the majority of school-age children in the Six
              Counties now come from a Nationalist, Catholic background, as
              research and statistical experts stated in the ‘Belfast
              Telegraph’ last evening. Many other sources will attest to that.
              It is a fact; for some it is, perhaps, an unpalatable reality.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Belfast City Council voted £100,000 to
              celebrate the British jubilee, yet it is giving nothing to
              celebrate Saint Patrick’s Day. That needs to be put on the
              political agenda.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My suggestion is that schools, above all
              places, should be kept neutral. The Department of Education is
              charged with providing the best possible education for all our
              children. It is not charged with celebrating the British monarchy.
              Allegations have, quite properly, been made that the DUP is
              playing politics and is flag-waving. Earlier this morning a DUP
              Member gave an interview about this subject on the BBC, quickly
              followed by his party leader, who totally opposed the notion that
              an English Catholic could either marry a British monarch or become
              a British monarch.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Therein lies the true agenda. This is
              flag-waving by the DUP; it is a party political agenda. As an

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Gibson:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have heard much about many people’s
              memories of the coronation. This debate is about respect for one
              of the greatest and most brilliant concepts in the history of
              civilisation — a constitutional monarchy that allows the people
              to dictate the terms and thinking of a nation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Despite Mr McElduff’s rubbish allegations —
              when he talked about discrimination, or in McNamara’s word,
              &quot;scandal&quot; — the day Mr McElduff decided to select a
              wife, he discriminated against, or scandalised, other women.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The constitutional monarchy gives us, as a
              nation, the ability to defend Catholic, neutral Belgium or to
              respond to the attack on Poland, which is another Catholic nation.
              In other words, it is a constitutional monarchy that believes in
              upholding its agreements. This morning we have seen the direct
              violation of the Belfast Agreement. The agreement has been proven
              not to work because Barry McElduff, as spokesman for Sinn Féin,
              has shown that that party does not respect, or think of
              accommodating, other precepts or concepts in the Assembly. Sinn
              Féin has no regard for, or intention of accommodating, the
              concept of a constitutional monarchy.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I compare the concept of the constitutional
              monarchy to the concept of blood sacrifice of 1916 that Mr
              McElduff mentioned, which was epitomised in the celebrations of
              the 1960s. That blood sacrifice gave us thirty years of mayhem.
              Perhaps the greatest outworking of that sacrifice occurred in the
              two months when Sinn Féin/IRA controlled the suicide of 10 of
              their own people. Nothing matters as long as the blood lust is
              satisfied.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a difference in concepts. I am almost
              ashamed that the SDLP, which has piggybacked on the IRA for the
              past 30 years, has said that it does not support the motion. That
              is probably a form of non-violent boycott, which that party uses
              as a way out. However, there is a comparison, which has been well
              demonstrated in the Chamber, between those who wish to respect a
              constitutional monarch and the precepts, precedence and principles
              that the monarch embodies and those who respect the blood
              sacrifice of thirty years of mayhem — epitomised by the deeds of
              the 1916 rebellion and from 1966 onwards.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I still have my coronation spoon as a memento
              of those bygone days, when, as a small boy in Omagh, I heard a
              historic proclamation read from the courthouse steps. It
              demonstrated the seamless continuity of the monarchy, &quot;The
              King is dead, long live the Queen.&quot; A coronation spoon, which
              was chromium-plated and probably worthless, is the memento I have
              to mark the fact that I was there to see the continuation of the
              concept of constitutional monarchy, which is probably no more
              perfect than any other human institution.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The death of Princess Margaret occurred this
              week. Despite her prestige and position, she struggled for many
              years to accept eventually the idea behind constitutional
              monarchy, that faith is the all-important personal precept.
              Therefore, if the Belfast Agreement is so all-accommodating and
              all-embracing, it should show respect to those Roman Catholics and
              others, who I believe are still the great majority, who support
              the idea of constitutional monarchy. If the Assembly cannot
              accommodate that, it is proof that the vision of blood sacrifice,
              so well demonstrated by Mr McElduff and supported by the massive
              contribution from the Minister of Education, is not wide enough to
              allow people to support the brilliant concept of constitutional
              monarchy and to respect it for 50 years of stability in this
              nation.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is sad and regrettable that there are those
              in the Chamber today who seek to deny the people, and especially
              the children, of Northern Ireland the right, honour and privilege
              to celebrate 50 years of Her Majesty’s reign.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland
              spoke recently about a cold place for Unionists. Unionists were
              not even allowed to stand in the Chamber yesterday to mark the
              death of Princess Margaret. One wonders whether the Chamber is
              becoming a cold place for Unionists. I am not surprised by the
              remarks of IRA/Sinn Féin. They tried to murder me, so why should
              I be surprised that they do not want to celebrate Her Majesty’s
              reign? On my fortieth birthday I received a bomb. Life is supposed
              to begin at 40; mine was supposed to end, thanks to the
              Provisional IRA. Before the celebrated peace process the Provos’
              last act was to have been the murder of my wife and children.
              Therefore nothing that comes from the lips of those who would deny
              children the right to have a celebratory memento or souvenir
              surprises me. My children were to have been denied the right to
              life. Their souvenirs were to have been coffins.</p>

              The Member from West Tyrone says that schools should be kept

              denying children the right to see a royal person in case they

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does anyone believe that? It was Sinn Féin/IRA
              and, to be quite honest, they are all from the same litter. Sinn
              Féin/IRA denied a royal personage the right to come to a school
              in my constituency. If they could not let the children even see a
              person coming to talk about education, why should we be surprised
              that they would not allow a child the right to have a souvenir?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is interesting to note that, despite all
              this Republican anti-monarch and anti-Queen propaganda, people who
              support that propaganda love to run to the post office or the bank
              to get Her Majesty The Queen on banknotes. They love her very much
              when it comes to the day for paying out. That shows the brass neck
              of Republicanism and just exactly what Republicans stand for.
              However, I can understand it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I can even understand the SDLP’s perspective.
              I must challenge some remarks made by Alban Maginness. He said
              that the motion proposed the imposition of a souvenir on the
              children. The motion says</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;That this Assembly calls on the Minister
              of Education in this, Her Majesty’s Golden Jubilee year, to
              ensure provision is made for each primary school pupil in Northern
              Ireland to be provided with a suitable souvenir to mark this
              important and historic occasion.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nothing is being imposed — a provision is
              being made. In other words, if a school and the children want a
              souvenir, provision is made for it. In fact, the imposition is
              coming from the other side, because the SDLP suggests imposing on
              the Unionist family the denial of a right to a souvenir.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other Members have spoken about what they
              received for the coronation. I remember Her Majesty’s
              celebrations back then. I was only a wee nipper. I was dressed up
              as a sailor boy. My sister was dressed up as an angel, and my
              other sister, who was dressed up as Little Bo Peep with her sheep,
              won first prize in Stewartstown, County Tyrone.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have those memories, but we are not allowed
              to have them any more. It is only one road, one side. Therefore it
              is an imposition. However, it is an imposition on the Unionist
              community, because the motion does not impose anything on any
              child from the Nationalist or Republican communities. There is no
              imposition; the motion makes provision for each child if the
              school desires it. What is wrong with that? I do not care whether
              it is the Department of Education or the Department of Culture,
              Arts and Leisure that provides the souvenir.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I can understand the SDLP’s perspective, but
              it was important to set the record straight because Mr Alban
              Maginness misunderstood. Having removed that misunderstanding, I
              hope that Mr Maginness and his Colleagues will not sit on the
              sidelines, but will come with the Unionist population rather than
              deny them their right.</p>

              his opposition to it in strong and strident tones. Mr Maginness
              then said that they were not to vote, that it would not do to vote
              and that it was not the time to vote. It seems very strange that
              from one voice we hear the denunciation of these evil Unionists
              who would dare to do such a thing, and then his leader — or
              half-leader, or whatever he is — says that they have all to go
              home and not vote at all.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The fact is that he desired to be deputy leader
              but did not actually make it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I found Alban Maginness’s tones more
              conciliatory than Mr Gallagher’s. Divided voices within the SDLP
              may be common, but I trust that sense and reason will prevail in
              this. However, it is right to put the record straight, because Mr
              Maginness’s argument for rejecting the motion was that it was an
              imposition.</p>

              today by the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure. If anything is
              to be regretted or deplored, it is the position of the Ulster
              Unionist spokesperson in this debate. It is true that flags are
              being taken down in the councils, but now it seems that that same
              party does not want to give children the right to receive a
              souvenir of Her Majesty’s Golden Jubilee from the Department of
              Education. That is a disgrace. Minister McGimpsey must have got
              out of the wrong side of the bed this morning, come to the House
              in a fit of pique and let his tongue get away before his brain
              went into gear, so ill-considered was what he said.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To say the least, it is pathetic to use the
              death of Princess Margaret as a reason. That is obnoxious,
              revolting and scurrilous. I remind the House that Her Royal
              Highness was still alive when my hon Friend put this motion before
              the Business Committee, where it was accepted and supported by the
              Ulster Unionist members. Perhaps Minister McGimpsey did not talk
              to some of his Colleagues to find out what happened at the
              Business Committee. It is usual to do that, because there are
              several voices from that party on the Committee.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That he came to the Chamber this morning and
              abused the death of Princess Margaret in that way is to be
              regretted. I trust that before the end of this debate the Minister
              will do the honourable thing and withdraw those despicable,
              scurrilous and needless remarks in which he tried to abort and
              destroy the motion before this House.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have no doubt whatsoever that we will watch
              with care the various activities to be announced by his Department
              for Her Majesty’s celebration. It is certainly not his right to
              deny children their right to a souvenir of Her Majesty’s reign.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have a right to be proud of the 50 years’
              service given by Her Majesty to the United Kingdom. She has given
              that service with honour. Like any other mother she has had her
              heartaches, but she has carried herself with great dignity, and
              she has ruled with honour. My hon Friend has today brought to the
              House a simple yet proper and appropriate motion to mark Her
              Majesty’s Golden Jubilee. I trust that on better thought the
              rest of the House will give it support.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Education (Mr M McGuinness):</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am sorry that I was not present at the
              beginning of the debate. I was at the launch of the Anne Frank
              History for Today exhibition at Queen’s University Students’
              Union. I apologise for that; the debate was not expected to start
              until later.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have only a few things to say in response. It
              is important that events such as this do not prove divisive.
              Participation should be therefore a matter of choice, and I
              support that approach.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure is
              co-ordinating the Golden Jubilee celebrations. I know that the
              Minister has taken a close interest. He is keen to encourage the
              involvement of schools, should they choose to become involved.
              There is a range of events and opportunities in which any parents’
              association or parent-teacher association can choose to
              participate.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The main event for schools is a special poetry
              competition that is open to pupils aged seven to 18. It is divided
              into three age groups and has the Golden Jubilee as its theme.
              Schools may submit up to three entries in each age category. The
              subject matter of poems can range from Queen Elizabeth of England
              to social or historical events from the past 50 years. Therefore,
              there is a great deal of scope for the budding poets. Mr McGimpsey
              attended the launch of the competition in Buckingham Palace in
              early October last year. The closing date for entries is 31 March.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Schools and parents’ associations may run
              their own event for the jubilee; they may receive special funding
              for that purpose. Applications can be made to the Department of
              Culture, Arts and Leisure, and several primary and post-primary
              schools have already made applications.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I appreciate some Members’ views on my
              Department’s provision of a souvenir for primary schoolchildren
              here. However, I see no justification in spending public funds
              that would be more effectively used in the classroom.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. Is it
              in order for the Member to refer to the Queen as the Queen of
              England? She is the Queen of the United Kingdom. Of course, he
              would not believe in that, but he is happy to be a so-called
              Minister of the Crown.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not sure that that was a point of order.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs E Bell:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This has been an interesting debate that has
              almost acknowledged the intention of the motion. However, I was
              right to predict that the debate would also border on somewhat
              intolerant attitudes.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am aware that, as the Minister of Culture,
              Arts and Leisure said, the debate may have been ill-timed.
              Nevertheless, it took place, and I assert that my amendment would
              make specific what the DUP Members hinted at. That is, a souvenir
              would not be obligatory; each school would make its own decision.
              Therefore, all schools would be able to deal with the issue
              appropriately. In the interest of inclusiveness, I ask the mover
              of the motion, Mr Morrow, to include the amendment in his motion.
              However, if he does not agree to that, I beg Members to support
              the amendment.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Morrow:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank those who participated in the debate.
              It has stimulated some interesting comments, and I sincerely thank
              those who found it within themselves to support the motion. They
              have fully grasped what we are trying to do, and I acknowledge
              their remarks. All Members have expressed themselves exceptionally
              well.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I listened intently to Mr Gallagher. He may be
              some things to some people, but he has a habit of coming across in
              a belligerent, sectarian way. Of course, that is the way that he
              is made, and he cannot hide that. He came across in that way
              today. However, he should, perhaps, have listened to his comrade,
              Mr Alban Maginness, because he was speaking in a completely
              different direction. That is a matter for Mr Gallagher and Mr
              Maginness. Perhaps they owe each other something, but whatever
              that may be, they should sort it out somewhere else and not in the
              Chamber.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr McCrea tried to analyse what Members were
              saying, and he said that there was a divide in the House. He said
              that the comments of those who call themselves Nationalists were,
              perhaps, understandable. He then turned his attention to this side
              of the House and addressed the comments that were made here. I am
              deeply offended by Mr McGimpsey’s remarks. He appealed to the
              lowest common denominator. As Dr McCrea suggested, Mr McGimpsey
              should do the honourable thing and get to his feet to withdraw
              those scurrilous and tragic remarks. I will make way for him to do
              that. It is beyond contempt to try to make political capital from
              the Princess’s death. I ask Mr McGimpsey whether he would like
              me to give way so that he can withdraw his remarks — his refusal
              speaks volumes.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.15 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When I submitted the motion, Princess Margaret
              was alive. The Business Committee accepted the motion. Mr
              McGimpsey’s party colleagues are here and can confirm that. If
              we had known or received any direction, we would have re-examined
              the situation. This House will know how to treat Mr McGimpsey for
              using that event in such a way. More importantly, the public will
              form its own opinion.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I did not table this motion to put anyone on
              the spot. There are plenty of ways and opportunities for
              politicians in this Chamber to put the Opposition on the spot. I
              was determined that I would not use this motion to do that. I care
              little whether it is Mr McGimpsey’s Department, Mr McGuinness’s
              Department or anyone else’s Department that makes this
              provision. I want this House to ensure that a directive is given
              today to one of the Ministers so that schoolchildren will have the
              opportunity to pick up a simple memento that they can look back on
              in years to come and say that they received it in the Queen’s
              Golden Jubilee year. If that is a political or offensive
              suggestion, it goes right over my head. I want to assure people
              that politics is not the driving force behind this motion.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I cannot accept Eileen Bell’s amendment for
              one simple reason: the amendment seeks to put the onus on the
              boards of governors. That is not right. The provision should be
              made so that those who wish to do so may take it up. It is not
              going to be forced down anyone’s throat.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ford:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member said that the school should decide
              whether to take up this provision. Who is the competent authority
              in any school, if not the board of governors?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Morrow:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The amendment clearly says that this would be
              the decision solely of the board of governors. That is not right.
              Provision should be made available so that those who wish to take
              up this offer can do so. It should not be the case that each board
              of governors must go to the Department to say whether it wishes to
              take up this provision. The Department of Education or the
              Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure should make the provision.
              The schools should know that it is available and how to take up
              the offer.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr William McCrea:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does my hon Friend agree that parents should
              make the decision? They should have the right to choose. Why
              should a headmaster or a board of governors deny children the
              right to take up this provision, simply because they do not feel
              that it is politically correct? There is availability through the
              schools. Therefore, parents and children should avail of it,
              rather than let boards of governors make that decision for them. I
              have been a member of boards of governors for several years, and I
              believe that some on those boards would deny children the right to
              a souvenir. It is a decision for parents and their children.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Morrow:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Member for his exceptionally
              well-made point. No further comment on the matter is necessary.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I did not say what Rev William McCrea claimed
              that I said. If a matter such as this is brought before a school’s
              board of governors — and each board has at least two parent
              governors — the decision will not be taken at one meeting; it
              will be referred to the staff, pupils and parents.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr William McCrea:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No, it will not.</p>
              <b>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yes, it will. I have been in education for many
              years. It may be different in the South Eastern Education and
              Library Board, or on Mr McCrea’s board, but that is what we do.
              We never make a decision without referring it to parents. That may
              be wrong in the Member’s eyes, but that is the practice. Why
              does Maurice Morrow simply not say, &quot;I do not want to accept
              the amendment&quot;? I would rather he said that — it would be
              more honest.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I should like to comment on the Minister of
              Education’s remarks on the expenditure of public funds. I note
              that he does not have the same inhibition about delivering funds
              for the Irish language. This side of the House has very little
              appetite for that. Therefore, his remarks hold little water. I
              also understand that other Departments spend considerable amounts
              of money on such things — they put it down to spending on
              culture. If they want to create a sectarian divide with this
              matter — and I have no desire to do that — then I ask them to

              Children, Supporting Parents’ (2000), which decided not to
              change the legislation.</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Why this motion at this time? The subject is a
              crucial and emotive one, although it must be said that attendance
              in the House at the moment might suggest otherwise. However, we
              know from wider debate on the issue that that is the case. During
              the debate, there will, no doubt, be tremendous unity on the need
              to prevent cruelty and abuse of children. That is an aim that we
              all share. However, there will be differences regarding what is in
              the long-term interests of children.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The basic motivation for the motion was
              provided by the Office of Law Reform’s public consultation,
              which was titled ‘Physical Punishment in the Home’. That
              document implied that the so-called reasonable chastisement
              defence, which allows, within limits, parents to smack their
              children, should be either totally removed or severely qualified.
              However, in November 2001, during the course of that period of
              public consultation, which finished a few weeks ago, the
              Department of Health in London completed its own parallel
              consultation and decision-making in the same field. It concluded
              that no legislative change was necessary. My motivation in moving
              the motion is to urge the Minister of Finance and Personnel to pay
              strong attention to the decision in London.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My first reason for commending the result of
              the consultation in London is that the local Office of Law Reform
              document does not seem to have been genuinely open to all the
              options. On page 1, the then Minister of Finance and Personnel
              writes that</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;This paper does not take sides&quot;.</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That statement does not sit well with the
              subsequent comment on page 38 that</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;We must change our law in some way&quot;.</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Page 52 is emphatic. It states that</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;It is clear that the most obvious ways to
              mitigate the adverse impacts identified and to better promote
              equality of opportunity would be to remove the defence of
              reasonable chastisement from our law&quot;.</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If that is indeed the view of the former
              Minister of Finance and Personnel, what room is left for
              consultation that is open to all options, which should logically
              include the option of leaving the law unchanged?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A second reason to call for note to be taken of
              the decision of the Department of Health in London is that the use
              of research and statistical evidence in the Office of Law Reform
              paper further adds to the impression of a quest for a
              predetermined outcome. The document specifically asks for views on
              the evidence presented. Research in 1998 by the Office for
              National Statistics (ONS) showed that 88% of those surveyed across
              the United Kingdom viewed smacking as sometimes necessary.
              Contrast that with the survey quoted by the local consultation, in
              which only 34% were recorded as supporting &quot;physical
              punishment&quot;. In fact, the apparently low level of support in
              Northern Ireland may have been strongly determined by the way in
              which the question was worded — &quot;physical punishment such
              as smacking or hitting&quot;. To most people, hitting is much more
              violent than smacking, hence the much lower figure of support
              here.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As wide a range of scientific evidence as
              possible should be considered. In contrast, when on page 10 of the
              Office of Law Reform’s paper it claims to summarise the evidence
              on the effects of physical correction of children, it relied
              entirely, at least as far as the footnotes suggest, on just two
              academics, Dr Penelope Leach and Prof Christina Lyon.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is not made clear that both those people
              have strong links to the lobby favouring the criminalisation of
              smacking. In 1993 Penelope Leach said:</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Social policy cannot always await
              rigorous research evidence&quot;.</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Moreover, their research has been strongly
              criticised by other academics. Prof Eysenck stated in 1993:</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Leach’s account is too one-sided to
              form the basis of responsible recommendations to law giving
              bodies&quot;.</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also wonder why the document fails to
              register the research of other academics such as Dr Baumrind and
              Dr Larzelere. Dr Baumrind has written a review of the research
              evidence for the American journal ‘Paediatrics’. She concludes
              that a blanket injunction against physical punishment by parents
              is not scientifically supportable. A further review by Dr
              Larzelere and also published in ‘Paediatrics’ in 1996 found
              that out of 11 studies of parental discipline most — six —
              were found to have beneficial outcomes for children, one had a
              negative outcome and the remainder were neutral.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A further reason for following the Department
              of Health in London in retaining the reasonable chastisement
              defence in law is that the A versus the United Kingdom case at the
              European Court of Human Rights need not imply any further change
              in the law. That is a fundamental point. In spite of what the
              Office of Law Reform/ Department of Finance and Personnel document
              seems to imply, there is no imperative on the Administration in
              Northern Ireland, any more than its counterparts in London or
              Edinburgh, to allow a hard case to make bad law.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The 1998 A versus the United Kingdom case is a
              very peculiar and sad one. The boy known as &quot;A&quot; had
              allegedly threatened his brother with a knife, and he had also
              stolen something. His stepfather then beat him on several
              occasions with a garden cane. At the stepfather’s trial at
              Lincoln Crown Court in 1994 the jury deemed that the stepfather
              was using moderate and reasonable punishment. Subsequently, the
              anti-smacking lobby group, end physical punishment of children
              (EPOCH), sponsored A’s case in the European Court of Human
              Rights. The court found that A had been treated in an unacceptable
              manner under article 3 of the Convention on Human Rights. However,
              the European judges did not deliver any general pronouncement on
              the state of the law in England or the UK in this area. The
              Department of Health summary provided in ‘Protecting Children,
              Supporting Parents’ (2000), paragraph 4.5 states:</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The Court’s decision was based on the
              facts of the case before it. The ruling applied to that case
              only&quot;.</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is, therefore, no need to amend existing
              laws. The laws on assault should have been enough to result in a
              conviction in the A case, and there is therefore no need to remove
              the longstanding defence of reasonable chastisement. Moreover,
              under the Human Rights Act 2000, all UK courts must now take into
              account judgements from Strasbourg, including the A case. The
              Office of Law Reform admits that this has already happened in the
              case of Regina versus H 2001. That court of appeal case, heard in
              April 2001, developed the common law for England and Wales to take
              account of the A case.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A further major point is that those who argue
              for an outright or partial ban on smacking may have misunderstood,
              or misused, section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 on
              equality of opportunity. The Office of Law Reform has a
              responsibility under section 75 to promote equality of opportunity
              with respect to age, among other things. As a public body it has
              that responsibility. The document seems to imply that that
              responsibility should be read across to the position of parents
              relative to children. Is that not a fundamental misreading of the
              purpose of section 75? It neglects the extent to which adults and
              children are, by definition, unequal in certain key respects.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is therefore an absurd use of the law to
              argue that smacking equals inequality and that hence smacking is
              illegal. Children, unlike parents, are subject to reasonable
              chastisement. However, they also cannot buy alcohol or cigarettes
              under a certain age, and nor can they vote, drive or get married.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCartney:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Not only are children prevented from doing a
              number of things, but they are also, by virtue of their age,
              protected by the law as it stands, in a way that adults are not.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Birnie:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Member for that valid point.
              Moreover, there is incoherence in the consultation document. On
              page 16 it seems to favour non-physical methods of correcting
              children, such as time out, grounding and withdrawal of treats. If
              it is to correct a child physically, then — with regard to
              section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 — in due course it
              will be argued that it is just as unequal and unlawful to correct
              them by non-physical means. The logic must apply if we start from
              the premise.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most parents in Northern Ireland would be
              appalled at the prospect of legal change that could criminalise
              the use of moderate and reasonable chastisement. In moving this
              motion, I oppose the amendment in Ms Lewsley’s name. In that
              respect, the Governments of Scotland and the Republic of Ireland
              have proposed bans on smacking, but they are not yet law. We will
              have to wait and see whether they move in that direction.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The document relied heavily on arguments drawn
              from human rights and equality, but what about the human rights of
              many parents who believe in a family ethos where moderate physical
              chastisement can be used in a loving manner? Of course, no one is
              defending violent abuse or bodily harm, but I want to defend the
              human rights of those families who wish to practise moderate
              physical chastisement. If the law is changed to ban smacking, some
              of us may have to make the difficult choice between following the
              law and following our consciences.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister should pay heed to the decision
              taken by his counterparts in Westminster. As the Minister of
              State, Department of Health, Jacqui Smith, said on 8 November
              2001:</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;We do not believe that any further change
              in the law at this time would be appropriate — it would neither
              command widespread public support nor be capable of consistent
              enforcement&quot;.</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those points, which are made in the case of
              England and Wales, apply with equal strength to Northern Ireland.</p>
              <b>

              their homes&quot;.</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I ask the House to support the amendment. It is
              essential that we identify and analyse models of best practice,
              current thinking and research in many other jurisdictions, not
              just England and Wales. We have to consider the development of
              best practice in line with international standards. The protection
              of children is of paramount importance in our society, and the
              issues around the physical punishment of a child have provoked an
              interesting and wide-ranging debate.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Children should be entitled to the same
              protection in law as adults. Domestic violence is still a common
              occurrence here, and witnessing this type of behaviour in the home
              has a devastating and detrimental effect on children as it can
              increase violent, aggressive and anti-social behaviour in young
              people and adults.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In order to best meet the needs of children, we
              should all approach this issue with a genuine, open mind. That is
              the duty of the Minister and the Executive. In its consultation
              paper on physical punishment, the Northern Ireland Office of Law
              Reform maintains that children require effective discipline and
              agrees that care and effective discipline will equip them to take
              their place as mature members of the community.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is in that context that the issue must be
              addressed. As Dr Birnie said, the Office of Law Reform is engaged
              in an open consultation exercise, and the outcome is not
              predetermined. It is vital that experiences in other countries are
              taken into account.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to discipline, parents’
              discretion is exercised in a framework of legal rules. Any parent
              who fails to meet a child’s basic needs or mistreats a child can
              be tried in a criminal court. Although the law already regulates
              the issue of physical punishment, the established legal standard
              is problematic. Currently parents are allowed to use chastisement
              only in a reasonable and moderate manner. Changing the legislation
              is not enough to change society’s attitudes to parenting and the
              physical punishment of children.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Increasing knowledge of child development and
              psychology suggests that effective discipline should aim to stop
              unacceptable behaviour in the long term and short term by showing
              children an acceptable alternative way to behave. Effective
              discipline should help children to take responsibility for their
              behaviour and to internalise moral values.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In a recent report on physical punishment, the
              British Medical Association concluded:</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;We believe that physical punishment is
              inefficient, ineffective and harmful in modifying children’s
              behaviour and that parents should be encouraged and assisted in
              developing other methods of child discipline.&quot;</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Court action will not bring Northern Ireland
              law into compliance with the Government’s full range of human
              rights obligations, nor with the equality obligations of the
              Northern Ireland Act 1998. A decision must be made on whether the
              current law should be abolished or incorporated into a more
              general statement about families’ rights and responsibilities.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A statement of rights and responsibilities
              could be constructed to include the responsibilities of both
              children and parents, similar to that formulated in Austrian law,
              which was used to declare an end to physical punishment. That
              statement could be aspirational. Instead of banning physical
              punishment, the statement could say that parents should aim at not
              using physical punishment. It could be part of civil law rather
              than criminal law and be designed to help parents and children
              know where they stand under the law. A primary duty of the
              Northern Ireland Government is to promote equality of opportunity
              between people on the issue of physical punishment. Accordingly,
              due regard must be given to how to mitigate any equality impact
              and to how to promote equality of opportunity when dealing with a
              physical punishment policy.</p>

              physical punishment. Both the NSPCC and Save the Children are

              parents, not only those who experience problems, is important. Any
              help and support for parents, whether they are having a difficult
              time or not, can only be good. The aim should be to establish a
              system that will not only provide adequate protection for the most
              vulnerable in society from those who seek to cause them harm but
              also to respect parental rights.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A fundamental aspect of all relationships is to
              keep lines of communication open. We can all relate to parents’
              statements such as &quot;I do not know what to do with him/her.
              He/she will not listen to me.&quot; There are very few parents who
              have not said those words in some form or another. We cannot
              afford to give up and to stop communicating with young people.
              They may appear not to be listening, but often they have taken in
              our words and simply do not want to admit it. Respect and empathy
              should be shown to children, and corporal punishment is a
              contradiction of those values.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Funding is essential to support parents and, in
              addition to creating programmes to deal with problems after they
              develop, to introduce preventative measures. After all, prevention
              is better than cure. I therefore put the amendment before the
              House.</p>

              half hours for the debate. For that reason, and to ensure that the
              smaller parties have an opportunity to speak, I must limit Members’

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Gibson:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Parents from all over Northern Ireland have
              spoken to me about the issue. I point out to the Minister that
              loving, caring parents want their normality to continue. I speak
              on behalf of those who have enjoyed parenthood, who have love and
              affection for their children, and who have a sincere wish to bring
              up their family according to the precepts, norms and principles of
              their beliefs, philosophical or otherwise.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I warn parents in Northern Ireland that if they
              allow the legislation to be passed without challenge, they will be
              assuming that there is a nanny state — in other words, the state
              knows best; the state takes control, and the state controls
              parenting and its methodology. I ask parents to write to the
              Minister to convey their concerns. I want all those who are
              concerned about the matter to ensure that the Minister is aware
              that raising a family involves love and affection and the wish for
              one’s children to grow up to be good citizens. That is the norm.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are being told to control a tiny minority,
              the abnormal few who do not respect the rights of parenthood. We
              have a right to protect the family unit. It has always been the
              basic unit of society. We must give parents that right and
              privilege. I remind the Minister and those who support the current
              legislation that, according to the penultimate sentence in article
              2 of protocol No 1 of the European Convention on Human Rights, the
              state shall not act contrary to the philosophic beliefs and wishes
              of parents. Therefore the concept of respect for parents and the
              family unit is embodied in European law.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I ask that that right be respected in our
              legislation. It would be wrong of any legislature to assume that,
              because some parents are irresponsible, it can impose a general
              prohibition on the norm. I appeal to the Minister to take note of
              a heartfelt lobby. Perhaps it is not the most vociferous lobby,
              but it is composed of people who want their human rights and
              beliefs to be respected. Let us do more than just take note. It is
              important to support Dr Birnie’s contentions, which he so
              eloquently outlined together with the various academic arguments
              on the issue.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I appeal from the point of view of common
              sense. Ulster parents have always had great respect and support
              for the family, so to support the normal, good parents, who do
              their best for their children and who want to continue doing so
              — without having to look over their shoulders to see what the
              nanny state dictates — it is important that Members show clearly
              that we support the rights of the family.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to record my disappointment that the
              Business Committee has allowed each Member just five minutes.
              There is clearly a great deal of interest in the debate — both
              in the Chamber and outside it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion and the amendment. The
              motion is only calling for the Minister to take note of the
              outcome of the consultation process in England and Wales even
              though it was decided not to change the legislation there. I
              support Ms Lewsley’s amendment, because I think that she is
              right: the House should call upon the Minister to take note of the
              consultation that is taking place throughout the world and not
              just that which was carried out in England. We should not try to
              reinvent the wheel. There is plenty to take note of.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly must be careful not to pre-empt
              the outcome of the consultation, put a barrier against the
              outcome, or restrict the work of the Committee for Finance and
              Personnel or the Minister on that outcome. If there is to be
              consultation, the Assembly has a duty to allow the people who are
              being consulted the right to give their views. Local issues
              require local consultation, and the consultation exercise on this
              has raised several points from both the pro and anti sides in
              recent weeks. The Assembly must support parents, but it must also
              protect children.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">‘Children Are Unbeatable!’ is a group that
              has undertaken much research on this. It has produced a briefing
              paper, which says that</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;At the moment, ‘Children Are

              under the law and deserve better support from society&quot;.</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not believe that any Member would object
              to that. I am concerned that Dr Birnie does not support the
              amendment. I am unsure of his reasons. The model that has been
              proposed in Scotland, which Members were briefed on, shows that</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;A ‘middle’ position has emerged which
              includes a ban on all physical punishment of children under the
              age of three and the use of implements on all other
              children.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am, therefore, concerned about the basis on
              which Dr Birnie is rejecting the amendment.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many parents feel uneasy at present about what
              they see on television and in the media, and the Assembly must
              take that on board. There are concerns that many good parents will
              be victimised by this. The ‘Children Are Unbeatable!’ briefing
              paper states that</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;If the law were changed, parents should
              not have to worry about trivial prosecutions. Safeguards should be
              put into place to ensure that the new law is able to serve its key
              purpose — to protect children from physical violence rather than
              to penalise parents&quot;.</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The people who are working on that consultation
              exercise are also aware of the issues.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Regarding the substance of the motion, I do not
              think the Assembly should allow anything to pre-empt the outcome
              of any consultation exercise or restrict Committees. All Members
              sit on Committees and are, therefore, aware that they get lobbied
              — rightly or wrongly — about many matters. The Committees have
              time to take that on board and to analyse, scrutinise, and ask for
              advice.</p>

              satisfied with a number of Bills. While I hope that Dr Birnie is
              not trying to pre-empt or stop any consultation exercise, he is
              unwilling to take on board the model or consultation exercise that
              has happened. That is why I support Ms Lewsley’s amendment.</p>

              Surely, if it is with the leave of the House, that would mean that
              all Members are happy with the time being extended. Why should any
              time restriction be imposed? Mr Poots suggested that we seek the
              leave of the House to extend the debate by 45 minutes to allow a

              sixth time that this feeling of the House — that the time
              allowed for important debates of public interest is being severely
              restricted — has been aired. Apparently, there has been no
              improvement whatever. Mr Poots made the point that the time is
              currently available, as other business was more expeditiously
              dealt with than was anticipated. Why not, with the leave of the
              House, use that time? If one Member objects, then we do not have
              the leave of the House. If every Member agrees, then we do.</p>

              am then forced into finding time for smaller parties, such as your

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Like other Members, I was a little surprised
              that this motion was put before the House today. The motion simply
              calls on the Minister of Finance and Personnel to take note of one
              aspect of consultation on the matter of children’s discipline
              that is being conducted in England. I have no doubt that, whatever
              criticisms I might make of him in other areas, the Minister of
              Finance and Personnel is aware of the English consultation and is
              capable of reading the outcome of that report. In the terms in
              which the motion is phrased, it does not particularly add much to
              the process that we are currently undergoing.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In that respect at least, Patricia Lewsley’s
              amendment adds something to it, since it creates a greater degree
              of balance by referring to the consultations in Scotland and the
              Republic, rather than merely to those in England and Wales. The
              amendment, therefore, has considerable merit. In any case, while
              the motion as originally put down was not particularly meaningful,
              I would not have wanted to vote against it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no doubt that Scotland and the
              Republic of Ireland have taken significantly different directions
              to those taken in England and Wales, though their decisions have
              not been finalised. Given that the Unionists in this Chamber
              always tell us of their affinity with the Scots, they seem less
              willing to listen to the Scots than to the English. No doubt
              Nationalists will consider that they are being consistent by
              listening to what happens at this stage south of the border.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Scots have taken a rather more balanced
              approach in their considerations than the English have,
              particularly in the matters of protection for children under three
              and the use of instruments for administering corporal punishment.
              If we are not moving towards a total ban, those areas should be
              considered. Perhaps we should move further in the direction of an
              outright ban. There is an issue of proportion in how we address
              the matter and in how we deal with the genuine concerns of loving
              parents who consider that their past methods might make them
              criminals.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Northern Ireland we must refer particularly
              to the issue of obligations under section 75 of the Northern
              Ireland Act 1998. I was a little surprised at the suggestion made
              by Dr Esmond Birnie as proposer of the motion that adults are not
              exactly equal to children and therefore do not really matter under
              section 75. That is not my interpretation of section 75, and I do
              not accept that there is a case for adults’ doing anything they
              like with children just because they are not exactly equal.
              Clearly the rights under article 3 of the European Convention are
              at issue, and I was surprised when Mr McCartney intervened and
              referred to children being protected by virtue of their age. That
              also suggested that children might be damaged by virtue of their
              age in a way that would not apply to adults.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Birnie talked about defending the rights of
              families who wished to use moderate physical chastisement. Would
              anyone in this Chamber use that phrase in relation to any kind of
              adult? How can it possibly be suggested that such language is
              appropriate in respect of children if it cannot be used about
              adults? We must examine appropriate mechanisms to encourage
              discipline.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clearly there are, and I thank Dr Birnie for
              bringing me to my next point. As part of the balanced Scottish
              approach, for example, I notice that the Standards in Scotland’s
              Schools Act 2000 specifically bans corporal punishment but states
              that</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;corporal punishment shall not be taken to
              be given to a pupil by virtue of anything done for reasons which
              include averting … an immediate danger of personal injury or ...
              danger to property.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clearly there are cases where the proverbial
              tap on the back of the hand is appropriate, but we must be very
              careful that we do not appear to give the impression of a carte
              blanche for serious physical abuse. We have seen plenty of that in
              this society, and we must be careful not to approve anything which
              extends to any parent an understanding that such behaviour is
              acceptable. In this debate there is a danger of talking as if
              discipline is solely physical punishment. Other methods of
              discipline might not at times appeal to harassed, tired parents
              but might be more creative and beneficial to children in the long
              term.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is certainly no part of my case to make
              criminals of loving parents who react in a particular way at a
              particular time. It is clear that we must look to a balance in
              those matters. Rather than suggest that we should automatically
              espouse the English system, we should seek to encourage more
              appropriate discipline, and thereby more appropriate behaviour by
              children.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What is the definition of a smack? I would like
              to know the weight of a smack and the velocity of the movement of
              the arm. What is the difference between a proper smack and an
              improper smack?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members’ comments seem to involve an element
              of &quot;Don’t do as I do, do as I say&quot;. In other words,
              our children should be taught not to use violence in the hope that
              they will not use violence as adults. Of course, the people who
              teach them not to use violence use violence themselves. That is a
              fact.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Parents will do what they want to do in the
              confines of their home. There may be precious little that we can
              do about that. However, we, as legislators, should create an ethos
              and send out the message that the use of violence is unacceptable.
              It is as simple as that. I would like Members to share that
              opinion with me. Certain Members have wanted me to share those
              views with them for a long time. I want Members to share those
              views with every citizen of our society, including those who
              cannot speak for themselves and those who, when they do speak for
              themselves, are not listened to.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We cannot assess the parental skills and
              talents of Members, but their skills and talents as legislators
              are pretty evident. We have choices to make. We may not cure the
              ills of our society in one day, one week or one month, but we can
              lay down markers and an ethos. We can do that with our children
              before they get the opportunity to become, perhaps, polluted by
              the society that we live in.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It seems that there are circumstances in which,
              if a slap on the wrist were required, Mr Deputy Speaker, you would
              be more than welcome to tell an adult that he or she is about to
              get one, rather than have the adult tell the child that. I think
              that you get my message, Mr Deputy Speaker. It would seem that
              there are as many unruly adults as there are unruly children.
              There are those who are the grand democrats, who want to be
              listened to and fawned over but who will not listen to others.

              the ages that we may be, we can all cast our minds back and decide
              whether physical punishment in the home was a good idea. In
              relation to our capacity to withstand physical punishment, the red
              welts will go away. However, I am talking about a person’s state
              of mind, and the belief that it is OK to smack. Regardless of the
              scale of the punishment, and how it is dressed up, if it is OK to
              smack to engender authority, it follows that violence is OK. Even
              if minimal violence is involved, that is exactly what you are
              saying. Nothing will redress that — violence is violence is
              violence is violence. It is as simple as that.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ervine’s last point related to changing
              societies. Lest there be laughter in the House about the fact that
              certain things were once acceptable, but became unacceptable, I
              will tell Members about what was once acceptable — and what was
              said in the courts about what was acceptable — when it came to
              hitting a person. Hitting then, of course, became known as abuse.
              It was once acceptable to hit a woman with a stick that was no
              thicker than a person’s thumb, hence the phrase, &quot;rule of
              thumb&quot;. That was where the ecclesiastical courts started
              their rulings. They declared that it was perfectly acceptable to
              hit a woman in the house, providing that it was not too damaging.
              Women, rightly, started to ask what was considered damaging and
              what could be construed as emotional or physical abuse. Therefore
              the law began to change. The victims rose up and said that people
              would no longer decide by those laws what they could tolerate. A
              great deal of law was made on the basis of victims responding to
              what was considered to be acceptable.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Office of Law Reform’s consultation has
              not chosen a position. The matter has been left open for
              consultation and I have no doubt that the Minister will respond.
              The Office of Law Reform deliberately kept the consultation
              process open to facilitate a healthy debate.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Patricia Lewsley’s amendment is welcome. Some
              Members may agree with what the Scottish Parliament has done, but
              I disagree. When we start to split children up into age groups of
              0-3 years, 3 years and above, et cetera, we are getting into
              difficult territory. Let us in this devolved Assembly form our own
              views and advise the Minister on the civil law. We are not
              discussing criminal law, because the Office of Law Reform has
              responsibility only for civil law. As we debate this matter, let
              us remember that Northern Ireland is still the only place in
              Europe that tolerates corporal punishment in independent schools.
              That is a piece of legislation that we should move to change
              immediately. In tabling the motion, Esmond Birnie is getting ahead
              of himself. It might have been best to wait until the Committee
              had reported to the Assembly on the current consultation process.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with other Members who question what
              constitutes moderate physical force. Let me tell Esmond Birnie and
              Oliver Gibson that it is not a matter of a nanny state making
              decisions. The debate on seat belts was the same. The car was
              considered to be a private place and it was thought that, once
              inside a car, people should be allowed to do what they wished for
              the sake of their own safety. It was up to the individual to
              decide whether he or she would wear a seat belt. However, the law
              and the state took a different view, saying that such decisions
              had consequences for young children and that it was not the right
              of a parent to decide whether the child would wear a seat belt.
              The law and the state took that decision.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If people do not wear seat belts and accidents
              occur, there are consequences for the Health Service and social
              services. The same situation will arise as regards hitting
              children. The decision has consequences for psychiatric services,
              counselling services and social services. The state does make
              decisions on what happens in private places. Having undertaken
              much research over the years, I assure the House that private
              places are the most unsafe. People who are known to their victims
              carry out most of the violence in our society.</p>

              digestion. We have heard some rumblings already in his address to
              the Assembly.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I oppose the amendment and support Dr Birnie’s
              motion. In an erudite, logical and objective speech, he indicated
              all the relevant parameters of the debate. I can speak with a
              degree of authority, because I am the father of four children and
              the grandfather of six, two of whom I take on holiday for three
              weeks every year. Therefore, I am in close contact not only with
              my own children but also with my grandchildren. The difficulty
              lies in distinguishing between child abuse — in whatever form
              — and correction or reasonable chastisement of a child in a
              loving and caring environment, when that chastisement or
              correction is offered not to endanger the child, but to protect
              him or her.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If a child clambers up on the parapet of a
              high-rise flat, introduces a piece of paper into an electric fire,
              or runs out into traffic, it may be necessary to correct that
              child’s behaviour instantly, not because anyone wants to abuse
              or to inflict cruelty on that child, but rather to teach, protect
              and make him or her alert to the dangers of this world. The world
              is a dangerous place, and a criticism of the nanny state and the
              excessively caring parent is that by not exposing children to risk
              and danger, or to an apprehension of danger, or to the correction
              of danger, in a natural environment, they may place the child in
              greater danger. That has been the subject of all sorts of
              psychological investigations.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The law as it presently stands protects
              children from abuse or cruelty, although much of the abuse and
              cruelty that goes on is undetected by organisations such as the
              National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC)
              and social workers, who apparently are engaged to protect them.
              There is the example of the NSPCC in the case of the Climbie
              child, and countless other examples of children who have been
              systematically abused, and who have been systematically supervised
              by social workers and the NSPCC, which fails them entirely.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In many cases, therefore, the real, secret
              abuse will continue to escape detection. When it is detected, the
              abuser will be subject to prosecution under the existing laws that
              protect children as they protect everyone from cruelty, harm or
              assault. That blanket imposition on parental control would mean
              that a mother who is alarmed when her child dashes onto the road
              and who pulls the child back, giving it an instant smack on the
              leg, may well be reported to the local authority by a neighbour or
              a happy voyeur, and may be prosecuted. There is a suggestion that
              an individual may be given six months’ imprisonment or a period
              of counselling by some parenting group. That is absolute nonsense.

              beaten on the legs with a garden cane, involved a breach of human
              rights. However, the court did not make any judgement on the
              principle of law that operates in the United Kingdom which states
              that a parent may not abuse or be cruel to his or her child, but
              may exercise reasonable chastisement for the purpose of protecting
              that child, because they love and cherish the child and wish to
              protect him or her from future dangers that might cause pain or
              suffering. It would be a great wrong to remove that right from a

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Weir:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion and oppose the amendment.
              Henry Ford once said that you could have any colour of car you
              wanted, as long as it was black. Having read the consultation
              paper from the Office of Law Reform, it seems that you can do
              anything about the law as long as it is changed. That is the
              option that is open to us, as the proposer of the motion noted.
              The status quo is the one thing that is not acceptable, because a
              range of five different options has been put forward.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I appreciate that consultation continues. For
              unusual reasons, there was not a great deal of publicity when the
              consultation was launched. Its launch was scheduled for 11
              September, but other events overtook it. As the mover of the
              amendment probably said, there have been many lobby groups and
              forms of consultation. However, many people who have contacted me
              to express their concern do not feel that they have been empowered
              and consulted.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The voices of ordinary parents have not been
              listened to in this debate. The proposals bear symptoms of a wider
              malaise in society. The liberal elite appears to be introducing a
              raft of supposed rights and other proposals that are either
              ludicrous or repugnant to many right-thinking people. That liberal
              elite seems to sneer at anything that purports to relate to family
              values or the family unit, and that is the background against
              which the motion is examined.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are several reasons why we should argue
              that the current law is adequate. Any proposed change
              discriminates, in particular, against parents of a certain moral
              disposition based on strong Christian values. A large lobby of
              people believe that they have a right to apply a certain level of
              discipline to their children as part of their Christian faith. Any
              changes to the current law would discriminate against them.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It has been indicated that any change would hit
              the wrong target. For example, unfortunately, at one end of the
              scale, many parents seem to neglect their children, let them run
              wild and do not seem to exercise any discipline. I am sure that
              all of us have received complaints from constituents whose lives
              have been made a misery by petty vandals and young children who
              create nuisance. However, any change in the law relating to
              reasonable chastisement would not affect those parents.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the other end of the scale, the current law
              does not permit the physical abuse of children. Parents who
              physically abuse children, beat them up or attack them, are dealt
              with by the law. The review does not intend to deal more severely
              or adequately with those people. It will target parents who take a
              loving and disciplined attitude to their children. Those people
              will suffer as a result of any change in the law. Therefore, it is
              wrongly directed.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As regards state interference, the state has a
              right and a duty to protect the vulnerable in society against
              extreme behaviour. However, there is a fundamental difference
              between that and the enforcement of a particular theory of
              parenting, which is clearly intended in this instance. It is a
              facile argument to compare the reasonable chastisement of a child
              to the use of car seat belts based on the fact that if seat belts
              are not used, the child might be killed. We are not comparing like
              with like. If that theory were accepted, where would it reach its
              logical conclusion? For example, do we impose dietary conditions
              with which to bring up children? That would create a police state
              or nanny state, and it would take the role of the state too far.
              It would diminish people’s respect for the law, because it would
              create a law that people would find ludicrous, and which might not
              be enforceable. That would distract people’s attention from the
              important issues of child protection — the use of resources to
              protect children who are physically abused.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is worthy to support the motion, because
              proposals to change the law as outlined by the Office of Law
              Reform would result in political correctness gone mad. Let us
              ensure that parents have a choice as to how they bring up their
              children, within certain restrictions. I call on everyone to
              support the motion.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion. It gives parents, myself
              included, insight into other aspects of life. We all bring our
              children up in a world full of hope and promise, and we all
              believe that we act as our parents have done. However, we
              sometimes have to chastise our children, and a slap across the
              back of the legs is one way of doing that.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Babies grow up, and we must educate them about
              right and wrong. That means that we praise the good behaviour, but
              we also acknowledge the bad behaviour and punish it. I found that
              out more so with my three boys. I sometimes wondered why I was
              smacked as a child, and I realised with my children that there was
              a reason for it. It was not out of anger, but to protect the
              children. It was out of love and a fear that they would continue
              to do wrong in the future. That was the guiding light for many of
              us. Smacking as a reprimand was not always carried out, but the
              knowledge that my parents would smack as a last resort was enough
              to enforce upon me that there were social rules that had to be
              obeyed.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is disappointing that some Members here
              today cannot acknowledge the need for some control within a
              household on smacking children. Some Members seem to believe that
              there should be no smacking at all. They believe it to be cruel
              and unnecessary. That is hard to understand when we have
              representatives of a party here who tell teenagers to appear at
              Connolly House for reprimand and retribution. It does not look
              good: they are against smacking but are crying out for much more
              severe punishment.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Eighty per cent of parents in the United
              Kingdom said that they would use some form of physical punishment.
              The Government and the Assembly would be penalising the vast
              majority who take parenting responsibly. Many children are now
              fully aware of their rights and use those to their advantage. How
              many times have we heard of teachers being assaulted in schools
              and then being prosecuted because they tried to restrain the
              individual who was trying to cause them injury? We should
              acknowledge that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In London, a teacher was kicked in the stomach
              by a student when she was four months pregnant, and she lost her
              baby. The student was never prosecuted for the offence, but the
              teacher was victimised even more by the students on her return to
              work. She was again assaulted when she became pregnant for a
              second time. This was in the press at the time. Teachers cannot
              even ask a student to go to the headmaster’s office — a place
              where I found myself perhaps more than I should have — because
              that would be picking on him and violating his human rights.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Minimal and appropriate physical punishment is
              necessary when bringing up children, and a lack of any form of
              punishment in society directly corresponds with the rocketing rise
              in crime and vandalism that we are seeing today. That has already
              been mentioned by other Members. It is necessary to inform
              children that bad, and sometimes dangerous, behaviour is never
              appropriate and will be punished.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the arguments against smacking is that
              it does not work. It does. I will give the example of one of my
              children. He was told not to do something, but he kept on doing
              it. He was approaching a fire, and there was a danger that he
              could be burnt. I told him to draw back, and he did not. I reached
              out, not in anger, but to protect him, to bring him back, and I
              smacked him. My son learnt that the fire was dangerous, but I also
              saved him from serious injury. That is a small thing, but it is a
              way in which a parent interacts with his children and ensures that
              they are protected. That is important. It is a small but effective
              measure.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Physical punishment is appropriate, because
              children do not know what is best for them. That is a parent’s
              responsibility. That is what we are always trying to do. To those
              who say that smacking is wrong, I ask how they can reason with a
              five-year-old who is hell-bent on scribbling on a wall with
              felt-tip pens or beating the brains out of his younger brother?

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Poots:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is a very interesting debate, and I
              welcome the fact that most Members will have the opportunity to
              participate. The role of the family is crucially important, and we
              do ill to interfere too closely with it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Parents have a special relationship with their
              children. Having children was a special experience for my wife and
              myself. There was a bonding experience that allowed us to express
              our love, and allowed us to care for our children, and for our
              children to express their love to us. The vast majority of parents
              have the same relationship with their children. It is a loving and
              caring relationship where parents want the best for their
              children. They also want to give them the best opportunity and
              guide them in the right direction.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is remarkable that 88% of parents have, at
              one stage or another, used smacking as a means of giving their
              children direction. The vast majority of those 88% did that in
              love and care, because they wished to give their children the
              right guidance.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some Members may think it somewhat odd that I
              was such a keen supporter of the children’s ombudsman, and yet I
              supported smacking in the home. Throughout the process of the
              report that the Committee of the Centre drew up on a children’s
              ombudsman, I had said that 95% of the work of the ombudsman would
              relate to 5% of children. Children are being neglected and abused,
              not by parents smacking them, but by parents who are ignoring them
              and allowing them to run wild and do as they please in many
              circumstances. Those children unwittingly stray into danger.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In my constituency, large numbers of young
              people meet up regularly. Residents in the vicinity are harassed,
              objects are thrown at their houses and their own children are
              abused by those young people. Girls as young as 12 and 13 are
              mixing with young fellows of 18 and 19 years of age, where drink,
              drugs and glue are readily available. Are those parents caring for
              their children? Should those parents be charged with neglect of
              their children? I believe that parents who neglect their children
              and allow them to run wild do much more harm to their upbringing
              than those who will occasionally smack their children to bring
              them into line.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some of the articles that I have read about
              smacking and other forms of punishment stretch to the ridiculous.
              Giving children stars for good behaviour may work with very young
              children, but once they get a little older they may look upon that
              with disdain. Another form of punishment is to send children to
              their rooms for a time. If smacking amounts to physical
              punishment, then those other methods equate to mental punishment,
              and that must be considered objectively.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since corporal punishment has been excluded
              from schools, many teachers have said that they have no way of
              controlling children. Children can do what they like, and teachers
              can do nothing with them. If that has happened in our schools over
              the short time since corporal punishment has been removed, what
              will happen in our homes when children are allowed to do as they
              please, when they please, where they please, and parents can no
              longer bring them back into line?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Smacking is one form of punishment that can be
              used on children. I had to punish my son this morning, and I did
              that by removing his mobile phone for a week. I could have chosen
              to smack him, but I believed that removing his phone was another
              method of punishment. Parents have a range of options, and those
              who are disciplining their children should not be punished. Those
              parents who are neglecting their children and allowing them to run
              wild should be punished.</p>

              Farren):</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although I welcome the debate, I approached it
              with a degree of apprehension. I anticipated that, although the
              motion is directed at the nature of the consultation process, much
              of the debate would slip into assumptions about the outcome of
              that consultation process at a phase when the public consultation
              has been completed and an analysis of all of the submissions has
              just begun.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Therefore there has been no determination at
              this point on the outcome. As has become clear from the debate,
              many other jurisdictions, including all the United Kingdom
              jurisdictions, have been consulting on the question of how we most
              effectively bring discipline and guidance into the lives of our
              children, and what role the law should play. It is not a case of
              the law’s not having a role to play; it has a role to play in
              many aspects of family life. Suggestions that it should have no
              role at all simply ignore the considerable volume of family law
              that necessarily exists.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In England and Wales the consultation was
              through the document ‘Protecting Children, Supporting Parents’,
              published in 2000. That consultation received 900 responses, 80 of
              which were from Wales. Five hundred and sixty of the responses
              were from individuals. Analysis of the consultation showed that
              although nearly all the organisations that responded favoured a
              change in the law, 70% of those individuals who replied were in
              favour of maintaining the status quo. In November 2001, the
              Minister of State at the Department of Health, Jacqui Smith MP,
              communicated the Government’s decision on the way forward. She
              said that the Government would not be legislating on the issue.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important to note that, whereas the
              decision was taken not to legislate for the time being, Members
              will be aware from now on that that did not mean that there was no
              change in the law in England and Wales. The Court of Appeal,
              between the consultation and the Government’s decision, had
              occasion to adapt the law in the case of the Crown versus H. The
              Court added to the existing common law on reasonable chastisement
              those tests set out by the European Court of Human Rights in A
              versus the United Kingdom. Judges and juries in England must
              consider the nature and context of the defendant’s behaviour,
              the duration of the behaviour, the physical and mental
              consequences of the behaviour for the child, and the age and
              personal characteristics of the child. The Court of Appeal also
              added a fifth factor, namely, the reasons given by the defendant
              for administering the punishment.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister finished her statement by saying
              that the law on reasonable chastisement in England and Wales would
              be kept under review. It is, therefore, possible that the matter
              will be raised again in England and Wales at a later stage. Let me
              assure the Member — because this is the point of his motion —
              that I shall take careful account of the outcome of the English
              consultation exercise just as I, and, indeed my predecessor, have
              taken into our consideration the decisions reached on the law on
              the physical punishment of children in other jurisdictions.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Scottish result may be very different from
              that of England and Wales. A Bill is being introduced by the
              Scottish Parliament, which, if passed, will prohibit the physical
              punishment of a child under three years of age. It will forbid the
              use of any implement, such as a cane or slipper, and will make it
              illegal to shake a child or hit him or her on the head. The Bill,
              if passed, will also make it illegal for childminders in childcare
              centres to use physical punishment.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Republic of Ireland has also reviewed
              policy on the physical punishment of children and has decided that
              it will follow a policy aim of ending parental physical punishment
              through education. The Law Reform Commission of Ireland has said
              that it believes that this may, in due course, facilitate a change
              in the law, although it would be premature to change the law there
              now.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I should also refer to the experience of other
              countries. Sweden, Finland, Austria, Italy and Israel are among
              those countries that have ceased physical punishment, while Canada
              and almost all US states take the view that physical punishment is
              an exception to the law of assault. Therefore it was important to
              conduct a thorough consultation exercise in Northern Ireland so
              that a decision on the right model for Northern Ireland could be
              reached through the collection of comprehensive information on
              people’s views. The consultation document was not launched on 11
              December, Mr Weir; it was launched on 11 September.</p>

              circulated, and the Minister launched the document at a press

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Doctors, dentists and surgeries were all
              provided with copies of the consultation document, as were
              churches, libraries and schools. Evidence that attention has been
              paid to the document and that the consultation process has been a
              success in reaching all sections of society is to be found in the
              500-plus submissions that have been received. It is vital that the
              Executive hear the range of views so that we can find an
              appropriate way forward.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The process of analysing the responses has
              begun, and it will be a substantial task. I am making a commitment
              to publish the analysis. My Colleagues and I enter the process of
              examining options for the way forward with genuinely open minds.
              We shall have to do something, because the Westminster Government
              have undertaken to the European Court of Human Rights that the
              failure of the law to provide adequate protection to those in the
              position of A will be addressed and the law amended. However, all
              the options set out in the consultation paper remain: limiting the
              scope of the defence of reasonable chastisement; removing the
              defence of reasonable chastisement, including a statement of
              rights and responsibilities in the legal definition of parental
              responsibility; and encouraging the development of parenting
              programmes. Those options remain, and there may be more.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the contributions to the consultation
              exercise from all shades of opinion, including those contributions
              from Assembly Members. They are difficult issues that invoke
              strong feelings in many people, and the consultation exercise was
              the means by which those feelings could be communicated to those
              charged with deciding the way forward. The responses must be
              tailored to the circumstances of people in Northern Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall turn to some of the individual matters
              raised by Members. The nature of the Strasbourg jurisprudence,
              which was questioned in some contributions, means that although
              the court can look only at the case before it, its decisions will
              have wider ramifications. In A versus UK, the United Kingdom
              accepted that the law did not provide adequate protection to the
              applicant against maltreatment or punishment, contrary to article
              3 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Therefore it should
              be amended.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In moving the motion, Dr Birnie suggested that
              the research on which the consultation paper is based is flawed.
              Experienced lawyers and academics wrote the paper, and all efforts
              were made to check the facts contained in the paper. Dr Baumrind
              and Dr Larzelere are two leading sources that have been mentioned
              as not having been considered adequately. Dr Baumrind was
              considered during the preparation of the paper. Dr Larzelere’s
              work was written when the research for the paper was completed,
              but it has kindly been provided to officials who will give it
              proper consideration.</p>

              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Birnie:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My understanding is that Dr Larzelere’s
              research was published in 1996, well before the consultation in
              2001.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Farren:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I understand that the paper and research, which
              the Member refers to, was made available only after the
              consultation document was prepared. Nonetheless, it has been made
              available to officials, and the evidence in it will be considered
              in the course of the analysis of submissions to the consultation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Reference has also been made to an alleged
              misuse, or misapplication, of section 75 of the Northern Ireland
              Act 1998. Section 75 provides for equality of opportunity in
              respect of age. Every consultation in Northern Ireland must refer
              to equality obligations, and equality impact assessments must be
              carried out in relation to policy decisions. Currently, the law
              creates differences between how children and adults are treated in
              the law as regards assault and battery. There is no defence of
              reasonable chastisement for an adult who hits another adult.
              Therefore it is our job to see whether that distinction, as
              regards children, is justifiable. That is one of the purposes of
              the consultation; it does not predetermine the outcome.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I reassure the Member that the outcome of the
              consultation carried out in England and Wales has been, and will
              continue to be, noted by my Department and by the Executive.
              Equally, we will take into account the experience in other
              jurisdictions. Work will be carried out to analyse the responses
              to the consultation, and any policy that is developed will
              properly take into account the views expressed by those who
              responded to the questions posed by the consultation paper.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the debate has demonstrated, this is no easy
              topic. We have to keep in mind the three-year-old who is given a
              quick smack for going too close to the fire and the 12-year-old
              who is hit with a broom handle or worse, as evidenced by the use
              of baseball bats and cricket bats in our society. We must keep in
              mind chastisement of that kind, which is being given to teenagers
              for answering back or perhaps for not answering at all.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is not a referendum for or against
              smacking; it is much more complex than that. We have to focus on
              the functions of the law in defining standards. It is about
              protecting vulnerable people, including children who can be
              exposed to considerable mental and physical risk not just outside
              the home but also within it, and helping to shape people’s ideas
              about what is acceptable and unacceptable. It is not about
              classifying people into good and bad parents. Some good parents
              say that they have frightened themselves by smacking too hard. It
              is about asking some difficult questions and recognising that we
              are dealing with laws that are 150 years old.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is because of the value of informed debate
              on these important issues that I am happy to support the amendment
              in the name of Patricia Lewsley, as it emphasises the many sources
              on which we want to draw. Indeed, we have been doing just that in
              deciding the way forward. Parents, interested groups and all of us
              want what is best for our children and to bring them up to be
              responsible and active members of the community. I thank the
              Member for raising these vital matters in the debate, and I thank
              the Members who have contributed to it.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Lewsley:</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank those who have contributed to the
              debate and especially those who supported my amendment.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The debate is not about good parents or bad
              parents; nor is it about penalising any parent. It is about
              putting guidelines, legislation and, in particular, support
              mechanisms in place to help parents. I am surprised by Mr Weir’s
              complaint about the lack of consultation with parents and his
              support for a motion that narrows the issue by asking the Minister
              to take into consideration only the outcome of the consultation in
              England and Wales to the exclusion of other jurisdictions. The
              ultimate aim of the consultation should be the protection of our
              children.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Birnie:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank all those who took part, particularly
              the Minister.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The underlying argument in proposing the motion
              is simple and modest. It is that the Minister should note the
              decision made by the Administration in London, which was taken
              during the process of public consultation here, that no further
              change in the law is necessary. England and Wales face the same
              European Court of Human Rights obligations as we do, and the
              European Convention on Human Rights has already recognised that
              the European Court of Human Rights does not imply that all
              signatory countries must have an outright ban on smacking.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I sense that many opponents of the motion fear
              that if Northern Ireland, or any other part of the UK, retains the
              so-called &quot;reasonable chastisement&quot; defence, it will
              make them the odd man out internationally. Despite the implication
              contained in the consultation document, there is, in practice,
              great uncertainty as to whether major European countries such as
              Austria and Italy have truly banned smacking in the home.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The opponents of the motion should also be
              aware of the example of the state of Arkansas in the USA. You may
              say —</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will not give way as I have only a short
              time. The former President of the USA, Bill Clinton, who was a
              welcome visitor here, was Governor of Arkansas, where the statutes

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not think that we want to debate that
              issue today.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will be brief. Ms Lewsley referred to the
              need to encourage effective parenthood, and we all agree with
              that. I pay tribute to those portions of the consultation document
              that point the way to greater forms of support for parents. I have
              doubts about Ms Lewsley’s proposal for changes in the civil law.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with Mr Gibson’s points. Many of us
              have received letters from parents who are concerned about
              proposed changes in the law, and we should avoid punishing the
              innocent majority of parents along with a small minority. We
              should avoid a nanny state.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Ramsey said that we should look at the
              example of other countries, and I agree with that. However, it is
              important to examine those examples carefully to check whether
              they actually have banned smacking.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As to the point that changes in the law would
              not lead to trivial prosecutions, we should bear in mind that a
              court case has been taken in Scotland because of an incident in
              October last year when a French tourist smacked his eight-year-old
              son on the streets of Edinburgh.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ford said that we should not give carte
              blanche for serious abuse. We all agree with that. There is an
              existing law on assault.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ervine challenged proponents of the motion
              to define smacking.</p>

              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An acceptable definition could be established
              by the five criteria that are now set out in the development of
              the English common law, established by the R versus H case in the
              spring of last year, to which the Minister referred.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Prof McWilliams said that the consultation was
              an open process. However, as Mr Weir said, the option of keeping
              the law as it is was not listed among the options for public
              consultation. As to the impact of physical correction on children,
              I refer Prof McWilliams to the research that I mentioned in my
              opening speech. I agree with Mr McCartney that, in all
              probability, a change in the law would not prevent the sort of
              insidious, secret abuse that is so damaging and wrong.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with Mr Weir that we must listen to the
              concerns of ordinary parents. I also agree with Mr Shannon’s and
              Mr Poots’s remarks about the importance of having a loving
              family without excessive state intervention.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I note that the Minister said it is too early
              to analyse the results of the consultation. We eagerly await the
              analysis of the more than 500 submissions that the Office of Law
              Reform received. As I said, he listed the five criteria that were
              established after the United Kingdom versus A and the R versus H
              cases in order to inform courts about the definition of reasonable
              chastisement in future. That is where our law should rest.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, I urge the Minister of Finance and
              Personnel to note that the ‘Protecting Children, Supporting

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Business Committee for allowing me
              to bring this matter to the Floor of the Assembly. It is important
              to highlight the recent decline in employment in east Antrim to
              other Assembly Members and to the various Government Departments. <i>[Interruption].</p>

              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Beggs:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a clear need for Government
              Departments to assess how the job prospects and lifelong learning
              opportunities of the people of east Antrim can be improved.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many people’s perceptions of east Antrim are
              inaccurate and have more in common with the situation in the
              1960s, rather than with the reality of the twenty- first century.
              GEC, ICI and Courtaulds have gone. The voids left by those
              multinational companies have been filled by FG Wilson
              (Engineering) Ltd and by small business complexes which have
              developed on the former sites of ICI at Kilroot and of Courtaulds
              at Carrickfergus. During the past decade, in common with the rest
              of Northern Ireland, unemployment declined with the emergence of
              new industry and service sector jobs in east Antrim. In 1996,
              unemployment in Larne was at 10%, slightly above the Northern
              Ireland average of 9·5%.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In recent years the economic outlook for east
              Antrim has been primarily related to the fortunes of Nortel
              Networks. In 1999-2000 over £125 million was earmarked for
              investment in Nortel’s Monkstown plant. In 2000 Nortel won the
              Northern Ireland Exporter of the Year award, and its workforce
              almost doubled. A range of suppliers flourished in east Antrim at
              that time — Insilco, Solectron and C-Mac.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">New jobs were created, but with the crash of
              the global telecommunications market those were either lost or
              were at risk. Since January 2001 there have been 1,000
              redundancies at Nortel, and 200 staff have been given early
              retirement. There have been 350 redundancies at Solectron, 200 at
              C-Mac and 120 at Insilco. Other job losses in the electronics
              industry were related to the decline in the world economy. Two
              hundred jobs were lost at Daewoo Electronics in Carrickfergus, and
              65 at AVX in Larne. With the announcement of other redundancies,
              the total of jobs lost in the last year affected approximately
              2,000 people.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Questioned by David Hilditch, an Assembly
              Colleague from East Antrim, the Department of Enterprise, Trade
              and Investment reported that 44% of all redundancies in Northern
              Ireland between April and November 2001 were in east Antrim. That
              statistic is startling. The scale of job losses is the same as
              that caused by the closure of the man-made fibres industry in the
              early 1980s. The trade union Amicus-AEEU indicated that a 2:5
              ratio multiplier effect comes into being when manufacturing jobs
              are lost, because the additional loss of service sector jobs
              increases the total.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The unemployment statistics for December 2001
              show that unemployment in the Carrickfergus Borough Council area
              is at 6·6%. That is the fifth highest of any council area in
              Northern Ireland. Larne borough, at 5·9%, is the sixth highest,
              with the Northern Ireland average at 4·6%. That is the position
              at the moment, and recently announced redundancies have yet to
              appear in official unemployment statistics.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Eleven district councils in Northern Ireland
              are earmarked for special TSN support from LEDU and IDB. I want to
              know why those eleven councils qualify, while the councils with
              the fifth- and sixth-highest unemployment rates — Larne and
              Carrickfergus — do not. I welcome the fact that the criteria for
              designating TSN are under review, but I would like the Minister of
              Enterprise, Trade and Investment, and the Executive, to bear in
              mind that dramatic changes have occurred in east Antrim, even
              since the recent completion of the Noble indices.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The IDB’s most recent report shows low
              numbers of overseas visits to east Antrim. In 2000-01, there were
              no visits to Larne, and only three to Carrickfergus. How can we
              address the decline? How do we make progress? How can we
              contribute to improving the lot of the people of east Antrim?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a need to promote sustainable
              employment, and to switch the focus to indigenous business
              start-ups and company development, which is the role of the
              Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment and Invest Northern
              Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Education also plays a role in improving people’s
              opportunities. I place a high level of importance on the need for
              education, to enable an individual to improve his or her skills.
              The availability of training and further education is key to
              improving the employment potential of individuals, the economic
              performances of employers and the economy as a whole: hence the
              wording of the motion.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The East Antrim Institute of Further and Higher
              Education, for which I have the highest regard, is not located in
              east Antrim; it is located in north Belfast. East Antrim is one of
              the few constituencies in Northern Ireland that does not have a
              permanent, central further education college. As a member of the
              Committee for Employment and Learning, I have repeatedly raised
              the issue of further education provision in my constituency, as
              the former Minister will testify.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is underprovision. Larne Technical
              College closed in 1999. It has since been demolished, and the site
              is derelict. Larne’s current further education provision is
              situated in a temporary, out-of-town location. There is a real
              need to re-establish further education facilities in Larne town
              centre to give a focal point to continuing lifelong learning. I
              hope that the Minister will soon be in a position to announce good
              news on that front. I am pleased that she has agreed to meet me
              next week to discuss this and other related issues. The meeting
              was arranged prior to the selection of this motion for debate.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are several areas in which there have
              been educational gaps in east Antrim, particularly under Peace I
              funding. Proteus (NI) Ltd spent a total budget, largely in the
              field of educational support, of £22·25 million, none of which
              was spent in the Carrickfergus Borough Council area. The
              educational guidance service for adults (EGSA), with a budget of
              about £4·3 million, spent only £26,000 in the East Antrim
              constituency, on one pilot project.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the fact that Proteus (NI) Ltd and
              EGSA recently attended a community-funding event in east Antrim.
              Applications will rise as a result of that. However, as east
              Antrim has a relatively weak community infrastructure, there may
              be a need for proactive departmental support in that area.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Oakfield Community Centre in Carrickfergus
              is a potential outreach area for the East Antrim Institute of
              Further and Higher Education. It has been successful to date, but
              demand is dropping because its equipment is obsolete. I seek
              proactive support from the Department for Employment and Learning
              to improve the educational facilities in that deprived area of my
              constituency.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many villages, never mind towns, in Northern
              Ireland were provided with community educational IT suites through
              Peace I. However, to the best of my knowledge, the town of
              Carrickfergus, which does not have a further education college,
              was not. The officials responsible for the allocation of Peace II
              money recently advised me that it is unlikely that funding will be
              available within their gift. Again, will the Minister say whether
              there are departmental or other funds to provide Carrickfergus
              with a community education facility so that lifelong learning
              programmes can be provided?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I expected learndirect, the Internet-based
              learning facility, to play a key role in filling the
              further-education voids in east Antrim. Until recently, Larne and
              Carrickfergus were two of only four district council areas in
              Northern Ireland that did not have a learndirect centre to provide
              community access. I welcome the recent announcement of a
              learndirect centre in Carrickfergus, which is to be operated by
              Oriel Training. However, I regret the fact that no learndirect
              application of the required quality has yet been approved for
              Larne. I suggest to the Minister that a new further education
              campus in Larne would be an ideal location for a learndirect
              centre. The community that I represent is becoming frustrated by
              the delays and the lack of equality in the provision of lifelong
              learning facilities.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the development of small business
              units. There has been a successful development at the Larne
              Enterprise Development Company (LEDCOM) and at Carrickfergus
              Enterprise Agency Ltd (CEAL), in Carrickfergus, where business
              start-ups have been encouraged — all the units there are filled.
              In my constituency there is an opportunity to further develop
              indigenous employment that would continue to exist despite changes
              in the world economy. I ask the Department for Employment and
              Learning and other Departments to support such developments.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The people of east Antrim need equal education
              opportunities as regards the provision of further education and
              training. A level playing field is required to provide incentives
              for businesses across the board in Northern Ireland. The fortunes
              of the global economy are not in the hands of the Assembly, but
              let us ensure that equal opportunities for training, education and
              employment are provided for everyone in Northern Ireland,
              including east Antrim.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank my fellow Assembly Member for East
              Antrim, Mr Beggs, for bringing this important issue to the House.
              There has long been a perception that east Antrim is prosperous
              because of companies such as GEC, Standard, Courtaulds, ICI plc
              and Carreras Rothmans (NI) Ltd. Those companies have gone. They
              were replaced by companies such as Daewoo, which is more or less
              gone; Insilco Technologies, which has only two remaining
              employees; and C-MAC, Solectron, and AVX, which have also gone.
              There is a real danger that the entire constituency of East Antrim
              is placing all its eggs in two baskets: FG Wilsons and Nortel
              Networks Ltd. That is dangerous, as we have seen already this
              year. For example, my friend is today working the last day of his
              notice period at a subsidiary of Nortel. He is redundant from
              today.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">East Antrim is now one of the unemployment
              black spots of Northern Ireland. When my Colleagues, Mr Beggs and
              Mr Roger Hutchinson, and I met the Minister of Enterprise, Trade
              and Investment a few weeks ago, we discovered how bad the
              situation is. Long-term unemployment is increasing, and youth
              unemployment is actively rising. There may be a correlation
              between the rise in youth unemployment and the closure of the East
              Antrim Institute of Further and Higher Education in Larne. When
              that facility closed, all sorts of promises were made. We were
              told that a smaller, purpose-built, state-of-the-art building with
              IT suites would be built to meet the needs of modern education.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those promises have not been delivered on,
              because the property has not yet been sold. I hope that progress
              will be made on the matter. I thank the Minister for her presence
              here today, and I know that she is sympathetic to our concerns and
              is trying to ensure that all people in Northern Ireland have equal
              access to training.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.00 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Further education in Larne was asset-stripped
              by the East Antrim Institute of Further and Higher Education. More
              and more courses were removed from the institute in Larne to
              safeguard the institute in Newtownabbey until full-time further
              and higher education provision could no longer be justified in
              Larne. However, hundreds of people made use of part-time
              provision, and that service is no longer available.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to touch on some other issues that have
              affected my constituency. The Moyle interconnector is now on
              stream, and there is a combined gas turbine plant at Ballylumford,
              where there will be a huge number of job losses once that is fully
              operational. There have been job losses at Kilroot power station
              in the past few years. East Antrim seems to have fallen behind; as
              prosperity has increased elsewhere in Northern Ireland, it seems
              to have decreased in east Antrim.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is also hidden unemployment. Mr Beggs
              referred to figures that we received from the Minister. However,
              because many of the jobs that were lost in companies such as AVX
              and Insilco Technologies provided second incomes for families, and
              because those losses occurred in the run-up to Christmas, perhaps
              they have not yet appeared in the raw statistics. I fear that the
              statistics are much worse than we are being led to believe.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like the Minister for Employment and
              Learning and the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment to
              appoint officials to examine seriously the situation in east
              Antrim. There is no longer a hospital in the constituency; a minor
              injuries unit was promised, but there has been no word of it. The
              people of east Antrim have been stripped of everything that they
              had, and they cannot take much more. Not enough is being done to
              meet their needs.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is talk about building the capacity of
              our young people and helping them be the best that they can be in
              order to compete in the modern world. I agree, but how can that be
              done when people in Carnlough have to travel almost 40 miles to
              reach the East Antrim Institute?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The tourism industry has been faltering, and
              much more should be done to improve it. The Industrial Research
              and Technology Unit should become more involved in trying to
              safeguard and add value to the assembly jobs at FG Wilson.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Hilditch:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support what the previous Members have said,
              and I once again voice my concern at the job losses and the lack
              of training opportunities in the constituency of East Antrim.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After the last round of job losses at Nortel in
              May 2001, I wrote to the company and subsequently met their
              representatives on 12 June 2001. The agenda of the meeting was the
              long-term future of Nortel and the group of satellite companies
              that was set up to supply directly to Nortel. The company
              representative assured me that job losses had been unavoidable,
              but that the company was now leaner and fitter and that the market
              had bottomed out. Nortel was simply waiting for the upturn that
              research predicted would happen. It could not be stated at that
              stage when that upturn would occur, but Nortel was confident that
              no more job losses would occur at the company or at its suppliers,
              including Solectron. Disappointingly, as an elected
              representative, that was the last I ever heard from Nortel.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I then had a series of meetings with the
              satellite companies, including Solectron. At this stage I was
              concerned that Solectron had a contract with Nortel as the sole
              customer, and that people who had applied for jobs at Nortel ended
              up employed at Solectron. I have continued to be concerned at the
              state of this industry, in which Nortel appears to be the central
              figure. Indeed, I have submitted written questions on this
              subject, to which Mr Beggs referred earlier. The answer was that
              1,218 people were unemployed up to 9 November, but I believe this
              figure to be less than half of the jobs that have really been
              lost. The figure does not take into account those on temporary or
              fixed-term contracts, and those who lost their employment before
              finishing their training, therefore not attracting redundancy.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I must add that many of these employees were in
              secure employment elsewhere, and were encouraged to leave and move
              to Nortel and Solectron on the promise of secure employment,
              increased earnings, overtime, and better working conditions. This
              is why the workforce is so embittered about not only the loss of
              its employment, but the way in which the bad news has been
              handled. For example, documentation was left accidentally in
              photocopiers: output increased at the Solectron factory; employees
              were sent to other factories in Scotland and the Republic of
              Ireland to help them achieve the quality that the Carrickfergus
              factory achieved every day. Currently the contract Solectron has
              with Nortel is worth some £45 million, and I believe that this
              will be relocated to the aforementioned factories. Therefore this
              loss will be not only to Carrickfergus and east Antrim, but to
              Northern Ireland as a whole.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to redundancy packages for the
              workforce, the reality is that because Solectron is such a new
              company in the Province, the redundancy package is of little use
              to most of the employees. I urge the Minister to ensure that every
              effort is made in training and employment to ensure that the very
              capable workforce is offered every opportunity for training and
              upgrading of its skills and technical know-how, so that its
              prospects for new employment are fully maximised, and that these
              workers are simply not put out to graze as surplus to requirement.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another area for concern in my constituency is
              the gas turbine installation in the Premier Power plant at
              Ballylumford. The contract has been awarded to an Italian company,
              which in turn has recruited a workforce of foreign nationals. I am
              informed that the skills required are readily available in our
              locality. I am concerned that the workforce may not be receiving
              the minimum wage, despite its entitlement as members of the
              European Union. I have brought this to the attention of the
              Assembly through question AQW 965/01. The answer from the Minister
              of Enterprise, Trade and Investment was as follows:</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;My Department does not hold this
              information which relates to issues outside its remit and to a
              private company. Nationals of countries outside the European Union
              and the European Economic Area require an employment permit to
              work in Northern Ireland. Responsibility for the issue of
              employment permits rests with my colleague the Minister for
              Employment and Learning. The National Minimum Wage is a reserved
              matter, on which the Department of Trade and Industry leads for
              the United Kingdom as a whole.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Further questions have been tabled, and are due
              for answer this week by the Minister for Employment and Learning
              — we look forward to those. I am disappointed with that answer,
              and empathise with the local people who have experienced
              unemployment in the east Antrim area, and who see foreign
              nationals taking much- needed jobs and shipping home the wages.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In conclusion, I am deeply concerned at the
              state of the telecommunications industry in east Antrim, on which
              the area is heavily dependent. I can draw parallels with the
              textile industry, whose demise devastated the area during the
              1970s. We can ill afford to lose the telecommunications industry,
              but similarly I am concerned at the over-dependence on this
              industry. East Antrim also depends on small businesses, as some
              58·4% of employment in Carrickfergus and Larne is accounted for
              by small businesses, many of which are experiencing difficulties.
              East Antrim currently ranks fifth among the 18 parliamentary
              constituencies in unemployment figures, and urgent measures need
              to be put in place to reverse that trend. I support the call to
              improve job prospects and lifelong learning opportunities.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ford:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I rise to look over the constituency boundary
              from South Antrim to East Antrim, as I want to add a few brief
              comments to the debate on the Nortel aspect, particularly on
              behalf of my Colleague, Mr Neeson. I welcome the fact that this
              debate is taking place, and I congratulate Mr Beggs for having
              introduced the topic.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a significant problem in east Antrim.
              Companies such as Nortel did not just employ constituents of East
              Antrim Members; they also employed many people from south Antrim
              and north Belfast. As David Hilditch has rightly highlighted, the
              shrinking of 1,500 jobs in IT and communications in the last year
              or so was in parallel to what happened in the late 1970s and early
              1980s to the textile jobs, which also disappeared from south and
              east Antrim. A major initiative is needed to restore confidence in
              the area and deal with the after-effects of the job losses at
              Solectron in recent weeks.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There has also been some good news. The recent
              announcement by the planners to give outline planning permission
              to the retail and business park at the Courtaulds factory site in
              Carrick is a positive development on a brownfield site and is
              clearly welcome. However, we must ensure that that is followed up
              fully. I trust that the Minister for Employment and Learning will
              ask her Colleague, Reg Empey, to ensure that the Department of
              Enterprise, Trade and Investment lends as much support as possible
              to that project, so that there are more jobs for the people of
              Carrickfergus.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Similarly, there are some positive signs of
              recovery of IT jobs in north America. We hope that the Minister
              can give us some assurance that everything possible will be done
              to stop job losses in Northern Ireland and to ensure that jobs are
              underpinned until they become fully viable and firms can expand
              again after the anticipated upswing in the economy when it comes
              across the Atlantic from north America.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Invest Northern Ireland will have a major role
              in developing and promoting investment. The over- dependency on IT
              and communications jobs has been highlighted, and there is a need
              to build up the tourist potential, but basically the economic base
              in the constituency and in the wider County Antrim area must be
              broadened. That clearly comes back to the Minister for Employment
              and Learning, because one fundamental matter must be addressed —
              skills development and the promotion of lifelong learning
              opportunities.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Government must support private business,
              because private business is the engine that produces economic
              growth in an area. However, competition does not always achieve
              what we want, and the changes made to further education several
              years ago seem to have created difficulties. The amalgamation of
              separate colleges seems to have led indirectly to problems in
              several areas, most obviously in the closure of the Larne campus
              of the East Antrim Institute.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It must be possible to redress that. Danny O’Connor
              has rightly highlighted that it has not been dealt with as
              speedily as it should have been. Whatever problems there may be in
              running a multi-campus institution, it cannot be right that the
              people of Larne have no further education provision closer than
              Ballymena, Antrim or Whiteabbey. Something must be done to put
              further education provision back in Larne, and we must also look
              for some form of outreach in Carrickfergus instead of depending
              entirely on the facility in Whiteabbey. Those matters must be
              addressed urgently.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Economic confidence in east Antrim, which has
              had high employment levels and has lost them, is lower than in
              some parts of Northern Ireland that have always expected to have
              higher levels of unemployment. Larne is clearly an area of major
              concern, although Carrickfergus is not far behind, and when I say
              Larne, I mean the entire borough from Ballycarry to Carnlough.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sean Neeson wrote recently to several Ministers
              to seek a co-ordinated interdepartmental approach to the situation
              and to ask that a task force be set up to ensure that the problems
              do not fall through the gaps between different departmental
              responsibilities. Those problems simply cannot be dealt with in
              isolation, and I ask the Minister for Employment and Learning to
              tell us what she can do, in conjunction with her Colleagues, to
              ensure that a multi-agency task force, involving not only
              Government Departments but also local agencies in Larne and its
              wider community, is put together to ensure that we tackle the
              problem in a way that shows that this institution is supposed to
              symbolise joined-up Government.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr K Robinson:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I must point out that east Antrim contains
              three boroughs — Larne, Carrickfergus and Newtownabbey. They are
              both independent and interdependent. What affects one part affects
              them all.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.15 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is true in the current economic climate,
              especially in the aftermath of September 11.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A catalogue of job losses has removed thousands
              of positions from our economy over the last year: Nortel Networks
              and Bombardier Shorts in Newtownabbey; Fort James UK Ltd; AVX and
              Insilico Technologies (UK) Ltd in Larne; and most recently
              Solectron and C-MAC Network Systems Inc in Carrickfergus.
              Countless other small firms have either closed their doors or
              savagely reduced the numbers of their workers.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unfortunately, east Antrim has been down this
              road before. In the 1960s and 1970s, almost one quarter of the
              man-made fibre industry of the United Kingdom was located in that
              area. Names such as Courtaulds, ICI and the tobacco firm Carreras
              appeared on the wage packets of many homes in the three boroughs.
              A change in global economic terms led to a disastrous period of
              closure for those firms. The blow to the economy in local terms
              was manifest in the virtual stagnation of commercial life in those
              towns. Shops that depended on the spending power of these workers
              closed, thus adding hundreds more to the unemployment registers.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With the terrorist campaign in full flow, the
              intervening years brought a certain unexpected respite to the
              economic life of the area. Many residents found part-time or
              full-time posts in the security forces and the Prison Service,
              with the Carreras site eventually housing the RUC stores. Today,
              with the present, imperfect peace process, there has been a
              substantial loss of these security-related jobs. That is a hidden
              factor in the job problem in east Antrim.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since the region had a particularly high
              concentration and percentage of these sources of employment, this
              has in many ways created a double whammy for my constituents in
              East Antrim. Are our towns once again to suffer the commercial
              downturn that afflicted them in the 1970s? There is perhaps one
              vital difference today. In the 1970s, the direct rule regime was
              not particularly sympathetic, and was disinclined to intervene in
              east Antrim for political, as much as economic, reasons. Today we
              have once again a local Administration that can reflect the
              concerns of our constituents. Just as it was a local
              Administration that first attracted the man-made fibre and tobacco
              industry into east Antrim, the current, restored Administration is
              in a position to actively pursue inward investment. It is also in
              a position to work with large companies to minimise the current
              unemployment downturn and ensure that these companies and their
              workforce are well positioned to benefit from the inevitable
              upturn.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In this era of joined-up government, I appeal
              to the Ministers — particularly the Minister of Enterprise,
              Trade and Investment — to set up a task force, comprising the
              six MLAs, representatives from the borough councils and
              business/commercial life and the Minister’s officials to see how
              existing links, for instance via twin towns and sister cities,
              might be profitably exploited. Perhaps a trade mission focused
              solely on the needs of east Antrim could be put in motion. I am
              sure that the local enterprise development agencies in each of the
              boroughs can contribute their expertise in the creation of small
              and medium enterprises to ensure that the economy does not put all
              its eggs in one basket again.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the current survey into to the location of
              Civil Service jobs is complete, the Minister of Finance and
              Personnel will have an opportunity to ensure that a significant
              number of those jobs are located in Larne, Carrickfergus and
              Newtownabbey. Those towns currently have 0·6%, 0·5% and 0·3% of
              the total Civil Service jobs in Northern Ireland, which is an
              absolute scandal. Those stable jobs would help to sustain that
              critical mass of the economically active residents which these
              towns require during this period of industrial readjustment.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of the Environment also has a role
              to play by ensuring that the outstanding natural beauty and
              resources are enhanced and not destroyed by endless, thoughtless
              and, in many cases, tasteless development, so that the tourist and
              recreational potential of the area can be fully exploited.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister for Employment and Learning also
              has a vital role. One strong nucleus in the area that can attract
              employees and employers is the strong higher and further education
              base provided by the East Antrim Institute of Further and Higher
              Education, currently based in Newtownabbey. That base could be
              considerably strengthened if the Larne campus were speedily
              developed to its full potential to provide a focal point for the
              upgrading of the skills of that local workforce, thus enhancing
              their prospects and the prospects of the town in attracting inward
              investment.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Jordanstown campus provides a strong
              research and development base, which has been useful in the task
              of spinning out new enterprises, particularly in the high-tech and
              biomedical field. It is currently the centre for training for the
              hospitality and tourist industry. I hope that the University of
              Ulster will be encouraged to develop that expertise at the
              Jordanstown site given its high standing and its proximity to many
              tourist attractions and hotels in the area.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister for Regional Development has a
              crucial role to play by ensuring that the trans-European network
              route linking Larne to the rest of the system is not reduced
              beyond Whitehead, and that the A2 beyond Greenisland towards
              Carrickfergus is urgently upgraded, so that businesses in
              Carrickfergus can more readily access and exit their industrial
              units.</p>

              areas are being painted over to improve their appearance. It is a

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are addressing an urgent problem today with
              job losses running into thousands. Commercial life is in need of a
              confidence boost, and if the House supports the people of east

              Northern Ireland.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker.
              Several times in the House, when we have come to very important
              points, speeches have had to be squeezed into six minutes. It is
              totally ridiculous, especially given the seriousness of this
              situation. It has happened in debates on education and in others.
              I draw it to your attention.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member knows that according to Standing
              Orders the Adjournment debate is only permitted to last one hour.
              Many Members are interested in participating in the debate and in
              order to give the Minister time to respond it is important that we
              restrict the timing.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr R Hutchinson:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I, along with my Colleagues, support Mr Beggs’s
              motion, although I wonder what benefit it will be as we have
              already met many of the people concerned in the Assembly and the
              Executive. We have written to the First Minister and the Deputy
              First Minister. We also met Sir Reg Empey and put exactly the same
              points to him that we are putting today. I wonder how seriously
              those in authority view the situation in east Antrim.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I remember the days when a boy left school in
              Larne, and it was just a formality to go into the BTH, as it then
              was, and take on an apprenticeship, or go down to the Pie, or the
              NSTC as it became. He could go to Ballylumford, or into the Bleach
              Green, the Morne, the paper mill, or down to Larne Harbour. Sadly,
              many of those outstanding businesses that have served Larne well
              over the years are no longer there.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have to agree with what my Colleagues, Mr
              Beggs and Mr O’Connor, have said about east Antrim. People look
              at the area through rose-tinted glasses. They seem to think that
              east Antrim is made up of leafy lanes in Jordanstown, and that
              there is nothing beyond that. East Antrim consists not just of
              Jordanstown, but also of Greenisland, Carrickfergus, Larne,
              Carnlough and Glenarm. Many of those areas are in great
              deprivation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">East Antrim has suffered sectarian attacks over
              the past few months, especially in the Larne area. The whole of
              east Antrim has received very poor publicity in the media and
              throughout the world. When thinking of inward investment, I have
              to bear in mind the fact that people can only come to an area when
              they are encouraged to come.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I make no apology for asking the following
              questions. When it comes to focusing attention on east Antrim,
              where has the Industrial Development Board (IDB) been? Where has
              LEDU been in promoting east Antrim? What have those bodies been
              doing? What have they been saying? Why have there been so few
              visits? Why do we hear of jobs being created west of the Bann? Why
              do we hear of employers setting up business in Londonderry,
              Dungannon and other areas, while Larne, Carrickfergus and
              Newtownabbey suffer?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I sit on Newtownabbey Borough Council. At
              times, we are concerned with the Nortel set-up. We have Nortel at
              one end of the constituency and F. G. Wilson at the other. God
              forbid that anything should happen to those two companies, or east
              Antrim would be in desperate trouble. The Minister has kindly come
              along today. However, I must ask her — where is our college in
              Larne? What is delaying the investment?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have rightly heard that the East Antrim
              Institute is not sited in east Antrim. It is in north Belfast. Why
              are the people of Larne and the surrounding area penalised through
              there being so little further education provision in the town? We
              know that youth unemployment has increased. Is that because they
              are not encouraged to pursue further education in Larne? I cannot
              answer the question. I do not know why it has taken so long for
              that particular development to take place.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many people in east Antrim are trying. The six
              MLAs have been vigilant in seeking to bring new investment to the
              area. We have met together, we have met those in authority, we
              have met business people and we have asked the right questions.
              However, nothing seems to happen. I ask a simple question — why
              has east Antrim been neglected? It is unfair and something needs
              to be done. I call on those in authority to take east Antrim on
              board.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I totally agree with my Colleague Ken Robinson
              when he calls for a task force to be set up. Indeed, I have been
              calling for that for months. That is one issue that I put to Sir
              Reg Empey when we met him. A task force must be set up that is
              solely concerned with promoting east Antrim and with bringing jobs
              to the area before it is too late. I am pleased to support the
              motion.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr J Wilson:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I recognise that the debate focuses on job
              losses in east Antrim. However, I am acutely aware that employment
              catchment areas do not recognise constituency or district council
              boundaries. Madam Deputy Speaker, I have taken your advice on my
              contribution to the debate and I shall do my best to adhere to the
              guidelines that you have set me. I thank you for permitting me to
              contribute to the debate.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The neighbouring constituency of South Antrim,
              which I represent, could be described as a gateway to the rest of
              the Province. Traffic that enters the port of Larne in east Antrim
              passes through south Antrim on its way to Belfast and to the west
              of the Province. Belfast International Airport is in the heart of
              my constituency, and the M2 motorway runs its full length. One
              could argue that an infrastructure and communications network
              would rubber-stamp south and east Antrim as an area of commercial
              attractiveness. However, the announcement in December 2001 by the
              Antrim textile company Norfil that it was to cease production with
              the loss of almost 200 jobs heralded a catalogue of job losses in
              the region. Since then we have had bad news from companies based
              in both constituencies. Although situated outside south Antrim,
              companies in east Antrim and other areas draw a large part of
              their workforce from the Antrim and Newtownabbey council areas.
              Although part of Newtownabbey is in east Antrim, most of the town
              is situated in south Antrim, a point well made by my Colleague Ken
              Robinson.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nortel is one such company, just over the
              constituency border in East Antrim. It boasts many South Antrim
              employees in its workforce — or rather, it did.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The tragic events in the United States of
              America on 11 September dealt devastating and far-reaching blows
              to the aviation industry. Belfast International Airport, one of
              County Antrim’s greatest strengths, suffered as a result. The
              withdrawal of the British Airways flights to Heathrow and the
              further announcement by Aer Lingus brought more bad news for jobs
              in south-east Antrim. Shorts is one of the Province’s major
              players and an attractive employer for people residing in County
              Antrim. However, it felt the draught of the American tragedy.
              Fortunately, the initial prediction of 2,000 job losses has been
              reduced, and the final total has yet to be announced.</p>

              their remarks to the subject areas indicated. I understand that

              rule when we did not have local politicians focusing on local
              issues. However, it would be wrong to be totally despondent. Since
              devolution, new jobs have been created in east Antrim. There is no
              doubt about that; it is not a matter for dispute. The Department
              of Enterprise, Trade and Investment and the Department for
              Employment and Learning are pulling out all the stops to ensure
              that the Province continues to remain attractive and to come to
              the aid of those who have suffered losses in the region. I urge
              the Minister to use all her offices to do everything possible to
              speed up the process of retraining and re-employing those who have
              lost jobs in the region.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Mr Beggs for giving me the opportunity
              to respond and to discuss some ways in which my Department
              approaches activities to address the impact of the recent job
              losses and the wider need to provide all our people with jobs and
              lifelong learning opportunities. Since the 1960s, east Antrim has
              had a reputation for being the centre of Northern Ireland’s
              major industry. While things have changed considerably — Mr
              Beggs would probably say dramatically — it is vital that we
              maintain and build on what still exists and keep those companies
              in Northern Ireland so that we are still positioned to take
              advantage of future opportunities. It is obvious that all the
              Members present have a genuine concern for their constituency, and
              that has been articulated very clearly in the debate.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Job losses have a devastating effect on
              everyone in a community, including other businesses, families and
              Members. Nobody escapes. Today it was County Antrim, with the
              closure of Dorma in Randalstown, and we can see exactly the effect
              of that. It saps morale and undermines confidence. There have been
              so many redundancies and job losses in east Antrim that I will be
              unable to mention them all, but I know that Solectron dealt a
              major blow to the area. The job losses are regrettable, but they
              are a result of the global downturn in the telecoms market. It was
              a commercial decision taken by the company. However, I am thankful
              that it still has a presence there, and it is essential that we
              keep it there. The IDB will work with Solectron to explore ways in
              which the local operation can, it is hoped, start to grow again.
              This will include developing relationships with the parent company
              to position Northern Ireland as a preferred site for other mobile
              projects within the corporation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The IDB will continue to market the east Antrim
              area to potential investors. From April 1998 to date, there have
              been 75 first-time and 19 repeat visits to the area by potential
              investors. Although the Member may think that is not enough, it
              illustrates the ongoing contact between the Department of
              Enterprise, Trade and Investment and the local councils in east
              Antrim to understand their economic priorities and to work
              together in marketing the region to potential investors.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although we are all aware of the current
              difficult market conditions and the severe downturn, particularly
              in the telecommunications market, Northern Ireland still retains a
              strong cluster of world-class telecoms companies. Those companies
              have not been immune to the impact of the market downturn, and the
              repercussions have hit hard in Northern Ireland, including in east
              Antrim. However, I believe that the availability of high-speed
              telecommunications will become more important than ever to
              businesses as new applications are developed and the level of
              e-business and e-commerce increases. We must press on in this area
              and ensure that, as a region, we are well placed to respond to the
              upturn in the market when it comes. The Government have a key role
              to play in the area to provide opportunities and hopes for the
              future.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am very aware that east Antrim has suffered
              over the past months as a result of several major companies
              announcing redundancies and closures. Most of those companies had
              contracts with Nortel, and most of the redundancies have taken
              place since 11 September. My Department’s main concern is to
              minimise, as far as possible, the impact of those redundancies on
              the lives of the individuals who have been affected. The
              jobcentres work closely with the IDB, LEDU, the Department of
              Enterprise, Trade and Investment, the Social Security Agency and
              the relevant local companies to try to offer as full a range of
              services as possible to those who have been made redundant.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Professional advice on new career opportunities
              is available to everyone affected by the redundancies. This is
              provided by my Department’s career officers, as well as by
              qualified staff from the Educational Guidance Service for Adults,
              with which we liaise closely. As part of that service they provide
              information and advice on job searching; curriculum vitae writing;
              local job vacancies; job vacancies further afield, including in
              the European Union countries; and training and other services
              available through New Deal.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Where appropriate, job clubs have been set up
              for employees to attend prior to the date of their redundancy. My
              staff maintain close working relationships with the Social
              Security Agency and, indeed, are co-located with that agency in
              Carrickfergus. That joined-up service enables us to have an
              integrated and holistic approach to our advisory and support
              service by incorporating advice on benefits issues.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Larne our approach has been co-ordinated
              within the local enterprise agency, LEDCOM, which is being
              particularly proactive and is helping to co-ordinate a wide range
              of activities. It has helped to facilitate meetings between the
              relevant local companies and the appropriate agencies, including
              our jobcentre and social security staff, and it has proved to be
              effective. The Carrickfergus jobcentre manager is currently in the
              process of arranging meetings with the enterprise agency in the
              Carrickfergus area to discuss replicating that model there.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other initiatives and services include the new
              Focus for Work provision that was introduced last October, which
              provides a range of measures to assist unemployed people back into
              work, and which has started well in the local area. There are also
              employment review interviews, which are voluntary interviews for
              jobseeker clients approaching their thirteenth week of
              unemployment to discuss work goals and the steps taken to achieve
              them. We have the job clubs, which aim to provide job search
              skills for unemployed people, including those under notice of
              redundancy or who are returning to the labour market. They provide
              individually tailored technical, procedural and personal
              assistance and support aimed at helping jobseekers to identify and
              obtain employment opportunities.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Carrickfergus the job club provider is
              Enterprise Ulster, and in Larne it is JTM Training and Employment.
              In December it held a job club for those being made redundant at
              AVX, and they will have a further session in March. Training for
              Work is a new vocational training programme aimed at assisting
              clients with an identified training need to improve their chances
              of getting a job. A key objective is to help the client develop
              and maintain positive work attitudes in a programme lasting for up
              to 26 weeks.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Enterprise Ulster has been piloting a programme
              across Northern Ireland since last September. WorkTrack is
              particularly suitable for those who need to establish a work
              history. There is also the Bridge to Employment programme, which
              aims to provide customised training courses to equip the
              unemployed, including the long-term unemployed, with skills to
              enable them to compete for new job opportunities. Members all know
              about New Deal, the major element of the Government’s welfare to
              work strategy, which gives unemployed people a chance to develop
              their potential, gain skills and the experience to find work.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is depressing that all the jobs are gone,
              and we are discussing remedial action, but this is what we have to
              do to get back to our previous position.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the wider issue of education, training and
              lifelong learning provision, my Department supports a range of
              provisions in the east Antrim area. I will advise the Assembly of
              the activities in place and under development in the further
              education sector.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The central aims of further education in
              Northern Ireland relate directly to the subject of our debate:
              supporting economic development and widening access to, and
              increasing participation in, further education and training.
              Another aim is to improve quality and raise standards. These aims
              are the bedrock of the Department’s lifelong learning strategy,
              which reflects the Executive’s focus on economic development and
              social inclusion.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the largest provider of vocational education
              and training in Northern Ireland, the further education sector is
              ideally placed to respond effectively to these challenges. In
              1999-2000, the latest year for which figures on full-time
              enrolment are available, the further education sector had over
              120,000 vocational and almost 70,000 non-vocational enrolments.
              The college closest to east Antrim is the East Antrim Institute of
              Further and Higher Education; in 1999-2000 it had 6,700 vocational
              and 3,690 non-vocational enrolments. I visited the East Antrim
              Institute recently. These totals include enrolments from the
              institute’s current campus provision in Larne and its outreach
              provision in Carrickfergus.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In recent years the institute has widened
              access to further education and increased participation by
              individuals who, for whatever reason, had not previously taken
              advantage of the opportunities available. The institute has also
              maintained a clear focus on the economic needs of Northern
              Ireland. It has seen a 31% increase in enrolments in the six areas
              of skills need identified as important to the development of
              Northern Ireland’s economy.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The East Antrim Institute has demonstrated
              particular strengths in information and communication technology
              training and is one of only three centres in Ireland approved to
              run the Cisco certified network professional qualification
              programme. The other two centres are in Dublin and Cork. The
              institute also offers one of the current pilot foundation degrees
              in telecommunications in conjunction with the University of
              Ulster.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To ensure that the outputs of the sector are
              aligned as closely as possible with the needs of business and
              industry, colleges are encouraged to develop and strengthen
              partnerships with the key players in the local area. These
              partnerships should not only drive up the demand for learning, but
              put in place the infrastructure to satisfy demand. That is the aim
              behind the partnership fund operated by my Department, which was
              introduced in 1999 and called the collaboration fund. That
              initiative aims to establish partnerships inclusive of all major
              interests, including the business, voluntary and community groups,
              local councils and chambers of commerce. To date, my Department
              has provided £900,000 to that fund. The East Antrim Institute has
              put that money to good use and has advised the Department on a
              range of activities that it has taken forward on the basis of that
              funding, such as collaboration with the borough councils of
              Newtownabbey, Larne and Carrickfergus, the development of the East
              Antrim Learning Partnership and collaboration with businesses.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I advise the Minister that there is only one

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will move on swiftly, because I want to
              respond to some of the comments made in the debate. We have been
              talking about the task force on employability and long-term
              unemployment, and its report is due for consultation around the
              end of March. I hope that its proposals will be radical and
              innovative and will address seriously the core problems in our
              changing labour market and economy.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to respond briefly to the Members who
              spoke. Mr Beggs talked about the new TSN, and we await the outcome
              of that review. Mr Beggs, Mr O’Connor and others spoke about the
              Larne campus. Members are aware that an economic appraisal for a
              new facility has been approved. There has been some delay with the
              title deeds. However, it is hoped that the new further education
              college will be funded from the sale of the old campus, and I will
              do all I can to advance that as soon as possible.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Madam Deputy Speaker:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I advise the Minister that, because we only
              have one hour for this debate, she should take a few seconds to
              draw her remarks to a close and advise Members that she will give
              them written responses.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Hanna:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will certainly respond to the Members. As I
              have said, my Department has an open door, and I will be happy to
              talk to any Members. I assure all Members — and particularly Mr
              Beggs, who raised this matter — that I will do everything in my
              power to bring employment back to the east Antrim area as soon as
              possible. I appreciate Members’ participation in the debate, and
              I will take all their views on board.</p>
