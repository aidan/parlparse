              </font></b><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the end of the last sitting of the Assembly
              some Members raised with me difficulties regarding the audibility
              of other Members who were speaking in the Chamber. The problems
              identified have been examined and, where possible, have been
              addressed. In particular, I draw the attention of Members to the
              suspended microphones in the Chamber. I have had these lowered in
              an attempt to ensure greater amplification. I trust that they are
              now not so low as to cause the taller Members of the Assembly any
              inconvenience. If Members still experience difficulties in hearing
              other Members’ speeches they should contact the Keeper of the
              House.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There has been some uncertainty over the status
              of papers placed in the Library. I have looked at this matter, and
              to clarify things I make the following ruling. When papers are
              placed in the Library, that act will make them public documents.
              The Library will not be responsible for making the papers
              available; the papers, along with other material, will, as soon as
              possible, be placed on the Assembly’s website and thus will be
              widely available. They are, of course, always available to
              Members, who should feel free to publish them.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Papers to be put in the Library but which are
              not for public dissemination will be termed &quot;papers deposited
              in the Library&quot;. Such papers will be available to Members but
              should not be made more widely available.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the previous sitting Mr P Robinson asked me
              to reflect further on the meaning and intention of Initial
              Standing Order 2(1), suggesting that, in ordering the Doors to be
              fastened, I was going beyond what the Initial Standing Orders
              entitled the Initial Presiding Officer to do. I agreed to
              re-examine the matter and to advise the Assembly if I had made a
              judgement that went beyond what was appropriate. I have made it
              clear on many occasions that the Initial Standing Orders are
              inadequate for conducting the Assembly’s business and that other
              matters should be taken into account — for instance, the draft
              Standing Orders, as discussed by the Committee on Standing Orders,
              and Erskine May.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have reconsidered the matter raised by
              Mr&nbsp;P&nbsp;Robinson in some detail, and I have taken advice
              from my legal counsel. I have concluded that I must stand by my
              earlier ruling on the issue. I do not think that anyone could
              seriously challenge the assertion that the Initial Presiding
              Officer is under a duty to act fairly with all Members and should
              not discriminate in favour of some to the disadvantage of others.
              If I were not to proceed in the way that I have ruled, my actions
              could be challenged by way of judicial review.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the unfair advantage that I have mentioned
              is to be avoided, it will be necessary to ensure that all Members
              are allowed the same time in which to enter, physically, the place
              where they are entitled to vote. How this is achieved is clearly a
              matter of procedure upon which, by virtue of Initial Standing
              Order 2(1), my ruling shall be final.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The adopted procedure of closing the Chamber
              Doors at the expiration of three minutes after a general
              announcement is a fair and reasonable one, particularly bearing in
              mind that any other procedure for achieving this would be
              difficult to police. Those Members who are excluded because they
              arrive late will not have been treated any less favourably than
              any other Member. Until the Doors are opened at the conclusion of
              a vote, Members who have been denied access to the Chamber will,
              of course, be able to observe, although not participate, from the
              Gallery.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Robinson:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am grateful for this, but it does not go to
              the heart of the matter that I sought to have addressed. What I
              asked was whether the Initial Standing Order permitted you to make
              an interpretation, no matter how liberal that existing Standing
              Order was, or whether it drew a line at allowing you to bring in
              or make new Standing Orders. Where is the line between
              interpreting an existing Standing Order and making a ruling which
              amounts to a new Standing Order?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Initial Presiding Officer:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My view is that no Presiding Officer should be
              in a position arbitrarily to construct Standing Orders. It is not
              just appropriate to ensure that whatever developments of procedure
              are necessary for the implementation of Standing Orders are
              carried through, but a binding duty. I do not think it is
              appropriate for completely new and essentially arbitrary Standing
              Orders to be created, and I do not believe that my decision did
              that.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members know that certain questions of
              procedure were raised with me by the First Minister (Designate) at
              the last sitting. I said to him that I would explore the matter
              and any other matters that were drawn to my attention in that
              context which involved discussions between Mr McCartney and the
              Deputy Clerk. No further material was raised with me in that
              regard. Since that time, certain other matters —</p>

              Officer. This matter was not raised as a point of order, and I
              therefore feel able to intervene on a point of order.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are dealing with personnel matters relating
              to a civil servant, and I do not believe that that is fair of us.
              It would be appropriate for you to refer it to the party Whip, who
              can make his Colleagues aware of the position.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When I first considered placing this motion
              before the Assembly, it was reasonable for me to expect that it
              would have the support of all parties. However, over the past few
              days it has become clear to me that the prospect of all-party
              support for the motion has disappeared. Indeed, I have received
              reasonably sound information to suggest that the SDLP and the
              Ulster Unionist Party intend to oppose it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I feel that I have a duty to make clear the
              reasons for these parties’ opposition to the motion to everyone
              in the Chamber, to those in the Galleries, and to the wider
              public. It gives an indication of the shape of things to come. We
              will have in the Assembly what in the business world would be
              known as a cartel. Those who have been preaching the gospel of
              inclusivity and responsibility sharing are about to carve up
              between them all the positions of responsibility in the Assembly.
              These jobs for the boys will be shared between the Ulster
              Unionists and the SDLP.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have set out some of the difficulties that I
              have encountered in relation to this matter. Bearing in mind the
              excellent service that you have given to the Assembly during your
              probationary period as Presiding Officer, a fact that is
              acknowledged by all parties, it is with some sadness that I inform
              you and formally advise the House that I intend not to move the
              motion standing in my name. I have spoken to your assistants about
              the meeting. However, my action is on the basis that everyone must
              understand the likely shape that the Assembly will take in the
              future.</p>

              Officer. The Member for Strangford has said that he will not be
              moving the motion. However, the Order Paper shows that this is
              part of the business for today. I could, of course, after making
              some remarks, decide to move the motion myself. That would be in
              accordance with the practice of the House. Mr&nbsp;Wilson has
              drawn attention to what is a fairly sleazy arrangement between the
              SDLP and the Ulster Unionists.</p>

              makes it imperative that we have a discussion on this matter,
              particularly as the Chair is supposed to be politically neutral.
              It is not supposed to be part of a carve-up between parties,
              creating a situation in which the Chair would be answerable to a
              particular party and would have to do its bidding.</p>

              the House. It is not a case of it being withdrawn or not

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the most recent meeting of the Committee to
              Advise the Presiding Officer, there was discussion of a proposal,
              by leave of the Assembly, to alter the speaking times set out in
              Initial Standing Order 8(5).</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Following that discussion, it was agreed that
              the Assembly should judge the matter at the sitting. The
              proposition was that speaking times would be amended for the
              duration of the debate so that proposers of the motion would have
              30 minutes, instead of 20 minutes, divided between proposers if
              they wished; that all parties in the first round of speaking would
              have 20 minutes, rather than 10; that other Members would have 10
              minutes; that the four largest parties would have 20 minutes for
              the winding-up speech; and that the proposers of the motion would
              have 20 minutes for the winding-up speech, divided as they wished,
              instead of the current 15 minutes.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Do we have the leave of the Assembly for those
              proposals?</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr Initial Presiding
              Officer. I note that those who are least willing to have fuller
              debate are the Ulster Unionist Members. Clearly they are concerned
              that their argument could not sustain scrutiny. They want to deny
              Members the opportunity to speak more fully on the issues, and
              that shows how weak their arguments are and demonstrates that they
              are running scared of debate.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Perhaps I could put another proposal under
              Standing Order 8(5) which will give those Members a chance to
              reflect on their immaturity and to recognise that this is a
              democratic institution, which is supposed to allow free and open
              debate. They should not be afraid of that, although one can
              understand why they might be. I suggest that the proposer, or
              proposers, share 30 minutes between them, and that all Front-Bench
              spokespersons have 20 minutes each, but that the 20 minutes is not
              accorded to the Member who is winding-up, nor is any extension of
              time given to the person who makes the winding-up speech for the
              proposer.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Perhaps I could clarify the matter. As I
              understand it, the proposition is that the joint proposers would
              have 30 minutes each — that would be up to 60 minutes for the
              proposition; there would be 20 minutes for all parties in the
              first round; 10 minutes for other Members; and no additional time
              for the winding-up speeches for the larger parties. I am not
              clear, however, as to whether there was a proposition to extend
              the normal 15 minutes.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr Initial Presiding
              Officer. We had been informed by you that we could expect to have
              this report last Thursday. There has been a consistent habit on
              the parts of the First Minister (Designate) and the Deputy First
              Minister (Designate) to delay the publication of their reports
              beyond the time when they are scheduled to be released. Clearly
              they have some internal difficulties. However, those internal
              difficulties should not be in breach of arrangements that are made
              with business managers of this House. Some of my colleagues did
              not receive this report until this morning because of the late
              publication. The First Minister (Designate) would do better to
              listen than to point his finger around and look at the Galleries
              of the House. It is his behaviour that we are referring to at the
              present time.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is it in order for the First Minister
              (Designate) and the Deputy First Minister (Designate) to give
              indications to your office of the release times of reports and
              consistently fail to meet those releasetimes, therefore denying
              Members the opportunity to read the report before it is debated in
              this Chamber?</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have to say that I find it a difficulty when
              I am passed information about how things will be, and I convey
              that in good faith to those who request it, and find that it
              appears the information I have given is incorrect. I apologise to
              the House that I find myself being the purveyor of inaccurate
              descriptions of how things will be, but I have found it difficult
              to do otherwise. I particularly regret that this is something that
              you have had to take from me on more than one occasion.</p>

              substance of that issue — which was not, I think, a point of
              order — later. I was gesturing with my fingers because the
              clocks appear to be malfunctioning. It has since been suggested to
              me that the reason for that might be that they are not trying to
              time the points of order. I wonder if that is correct.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The delay in receiving this report, Sir,
              inconvenienced those who had called meetings on Thursday in light
              of the promise made by you that this document would be available
              at half past four on Thursday. I contacted the First Minister (Designate)’s
              office, the Clerk’s office and your own office, and I was told
              by Mr&nbsp;Trimble’s office that there was both political
              difficulty and logistical difficulty with this report. Those
              difficulties should have been solved by those concerned so that
              those of us who wanted to read this report and table amendments
              would have opportunity and time to do so.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In fact the report had to be collected and
              brought down to my home. However, that document is different to
              the one which is now printed. How can we do the business of this
              House when we are not given the proper document or given three
              clear days to read that document and table amendments? Surely this
              matter should not be re-occurring. It should be put right once and
              for all.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You have raised two issues, Dr Paisley, and the
              first of these is the question of the delivery of material to
              Members. In fairness to the staff of the Assembly, I must point
              out that it is not their responsibility to deliver material which
              emanates from Assembly business, although they do their best to
              oblige us.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A further substantial point of order relates to
              the question of amendments, and I must draw this to the attention
              of those who are considering our Standing Orders. Where it is the
              case that material arrives late and the Standing Order — unlike
              Standing Orders in other places — requires amendments to be put
              down one hour before the commencement of the sitting, there is no
              doubt that that creates certain difficulties which would not be
              encountered in other places where manuscript amendments can be put
              down.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have to remain with, and ensure compliance
              with, the Standing Orders that we currently have. As
              Mr&nbsp;Robinson pointed out, I am not at liberty to either
              disregard them or make up Standing Orders of my own. I do,
              however, accept that there is a dilemma with matters arriving late
              and the Standing Orders, which insist that amendments must be put
              down at least one hour before the commencement of the sitting.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr Initial Presiding
              Officer. With regard to the two motions arising out of the report,
              perhaps you would clarify whether you intend to have a separate
              debate on business motion number 5, or whether you intend to take
              the two votes together?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Initial Presiding Officer:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Perhaps I can explain to Members how I propose
              to conduct the business. There are two motions: the motion on the
              report, and a business motion which is for the purpose of a
              determination and refers to matters entirely contained within the
              report. On the Marshalled list of amendments, there are also two
              amendments — one amendment to the first motion and an amendment
              to the business motion.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since it is clear that all matters referred to
              in the business motion are also referred to in the report, which
              is the subject of the first motion, it seems reasonable that the
              House should proceed by way of a single debate, within which would
              be contained the proposal of the first motion and any amendments.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When it comes to the vote, the amendment to the
              first motion, if moved, will be taken first. Depending upon the
              result of that, the substantive motion will then be taken. The
              amendment to the business motion will then be tabled but, since it
              will have been spoken to in the previous debate, will not be the
              subject of further discussion. The business motion will then be
              taken formally, full debate having been possible on all of the
              matters.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to make it clear that I will not rule
              that a matter is not relevant to the first motion because it
              refers to the second. It seems to me they are all one matter. The
              Assembly will then proceed to four votes if the amendments are
              moved and the motions also moved at that point.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is there any objection to our proceeding on
              that basis?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There being no dissent, we have the leave of

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If, however, they had purchased the ‘Irish
              News’ on Saturday they could have read the full report. I should
              be interested to hear your opinion, Mr Initial Presiding Officer,
              of the standing of such a document. Is it public property as soon
              as the printers have done their work, is it available to just one
              newspaper or to all newspapers, or should it be available to any
              before it is available to Members of this House?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second issue has to do with the Order
              Paper. Because of the late delivery of the report, amendments
              could not be tabled before this morning, so there is no edge to my
              comments in relation to the staff of the House. There is a
              printing error in the first amendment. The last line says
              &quot;unnatural departmental divisions are correct&quot;.
              &quot;Correct&quot; should be &quot;corrected&quot; — the House
              should note the proper terminology — and that mistake is the
              fault of the First Minister (Designate) and the Deputy First
              Minister (Designate) who did not release the report in time.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Initial Presiding Officer:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I remind Members about what has just been said
              about the correction to the first amendment on the marshalled
              list: the last word in amendment 1 should be &quot;corrected&quot;
              instead of &quot;correct&quot;.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Time was a difficulty with this, and I
              appreciate Mr Robinson’s comments about the staff who have
              striven to address matters as best they can. With regard to the
              previous point that was raised, the question of items being put in
              the public domain, it has always been a convention at Westminster,
              at least until recent times, that material did not make its way
              into the public domain in advance of its being made available to
              Parliament.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It has been made clear at meetings of the
              Committee to Advise the Presiding Officer (CAPO) that it would be
              regarded as a discourtesy if such were to happen here. However,
              there is nothing in Standing Orders that allows me to make a
              ruling on this. I can simply point out how Members feel about it,
              but the Executive (Designate) has to act as it wishes to. Members
              may feel that this is a discourtesy, but there is nothing in
              Standing Orders which allows me to rule on it one way or another.
              This is a matter which Members may wish to raise in other ways.</p>

              anything else, because he does not know what I am about to raise.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want clarification, as we are supposed to
              vote on and adopt the report, specifically on annex&nbsp;2 where
              we have the determination by the First and the Deputy First
              Ministers (Designate) on the 10 ministerial offices and the
              Departments. I am uncertain as to why annex&nbsp;1a is not also
              included. We are being asked to adopt the report, which contains
              the number of Ministries and the definition of a Ministry but does
              not contain their actual functions. Neither is there any detailed
              reference to the Office of the First Minister (Designate) and the
              Deputy First Minister (Designate), albeit, as I see it, it would
              take an Assembly of its own to organise that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Are we being asked to adopt what is contained
              in annex 2 and in annex 1 in relation to the 10&nbsp;Departments?
              Are we also being asked to adopt what is said about the Office of
              the First Minister (Designate) and the Deputy First Minister
              (Designate), which are both excluded from annex 2? This is very
              important.</p>

              of levels. It is not appropriate for me, in any fashion, to look
              at the question of the content of the advice — that is not a
              matter for me at all. It is only for me to try to make proper
              judgements about the legal competence. As things currently stand,
              I have been assured that by the time the matter becomes extant,
              all the necessary matters will have been addressed by way of
              legislation. It will all have been addressed by then. I cannot do
              other than to accept that assurance, and with that assurance, as
              far as I can see, the proposition is a competent one.</p>

              You are saying you have been assured, and I have no doubt that you
              have been, but, for the record, I would like to know by whom. Will
              the First Minister (Designate) and Deputy First Minister

              of those whose responsibility it would be to ensure that the
              legislation is passed. That would not be in this place, but in
              another place. The advice I have received is that all the

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let me make it clear that it is not for me to
              do anything other than try to ensure that a motion that comes
              before the House is a legally competent one. It would be quite
              inappropriate for me to even explore other matters. I have made
              explorations in order to try to ensure that the matters will be
              dealt with competently, and I have been assured that that is the
              case. As regards the content and all the other matters, Dr Paisley
              must refer his questions to people other than myself. They are not
              points of order in that regard.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Maskey:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My interpretation of this is that the
              legislation will not apply to shadow Ministers, so if a shadow
              Executive is established, which of those designated functions will
              the shadow Ministers be responsible for?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Initial Presiding Officer:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope I am not straying outside what is
              appropriate, but I draw to Members’ attention the fact that
              shadow Ministers do not have legal authority and responsibility
              for any Departments. They are there to shadow, to learn, to
              apprentice themselves into the position.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is obviously complex given that there are
              currently six Departments, and this is a proposition for rather
              more than that, but they do not have responsibilities according to
              the legislation.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister (Designate):</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report was drawn up on the basis of legal
              advice that we received that the content of annex 2 satisfied the
              requirements of the legislation and the Standing Orders. We also
              endeavoured to ensure that all relevant information was contained
              in the other annexes. Annex 1a gives a more detailed description
              of the functions of the Departments because it encompasses the
              functions that we missed in the 18&nbsp;December statement. The
              distribution of functions contained in that statement is also
              given, for ease of reference, so people comparing 1a and 1b will
              be able to see what the missing functions were and how they have
              been allocated.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We wanted to and had hoped to make this report
              available to people much earlier. Part of the reason for the delay
              was the detail that we had to determine and settle with regard to
              the Civic Forum. That is one of the important new matters in this
              report compared to others. Members will see that the motion asks
              them specifically to approve the proposals in relation to
              establishing a consultative Civic Forum. That means that that
              approval will turn this part of the report on the Civic Forum into
              the basic law of the Civic Forum, and, consequently, it was
              necessary to include material on the Civic Forum in considerable
              detail so that we can be clearly agreed on it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was not adequate at that stage to sketch
              general outline provisions on the Civic Forum. If we had just
              indicated it in outline, we would not be bringing forward the
              detail until after devolution day. Consequently, we would be
              delaying the point at which the Civic Forum would come into
              existence. In order to be able to bring the Civic Forum into
              existence very soon after D-Day, it was necessary to get details
              settled here, and we have gone as far as we possibly could —
              indeed, some matters were not resolved until Friday morning.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am sorry to say that another reason for the
              delay is that, in making these changes to Departments, we are
              encountering a certain amount of turf war between Departments. We
              are also encountering a reluctance on the part of some officials
              to realise that things are changing. I do not want to go into
              detail on that. People are resisting changes. I know that it is
              difficult for some senior civil servants, after 25 years of direct
              rule, to accept that elected Members are gaining authority and
              making decisions which officials have to accept and implement. The
              rearguard action that is being fought by some Departments against
              the changes that were agreed on 18&nbsp;December is most
              regrettable. I hope that the Departments responsible will accept
              the decisions that we as elected representatives have taken in
              this Chamber and will implement them loyally. I hope I will not
              have to refer to this matter again.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When Mr&nbsp;Maskey held up his report his
              thumb was on the typographical error in annex 2, and I thought
              that he was about to refer to it. The reference to the Minister of
              Enterprise, Trade and Development should read the Minister of
              Enterprise, Trade and Investment. There is at least one other
              typographical error in the body of the report, but for brevity’s
              sake I will not get into the substance of that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have said that the new material relates
              essentially to the British-Irish Council and the Civic Forum. I
              will not go through this in detail, but would point out that the
              key concept is to encourage the creation of consortiums in various
              sectors which will then nominate individuals. The Deputy First
              Minister and I were anxious to avoid a situation where we were
              directly responsible for all nominees. We will accept
              responsibility for some, but we will have that residual category
              to ensure a proper balance. The organisations that are to be
              involved in this Civic Forum have to accept responsibility for
              their nominations. We will accept responsibility for oversight and
              to ensure that fair and open procedures are adopted and followed,
              but nominations must come from them.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The important step in this debate is the
              determination on Departments. That is the next step in a series of
              steps leading to the transfer of power to this body. That is the
              real question that we have to deal with, and we will have to deal
              with it in the run-up to the target date for that transfer of
              10&nbsp;March.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Essentially, we are today reviewing progress
              and making a formal determination. The real question is whether we
              manage in the run-up to 10&nbsp;March to see that everything is
              done that should be done. Members are aware of my party’s
              stance. We intend to do everything that we need to do and that we
              can do regarding that transfer. But there are other things that
              should be done by other people, and they include matters that some
              people have not yet addressed. They will have to do these things.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not wish to labour the point — the Irish
              Prime Minister said everything that was necessary to be said on
              this matter yesterday morning. It was published, and, while the
              pill was sugared slightly for some people in the course of the
              day, they should not think that they can evade the issue. It
              cannot be evaded. It is a matter not just for Sinn Féin but for
              other paramilitary organisations too. They must be under no
              illusion as to what is required by the agreement for progress. We
              hope that in the run-up to 10&nbsp;March, they can achieve what is
              necessary and can carry out their obligations.</p>

              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We want to see this body progressing in an
              inclusive fashion. That is our primary objective. That can happen
              only if people carry out their obligations and cease clinging to
              this interpretation of the agreement which the Taoiseach rightly
              described as unreasonable, unfair and illogical.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is time for people to do what they have to
              do, and that must be done in the run up to 10&nbsp;March. The real
              question is what will happen in that period when we will be trying
              to juggle the necessary provisions for the devolution Order, which
              will have to start at Westminster, and the proceedings that we
              will have to adopt in the House in March. This is merely a staging
              post on the route to that destination, and I hope that we reach it
              with all the necessary steps having been taken.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some amendments have been tabled, and I want to
              touch on them briefly. I preferred the original drafting of
              amendment No. 1 rather than the corrected drafting that was
              produced by Mr&nbsp;P&nbsp;Robinson. The final words of the
              original draft —</p>

              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">are correct. They may be described as
              unnatural, but they are also correct. The DUP wants to see them
              changed, but without showing how that should be done. That is not
              an amendment that we can accept. Neither can we accept amendment
              No. 1 to the determination because to decline to approve the
              determination merely stops the process and does not achieve
              anything.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What must happen and what is important is that
              before the appointed day and the transfer of functions to the
              Executive, and, indeed, before the formation of the Executive, we
              must see a credible beginning of a process of decommissioning. As
              the Ulster Unionist Party reiterated at its executive meeting on
              Saturday, it will stick to that requirement, and that will be the
              view of all members of our party. We are united on that.

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No, I am sorry. Having refused to give way to
              one Member, I must be equal and even-handed in my approach and
              treat all Members equally on this matter. This is a staging post
              towards the achievement of that, and I look forward to the day
              when power can be transferred to the Assembly; when there are not
              shadow Ministers, but real Ministers; and when the Assembly can
              carry out all that we have worked for over recent years. I look
              forward to that time, and I hope that we will do that in the good
              spirit that is beginning to develop within all sections in the
              Chamber. That must be the earnest wish of us all.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister (Designate) (Mr&nbsp;Mallon):</b>
              May I, like the First Minister (Designate), apologise for the
              delay in the report reaching Members. There were many
              difficulties, not the least of which was the complexity of some of
              the new, creative and imaginative arrangements, and that delayed
              us. Yes, there were difficulties in relation to the text. There
              will always be difficulties in this type of arrangement, and I
              would have preferred the report to be with Members sooner.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The difficulties are there because of the very
              nature of the arrangements. I would not like it to be thought that
              that was the fault of the Civil Service or any civil servants. I
              thank them and the Members who took part in the round-table and
              bilateral arrangements for their input on many of the issues, not
              least the Civic Forum.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today is a crucial one in the political process
              that we have embarked upon. It is the beginning of the end of the
              initial section of this part of our new politics. From now on
              there will be no more time or space for delay or for
              prevarication. We have the target dates, and we will know what we
              have to do when this motion is passed, as it will be. It defines
              not just the substance but the time in which we all have either to
              implement both the letter and the spirit of the Good Friday
              Agreement, or resile from it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This should not be an acrimonious debate;
              rather it should be serious and constructive. We should listen
              seriously to what others have to say, and not just listen, but
              understand what they have to say and why they are saying it. We
              have to generate the amount of trust which is going to be required
              to make a quadripartite-coalition type of administration work.
              That has been difficult, even on the limited basis so far, and it
              is going to be difficult in future. If we can have as serious a
              debate as possible without acrimony, the better for all of us.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should not underestimate the amount of work
              that has gone into this report. It has become difficult, and it
              will become more difficult as the complexities of the arrangement
              show themselves. The reality is that we have been able to overcome
              some difficulties — the difficulties of timing, the difficulties
              of understanding the agreement and the difficulties of party
              positions. All of those difficulties have been overcome on this,
              and that against the background of the continuing question of
              decommissioning.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I know that it should not overshadow this
              debate, but we must rise above the difficulties that we face. We
              have to sustain the vision that carried the negotiating and the
              adoption of this agreement through. We have to sustain the
              potential for the future that we have in this room and in this
              political process.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the issue of decommissioning I want to make
              a few points that sometimes are lost. Decommissioning will be
              resolved by voluntary act or not at all. Those are the exact words
              of Sir Patrick Mayhew in his last speech in the House of Commons
              — the Patrick Mayhew who devised, created or stumbled into the
              Washington preconditions which laboured this problem for so long.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we accept that it will be by the voluntary
              decision of the groupings involved or not at all, then we have to
              face that fact. If this is not the case, and I am wrong in this,
              by what other way is it going to be achieved? What else has not
              been tried? What else could be tried? By what other way can it be
              achieved? That is the first question that we all have to look at.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second crucial point is that we forget that
              it is only in the context of this agreement that decommissioning
              will happen. Outside of this agreement there will be no
              decommissioning. I say this sincerely to people who have strong
              views about it: damage this agreement and we damage the prospect
              of achieving decommissioning. Lose this agreement and we lose any
              prospect of decommissioning. That is a harsh reality for all of
              us, but it is another of the fundamental points that should
              underline our thinking.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The third point is that decommissioning is a
              requirement of the agreement. The very structures of the
              institutions, the inclusivity, the shape of the sections on
              prisoner releases, law reform, human rights, equality and
              normalisation were all shaped for a context in which
              decommissioning would take place and violence and the threat of
              violence had ended. It follows then that it is an inexorable
              requirement of the agreement that we fulfil the Mitchell
              principles, and they were arrived at even before the negotiations
              started. They said that there would be some decommissioning —
              not before, not after, but during the negotiations. Negotiations
              have ended — they took two years. We are almost a year into the
              agreement, and I believe that the words of the Mitchell Report are
              as applicable now as they were then.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The fourth very important point is that
              decommissioning is not a precondition within the agreement. There
              is no legal or technical factor to suggest that it is, and to
              portray it as such overburdens the debate, as it probably does the
              prospect of obtaining decommissioning.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The fifth very important point — and I say
              this from some experience — is that without a resolution of the
              decommissioning issue there will not be sufficient trust in the
              political process to make it work effectively and creatively
              within the institutions which we are going to adopt today.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Trust is a rare thing among political parties.
              It has to be nurtured and encouraged, and that is difficult. We
              will never get absolute trust between any of the parties here or
              among them. What we can aim for is sufficient trust to make that
              which we have already agreed in the Good Friday Agreement and in
              the institutions work. However, unless this issue is resolved,
              that trust is not going to be there to make this agreement work in
              the creative, imaginative and determined way that it should.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It follows that the problems that are faced by
              the Ulster Unionist Party and Sinn&nbsp;Féin must be looked at
              honestly, and there are problems. I say, especially to those on
              the Unionist Benches today who have strong feelings and who might
              be tempted to vote against this motion because of this issue,
              that, outside of the agreement, there will be no context in which
              decommissioning can be achieved. I ask them to seriously consider
              that and weigh it against the agreement’s potential to achieve
              lasting peace and to make that lasting peace part of the political
              process, not as a word, but as the underlying thesis.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I recognise Sinn&nbsp;Féin’s difficulties on
              this matter, and I take this opportunity to put on record my
              acknowledgement of the courage with which many in that party have
              challenged those in the wider Republican organisation on this
              issue. I say very clearly to them that, like all of us, we should
              have only one resolve today: to stand by this agreement. We stand
              by both the letter of the agreement and the spirit of the
              agreement. If we are all resolved in terms of this debate to stand
              by this agreement, then we can build sufficient trust to make what
              we have decided operative.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I know there will be a long and detailed debate
              on the various parts of the report and I thank you,
              Mr&nbsp;Initial Presiding Officer, for the opportunity to respond
              in detail to some of those. However, there is one message today
              and it is this. We can either lay the basis today for resolving
              these issues and moving forward, or we can ensure that that which
              we have already agreed, and staked so much on, is put in jeopardy.
              Surely there is only one way to go, and that is the way forward on
              the basis of an agreement that we all resolved to stand by. There
              is no other way.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is very interesting to note that there is no
              mention whatsoever of decommissioning in the report. The First
              Minister (Designate) and the Deputy First Minister (Designate)
              spent most of their time commenting on decommissioning, but
              nothing is said about it in this paper. It is not referred to
              because nothing is really going to be done about it. The object of
              this debate is to see that Ulster Unionist Party Members vote in
              the right way on this report. In other words, the Members must now
              endorse the cheque that they voted for at the last sitting.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But interesting things are happening.
              Mr&nbsp;Ahern has said</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;decommissioning in one form or another
              has to happen. It is not compatible with being a part of a
              government, and part of an executive if there is not at least a
              commencement of decommissioning. That would apply in the North and
              in the South.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is what Mr&nbsp;Ahern said that we need to
              achieve. But then he was asked if he was really saying that,
              regardless of what it says in the agreement, the practical
              policies are that there can be no executive without a start to
              decommissioning. His answer was &quot;Yes&quot;, but that was in
              the morning. Before the sun had set he had evidently changed his
              mind.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">His change of mind came because there are guns
              on the table, under the table and outside the door of these
              negotiations. Mr Hume said that there would be no guns — but the
              guns are there, and Mr&nbsp;Ahern had to do a U-turn.
              Mr&nbsp;Ahern thought he would help Mr&nbsp;Trimble get reticent
              Ulster Unionists to vote for the report, he gave them the sop that
              he was with them in their attempt to keep Sinn Féin out of the
              Executive until such times as decommissioning had, at least,
              started.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But no such thing is in the mind of the
              Taoiseach. In fact, the Southern Ireland Government have violated
              every agreement that they have entered into with the
              United&nbsp;Kingdom, and they are seeking to violate this
              agreement with their usual skulduggery and deception.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As far back as September 1997 the Ulster
              Unionists and my party issued a statement, jointly signed by
              Mr&nbsp;Trimble and myself, which said</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The two parties are totally agreed that
              the principle of consent which is the right of the people of
              Northern Ireland alone to determine their own future is a
              fundamental governing principle which must apply in all
              circumstances. This principle must be accepted by the Government
              and all parties.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our two parties are also agreed that the issue
              of the decommissioning, i.e. the handing over of illegal terrorist
              weaponry, must be resolved to their satisfaction before there
              could be substantive political negotiations.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recognising the need for greater Unionist unity
              of approach at this critical time, the parties have agreed to meet
              again shortly.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In a matter of weeks, Mr Trimble had made a
              U-turn. When Sinn Féin was brought in there was no
              decommissioning, and my party, as it said it would in its election
              manifesto, immediately withdrew from the talks. It is a bit late
              in the day for the Official Unionists to attempt to build a
              barricade now. The flood waters are flowing, and they are not
              flowing their way.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This attempt to tell us that there will be no
              executive unless Sinn Féin is a member is wrong, and it will be
              proved to be wrong. The two Governments and world opinion will be
              stronger than the determination of Mr&nbsp;Trimble. How strong
              will these Members be who went to the electorate and gave
              assurances, as my party did, that they would not sit down with
              Sinn Féin in an Executive?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is amazing that this most important debate
              is being gagged by the votes of the Official Unionist Party. In no
              other Assembly would the party leaders be given only 10 minutes to
              speak to a motion of this kind. Why have we not had a full-scale
              debate with proper timings? We did not even get the documents.</p>

              Deputy First Minister (Designate) will be shouting me down.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Pick up the document and consider the Civic
              Forum — an amazing body. The largest industry in Northern
              Ireland is agriculture and fisheries — and agriculture is major
              in comparison with the fisheries side — yet it is only getting
              three voices.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have heard many Members on the Unionist
              Benches speaking about the victims and how their voices must be
              heard. Yet they are only getting two voices — two voices. Let us
              consider the victims of all the violence in this Province. Let us
              march them past the city hall and measure the number of hours it
              takes for the multitude of victims to pass by a given point and
              then think as well of the number who have been murdered. But the
              victims and their loved ones will have two voices to tell of their
              plight — probably one from the Nationalist side and one from the
              Unionist side. There is no distinction made today between innocent
              victims and others; they tell us that victims are all the same.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, the voluntary/community bodies, which
              are highly rated by the Official Unionist Party, will get 18
              voices — 18 voices. The First Minister (Designate) and the
              Deputy First Minister (Designate) are to reserve for themselves
              not two places but six. They will have more voices than the
              victims or the agricultural interests, yet we are being told that
              we must rush through this determination with a short debate.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What will be the end of this matter? The Deputy
              First Minister (Designate) has told us that the only way ahead is
              to give in to the lawless, to the people with the Semtex and the
              guns that have been used to commit these murders. I will never

              was the sum total of his short contribution. I listened to his
              case to see whether it would justify the abandonment of the Ulster
              Unionist Party’s election commitment. It did not.</p>

              have chosen not to rule on that matter.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also listened out for an explanation as to
              why he is setting up what everyone knows will be an embryo united
              Ireland. He is setting up all-Ireland bodies with executive powers
              which, at this stage, are clearly unaccountable to the Assembly.
              There was no explanation for that. I also listened for his
              reasoning for handing over responsibility for further developments
              to people outside the Unionist community. That did not come
              either.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the Deputy First Minister (Designate) spoke,
              I detected the distinction that can be made between his stance on
              decommissioning and mine. He says, quite rightly, that
              decommissioning, in the form in which we are discussing it, is a
              voluntary matter, and that it is up to the organisations that hold
              weapons to decide whether to hand them over. He then jumps from
              that position to saying that decommissioning will not happen
              unless we agree to this kind of accommodation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The question arising from the report is not
              will decommissioning happen, but is it right to have in government
              those who refuse to decommission. That is the issue that we must
              decide. It is a key issue for Unionists in particular, because
              Unionists of all parties, except perhaps one, have an electoral
              commitment on this matter. There are four stages on the road to
              Sinn Féin/IRA membership of an executive.</p>

              it is perfectly plain that they are using disreputable and
              unparliamentary language. Members do not always refer to each
              other as one might wish. I register that, but I am not sure that I

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Further to that point of order. I take
              exception to the remark. When I came into this Chamber I was asked
              to sign a book, and after my name I put the name of my political
              party and a designation of Nationalist or Unionist. I did all of
              that, and at no stage in the process did anyone from my party sign
              as Sinn Féin/IRA. For that reason we take exception to the use of
              this language, and I wish you, as Initial Presiding Officer, to
              point out to Mr&nbsp;Robinson and to anyone else using that term
              that they are totally out of order.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I can certainly confirm that the Member and his
              Colleagues signed the book in precisely the way that the Member
              has described. There is no question about that, and, as far as I
              am aware, when the Member stood for election he did so in the same
              way. However, the Member is asking me to rule that other Members
              are out of order when they choose to make a certain reference.
              That is a problem for me, because one of the purposes of having
              absolute privilege in the Chamber is not to enable people to say
              things which they could not say in other places but to enable them
              to be free to say what they believe.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As long as the language used is not
              unparliamentary, I have to adhere to the principle that allows a
              degree of freedom of speech — and that privilege is accorded —
              and it would be difficult for me to make a ruling that would
              accommodate the Member’s request. I know that this is unwelcome,
              and other Members in the Chamber have found rulings which I have
              given on matters not altogether different from this unwelcome, but
              I do not think that there is anything other that I can do under
              the current Standing Orders.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I can understand that you may. I have been
              asked to rule on other matters — for example, in respect of
              comments that have been regarded as deeply unflattering and
              discourteous to women Members — and I have looked into them as
              best I can and have found myself unable to rule on them.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some of what has been said in respect of women
              Members has been regarded as discourteous and unflattering, and
              manifestly so, and I said so at the time. However, it remained
              within what is parliamentary. If an inaccurate description is
              being used, that does not make it unparliamentary. Even if the
              Member regarded it as unflattering and discourteous to be referred
              to in that way, that would not make it unparliamentary. However,
              if the Member is saying that there is some accusation in the
              reference, that makes the matter somewhat complex, I will try to

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member made one remark which needs a brief
              response. It is established and accepted practice that a remark
              made in respect of a party does not carry the same kind of
              connotation as one made in respect of an individual. When the
              Member said that in making a remark about the party as a whole
              accusations were being levelled against 18 individuals, it is my
              understanding that, in parliamentary terms, that is not the case
              and that remarks which might be made of a party cannot be judged
              at the same level and in the same way as remarks which were

              cannot rise up after making a point of order and start a
              discussion on the ruling made by the Chair. It must be prefaced by
              the words &quot;On a further point of order&quot;. The Member did
              not do that. He thought he would just carry on his conversation
              with the Chair. I am pointing out to the House, and I think you
              will agree with me, that even if we are on a point of order, I can
              only address the Chair if the Chair takes a further point of order

              That is the proper way to handle things. I confess that in these

              will be less experienced than he in these matters and will be
              learning. I have no doubt that what he has said — and it is
              absolutely correct — will be taken on board by other Members and
              that they will respect that.</p>

              Presiding Officer in relation to whether or not an accusation is
              made against an individual as opposed to a political party, the
              Initial Presiding Officer should take on board very seriously
              indeed the fact that Sinn Féin has lost many of its members as a
              result of people being killed. A climate has been created on the
              outside whereby Sinn&nbsp;Féin was demonised, whereby it was
              effectively set up, whereby people like John&nbsp;Davey and
              Bernard&nbsp;O’Hagan — elected Sinn Féin councillors — lost
              their lives.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Initial Presiding Officer should consider
              that an accusation against a political party is possibly even more
              serious than an accusation against an individual, because it can

              make points of order it would be helpful if they could begin by
              pointing out that they wish to raise a point of order. Otherwise
              the distinction between points of order and other interventions

              with quite a number of Members, given the points of order that
              have been raised. Even within the past 10 or 15 minutes, there has
              been a degree of flexibility and generosity in that regard.

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Robinson:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I find it quite touching that Mr&nbsp;&quot;We’ll
              go back to what we do best&quot; Molloy is so interested in
              hearing my remarks on this report.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was saying that there were four steps in the
              process towards membership by members of Sinn&nbsp;Féin/IRA in a
              Northern Ireland Executive. They are not debatable; they are not
              something that we, as an Assembly, can alter. They are set down in
              statute, and they are going to be taken. Indeed, some of them have
              already been taken.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first step was the determination. A
              determination had to be made by the First Minister (Designate) and
              the Deputy First Minister (Designate), and that was effectively
              done on 18&nbsp;December. It was included, in large part, in the
              report that was received by the Assembly on 18&nbsp;January, and
              it is contained within this report, which includes an addendum. So
              the determination has been made, and there is nothing that the
              Assembly can do about it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second step is approval by the Assembly of
              that determination, and I will come back to that in a moment. The
              third step is the provision by the Secretary of State for Northern
              Ireland of the necessary Initial Standing Orders to enable us to
              run the mechanism. And the fourth step is the one by which the
              Initial Presiding Officer triggers that mechanism within the
              Assembly.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first step has already been taken, and we
              need to recognise that, as far as Unionist Members of the Assembly
              are concerned, the only one of those four steps over which we have
              any control whatsoever is the present stage, the giving of formal
              approval to that determination.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is there any Unionist Member brave enough to
              say that he trusts the Secretary of State to withhold those
              Standing Orders to avoid Unionists being placed in the
              embarrassing position of having Sinn Féin/IRA representatives in
              a shadow executive or a full executive? And is there any Unionist
              who would expect the Initial Presiding Officer to do anything
              other than fulfil his obligation to enforce those Standing Orders?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Secretary of State has full power, under
              the Northern Ireland (Elections) Act 1998, to release the Standing
              Orders to the Initial Presiding Officer. He will then have an
              obligation. This will not be a matter of his choice — he will
              have no say whatsoever. He will have to act immediately on the new
              Standing Orders that the Secretary of State releases to him. So
              the only step over which Unionist Members will have any say is the
              present step.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Are they relying upon the SDLP’s supporting
              them on a motion to exclude Sinn Féin/IRA from the Executive if
              they allow this step to be taken?</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.00</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Anyone who believes that the SDLP is going to
              turn on Sinn Fein/IRA does not understand the nuances of
              Nationalist politics. Do they believe that the IRA might begin to
              decommission? It will certainly not begin to decommission under
              the terms that the Deputy First Minister (Designate) has suggested
              where it would be substantial and verifiable and clearly part of a
              process to completely decommission. Perhaps it is what they have
              been telling some of their colleagues around the corridors. There
              will be a scorched earth policy. They will allow this to go
              through but when it comes to the stage of appointing people they
              are going to pull the rug from under the Assembly, precipitate a
              crisis and bring the House down unless decommissioning has begun.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Do they really believe what their leader is
              telling them on this matter? Indeed, that might be an issue worth
              exploring. Let me ask the Ulster Unionist Members, who are going
              to take a key decision today, tomorrow or the next day, if there
              is any one of them who really believes that the leader of the
              Ulster Unionist Party is not prepared to sit down in a shadow
              executive or a full executive with Members of Sinn Féin/IRA
              before decommissioning has taken place. I would like them to put
              their hands up if they are prepared to risk their political
              careers and resign from this House if he does not. Let us see the
              hands go up from those on the Ulster Unionist Benches who trust
              their leader in that respect. Not one of them trusts him to do
              that. Not one of them is prepared to do it. They are not prepared
              to risk their careers by doing so, but they are prepared to risk
              the future of the Union by voting for this motion.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We all recognise that in our lives there are
              moments when we will take a decision that will have profound
              consequences. There are even occasions when it is of such profound
              consequence that it will have an effect, not only on ourselves but
              on all those around us. This is one of those occasions.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The way Ulster Unionist Members and others vote
              in this debate today will have consequences for the Union. They
              cannot escape those consequences. They cannot sometime in the
              future say &quot;We were loyal members of the Ulster Unionist
              Party, we faithfully followed our leader, and we did what he asked
              us to do.&quot; Now that they have been warned of the consequences
              they cannot say at some later stage that they did not know what
              the outcome was going to be. They have been warned what it is
              going to be. To vote for this report is to vote for the
              destruction of the Union and for Sinn Féin/IRA in government.
              They need not try to tell their electorate otherwise.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Birnie:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome this report. On 18&nbsp;January I
              focused mainly on the North/South aspect. Today I am going to turn
              to an equally important, equally valid aspect of the
              implementation of the Belfast Agreement — the British-Irish
              Council (BIC).</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Before coming to that I want to say a few words
              about another element of this report — the Civic Forum. There
              are a number of key principles which we, as a party, believe are
              reflected in this report. We believe that in the structures for
              the Civic Forum there is indeed a wide representation of those
              groupings who have a reasonable right to be represented. There is
              transparency about the nomination and election procedures, and if
              there are problems in practice, there is written into them the
              provision for a review of the practice of the Civic Forum. What we
              wish to avoid is a situation where members of the Civic Forum have
              what a Conservative Prime Minister of the 1930s, Stanley Baldwin,
              referred to as &quot;power without responsibility: the prerogative
              of the harlot throughout the ages&quot;. We do not want that to
              apply to the Civic Forum, and we believe that the structure, as
              offered, will safeguard against that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is said currently that some of the
              difficulties being felt in south-east Asia, in terms of the
              economic crisis, relate to so-called crony capitalism. The
              provisions in the report ensure that the Civic Forum will not be
              subject to crony corporatism. The report envisages that not only
              will the North/South Ministerial Council meet in so-called shadow
              form, but so will the British-Irish Council. They will meet at
              roughly the same time. We hope to have parity of esteem on issues
              such as the size of the secretariat to the British-Irish Council
              relative to that for the North/South Ministerial Council, and on
              the location for a permanent support secretariat for the BIC.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the shadow meeting stage, the BIC will
              consist of representatives from Belfast, Dublin and London, and
              the smaller islands. We shall have to await representation from
              the devolved administrations in Scotland and Wales. Perhaps much
              further down the line English regions will be represented. In the
              interim, we in the Ulster Unionist Party are making our best
              efforts to seek the opinions of political parties and leaders in
              Scotland on the working of the BIC and are giving them our
              opinions.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The effort to get the BIC up and running and to
              formulate its procedures, which is mentioned in the report, is a
              complex matter but it is also a noble endeavour. We will keep in
              mind international precedents, and notably the Scandinavian
              example, the Nordic Council. Decision making in the British-Irish
              Council is to be by consensus. That can work, as the Scandinavian
              example demonstrates.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The BIC will have to settle the conundrum of
              who speaks for England. We will have to ensure that whatever
              procedures are adopted to represent English interests within the
              BIC, the views of the 50&nbsp;million or so residents of England
              do not swamp the views of the 14&nbsp;million residents of the
              so-called Celtic fringes.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report refers to a work programme for the
              British-Irish Council. I welcome that prospect, and the Ulster
              Unionist Party has strong views on the matter. According to IDB
              figures, between 1991 and 1996, the sale of manufactured goods
              from Northern&nbsp;Ireland to the Republic&nbsp;of&nbsp;Ireland
              increased by 60%, whereas those going from Northern&nbsp;Ireland
              to Great&nbsp;Britain increased by only 22%.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is against that background that we will be
              anxious to use the BIC to facilitate trade links between
              Northern&nbsp;Ireland and its largest external market — the rest
              of the United&nbsp;Kingdom. In that regard, I commend papers that
              were produced last month by the regional Confederation of British
              Industry on the issue of east-west transport and business
              proposals under strand three of the Belfast Agreement. We should
              look at the pricing, efficiency and frequency of sea links between
              Northern&nbsp;Ireland, Scotland, north-west England, and at the
              onward road and rail communications to London and the channel
              ports.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Belfast Agreement stresses mutual benefit
              as much in the context of strand three as in the context of strand
              two, which we discussed previously. For example, the Dumfries and
              Galloway region of Scotland is well known to Northern&nbsp;Ireland
              people in terms of tourism. People from here visit places such as
              Ayr and Dumfries. It is one of the historic parts of Scotland and
              contains the homes of such great Scots as
              Sir&nbsp;Walter&nbsp;Scott, Thomas&nbsp;Carlyle and Rabbie&nbsp;Burns,
              or Bobbie&nbsp;Burns as the Taoiseach referred to him in a speech
              in Edinburgh last October. For all that, that part of Scotland is
              considered peripheral, relative to the central belt area
              containing Edinburgh and Glasgow. It has some of the highest
              unemployment and lowest gross domestic product per head of any
              part of Scotland. So perhaps they have as much to gain by having
              stronger links across the Irish Sea as we have.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Turning to Merseyside, Liverpool’s economic
              problems are well known, and, indeed, parts of that region have
              the same objective status, at least at the moment, as Northern
              Ireland has. Anything that would revitalise the ports of
              north-west England would be just as good for that region as it
              would for Northern Ireland. Indeed, the north-west English region
              of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), along with its
              counterpart in Northern Ireland, are campaigning along those
              lines.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Edmund Burke said — I know that Ulster
              Unionists who quote him are sometimes upbraided for it, but he was
              a great Irishman and a great British parliamentarian, and the two
              need not be incompatible —</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;England and Ireland may flourish
              together. The world is large enough for both.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am glad that, last October, Bertie Ahern was
              in Edinburgh opening a Republic of Ireland Consulate. Indeed,
              there is also one in Cardiff now. I look forward to the day when
              the normalisation of north/south relations between Northern
              Ireland and the Republic of Ireland ensures that we also have a
              Republic of Ireland Consulate in the centre of Belfast.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The British-Irish Council is, in part,
              visionary; it is, in part, practical. It recognises the strength
              of human and cultural connections between these islands. The great
              historian HAL Fisher, in his history of Europe, referred to its
              peoples as energetic mongrels, and given the behaviour of some
              Assembly Members, that description seems quite apt. The comment
              was to do with the extent of ethnic mixing, because there is no
              such thing as a &quot;pure English race&quot; or a &quot;pure
              Irish race&quot;. Those who believe there is have often been
              misguided, and have done terrible deeds on the basis of such
              ideology.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Such ethnic mixing is supremely so in the case
              of the peoples who live in the islands of Britain and Ireland in
              Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland, Scotland, Wales and
              England. The genius of those peoples derives in large part from
              such human mixing, and the British-Irish Council is the
              institution in the Belfast Agreement which best reflects that
              fact. I urge support of this report.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Farren:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As we all know, today’s report brings us to
              the very critical, penultimate phase of the preparations required
              of the Assembly, prior to the formation of the Executive, the
              opening meeting of the North/South Ministerial Council, the
              transfer of power, the formation of the Civic Forum and the
              British-Irish Council. Despite the many late nights and the very
              difficult problems that had to be resolved during the negotiations
              on each of these matters, the overall result is one in which we
              can take considerable satisfaction.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Never before has such a level of agreement been
              reached between parties from the two main traditions in Northern
              Ireland, and between these parties and the two Governments in
              exercising ultimate responsibility for political relations in
              Ireland and Britain. To achieve this stage, signalled by this
              report, we have all had to travel very difficult paths. For some,
              the journey has been much more difficult than for others. I
              commend all those who have accepted the need for the honourable
              compromises which the Good Friday Agreement, and all that has
              followed from it, have required. What those parties which have not
              accepted these compromises have demonstrated, as today’s debate
              and previous ones have so frequently underlined, is that they have
              no capacity to produce any alternative with the remotest
              possibility of addressing the divisions in our society.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.15 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the contrary, they persist with a totally
              negative approach which is more likely to deepen and widen
              divisions than to provide bridges leading to agreement and
              reconciliation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a result of the compromises and the efforts
              of all the pro-agreement parties since Good Friday, we have put
              together a positive and remarkable blueprint for governing
              relationships in Northern Ireland, between North and South and
              between the people of Ireland and Britain as a whole. On the basis
              of that blueprint, we can begin mobilising our political resources
              to lead and support economic and social development, and,
              ultimately, genuine reconciliation in our divided community.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The hopes and expectations that were engendered
              by the Good Friday Agreement have been brought many steps closure
              to realisation. The opportunity to take responsibility for
              promoting economic and social reconstruction is at last within our
              grasp, but, as we all know, the challenges facing us are enormous.
              Economically, many sectors are showing significant signs of
              development, but to develop further they need a stable and
              peaceful political atmosphere. Other sectors continue to
              experience contraction and decline. In addition, unemployment
              persists at unacceptable levels, resulting in the marginalisation
              and poverty that are experienced by many. That sits uncomfortably
              alongside the affluence of others.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Peace and stability are even more essential if
              we are to attract inward investment, create new enterprises and
              provide for those who are affected by decline and contraction, the
              unemployed, the marginalised and a growing, young labour market.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In taking up all those responsibilities, which
              are eagerly anticipated by the wider society, many sectors of
              which will be joining us in this endeavour through their
              participation in the Civic Forum, we welcome the report’s detail
              on that Forum and the detail on the British-Irish Council. We
              anticipate many benefits economically, socially and culturally
              within the context of the new political relationships that that
              Council will encourage.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As we audit what has been achieved since Good
              Friday, we note that decommissioning remains the issue upon which
              hardly any progress has been recorded. While decommissioning is
              not a precondition for progress in any other area of the Good
              Friday Agreement, neither is the rest of the agreement a
              precondition for progress on decommissioning. I want to see the
              whole question of decommissioning removed as a matter of
              controversy and left to the international body, as laid down in
              the Good Friday Agreement.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will not give way.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I concur with many Members who have been
              calling for the matter to be treated in precisely that way, but
              that can only happen when there is confidence that the process is
              under way. I recognise that the absence of any report which would
              clearly signal that the decommissioning body is making progress
              speaks for itself.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is nothing for the international body to
              report, apart from the destruction of some LVF weapons and
              explosives before Christmas. I trust that Gen de Chastelain and
              his colleagues will soon have matters of more substance to report
              on decommissioning.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The exclusively democratic and peaceful means
              of resolving differences on political issues and the opposition to
              any use or threat of force by others for any political purpose, to
              which all pro-agreement parties voluntarily subscribed, can only
              mean that we continue doing all in our power and influence to rid
              society of illegally held arms in the possession of paramilitary
              organisations.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Using whatever power and influence that we have
              to this end is one of the fundamental tests of our commitment to
              what the agreement states to be exclusively democratic and
              peaceful means of resolving differences on political issues. It is
              a test we must meet as constructively as possible in order to
              instill the confidence and trust essential if the institutional
              blueprints before us in today’s report are to become the
              realities for which we all hope.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the past week there has been talk of where
              some who are here today believe we will be in 15 years time. I
              would like to think that by then we will be living in a totally
              peaceful, much more reconciled, more united and more prosperous
              society than the one we are living in today. If we are, it will be
              because we have implemented all aspects of the Good Friday
              Agreement. Indeed we will arrive at such a situation only by
              laying foundations today which are firm, just and equitable;
              foundations that respect and honour all traditions, and which,
              above all, are fundamentally informed by democratic and peaceful
              values.</p>

              was raised at a recent meeting. I urge you to declare now that the
              Gallery be quiet or be cleared. This is totally unsatisfactory. It
              is your duty to clear the Gallery if people persistently come
              there to try to disrupt democratically elected Members who are
              trying to speak on behalf of their constituents. Perhaps you might
              need assistance to do that.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The point the Member raises is absolutely
              correct, and if there is any further commotion whatsoever from the
              Gallery I will have no option but to clear the Gallery as a whole.
              That must be clear to Members. Those who come to the Galleries to
              observe the proceedings are very welcome to do so, but if they
              start making a noise they are attempting to participate in the
              proceedings, and that is another matter altogether — one that is
              completely out of order and unacceptable. I hope that that will be
              taken into account, and if there is any further commotion, the
              Galleries will be cleared until at least after lunchtime.</p>

              Presiding Officer. Will the Chair make it clear that visitors to
              the House, unless they are accompanied by a Member, cannot walk
              along the corridors with notebooks writing down the names that are
              on doors, and opening doors to find out who are in the rooms. I
              have raised this matter with the authorities, as the Initial
              Presiding Officer knows, and the next time this happens, the
              people in their rooms will have no option but to forcibly remove
              these people from the corridor. Are we being set up by people who
              roam freely the corridors of the House, taking down names and the
              numbers of the rooms?</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The situation in respect of regulations for the
              conduct of visitors to the building is very clear indeed. There
              are some public areas, the principal one being the Central Hall.
              Visitors are permitted into the Central Hall but they cannot go
              elsewhere, even if they have passes, unless they are accompanied
              by a passholder. That is very clear. If there are occasions when
              the regulations are broken, and it ought not to happen, I would be
              grateful if these were drawn to the attention of the doorkeeping
              staff and, indeed, to the attention of the Keeper of the House.
              The regulations are very clear indeed.</p>

              Officer. If — and I hope that it will not happen — you are
              called upon to exercise your authority in order to deal with
              disorder in the public Gallery, will you bear in mind that most of
              the people who visit the Chamber are exceptionally well behaved. I
              hope that your remarks and instructions will be directed only
              towards those who are causing the disruption.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I accept entirely what Mr McGrady said. It is
              rightfully said; it is well said. All visitors have a duty to
              respect the rules that have been set down and, indeed, which are
              pointed out to them when they come. It is difficult enough for me
              to keep order in the Chamber and keep an eye on Members; it is
              quite impossible for me to sort out matters in respect of visitors
              in the Gallery. Therefore if there is a commotion I have no option
              but to clear the Gallery as a whole, though that would be
              regrettable. I hope what I have said makes the position clear, and
              that it is not necessary to do so.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr Initial Presiding
              Officer. The House should be mindful that in the public Gallery
              today there are families who have suffered as a direct result of
              Sinn Féin/IRA violence — people some of whose relatives not
              only will not be heard from again but cannot ever have their voice
              heard in the Chamber. It is in that regard that we should question
              whether a small disruption is so totally out of place.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Initial Presiding Officer:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let me be very clear. One of the purposes of
              parliamentary procedure is to ensure that no matter how strongly
              Members feel about issues — and many Members have many reasons
              to feel very strongly about things that are said or done — their
              behaviour is kept within the bounds of procedure and proper rules
              and regulations.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While I have no doubt that many people have
              reason to feel strongly, particularly about the matters that may
              be dealt with in a Chamber of this kind, this cannot be an excuse
              for breaching regulations and rules that are properly set down.
              They must apply in the Chamber to Members, to the visitors
              Galleries and, indeed, to the press Gallery.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Further to that point of order, Mr Initial
              Presiding Officer. Surely in another place, when an interruption
              takes place in the Gallery, there is no attempt to clear it. The
              person who interrupts is taken out by those in charge of the
              Gallery. I would like you to give us a ruling. Can a Member bring
              13&nbsp;adults and a child into the coffee room that is supposed
              to be for the use of Members? Is that in order? Is that the way
              this place works?</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Initial Presiding Officer:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let me deal with the first question that you
              raise. It has been the fact that, on occasion in the past, some
              visitors in the Gallery have made a noise or other commotion. In
              some cases it was merely people getting a little excited; in other
              cases they were conversing rather too loudly with their
              neighbours. It was not always malign. That matter was pointed out
              by the doorkeeping staff who attended to it, and everything was
              fine.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.30 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was also clear — and I sought and received
              a report on this — that a number of visitors came, not on their
              own, but in a group with the clear intention of creating a
              commotion. The doorkeepers made it clear that such behaviour was
              not acceptable. Unfortunately, when those visitors were leaving,
              they upbraided the doorkeepers in a thoroughly unpleasant,
              inappropriate and unacceptable way.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I appreciate what Dr&nbsp;Paisley and Mr&nbsp;McGrady
              have said — that most visitors have an interest in what is
              happening in the Chamber and behave properly. Unfortunately, if
              there are visitors who create difficulties that the doorkeepers
              cannot deal with on an individual basis, I must deal with the
              situation by clearing the Gallery, for it is not possible for me
              to begin to identify individuals.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In respect of the other matter which Dr Paisley
              asked me to address, the rules with regard to the coffee lounge
              and other places are also quite clear. I must beg Members’
              indulgence. It is hard enough for me to deal with points of order
              that refer to what happens in the Chamber and in the Gallery, but
              to make an immediate ruling on a point of order about what happens
              in the coffee lounge does create some difficulty. The Member has
              quite rightly raised this matter, and I will ask the Keeper of the
              House to go to the coffee lounge and deal with the situation as
              appropriate.</p>

              Gallery. It struck me as some sort of strange virus, like DUP flu,
              for instance, because what was happening in the Gallery was merely
              an echo of what was happening on the Benches opposite. With all
              the focus on the Public Gallery, the point was missed that these
              Gentlemen, and one Lady, have always conducted themselves in this
              way. At some point, Mr Initial Presiding Officer, you should call
              them to order.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Bhí mé ag rá, sular cuireadh isteach orm,
              nach raibh Sinn Féin sásta leis an tuarascáil ach go raibh muid
              sásta go raibh dáta cinnte inti nuair a bhéas David Trimble ag
              cur moltaí chun tosaigh.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Tá an lá sin buailte linn inniu agus tá na
              moltaí romhainn: sin rud maith. Is céim thábhachtach í, agus
              sílim nuair a bhéas an díospóireacht seo críochnaithe —
              amárach nó Dia Céadaoine — go gcaithfidh Rialtas na Breataine
              céim eile a ghlacadh leis na h-instidiúidí a bhunú.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When Sinn Féin first received the report about
              one month ago from the First Minister (Designate) and the Deputy
              First Minister (Designate) — and I thank them for today’s
              report with its determination — it had a number of reservations,
              and those reservations stand. Some of my Colleagues will deal with
              them later in the debate.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We objected, for instance, to the absence of a
              Department of Equality, a very negative step; to the illogical
              fracturing of education into separate Departments; to the failure
              even to mention a junior Ministry with responsibility for
              children; and to the fact that in December the implementation
              bodies were diluted during the negotiations. Sinn Féin feels that
              much less was achieved than should have been.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sinn Féin also has reservations about the
              Civic Forum. That was to empower civic society and involve people
              in a whole range of important issues.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sinn Féin approaches these reports and this
              determination in a strategic way. It wants to see a new society on
              this island. It wants to see the Union ending. It wants to see —
              and this is only possible in that context — the aged taken care
              of, young people given opportunities, agriculture dealt with, and
              all those who are disadvantaged and oppressed being helped. Only
              when that happens will the Members opposite be liberated in terms
              of their sense of who and what they are.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This determination comes at a very important
              point for Unionism, and I want to address the rest of my remarks
              to where Unionism is now. The power, the influence and the
              monopoly on the affairs of this island, which Unionism used to
              represent, is gone. It is over, done with and gone. Some Unionists
              know this, and they accept it. Perhaps they even welcome this
              development. Some do not know, and they are the ones who cry the
              loudest like empty vessels. They do not know that the old days are
              over, that the old agenda has failed. In many ways, they are more
              to be pitied than to be scorned.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Others know this too, and they have great
              difficulties accepting the consequences of the changes that are
              coming or accepting their responsibilities for this new era. Or,
              at an intellectual level, they do accept that changes are needed,
              but emotionally they have great difficulties. This should be easy
              for Republicans to understand. They too have experienced a roller
              coaster of emotional and intellectual turmoil, but from a totally
              different basis. We want to try to be agents of the changes that
              are required. We want to try to be part of the transformation that
              is required if a real and lasting peace with justice is to be
              established.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some Unionists may hark back to the old days,
              the heady memories of Brookeborough and Carson, or even the ghosts
              of O’Neill and Faulkner. And there is an understandable interest
              in how the Ulster Unionist Party will vote, and what size the
              Unionist vote led by Mr Trimble will be. However, that is to miss
              the point, to miss what we have been trying to do and what we want
              to do. This is as difficult for the representatives of Sinn Féin
              and for the wider Republican constituency as it is for Unionists.
              The point is that no matter what our party political and
              ideological differences are, no matter the difficulties, the
              hardship and the grief that we have all come through, the new
              dispensation under the Good Friday Agreement divides us into pro-
              and anti-agreement camps.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If he implements the agreement, Mr Trimble, in
              his capacity as First Minister, has the support of over two thirds
              of the parties represented here. That is his own party, the SDLP,
              Sinn&nbsp;Féin, the Women’s Coalition, the Alliance Party and
              the Progressive Unionist Party. That is the new potential in all
              of this — not just looking over our shoulders at some fracturing
              of Unionism. Mr Trimble, as he implements the agreement, must
              uphold the rights of all citizens and respect the democratic
              mandate of all parties. There must be no more second-class
              citizens within this island. On these issues, the pro-agreement
              parties are in the majority and have a clear mandate from the vast
              majority of people on this island who are, to a man and woman, on
              the same side.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is difficult for me to contemplate being on
              the same side as the Ulster Unionist Party. It is difficult for
              them as well, but that is the reality. David Ervine said that it
              is also difficult for the Loyalist people, and I recognise that.
              In all of this, we have to look to the future. This is an
              important day, and this Assembly is going to clearly and
              decisively vote for this determination and this report. Sinn Féin,
              despite our reservations, is also going to vote for it. After that
              there needs to be speedy movement — <i>[Interruption]</p>

              Member behind him.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since last summer we have been waiting for
              these institutions to be put into shadow form. We want to see
              moves made speedily to allow these institutions to assume shadow
              form, so that power can be transferred from London and Dublin on
              10 March.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In response to the remarks made by the First
              Minister (Designate) and the Deputy First Minister (Designate), I
              would like to say once again that Sinn&nbsp;Féin remains totally
              committed to every aspect of the Good Friday Agreement and to
              restate Sinn&nbsp;Féin’s commitment to that agreement.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of course, this could be a messy debate, given
              the juvenile, schoolboyish and schoolgirlish antics of those on
              the Benches opposite. They provide light relief on what could,
              otherwise, be a boring day. But when the debate is finished, the
              Assembly will have sent a very clear message to the world that it
              wants the Good Friday Agreement to be implemented. The onus will
              then clearly be on the British Secretary of State to trigger the d’Hondt
              system, so that real power can be transferred from London and
              Dublin.</p>

              </i><b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Neeson:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I generally support the report from the First
              and the Deputy First Ministers (Designate). Some Members have
              complained about a delay in the presentation of the report, and I
              share these concerns. The report did not arrive a day late — it
              arrived about three and a half months too late. While the deadline
              of 31 October has been missed, I sincerely hope that the deadline
              for the transfer of powers to the Assembly will be met. I hope
              that by 10 March the Assembly will be well on its way to assuming
              the role for which it was formed and Members on their way to
              assuming the duties which, as elected representatives, they have
              been tasked to carry out.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is great expectation in the community at
              large about the prospects for the Assembly, and for its working
              for people regardless of their age, religion, gender, ethnic
              origin or disability. One important thing that could well develop
              once the Assembly is fully working — and I hope it does — is
              that more young people in Northern Ireland may be encouraged to
              become involved in politics. Clearly this morning’s events would
              not encourage that, but on occasions, such as when there have been
              delegations to Ministers on integrated education and the extension
              of the natural gas pipeline, the political groups in the Assembly
              have shown that they can work together on the bread-and-butter
              issues.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is up to the Members of the Assembly,
              collectively and individually, to ensure that we deliver, and
              deliver on time. Both Governments are working at full steam to
              ensure that the necessary legislation will be brought forward on
              time. I commend this, and I hope that developments inside and
              outside the Assembly will progress in parallel with the efforts of
              both Governments to ensure that full devolution is delivered.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since the initial presentation on the
              restructuring of the Departments was made I have reflected, and I
              think that there are a number of issues which need to be seriously
              addressed by those who produced the report. For example, the
              Education Department is going to be responsible for appointments
              to education and library boards. Some Assembly Members have
              already been contacted by the various libraries expressing concern
              that libraries have been put into the Culture, Arts and Leisure
              Department.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No doubt this was a balancing act. I have long
              believed that tourism should have been included within the
              Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure. I suppose that they have
              included Libraries in that Department in order to balance things
              out. That is no way to structure Government Departments. I appeal
              to those concerned to give further thought to this.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I strongly believe that the Environment and
              Heritage Service, which is currently in the Department of
              Environment, should have been included in the Department of
              Culture, Arts and Leisure because of its responsibility for
              archaeology and other heritage-related functions. I ask for that
              to be considered. Also, when we talk of museums we are talking
              about galleries as well.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As far as the six areas for co-operation and
              the implementation bodies are concerned, the Alliance Party would
              have preferred to have seen more implementation bodies
              established, even at this time. Clearly this was a point of
              dispute between the SDLP and the Ulster Unionists when they were
              working out their deal.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Energy should have been included in the areas
              for co-operation. As I said earlier, an all-party delegation met
              with the Minister to discuss the extension of the natural gas
              pipeline, and this is a clear example of where good North/South
              co-operation can lead to developments which can benefit people on
              both sides of the border.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the most important functions of the
              Assembly is to establish the scrutiny committees. Various Members
              talked about a &quot;stitch-up&quot; between the Ulster Unionists
              and the SDLP, and I hereby give warning that I do smell a rat.
              There will be 10&nbsp;Departments, and I strongly believe that
              there should be 10&nbsp;Committees to scrutinise them. Equally, I
              would like to think that there will be Committees to scrutinise
              the functions which will be brought to the centre — equality,
              community relations and the major issue of Europe.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is in the best interests of the Assembly to
              have an all-inclusive approach towards the scrutiny of the
              legislation which will come forward. There are 108&nbsp;Members in
              this Assembly, and it is important that every Member be involved
              in the scrutiny committees. It is important that all Members have
              ownership of the powers which will be devolved to the Assembly.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Regrettably, the question of decommissioning
              seems to be the next major obstacle that we have to face. The
              polls in the ‘Belfast Telegraph’ clearly showed the public’s
              concern on this issue. We have heard what Bertie&nbsp;Ahern said
              at the weekend. John&nbsp;Bruton, at the Fine Gael ardfheis, made
              similar comments, as did most of the political leaders here.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have got to remember that there are no
              preconditions in the Good&nbsp;Friday Agreement to entry into an
              executive. However, we are almost 10&nbsp;months down the line
              from when the agreement was reached. There is a strong moral
              obligation on the paramilitaries, whether Republican or Loyalist,
              to start actual decommissioning. I realise that it is
              a&nbsp;difficult&nbsp;issue. The International Commission on
              Decommissioning was established by the agreement to deal with the
              question of decommissioning, and it should remain with that body.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I repeat the suggestion I made last week: to
              ensure a win/win situation, and not a win/lose situation, it is
              important that David&nbsp;Trimble, the leader of the Ulster
              Unionists, and Gerry&nbsp;Adams, the president of Sinn&nbsp;Féin,
              get round the table together. If that could be facilitated by
              Gen&nbsp;de&nbsp;Chastelain, there are possibilities there. They
              have to be explored now if we are to achieve devolution by the
              10&nbsp;March deadline.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As we all know, the DUP amendment is simply a
              ruse to split the Ulster Unionists. Those who make some of the
              strongest statements about paramilitary connections should read
              yesterday’s issue of ‘Sunday&nbsp;Life’ before making any
              future statements. The determination of the report is important,
              and I look forward to the full devolution of powers on
              10&nbsp;March.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr R Hutchinson:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion represents a further weakening of
              the Union. For the past 30&nbsp;years, under the impact of the
              terror of Ireland’s physical force exponents, the balance
              between Unionists and Nationalists in Ulster has increasingly
              tilted in favour of the Irish Nationalist agenda.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We in the Northern Ireland Unionist Party will
              vote against this motion, not because we do not believe in peace
              but because the people who elected us would have no future in a
              united Ireland that was achieved by terrorism, ethnic cleansing
              and political coercion. The Unionist people would have ceased to
              exist. The evidence of our eyes, the experiences that we have
              lived through, and the fact that the wonderful and high-flown
              sentiments to which Nationalist politicians such as those in the
              SDLP, or, indeed, those in Sinn&nbsp;Féin/IRA who are engaging in
              the present charm offensive, bear no relationship whatever to the
              sufferings and abuse that have been inflicted on Unionists in
              pursuit of the objective of Irish unity.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All those things teach us that the romantic
              illusion of a united Ireland is undercut by the sordid reality of
              cruelty, lies and deception. Actions of the most savage and
              reprehensible kind, about which Irish Nationalists have taken up a
              stance of collective denial for too many years, have resulted in
              the Unionist population of Ulster being subjected to a brutal and
              efficient campaign of terror. Too often we have had to stand at
              the open graves of murder victims and listen to ministers of
              religion telling us that the victim had been cut down by a savage
              act of mindless violence.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those who said that the violence was mindless
              were wrong, however well intentioned they may have been. The
              assertion that the bombings and the killings were mindless conceal
              the fact that the violence was part of a cold-blooded, callous
              strategy based on the vicious principle that violence pays and, in
              the case of Ireland, that unity necessitated its use.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While Irish Republicans pursued their objective
              by physical force, constitutional Nationalists sought the same
              objectives by a process of gradualism. The motion represents the
              triumph of the policy of gradual Irish unification. In case the
              Unionists fail to follow through by committing collective suicide,
              the arsenals and the explosives will be retained. There will be no
              decommissioning until it is adjudged that the momentum towards
              Irish unification is irreversible. The violence was never
              mindless. Even the most devilish and satanic acts, as the media
              described them, could be subsumed within the overall strategy
              because such acts terrorised and intimidated people who did not
              understand the role played by the fanatic in the Irish struggle.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some weapons that are essential to the
              maintenance of control over Republican areas are in circulation.
              The remainder of the terrorist arsenals are stored away. The
              cynical calculation is that the IRA can get more out of the
              current situation by political means than by the application of
              physical force.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.15 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For the moment politics is more advantageous to
              the cause of unification than slaughter but the high priests who
              served Mother Ireland are ready to begin the ritual of human
              sacrifice again. Thousands of innocent lives are under threat and
              could be sacrificed if dark clouds arise to threaten the cult’s
              new dawn.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the Unionists renege on their commitment to
              the all-Ireland peace process then the arsenals would be made
              available to those who have signed up to the physical force
              tradition. These Republicans understand that the machine that
              drives forward Irish unification operates on a trigger mechanism.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The SDLP is well aware of the gains that
              violence has made for Irish unity, but its conscience is clear.
              Its liturgical condemnations of violence are a matter of public
              record. The SDLP has to make a choice between a stable society in
              Northern&nbsp;Ireland in which people who may have acute
              differences of culture and religion can nevertheless live together
              as neighbours and its aspiration for a united Ireland. Faced with
              that choice, the SDLP invariably sacrifices stability now for its
              dream of a united Ireland. The SDLP is into denial about the
              extent to which its united Ireland policy contributes to the
              polarisation in this society.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Northern Ireland Unionist Party rejects
              this motion setting up cross-border bodies, not only because they
              are an extravagant waste of money and make no economic sense but
              also because the sole rationale behind these functional
              institutions, which aim at a united Ireland through bureaucratic
              structures over time, are based on an Irish Nationalist agenda
              which is dangerously flawed, and has heaped untold misery on
              Northern&nbsp;Ireland over the last 30 years. The SDLP has put its
              Nationalist ideology and aspiration before the common good. The
              SDLP has preferred to tolerate deepening polarisation within
              Ulster as the necessary price to be paid for a united Ireland in
              some distant future.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Belfast Agreement, which we in the Northern
              Ireland Unionist Party reject, represents a triumph for the SDLP’s
              gradualist approach to Irish unification.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The SDLP is in effect saying to Sinn Féin/IRA
              through the Humes-Adams relationship &quot;It is our view that
              movement towards Irish unity can be advanced through cross-border
              bodies and the increasing involvement of Dublin in the everyday
              life of Northern&nbsp;Ireland, rather than by more years of murder
              and mayhem.&quot;</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are clear in our minds and in our analysis,
              which is why we will reject this motion today. We recognise that
              the violence of the IRA was never mindless. Note the importance of
              the statement made in ‘An&nbsp;t-Oglach’, the official journal
              of the Irish Republican Army in 1967:</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Our strategy must be the perfect blending
              of politics and violence (political action and military force) at
              the most opportune time and under the most favourable
              circumstances.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Only four years later Robert&nbsp;Moss, in his
              book ‘Urban Guerrillas’, was able to set out in outline or
              overview a more detailed appraisal of the IRA’s intentions. In
              March 1971 the Provisional IRA was claiming, according to Moss,
              that they had formed a terrorist organisation in Ulster capable of
              a protracted campaign; that that campaign would lead, firstly, to
              the fall of the old Stormont Parliament and, secondly, to direct
              rule from Westminster; that the IRA campaign would divide Ulster
              into Roman Catholic and Protestant zones; that the IRA would mount
              a programme of selected assassinations.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Then the IRA forecast that all of this strategy
              would — to quote Moss —</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;clear the way for the unresisting
              absorption of Ulster into a united Irish republic&quot;.</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No one can read those strategic predictions
              without a cold shiver going down the spine. Think of the thousands
              murdered and injured because cold-hearted, callous, cynical and
              brutal men deliberately set out to sacrifice victims, lives and
              limbs in order to unify Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They fly in the face of the history of this
              island, which is a history of cultural difference and legitimate
              political division in spite of all the wickedness to which it has
              been subjected. Unionist people have demonstrated resilience and
              perseverance throughout 30 years of terrorism. They will not
              readily surrender to either physical force or political coercion.
              Why should they?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 1986 we got another insight into this cruel
              and violent strategy which blends physical force and political
              activism — the Armalite and the ballot box. It was
              Brendan&nbsp;Clifford who revealed in his writings that he had
              been an eyewitness to the setting up of the Provisional IRA by
              what he called respectable people in the
              Republic&nbsp;of&nbsp;Ireland. He has written, of that period,
              that the IRA was financed and supported in its initial phase by
              eminent people in all parts of the Republic.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are many in the House and perhaps many
              outside among the public who will look upon this as a historic
              day. Either today or tomorrow we will vote on the report that will
              determine the future government of this our country. Either today
              or tomorrow we will choose between what some believe is going to
              be a solution to all our problems and what others believe is a
              transitional period on a road to a united Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This report is one that others believe will
              secure the Union and bring accountable government to Northern
              Ireland. Others even believe that voting to endorse this report
              will prevent something even more dictatorial being imposed by
              London and Dublin.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What we probably will end up voting for — if
              it is this report that we are going to vote for — is a report
              cobbled together during another time, the week before Christmas
              that coincided with the air strikes by the United States of
              America against Iraq. And that was preceded by the historic
              elections to this Assembly after the historic referendum result.
              One could say that living in Northern&nbsp;Ireland today is living
              through history.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Having been elected by good people who feel
              alienated and demonised politically by the great and the good in
              London, Dublin and Washington, I must say that it is a humbling
              experience to be here today. Warnings that many of us have
              consistently given regarding the Belfast deal have been ignored,
              but the fact remains that you cannot square the circle of
              democracy with armed, unrepentant murderers in government.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These particular people have a curious mindset.
              They say that we are wrong and have to change; that they are right
              and do not have to change; that we should forget about our past
              while they remember theirs. That is the mindset that we as
              Unionists have to deal with.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The G7 group pontificated again at the weekend
              about the Executive and parallel decommissioning. Where have we
              heard all of this before? Senior politicians who were involved in
              the &quot;Yes&quot; campaign with an insight into the thinking of
              paramilitaries tell us again that there is a crisis. What have we
              all been saying from the very start?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is inconceivable to think of having
              representatives of psychopathic IRA serial killers in government.
              I remind everyone in the Assembly that any chain is only as strong
              as its weakest link and that the weakest link in this process is
              the representation of heavily armed terrorists in this Chamber to
              whom the Labour Government have pandered and surrendered
              completely — and we have watched them do that. The total
              capitulation to these people will have many side effects for
              decades to come. The rule of law has now degenerated to the rule
              of farce. Violence has been shown to pay handsomely.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The precedent of an amnesty for future crimes
              has now been set with the Belfast deal. Who would have thought
              that after all the massacres and murders no one would serve any
              significant time in prison? The release on to our streets of some
              of the most violent men in Europe was degrading in the extreme for
              the victims of their crimes. I say with a heavy heart that those
              Unionists who negotiated the Belfast deal leave a dreadful legacy.
              I do not see what Unionism has achieved from this flawed
              agreement. Not one practical achievement has benefited the
              law-abiding Unionist.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Here we sit with the illusion of power,
              depending on Sinn&nbsp;Féin/IRA to denounce and reject violence.
              If President&nbsp;Clinton, Tony &quot;O’Blair&quot; — that
              would be a good name for him, and I suppose that it will be said
              to be a deliberate mistake — Bertie&nbsp;Ahern and all the other
              influential opinion makers cannot make Sinn Féin/IRA turn away
              from violence, what hope is there for an outcome to the pathetic
              pleadings for a token gesture on decommissioning by some Unionist
              leaders in the Chamber? Decommissioning is not the only issue.
              Some of us fought for election to the Assembly on more than the
              decommissioning issue. We object to people serving in government
              as of right.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Token gestures are meaningless. Many people
              have told Sinn&nbsp;Féin/IRA that their Semtex is not defensive
              and should be handed over. I suspect that there will be no
              decommissioning, no handing over of Semtex or other explosives.
              The illusion will be that everyone in Sinn&nbsp;Féin is doing his
              best to influence matters. Those Unionists who concluded the
              Belfast Agreement in 1998 betrayed all the efforts that were made
              by our gallant security forces over the past 30&nbsp;years. They
              also betrayed all of those who lost their lives in the battle
              against Provisional IRA/Sinn&nbsp;Féin terrorism.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No wonder the victims of terrorism do not rate
              anywhere in this deal. Those who faithfully supported the Ulster
              Unionist Party since its formation in Northern&nbsp;Ireland have
              been betrayed. People have entered into negotiations with armed
              murderers to secure the release of IRA murderers and bombers. The
              rule of law has been undermined by agreeing to a virtual amnesty
              for terrorist crime. The RUC will be destroyed, and those actions
              have led to the demoralisation of the Unionist people.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Paddy Fox, the dissident Republican recently
              kidnapped by Sinn&nbsp;Féin/IRA, said</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He was referring to a kidnap attempt. We should
              realise that nothing has changed. The Sinn&nbsp;Féin/IRA leopard
              has not changed its spots. The brutal murder of garda
              Jerry&nbsp;McCabe and the atrocious decision to drop the murder
              charges shows that in the Republic nothing has changed either. The
              same judiciary which for 30&nbsp;years failed the people of
              Northern&nbsp;Ireland by not extraditing the murderers and
              escapees to Northern&nbsp;Ireland, has now failed the garda; and
              the McCabe family.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The shocking and brutal killing of Eamon
              Collins by the IRA should be a warning about the seriousness of
              the situation. There is no doubt that at the end of the debate
              Unionists will vote with Sinn&nbsp;Féin/IRA. It will probably be
              the third time in 10&nbsp;months that they have joined together
              politically against the rest of the Unionist family. I repeat
              that. I take no pleasure in saying that. There is a danger that
              the Ulster Unionist Party and Sinn&nbsp;Féin/IRA will be
              inextricably linked because of this deal.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is there a modern democracy anywhere where a
              minority has an equal say in government and where a section of
              that minority seeks to undermine the very institutions in which
              they have a very sizeable stake or share? I do not believe there
              is. These basic reasons, together with the fact that this is a
              process dependent on concessions to Sinn Féin/IRA terrorism,
              ensures that I will certainly be joining with those who are
              opposed to this report.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a well-known &quot;traitor&quot; and
              &quot;betrayer&quot;, I support the motion. My party has some
              reservations, some of which were outlined by
              Mr&nbsp;Cedric&nbsp;Wilson and, indeed, by the leader of the
              Alliance Party. The two large parties need to be aware that
              consultation does not simply mean having a chat and then doing
              what one wants to do anyway. Cognisance needs to be taken of that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important to look at how far we have come
              before we consider jettisoning our desire, our vision for the
              future, to join those who at some point it may be worthwhile
              considering using parliamentary privilege against. This has been
              building and building, and I am getting pretty sick of it. I
              emphasise the word &quot;hypocrites&quot;, and if they want to
              raise points of order during my speech I am happy that you
              facilitate them, Mr Initial Presiding Officer.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They need to remember, when they talk about
              honour, integrity and decency, how many of them had long and
              meaningful debates with me — when I was a representative not of
              the Progressive Unionist Party but of the Ulster Volunteer Force
              — in meetings all over the country and, indeed, in some of their
              houses. I do not want to do it, nor do I want to give Nationalism
              or Republicanism a cudgel with which to beat Unionism, but I am
              not prepared to see the holier-than-thou attitude prevail.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am neither a traitor nor a betrayer. I have a
              view that is different to theirs, and I may have reason for it to
              be different. It may be because of my sense of betrayal, or my
              sense of people having sent me, assisted me, talked to me, came
              with me part of the way, and then betrayed me. They washed their
              hands of people. They shout at Sinn Féin so that their
              constituency might see it. The cry might be &quot;We beat them to
              death with DUP manifestos&quot;. Who are they kidding? They talk
              about the seriousness of what faces this country.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The reality is we have come a long way. The
              ceasefires may not be perfect, but they are in place. Many make
              use of television or other media to criticise those who take
              serious risks, and all of that as the words &quot;traitor&quot;
              and &quot;betrayer&quot; are ringing in the ears of those with
              whom they have to work. I ask them to think very carefully about
              who they describe as being a traitor or betrayer. They should
              think very carefully when I lay my life on the line, which I am
              prepared and happy to do — not for the first time, I might add
              — for my country, and I do so in the belief that we can make a
              difference. Not that it will stay the same. I do not ever want it
              to stay the same, and if it were wonderful it would not be good
              enough — it would have to be better.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I believe and hope that that is the nature of
              politics. It is supposed to be made better by politicians. The
              louder the complaining, the more I concentrate on the paramilitary
              groups, the drug gangs, the house-breaking gangs — all the
              difficulties in this society, such as the massive number of
              one-parent families, the near meltdown of the agricultural
              economy, the situation where Christians make a virtue of hatred
              and where politicians have no art, rather than making politics the
              art of the possible. I wonder if I am alone in wanting it to be
              different. Am I alone in wanting it to change?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have come a long, long way. There have been
              changes, even in the ideology, that people may not have recognised
              because they cannot see the wood for the trees. For them to
              identify the shifts or changes or schisms that exist between the
              ideology and the political reality of Sinn&nbsp;Féin would be an
              admission that perhaps there is hope, and they would not want
              there to be hope.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They walk past Carson, under Britannia; they
              sit in this House talking; they tore up the &quot;green
              book&quot;, but not many of them took the trouble to read it until
              recently, when they got elected and got the opportunity to let on
              that they had read it. They have no concept of the changes that
              can take place, of the will of the people, the desire of the
              people to live in peace.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I understand. Contrary to popular opinion, I do
              not live in &quot;leafy land&quot;; I have one small Housing
              Executive house, and I live in a solidly Loyalist housing estate.
              I have not had anybody shouting abuse at me. I wonder why.</p>

              fearful for the future of society that they are not telling me?
              They could always hide behind hedges and bushes, but they do not.
              And that tells me something: they are searching for, lusting
              after, some kind of better opportunity for the future.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All of us may be frightened. As we are in
              uncharted waters, why would we not be? No matter what tributary
              you face in life, the fear of getting it wrong is natural — of
              course it is — but you will never make anything or do anything
              unless you examine and explore the opportunities for the future.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is what we did in Castle Buildings. But
              there were those who would not even explore the opportunities for
              the future. Listen to the opportunities for the future and then
              retreat if you will. But they would not even listen. And they did
              not listen because the fiefdom might be challenged, the fiefdom
              that has them shouting and screaming at Sinn Féin only for the
              television.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What they are really trying to do is upset the
              Ulster Unionists and turn themselves into the leaders of Unionism.
              Some of them want to be that; others are &quot;cul-de-sac&quot;
              politicians. I repeat what I said in October: there are two forms
              of &quot;cul-de-sac&quot; politicians — those who cannot and
              will not come out of the &quot;cul-de-sac&quot; and those who live
              in a &quot;cul-de-sac&quot; and are frightened that somebody is
              looking through the venetian blinds and saying &quot;That is the
              one who let Gerry&nbsp;Adams into government.&quot; That is the
              fear — the fear for themselves. They cannot be afraid for their
              children or grandchildren or they would be thinking about the
              future; they would have vision.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we do not test Sinn&nbsp;Féin and the
              Provos, we will never know. We will have consigned this territory
              that we all profess to love to constant, bitter and brutal feuding
              until somebody with wisdom comes along and does something
              different. When the brutality has begun and we have begun to
              venerate the victims, we will be unable to stop the war. I have
              heard that from many people here; I have walked behind the
              coffins; I have had family members killed, and, indeed, there have
              been attempts on my own life. If all we had done was venerate the
              victims, how would we have ended the Second World War? How would
              we have gone on to have relationships with people that fought with
              my father, for instance? How often has it been said that soldiers
              fight only to end wars, not to perpetuate them? A battle or a
              conflagration must end or the value in that conflagration only
              exists in having it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a genuine opportunity to begin to use
              the process that we put together in Castle Buildings to
              deliver&nbsp;— to deliver the end of punishment beatings, to
              deliver decommissioning, to deliver accountable democracy, to
              deliver all of the things that every constituency signed up to, or
              it is not worth the paper it is written on.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But it is about more than that; it is about
              healing relationships, not only the fractured relationships
              between the North and the South and between east and west, but
              also the fractured relationships that have borders at the end of
              every street in some constituencies.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All that has to be begun, and if we cannot or
              are not prepared to set an example but are prepared only to chide
              and cough and play games, we will not get off first base.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those with large egos who defecate from a great
              height will undoubtedly tell us that vision which is not founded
              in their sense of democracy is not vision at all. If our troubles
              were a couple of days old we could begin the process of putting
              the wrongs right. We could say that one thing happened as a
              reaction to another and attempt to put it right and seek
              apologies. But we have had 30 years of this, and if we play the
              game of constantly harking back — today we were as far back as
              1967 — there will be no future, and those who advocated no and
              who want collapse at every turn have their part to play.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the way here this morning I passed Stormont
              Presbyterian Church, which I think has been sending us
              subconscious messages over the past few months as we drive to the
              Assembly. This morning the message said &quot;God give me patience
              ... but hurry&quot;. That message is truly meant for Members. We
              have waited long enough for this debate, and it is time that we
              made a determination to set up the Government Departments, the
              North/South bodies, the bodies for agreements between these
              islands, the British-Irish Council and the Civic Forum.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is time that we gave the people of Northern
              Ireland some encouragement by doing what they said they wanted us
              to do in the referendum. The process has become stagnant. We are
              in a vacuum, and every time that happens it is the most vulnerable
              time in our society. The people who live at the interfaces of our
              communities face the outcome of that vacuum. Day by day, they are
              terrified that we will not reach a decision that will eventually
              bring peace to Northern&nbsp;Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have that responsibility, and it is time
              that we implemented the agreement and moved to this next phase. It
              is the next step. Members have said that this is an important day.
              I hope that as we cast our votes in favour of accepting the report
              we realise the importance of moving to the next stage. We still
              have irreconcilable differences that are repeated over and over
              again in the media, which concentrate only on the fears of
              politicians, and leave no time for what David&nbsp;Ervine has
              rightly called space for hope.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If that is all that we are sending out, day by
              day, it is little wonder that people are saying that if the
              referendum on the agreement was to be rerun, they might be tempted
              to vote no. All that we have fed them is a diet of what people are
              against. I know from life and from working on committees and
              organisations and in education, that it is easy to be against and
              much more difficult to be for.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev&nbsp;Ian&nbsp;Paisley spoke about the
              floodwaters that are running, but it is much better to irrigate
              land than to see it in a drought. The Member for the United
              Unionist Assembly Party asked the Ulster Unionists about their
              legacy, which he said would be dreadful. My view is that it is the
              only one. It is the legacy of consensus and of agreement, the
              promise that we will never again do to each other what was done in
              this country over the past 30&nbsp;years. That is the legacy which
              I promise my children and their children, and the children of all
              those in the Chamber. That is the only way forward.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want decommissioning — not because it is
              being forced, but because it is the honourable thing to do when we
              move out of war and towards peace. It is the only thing to do.
              However, the agreement speaks to other forms of arms being taken
              out of this country. I read over the weekend that absolutely
              nothing will be done about firearms regulations or small arms. I
              want all arms, large and small, the arms that kill people, to be
              controlled. The only arms I want are those that I use to write. It
              is time for reality to set in and for us to agree that that is the
              only way forward.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must set up that Executive. I support the G7
              group. All Members may not agree with them, but at least they have
              put forward suggestions — for example, rather than just saying
              &quot;leave them to do it&quot;, they have suggested that there be
              decommissioning at the same time as the setting up of an
              Executive. It is one suggestion among many, and who are we to say
              that they should not make those suggestions?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have a great deal of concern about some of
              the issues in this report, but in the spirit of compromise and
              consensus we are agreed that this is the report that is going to
              stand up.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yes, I agree with the
              Rev&nbsp;Dr&nbsp;Ian&nbsp;Paisley that there may be room for more
              victims’ organisations to be represented on the Civic Forum.
              Many people have been affected by the troubles, and it is my
              belief that many of them will be represented on the Forum.
              However, if victims are going to get lost in the Office of the
              First Minister (Designate) and Deputy First Minister (Designate),
              then I have serious concerns.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At present, victims come under Adam&nbsp;Ingram’s
              portfolio. I want to make it clear that the Assembly is going to
              take this issue seriously. The concern of the victims’
              organisations that I have spoken to is not that all of them should
              be represented on the Civic Forum but that they will be able to
              secure core funding for the future. The ones that I have visited
              are simply spending project money, and when that runs out they are
              finished. As we move from conflict into peace these organisations
              start to come forward as the frozen watchfulness that they had
              during the years of conflict begins to melt. Assembly Members
              should ensure that they get the resources they deserve.</p>

              Presiding&nbsp;Officer. Is it in order for a Member to mislead the
              House? The DUP met Mr&nbsp;Mallon — one of Mr&nbsp;Maginness’s
              bosses — and Mr&nbsp;Trimble and discussed the matter fully. We
              also left them a paper on it. Now Mr&nbsp;Maginness is trying to
              malign the party by saying that it should have raised its concerns
              during the Civic Forum discussions.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms McWilliams:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let me address this very issue. The amendment
              makes a humorous point when it says that the Civic Forum should be
              &quot;merely consultative&quot;. One consults and addresses issues
              — one does not merely consult. I noted that Peter&nbsp;Robinson,
              the Member for East Belfast, said that he drew up this amendment
              rather quickly. The wording does indeed suggest that it was drawn
              up very quickly as it also contains the words &quot;properly
              appointing&quot;.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Civic Forum will not be appointing anyone.
              It will set up sectors, sub-sectors and, if required,
              sub-sub-sectors to bring people into the Civic Forum, from grass
              roots community activists to the top people in consortiums. I do
              not know if a person can be improperly appointed, but putting the
              word &quot;properly&quot; in front of appointed leaves a great
              deal of room. I hope that Mr&nbsp;Robinson’s party will address
              this wording when it discusses the Civic Forum.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The amendment also says &quot;merely
              consultative&quot;. Many of Mr&nbsp;Robinson’s Colleagues and
              others have argued for serious consultation. Given the response to
              the Member for North Belfast it would appear that these Members
              were consulted about the Civic Forum and responded to the
              consultation by putting forward a paper. Consultation should not
              have the word &quot;merely&quot; in front of it. Consultation is a
              serious matter and one should take on board the points that are
              made as a result of it. The adjectives put in the amendment have
              done a great disservice to the Democratic Unionist Party. Perhaps
              it now recognises that the Civic&nbsp;Forum will be established
              and will encourage members of civic society to put their names
              forward.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am also concerned that women’s issues,
              which are to be in the First and Deputy First Ministers’ office,
              will be buried there. Looking at the list that is attached to that
              office, one begins to ask seriously how any two people will ever
              be able to do the work that is spelled out in that report. I hope
              that if junior Ministers are to be appointed — and we still have
              had no serious consultation on that issue — a number of them
              will be given these responsibilities to take forward.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let me address the issue of the Civic Forum. It
              is a good day for the Women’s Coalition. We were the party
              responsible for putting this forward as an idea in the
              negotiations. It is true that we almost lost it; there were
              brackets around the Civic Forum, but we negotiated like everybody
              else and compromised on its final drafting. But it is there, to
              our great delight.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Civic society has been strengthened over the
              years by the number of people who were prepared to get out and
              become the doers and not just the talkers. It is that strength
              between and within communities that I would like to address. It is
              an inclusive body. It will address not just the issues of
              Nationalism and Unionism but the strengths across all sectors, and
              most particularly in the community and voluntary sector.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Contrary to what Monica&nbsp;McWilliams has
              said, it is not easy to be against purse and patronage of two
              Governments plus the United States, or against UTV and the BBC, to
              say nothing of ‘The Irish News’, the ‘Belfast Telegraph’
              and the ‘News Letter’, all of whom weighed in very heavily in
              favour of the matters that Monica&nbsp;McWilliams supports.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The only definitive statement of the Government’s
              policy strategy for Northern Ireland is entitled ‘Towards a
              United Ireland’. The present Secretary of State was the
              co-author of that document, which contains all the essential
              elements of the Belfast Agreement. Yet Unionists, by giving
              cross-community support to this determination, will be putting
              their future and that of the Union in her pro-Nationalist hands.
              By approving this determination, Unionists will, in effect, throw
              away the one element of positive control over the process that
              they can now exercise. They will have placed themselves and the
              Union at the mercy of a Secretary of State who is totally
              unsympathetic to their interests.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Once this determination is approved, the
              Secretary of State can, by Standing Order, put the d’Hondt
              formula into operation when she chooses. When she does, Sinn&nbsp;Féin
              will be entitled, as of right, to its appointed places in
              government, first in shadow and then in substantive form. Over
              that situation, pro-Union parties will no longer have any control
              whatever. Such trust in the Minister, in the wake of a string of
              broken pledges, indicates a faith and a child-like trust that
              beggars belief.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With the control of the timing of the d’Hondt
              operation, the Government will have space to arrange the final and
              fatal fudge on decommissioning. Gen&nbsp;de&nbsp;Chastelain is now
              claimed by Dr&nbsp;Mowlam and Messrs&nbsp;Hume and Mallon to have
              a pivotal role on this issue. That is a false claim, and it was
              reiterated today by Mr&nbsp;Farren. Gen de Chastelain is charged
              under the agreement merely with monitoring, reviewing and
              verifying progress on decommissioning.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;Farren should read the agreement. The
              fudge or fig leaf will require a new and unauthorised political
              role for the general. He will be pressurised to provide a
              programme for decommissioning commencing at some time after
              Sinn&nbsp;Féin has been seated. Unionists will be fobbed off with
              a promise of a review if Sinn&nbsp;Féin/IRA do not meet the
              required timetable. This arrangement has already been kited by
              such as Dr&nbsp;Maurice&nbsp;Hayes in yesterday’s ‘Sunday
              Independent’, and the ground is being prepared by
              Sir&nbsp;George&nbsp;Quigley and others of G7. The scheme would be
              worthless because there is no hope of the IRA decommissioning
              anything, and certainly not before the RUC has been demoralised
              and disarmed.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many informed people consider that the
              Government, under the guise of implementing measures appropriate
              to and compatible with a normal peaceful society, are preparing to
              remove all personal security weapons from those to whom they have
              been issued as a protection against terrorist attack.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is designed to meet the IRA’s
              requirement for what it calls demilitarisation. The Government
              will suggest it as a trade-off for decommissioning, and the
              Minister of State, Mr&nbsp;Adam&nbsp;Ingram, will tell
              Mr&nbsp;Trimble and Mr&nbsp;Ken&nbsp;Maginnis that he does not
              usually discuss the detail of such matters with the Opposition.
              Informed people realise that the Government, after each
              concession, such as the continuing prisoner releases, will tell us
              that we have no alternative, as failure to accede to each new
              demand from the terrorists would bring the entire process to an
              end and send the IRA back to war.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the past, the IRA threatened us with
              violence if we did not do what it wanted. Now the Government
              threaten us with violence by proxy. The reason is that there is no
              sacrifice that Unionists will not be asked to make in order to
              protect the lives of the first-class citizens and the economic
              targets on the mainland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Are we so naïve, so trusting and so blind that
              we do not realise that once Sinn Féin has taken its seats in
              government, it will never be put out as long as there is a threat
              of a renewal of terrorism on the mainland? This process has always
              been driven, and will continue to be driven, inexorably by terror
              and by the threat of terror until Sinn Féin/IRA achieves its
              political objectives. Those who think otherwise are living in
              cloud-cuckoo-land. The Ulster Unionist Party has said that it will
              refuse its seats in government if Sinn&nbsp;Féin takes its seats
              without decommissioning. This could only be compared to the
              defenders of a city throwing their weapons over the walls to the
              besiegers before announcing that, if the besiegers did not go
              away, they would march out and abandon the city to them.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly and any devolved government that
              it may produce under the terms of the Belfast Agreement are poor
              enough instruments for defending the Union, but they may turn out
              to be as much as we are ever likely to get in terms of local
              democracy. However, to throw it all away now, after giving
              everything else away and discarding all one’s cards, would be to
              commit political suicide. Unionists should realise that the tide
              of democratic opinion — here, in Britain and especially in the
              Republic of Ireland — has turned in their favour. There is an
              increasing awareness that without decommissioning democracy is
              dead and that no institution of government worthy of the
              description &quot;democratic&quot; can exist and, at the same
              time, include a minority that attempts to determine policy by
              using the threat of violence from a private army.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The case for excluding Sinn&nbsp;Féin from
              government until the IRA decommissions has never been stronger.
              Now is the time to take advantage of that growth in public support
              and to refuse to approve this determination until such time as
              substantial decommissioning has begun. One way of dealing with
              this problem, so far as the Ulster Unionists are concerned, is to
              vote for the first motion — the one on the report — put it on
              the table and say &quot;that is what we voted for and what we are
              willing to agree&quot;, but to withhold support from the second
              motion, which would transform acceptance of the report into a
              determination that would enable the Secretary of State to use the
              d’Hondt system whenever she wished.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thus the Ulster Unionist Party would have
              fulfilled all its commitments. It would be able to say that it had
              agreed to the bodies, to the Ministries and to the functions
              contained in the report while, at the same time, saying that it
              refused to vote for the determination until such time as
              substantial decommissioning had begun and had been carried out.
              Thus the Ulster Unionist Party could disarm its critics: it could
              not be accused of not being constructive, and it could not be
              accused of placing obstacles in the way of progress.</p>

              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A clear marker would have been put down: there
              cannot be a determination until Sinn Féin/IRA shows its
              determination to enter fully and properly into the democratic
              process.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I say this to Members: &quot;Do not place your
              future, the future of your children and that of the Union in the
              hands of this particular Secretary of State, but declare that
              without decommissioning there will be no determination.&quot; Such
              a decision is the last card within their control, and now is the
              time for the Ulster Unionist Party to play it. Without
              decommissioning, democracy is indeed dead, and the approval of
              this determination will enable the Government, and their allies,
              to pressurise the Unionist parties into Government without a
              single gun or a single ounce of Semtex ever being decommissioned.
              Members are simply storing up further pressure for the day when
              they will have to make a decision on whether they remain in an
              executive or go. I ask them, I implore them, to vote against the
              motion approving the determination.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Ulster Unionist position is quite clear: we
              will not be sitting in ministerial positions unless there is
              decommissioning. That is an absolute, and there is no getting away
              from it. I support this motion. I support my party leader, and I
              compliment him on his conviction, his bravery and his knowledge in
              this matter.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Reference has been made to the Civic Forum. I
              want Members to know that the DUP and Sinn Féin are very much
              agreed on the Civic Forum and on other issues — in case people
              have the wrong impression. Earlier, Mr&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;Robinson,
              in his nauseating, sanctimonious way, referred to a denial of
              freedom of speech. I wonder what he has to say about the attempt
              to deny freedom of speech in Fivemiletown a fortnight ago tonight,
              when there were despicable scenes aimed at stopping Unionist folk
              from going to a party meeting. I was kicked, jostled and subjected
              to taunts, scorn and gibing — that is what the DUP calls free
              speech.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want this state to prosper, but it can only
              be built upon foundations of a moral character. Such character is
              the principal element of its strength and the only guarantee of
              its permanence and prosperity. I do not want Government by
              stampede — not by any means. The situation must be appropriate,
              and at present it is not. The politicians of our time could be
              characterised by their vain attempts to change the world and by
              their inability to change themselves. Evidence of that manifests
              itself in the Assembly today.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This Assembly would almost be ready to begin to
              govern Northern Ireland, within the United Kingdom of Great
              Britain and Northern Ireland, but for one big, vital issue —
              decommissioning. Republicanism has reneged on the Belfast
              Agreement; it has failed to deliver on getting rid of arms and
              explosives; it has not honoured the agreement. Therein is the
              denial of democracy, and Sinn&nbsp;Féin — the front for
              terrorism — has failed, and failed miserably. I question whether
              it has ever really tried.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly cannot govern with credibility if
              political parties, from wherever, ignore the fact that there are
              weapons of war and destruction out there in the undergrowth. The
              potential for another Omagh, another Enniskillen and all the other
              dastardly acts of evil is still very real. If there is honesty, if
              there is integrity, let it show itself now.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The use of the words &quot;inextricably linked
              to the IRA&quot; is, in my opinion, wrong because it suggests that
              Sinn Féin is different from the IRA. One has to ask &quot;Is
              it?&quot; How often have Members of this Assembly, and others,
              been seen at the funerals of terrorists? Did not
              Mr&nbsp;Gerry&nbsp;Adams act as pall-bearer at the funeral of the
              Shankill bomber who, just two days before, had murdered eight
              people in that dastardly act of aggression? Did not Mr&nbsp;Francie&nbsp;Molloy
              state &quot;We can go back to what we do best&quot;? Was that a
              threat or an act of bravado to a receptive audience?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Are the leader of Sinn&nbsp;Féin and his
              associates not fooling some? Are they bluffing terrorist
              associates, or are they bluffing society? It seems they want to be
              part of both. They cannot be.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The IRA/Sinn Féin group must prove itself to
              society and not vice versa. They can make or break the benefits we
              seek from government in Northern&nbsp;Ireland. Do we wish to
              accept that they, without any sign of conscience, compassion or
              concern, once again associate themselves with those who have
              bloodied this land by their acts of terror? They expect this
              Assembly to ignore the fact that loved ones, dear ones, were torn
              to shreds. There have been broken hearts and broken limbs, and
              families have been scarred for the rest of their lives by base
              deeds. Decommissioning would be an act of trust, an act of faith
              and an earnest of an intent never again to sink to the depths of
              the past 30&nbsp;years of evil. We are not getting that action or
              trust.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Not only the Ulster Unionist Party should be
              emphasising this requirement of the IRA and Sinn&nbsp;Féin. Every
              party should seek it rather than evade it or turn a blind eye to
              the IRA/Sinn Féin movement, which can wreck the Assembly.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If IRA/Sinn Féin fails to deliver, the rest of
              us should agree, without any compunction, to go on without them.
              They will then have debarred themselves, and the world should be
              made fully aware of their deceit. It was destruction physically
              over the years, and now it is destruction politically by using
              democracy to deny and destroy democracy. Mrs&nbsp;Mary&nbsp;Harney,
              the TD in the South, has stated</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;There is no distinction between the IRA’s
              political wing, Sinn Féin and the IRA, and now is the time for
              them to decommission.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">‘The Irish News’ recently referred to
              attacks on people in Nationalist areas of Belfast. Of the

              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;All the attacks were plainly in breach of
              both the IRA ceasefire and the Good Friday Agreement. They state
              these punishment attacks must be brought to an immediate end yet
              Sinn Féin still continues to seek Executive positions.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sinn&nbsp;Féin and the IRA are holding this
              country to ransom. They inhibit progress and stifle trust, and for
              more than 30 years they have denied people the benefits of good
              citizenship. The whole world must now be made aware of the deceit
              and falsehood of Sinn&nbsp;Féin. If there were decommissioning, a
              Government would be in action here. That is as plain as day. They
              should move out of the darkness of evil into the light of
              democracy. We seek that, but Sinn&nbsp;Féin deny it to the
              people. It and any other terrorist-associated grouping cannot be
              allowed or excused such base behaviour.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Ulster Unionist Party wishes to set up the
              institutions that are envisaged in the agreement. We need to
              tackle the mass of urgent social and economic issues. Action on
              those is vital to the future welfare of our people.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to speak in support of section&nbsp;5 of
              the report relating to the consultative Civic Forum. I was the
              SDLP representative on the study group, and I should like to thank
              the representatives of the other five parties for their commitment
              towards producing that report. No party got everything it wanted,
              but the proposals in Section&nbsp;5 are an acceptable compromise.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I regret that two parties, the Democratic
              Unionist Party and the then United Kingdom Unionist Party excluded
              themselves from the study group. The proposals for a consultative
              Civic Forum are an indispensable and integral part of the
              Good&nbsp;Friday Agreement. The SDLP is committed to implementing
              all aspects of the agreement. We made many specific proposals,
              some of which are incorporated in Section&nbsp;5 and some of which
              are not.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The overall principle, which I am glad to see
              is implicitly acknowledged, is that the Assembly is free-standing.
              There are several forms of democracy, the most important of which
              is representative democracy whereby the electorate choose a
              relatively small number of people to take decisions on their
              behalf. By the standards of western democracy, we have a high rate
              of electoral participation. About 70% of the electorate voted in
              the Assembly election. That is comparable to the turnout in a
              general election. It is certainly a lot higher than in the US
              Congressional elections of last October where the turnout was 33%.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Civic Forum can broaden and deepen the
              political and public process by bringing a rich diversity of
              viewpoints to discussion about matters of public policy. Indeed,
              it could foster a healthy and creative relationship with the
              Assembly.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another principle held by the SDLP is that the
              Civic Forum must be as broadly based and inclusive as possible.
              Representation and selection are vital issues, and we want the net
              to be cast as widely as possible in order to allow the broadest
              possible representation. People will be nominated by various
              bodies, and they will, I believe and hope, not only have the
              confidence of their nominating bodies but the breadth of vision to
              empathise with the broader needs of society, as well. The process
              of selection must be gender-proofed, ensure an equitable
              geographic spread and be broadly balanced. We do not just want to
              see the great and the good, who, in fairness, have contributed a
              lot to our society over the past 30&nbsp;years. We now have an
              opportunity to include the marginalised and some fresh faces.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The make-up of the Civic Forum is not set in
              stone. The SDLP would have preferred, for example, that the
              Chairperson be selected from within the Civic Forum’s membership
              rather than an appointee. Also, there are groups that are not
              mentioned in the report who should have the right to nominate
              people, such as the Credit Unions. The fact that a group’s name
              is not mentioned does not preclude it from making negotiations.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Civic Forum must be effective and it must
              start working as soon as possible on a number of subjects, such as
              social exclusion, long-term unemployment, selection in education,
              sectarianism in our society and civics education in our schools.
              Discussion of these thorny and endemic problems in the Civic Forum
              would allow a consensus on the way forward to build up before an
              issue made its way on to the Floor of the Assembly.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Civic Forum will not necessarily
              depoliticise these problems, but it could ensure more rational and
              informed discussion among the parties. Democracy in all its forms
              has had a difficult time here for generations. It has been tested
              almost to the point of destruction by those who have resorted to
              violence. We have been given the chance for a new beginning. The
              proposals for a Civic Forum give us a chance to underpin our new
              start for democracy, and I hope to God that we do not waste that
              chance. If we do, what are the alternatives?</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We hear Unionist representatives saying that
              they are for decommissioning but that perhaps Sinn&nbsp;Féin is
              not. Some go further and say that Sinn&nbsp;Féin is opposed to
              it. All our efforts over the greater part of this decade, I
              contend, have shown — and we have proved this to the highest
              people in the highest places in this world — that we, as well as
              wanting to bring about an end to conflict, injustice, inequality,
              discrimination and domination, want to bring about the removal of
              all guns from Irish politics. It is not true that the Ulster
              Unionists and Sinn&nbsp;Féin are generally divided on this issue.
              The difficulty comes when the Unionists wrongly, as
              David&nbsp;Trimble admitted in a recent debate in this House,
              interpret the Good Friday Agreement as stating that there is a
              precondition to Sinn&nbsp;Féin’s participation in an executive.
              There is not, and we all know it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What did the Good Friday Agreement do about
              this issue? It made decommissioning or the removal of weapons from
              Irish politics the responsibility of us all, at least of all those
              who signed up to that agreement. It is the responsibility of us
              all. We in Sinn&nbsp;Féin are not going to take on our shoulders
              sole responsibility for resolving this issue. I think that both
              Governments are listening to the argument that the key phrase in
              the agreement is that responsibility for this lies with all the
              participants.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have met Gen&nbsp;de&nbsp;Chastelain on many
              occasions. I was glad to see many of the other parties going to
              meet him last week because up until then I had met with the
              general more than the other parties put together. I have told
              Gen&nbsp;de&nbsp;Chastelain that there is a responsibility to be
              shared and that Sinn&nbsp;Féin is not going to accept
              responsibility for this alone.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Ulster Unionists talk about decommissioning
              as if its taking place is proof of a party’s or parties’
              commitment to peace and democracy. It is no such thing. It does
              not prove that at all, and the LVF’s decommissioning clearly
              shows that. I know that this is a difficult process for Unionists,
              but it is also a difficult process for Republicans.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the big difficulties, even the great
              sadness, of this process has been the lack of connection between
              the Ulster Unionist Party and Sinn Féin. I do not know Roy&nbsp;Beggs&nbsp;Jnr;
              I do not know Pauline&nbsp;Armitage; I do not know
              Peter&nbsp;Weir. They never gave me the chance to get to know
              them. That is their right, but is it how a peace process should
              work? Most people in the international community would be shocked
              to know that if I were to meet David&nbsp;Trimble walking along a
              corridor here today he would not even say &quot;Hello&quot;. Is
              that how a peace process should work?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Over the weekend I spoke on the telephone to a
              very senior businessman who is a Unionist and a supporter of the
              Ulster Unionist Party. He told me that he was shocked to discover
              that the last time David&nbsp;Trimble met with Gerry&nbsp;Adams
              was 18&nbsp;December of last year — two months ago. Is that how
              a peace process should work? I think not.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There needs to be a real engagement between the
              Ulster Unionist Party and ourselves. They have hurts. They see us
              as people with a lot of baggage. I understand all of that. We have
              hurt them, but they must also look at it from our perspective. The
              people that we represent have been hurt. They were hurt on
              &quot;bloody Sunday&quot;; they were hurt by the introduction of
              internment; they were hurt by gerrymandering; they were hurt by
              discrimination; they were hurt by the killing of Pat&nbsp;Finucane;
              they were hurt by the fact that, as we can now prove, elements
              within British military intelligence, involved with Loyalist death
              squads, were involved in the killing of our people — probably by
              the hundred, the Pat&nbsp;Finucane case being only the tip of the
              iceberg.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Stephen&nbsp;Leach, one of the architects of
              decommissioning, has been in the United&nbsp;States in the last
              two weeks, and he told people he met that Sinn&nbsp;Féin would
              not get positions on an Executive unless — these are his exact
              words —</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;there is an actual surrender of weapons
              by the IRA.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is Stephen Leach, the man who thought up
              this issue and gave it to John&nbsp;Major in order to prevent
              negotiations taking place. If John&nbsp;Major had won the 1997
              general&nbsp;election none of us would have been standing here
              today. We are now facing a situation where the Ulster Unionist
              Party is threatening to use this issue against Sinn&nbsp;Féin’s
              participation in the Executive, using the same veto. I hope the
              British Prime Minister will not allow that to happen, because
              behind all of this, ongoing attacks are still being carried out by
              the Orange Volunteers and the Red Hand Defenders.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have here a component part of a hand grenade
              which was thrown in my constituency in recent weeks. I believe it
              is one of those hand grenades imported into the North of Ireland
              in the last 10&nbsp;years by Brian&nbsp;Nelson with the assistance
              of British military intelligence. These were the weapons that were
              divided between the UVF, the UDA and the Ulster Resistance. We
              heard &quot;Peter the Great (the Clontibret raider)&quot; and the
              &quot;Grand Old Duke of Paisley&quot; — who climbed up many a
              hillside — claiming this morning that they had absolutely
              nothing to do with all of this.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to commence with a brief reference to

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Reference was made to what might be described
              as our inactivity in coming forward with proposals regarding the
              Civic Forum, and there are those who would like to try to
              denigrate our position in relation to that by saying that we are
              totally and utterly opposed to the formation of a Civic Forum.
              They obviously have not read the amendment. We would not have had

              constructive proposals for that forum, but we are not going to sit
              down with the representatives of armed terror, be they called Sinn
              Féin/IRA or IRA/Sinn Féin — and I know there is a feeling out
              there in the community about which they should be called. We will

              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Campbell:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not know whether Mr&nbsp;Maginness is as
              conversant with ordinary English as he was with the French-English
              of a recent television programme, but we made a full, written
              submission about the Civic Forum, and we discussed it in
              bilaterals. How he can see that as total opposition on our part to
              the Civic Forum is something that I cannot understand, so I will
              leave it for others to work out.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Civic Forum is to be composed in a
              particular way, and others have outlined the problem — indeed,
              the many problems — arising from allocating so many positions to
              the voluntary and community groups, and from allowing the First
              and Deputy First Ministers to appoint six people and so on. There
              is no place for any formal local government involvement, yet that
              could have been considered.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Round-table consultations with six of the
              Assembly parties established this report, but there is no
              reference to the fact that consultations are supposed to take
              place on a whole range of matters. Two weeks ago we were having a
              serious debate here.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Interim Presiding Officer, you were absent
              because of the subject matter of that debate. There were those —
              and they are to be found in almost all the groups that are
              mentioned under paragraph 5(1) — who opposed my party’s motion
              of no confidence in you, thereby implying they had every
              confidence in you. Yet today we are told that consultations have
              been going on for a number of days and that it would not be
              expedient to proceed. We will deal with that in the coming days
              and the sleaze that goes on behind closed doors will no doubt be
              revealed.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The more substantial part of my comments
              relates to what will undoubtedly be established, and that is the
              Executive. We could dwell on, as I know some people have, promises
              made. I could refer to advertisements at the time of the
              referendum, to assurances given, and to adverts that cost tens of
              thousands of pounds, and I could well cause some embarrassment if
              I were to do that. There were Ulster Unionist voices that said
              &quot;Yes for the Union.&quot; I could cause acute embarrassment,
              but I do not know that that would do any good.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not know that that would bring us any
              further forward because my feeling is that, for the large part,
              minds have been made up; and people are prepared to live with the
              consequences of their actions. That is the feeling that I get. We
              are undertaking a debate today which will result in a vote that
              will lead to the setting up of a Government: a 10-person
              Executive, two members of which — and that is one fifth of the
              Government — are inextricably linked to a terror machine.
              Whether they are called Sinn&nbsp;Féin/IRA or IRA/Sinn&nbsp;Féin
              I care not.</p>

              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They will be part and parcel of the Executive
              that will come about because some token action will occur which
              will allow the Executive to be formed while allowing Mr Trimble to
              say that decommissioning has started. Whether it is
              Gen&nbsp;de&nbsp;Chastelain or Mo&nbsp;Mowlam in conjunction with
              Bertie&nbsp;Ahern, a token gesture will be made, and the Executive
              will be formed.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My main question is this: what then for
              Unionism? What do we do then? I have taken it as read that the
              vote will be carried today. From all the speeches and
              contributions I detect no feeling of regret. In spite of all that
              has happened and all the shifts that we have detected in opinion
              polls — even last week, when the Unionist’s community’s
              views were seen to harden — there are still those who are
              determined, for whatever reason, to press ahead. The self-destruct
              button must be pressed, and they are determined to do it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After this vote, and for the foreseeable
              future, there will be three elements of Unionism. First, the
              defeatist section of Unionism, who, for whatever reason, has
              decided that it cannot change anything, that the combination of
              Sinn&nbsp;Féin/IRA, the SDLP, the British Government, the Irish
              Government, the Irish Americans and the European Union cannot be
              defeated. People in that section have thrown in the towel and said
              &quot;Let’s make the best of it.&quot; That is the defeatist
              element of Unionism. They have cut their cloth, and there is no
              going back after this vote. I am not throwing my lot in with them,
              nor will I ever do so.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second element of Unionism contains the
              quitters or those who opt out. I sympathise with some of them
              because, understandably, they feel that they can no longer
              participate in politics. They have decided that they are going to
              quit political involvement or they have already quit, and we see
              that from the lower turnout from Unionist communities in the east
              of the Province. I am not in the lobby of those who have decided
              that there is no point in getting involved because the process is
              going ahead.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The third element contains those of us who are
              realists. We know what is going on. We see the reality of what is
              happening, and we have determined to do something about it,
              irrespective of our party label — whether we be DUP, Ulster
              Unionist, UK Unionist, United Unionist, Northern Ireland Unionist,
              or part of the mass of Unionists who simply see the realpolitik in
              this building and outside and want a change. They have said
              &quot;We do not like what we see. We do not want the status
              quo.&quot;</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have said here many times and outside the
              Chamber a thousand times that we do not want the status quo. Why?
              Because the status quo has brought us to where we are today. We
              want a dynamic, determined, confident, assertive Unionism,
              whatever its label, whatever party we belong to. We want that to
              enable us to bring about change for our people and for the
              Nationalist community so that together we can go towards the
              future and put the past behind us.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I rise today not with any sense of pleasure but
              with a very heavy heart. When looking at this report and the two
              motions that flow from it, I am reminded very much of the
              proverbial curate’s egg.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will turn briefly to the part of the report
              which I find quite reasonable. If we are to put up with the
              necessary nonsense of a Civic Forum, the proposals are quite
              reasonable, though not ideal. Therefore, I have no reason to
              object to item 4 on the Order Paper and will be supporting it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, anyone who knows about the substance
              of a curate’s egg, knows that it has good parts and bad parts.
              The whole point of a curate’s egg is that the bad parts make the
              whole egg rotten — which brings me to the business motion. I
              will be opposing that motion today and supporting the DUP
              amendment. I will be doing so because I believe that it is a
              dangerous motion — and I am not referring here to the number of
              Government Departments, though my preference would be for six or
              seven Departments only.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are criticisms that can be levelled at
              the make-up of those Departments that have been suggested. They
              may not create the best administrative system for Northern
              Ireland, but in themselves they are not dangerous to the Union.
              What is profoundly dangerous in passing this motion and in making
              the determination today is that it will place Sinn Féin/IRA
              closer to the heart of Government and remove one of the most vital
              barriers between it and executive power.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In days of yore in ancient Rome, the great fear
              of the citizens was that the citadel would be invaded from outside
              by barbarians. The phrase often used was that the barbarians
              &quot;rapped the gate&quot;. Today we find ourselves defending the
              citadel of democracy in a not dissimilar position. I will not
              compare any of the parties opposite to barbarians, because, given
              some of the vicious things that have gone on in Northern Ireland,
              to do so would be to insult barbarians.<i> [Interruption]</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nevertheless, in defending the citadel of
              democracy at this vital moment the effect of passing the
              determination will be to remove the guard that is there for the
              Assembly. Take it away, and you put at the gate, as the barrier
              between Sinn Féin’s getting into government and its being kept
              out, the Secretary of State. She will be the guardian, and I do
              not have faith in her to defend our democracy. The only remaining
              option for citizens faced with being overrun by barbarians is to
              destroy the citadel itself — and that is not a good strategy for
              Unionists.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not, here today, question the sincerity of
              my Colleagues who will presumably vote in favour of this. I do not
              question either their integrity or their motives — I know that
              they are of the highest level. What I do question is their
              judgement on these tactics. What is to be gained by passing this
              determination?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It has been said that this determination has to
              be passed to enable the various administrative acts to go ahead in
              preparation for devolution. That is not the case. Section 2.4 of
              the report indicates that the administrative work in setting up
              the Departments has already started. The number of Departments was
              confirmed by the Privy Council on 10&nbsp;February, and those
              Departments will come into effect on the day appointed for
              devolution. Thus the necessary administrative work will not be
              affected by whether this business motion is passed or not. We are
              correctly informed that before devolution can occur, there has to
              be some form of determination. I do not doubt that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As indicated by Mr&nbsp;Foster earlier, the
              circumstances are not appropriate at present for setting up an
              executive. Surely we should wait until the circumstances are
              appropriate before we formally pass any determination. If the
              circumstances were appropriate, we would be in a position to pass
              a determination within a matter of days. It strikes me that to
              pass it at this time would be foolish.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have been told that the stopgap measure
              offers an opportunity for a review of the whole process. We have
              been told by the Taoiseach — and we have no reason to doubt the
              Taoiseach’s word because he is a man who is consistent — that
              if we reach a review stage, nothing can really change. We have
              also been told this by Members opposite, particularly those on the
              SDLP&nbsp;Benches, and to be fair to them they have always been
              completely straight on this issue. We are going to vote on the
              agreement, and this is what is going to go through.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In any event, if we enter into that review
              having made the determination, we will be throwing away one of the
              Assembly’s strongest cards — the final veto over the
              establishment of an executive, when that is by no means necessary.
              We will be handing over to the Secretary of State who will, via
              the Standing Orders, have complete control over its establishment
              and the timing of its establishment.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we take the course of action that is
              proposed in the DUP amendment and reject the determination, we
              would not be passing any judgement on the nature of the
              Departments. All the preparatory work can go ahead so that were we
              to reach the situation in which we were ready for devolution, that
              could happen.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We would be sending a very clear message to the
              Government that the Assembly will not tolerate terrorists in
              government under any circumstances. We would be sending a clear
              message that no one could misunderstand.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In any form of politics there are times when
              the dictates of one’s party conflict with matters that one
              believes to be vital to the good governance of the country. This
              is one such occasion, and in all conscience I will vote against
              the determination because it is entirely inappropriate.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members should note that however things go
              between now and March or in the future, this will be the last
              opportunity for individual Assembly Members to voice their concern
              on this issue. Once the motion is passed, individual Assembly
              Members will not have that opportunity again.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My good friend Dr&nbsp;Birnie — whether he
              will want to claim that description is another matter; if I am
              going down perhaps I can take him with me — quoted
              Stanley&nbsp;Baldwin, who said that power without responsibility
              was the prerogative of the harlot throughout the ages. At that
              time there was another quote of which I do not know the source,
              and I fear that it will come into play if we accept the motion. We
              will be left with responsibility without power, which has been the
              prerogative of the eunuch throughout the ages. I urge Members not
              to be the eunuch but to take a stand by voting no to the motion
              and supporting the amendment.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report sets out the blueprint for the
              future of Northern&nbsp;Ireland and its relationship with its
              neighbours. It is the culmination of months, indeed years, of hard
              work, and I pay tribute to those Members who worked hard to bring
              us to this stage in the political process.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is my wish and without doubt the desire of
              the vast majority of people of both traditions that this day will
              mark a new beginning, a new style of politics and a new kind of
              democracy. Not everyone has welcomed the report with open hands.
              Some are apprehensive and a few are openly hostile, but we must be
              prepared for that, because politics should be about taking risks,
              meeting challenges and overcoming difficulties. It is certainly
              not about running away or about coming here with a sound bite for
              the media, and nothing more. <i>[Interruption]</i> I remind DUP
              Members that when they were speaking I gave them the courtesy of
              silence. I hope that Mr Robinson hears me. <i>[Interruption]</p>

              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dallat:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Change does not come easy to many people. We
              have a long history of resisting change, not only in politics, but
              in many aspects of our daily lives. Some Members came here today
              by motor car. One or two arrived in chauffeur-driven limousines,
              and perhaps Sammy&nbsp;Wilson came on his motorbike. In the last
              century when the motor car made its debut, someone walked in front
              with a red flag to warn of the dangers. In such circumstances some
              Members might have arrived with a green flag in front.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Just as the motor car has turned out to be safe
              if handled properly, let us hope that the new style of politics
              proposed in this report will be accepted — even if we continue
              to argue about the colour of the flag.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.45 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We cannot continue on horseback, because we are
              going nowhere fast. Members must face the future, uncertain as it
              may be, and we must stop putting obstacles that will prevent
              political progress in the way. In the engineering world, people
              from these Northern Counties influenced a rapidly changing world
              with their inventions. People like Harry&nbsp;Ferguson, John Boyd
              Dunlop and many others did not turn away just because someone in
              Parliament said &quot;You must confine your motor car to five
              miles per hour, and you must have someone walking in front with a
              red flag.&quot;</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Members debate this report the world is
              moving on, away from the engineering world which I have reflected
              upon and on to a new world of science and technology. That is the
              immediate challenge facing Members. Just as there were great
              innovators eager to encourage change in the past, there are many
              splendid people in the universities and the world of work today
              who have the knowledge and skills to put Northern Ireland back on
              the map. Their work has been seriously hindered by the continued
              political instability, and it is our task to do something
              constructive about that. Are Members prepared to be constructive
              or will we continue to live in the past with our little flags the
              only security we have to offer? I hope not.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Over the past few months Members have had an
              opportunity to focus on the political problems of the North and
              concentrate their minds on possible solutions. We know that the
              New Assembly must target social need, influence economic
              development and encourage cultural diversity. There will be
              10&nbsp;Government Departments as well as the six implementation
              bodies to do just that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members have a duty and a responsibility to
              ensure that education and training is appropriate to today’s
              needs and those of tomorrow. If Northern Ireland is to compete in
              the ever-changing world of science and new technology, much has to
              be done to make up for the neglect of the past. Members cannot
              walk away from this responsibility merely because they disagree on
              a timescale for redressing decommissioning or whatever.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Northern Ireland has been through hell for
              30&nbsp;years. Is the two-year timescale for sorting out these
              problems too much to live with? Progress in matters such as
              decommissioning is important; it will help reduce fear and
              mistrust, and Members who can influence progress have a
              responsibility to do so.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But there are other issues to be faced, and the
              most fundamental is the ability to trust each other and, in turn,
              to encourage the wider community to do likewise.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the Assembly there are encouraging signs
              that people from different backgrounds are making a genuine effort
              to stretch out the hand of friendship. Slowly but surely they have
              begun the process of building bridges and have set about laying
              the foundations of a new future built on mutual respect and a
              growing sense of confidence. This process is the greatest weapon
              to ensure that never again will politics fail. Is it too much to
              ask that Members ensure that people can continue to build bridges,
              create trust and show leadership?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Returning to the report before us, let us
              welcome it enthusiastically so that we can at last begin to
              address the very serious problems in the Health Service, deal with
              the shortcomings in education and tackle social injustice in all
              its forms, particularly unemployment.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Over the last nine months, I have had the
              chance to meet many people, many involved in the world of business
              and commerce, others running the various Government agencies or
              holding down key positions in our universities and places of
              higher education. I have also met a multiplicity of people
              involved in the community sector working both in a voluntary and
              statutory capacity. All of them are dedicated people who have
              ideas for the future and some will, no doubt, become members of
              the Civic Forum where they can assist and support the Assembly in
              its work.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How can I, or anyone else, go back to these
              people to tell them that we have failed? We cannot do it, and if
              those who say they are opposed to the report were honest with
              themselves, they could not do it either. They are waiting for
              someone else to blink, to give way so that they can run to the
              battery of cameras outside screaming &quot;Sell-out&quot;.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For political expediency, they want to gamble
              with the lives and future prosperity of our people. They do not
              care about the Health Service, the failings in our education
              system or the plight of the ordinary working-class people of this
              Province who have no jobs and no hope.</p>

              frustrated and returns to doing what it does best. <i>[Interruption]</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I appeal to Ulster Unionists to stand by their
              manifesto pledges and rejoin us as we strive for the return of
              true democracy in Northern&nbsp;Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What has changed between 1974 and 1999? In
              1974, Unionists stood firm and united to oppose the executive
              interference of Dublin, through the Council of Ireland, in the
              internal affairs of Northern Ireland. In 1999, some Unionists
              support executive inference by Dublin, through the proposed
              North/South bodies. In 1974, it was proposed to establish an
              Executive based on a wholly unrepresentative and undemocratic
              Nationalist-to-Unionist ratio of 50:50. In 1999, some of the
              people who opposed this body 25 years ago are now supporting
              exactly the same proposal. In the past 30 years, however, more
              than 3,500 lives have been lost in this country in our attempts to
              preserve freedom and justice.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those who support the ratification of this
              treacherous report say that it is the only way forward, if we do
              not want the murders and mutilations to resume. We are here today
              because of that violence, not because we are participating in a
              genuinely democratic process. For the time being, Gerry Adams,
              Martin McGuinness and their murderous colleagues are satisfied
              with the concessions that have been made. But their strategy means
              that they will inevitably return to terror when these concessions
              cease. The peace of which these men speak is not based on
              compromise or on mutual respect but will be possible only when
              there is a united Ireland. Only then will they cease to have any
              quasi-political reasons for murdering Unionist people.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We all welcome investment in Northern Ireland,
              and the jobs and prosperity that go with it. However, what
              precluded peace and prosperity in the past was violent terrorism.
              There has been huge destruction of both life and property. The
              only path to peace and stability is to remove guns and explosives
              from the situation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sinn Féin/IRA demands that all sides carry out
              decommissioning — not just paramilitary organisations but also
              the legitimate forces of law and order in Northern Ireland, (the
              RUC and the British Army). If Sinn Féin were genuine in its wish
              for equality, it should demand that the Irish Army decommission.
              In 1969, this Army gathered at the border, in a blatantly
              provocative operation to &quot;defend&quot; one section of this
              community. They should be part of Sinn Féin’s equation. They
              could decommission a few tanks, to start with — that is if they
              have any. Perhaps the Irish Navy could scuttle a gunboat or two.
              That might stop them from illegally boarding British fishing
              vessels from Portavogie and Kilkeel in British waters.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sinn Féin/IRA never stops talking about
              equality, but what about equality for the victims of their search
              for &quot;peace&quot;? What about the thousands of families and
              friends who have been robbed of their loved ones? When will we
              hear Gerry Adams stand up for the rights of the victims of the
              IRA? On 12 September last year, troops made a last symbolic patrol
              on the streets of Belfast before withdrawing to barracks. Yet the
              activities of all the paramilitary organisations have shown no
              signs of diminishing whatsoever. People are still being maimed by
              the weapons which the IRA and other groups continue to hold.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the end of September last year, soldiers of
              the Royal Irish Regiment stationed along the border had their
              personal protection weapons decommissioned. Perhaps the IRA could
              give their defenceless victims a week’s notice of their
              assassination, so that they can pop down to the barracks and sign
              out a personal protection weapon</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rumours about an escalation in Republican
              terrorism in those areas have substance. This is an ongoing
              problem for the security forces who, in spite of the supposed
              peace, are once again wearing flak jackets.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.00 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The IRA has yet to decommission one single
              round of ammunition. There can be few families in the Province
              which have not been touched by the deadly, cold hand of terrorism.
              While the Unionist and the Protestant people have felt the brunt
              of IRA violence, it is often forgotten that the organisation which
              was singularly responsible for the deaths of most Roman Catholics
              during the past 30 years was the IRA — the so-called protectors
              of Nationalists.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Two victims in particular come to mind. First,
              Kenneth Smyth, a UDR sergeant — my cousin — murdered on 10
              December 1971, and, secondly, his colleague, Daniel McCormick, an
              ex-UDR soldier. Kenneth Smyth had been a B-Special; he was a UDR
              sergeant and a Protestant. Daniel McCormick had been in the UDR;
              he was a Roman Catholic, who left behind three young children.
              That is an example of a Protestant and a Roman Catholic both
              defending their country and both murdered by the IRA. As on most
              occasions throughout the troubles, the murderers simply made their
              way back to the sanctuary and confessional box of the Irish
              Republic.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some people see fit to question the integrity
              of the security forces because of their religious make-up. The
              fate of the two brave men that I have mentioned can only be a
              major factor in this.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will list some details of the terror that we
              had in the month of January to give Members some idea of what
              these boys are up to in their spare time. They seem to be pretty
              busy: 15 shootings, 35 beatings, 65&nbsp;exiles and 69
              intimidations — 184 incidents, six for every day in January.
              These incidents took place, behind backs, in Holywood, Bangor,
              Cookstown, Londonderry, Dungannon, throughout Belfast and all over
              the place — an ongoing plan of terror against the good people of
              this Province. That is a phenomenal set of figures and makes
              interesting reading considering that we are meant to have peace.
              The conclusion of the peace process should have been peace, but
              that has not happened. There is not even a basis, a framework, or
              a foundation for peace of any sort.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All that Members have succeeded in getting is a
              growing list of demands from Gerry Adams and his pan-Nationalist
              colleagues. When one considers that it is estimated that the IRA
              has been responsible for over 1,000 knee-cappings and other forms
              of torture, which have left people maimed or disabled, one can
              really grasp the true spirit in which these people operate.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sinn Fein/IRA has continually reaffirmed its
              pledge never to decommission, while in the same breath it, and its
              political masters, demand the destruction of the gallant Royal
              Ulster Constabulary and the decimation of the criminal justice
              system. This is the accountable democracy that certain politicians
              love to eulogise about. Thanks, but no thanks.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Armed terrorists cannot be allowed to take up
              positions through which they can dictate how we should run our
              lives when, for over 30 years, they have done their very best to
              destroy those lives. To do so would be to abandon every principle
              of freedom and justice that we have ever stood to defend and
              protect.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Gerry Adams was reported in a recent newspaper
              interview as having said that hundreds of people who would
              otherwise have died in the conflict are alive and well today
              because of these endeavours. He seemed to be implying that had not
              the ongoing concessions process offered up sufficient gains to
              satisfy the insatiable tapeworm appetite of pan-Nationalists, his
              colleagues would have killed hundreds more people in protest.
              Gerry Adams makes it crystal clear that that is what would have
              occurred, and he is saying that if his demands are not met, this
              is what will happen in future.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is blatantly obvious that this Executive,
              this report, the agreement and this whole process are in no way
              accountable to the people of Northern Ireland, who have paid the
              price for a 30-year campaign of terror waged against them. On the
              contrary, it is based simply on the whim of those who were
              responsible for 30 years of violence, people who were, and still
              are, committed to the destruction of this country.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These people retain every ounce and bullet of
              their weapons capability to enable them to recommence their terror
              campaign, and their words indicate that that is what they intend
              to do, yet this report proposes to give them seats in the
              Executive of the Assembly, to see the destruction of Northern
              Ireland from within. At the same time, Dublin is given the first
              tentative reins of executive power over us.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other Members have referred to their children.
              I am the father of three young boys, and I will be doing my best
              for them by taking this stand. It is for them and for the
              thousands of other children that the DUP takes a stand, and it is
              for the children and the grandchildren that we urge Unionists not
              to support this report. It is a total travesty of justice and
              represents a profound adulteration of all democratic principles.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This report must on no account be ratified, and
              I urge every democrat in the House to take the resolute action
              which is necessary to restore democracy to Northern Ireland and
              vote this report into the annals of history. This could be the day
              that Unionists recaptured their Unionism.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr J Kelly:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A Chathaoirligh, we have heard all morning, and
              into the afternoon, about decommissioning. I contend that the
              issue which is central to the success of this agreement is not
              decommissioning but a commitment to equality in all its strands.
              Equality is at the core of this present peace process.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One has only to reflect back to 1985, to the
              Anglo-Irish Agreement, when there was no Sinn Féin, no
              decommissioning, no guns outside the door, inside the door or
              under the table. There was only the SDLP and the Alliance Party,
              and mainstream Unionism could not bring itself to share power with
              those constituents at that time. It is not about decommissioning,
              a Chathaoirligh, it is about equality.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sinn Féin has campaigned strongly for a
              Department to deal with equality issues and we will continue to do
              so. We will continue to do so, a Chathaoirligh, because equality
              must be cardinal in the governance of the Six Counties, and a
              dedicated Department is the only way of beginning to do that. The
              equality agenda must be developed on an all-Ireland basis. We need
              to demand the same level of equality promised in the agreement for
              the 26 Counties as for the Six Counties.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Equality is a right for all our people, North
              and South, Protestant and Catholic, men and women, black and
              white. Recognising this truth is the first step towards cherishing
              all of the children of the nation equally.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A Chathaoirligh, during the 18 January
              discussions on the report from the First Minister (Designate) and
              Deputy First Minister (Designate) Sinn Féin strongly criticised
              the proposal to locate the responsibility for the equality agenda
              within the office of the First Minister (Designate) and the Deputy
              First Minister (Designate). We did so, A Chathaoirligh, because
              even now, 30&nbsp;years after the Civil Rights Movement began its
              campaign to end discrimination, and after 25&nbsp;years of fair
              employment legislation, Nationalists are 2·2 times more likely to
              be unemployed than Unionists. This is why Sinn Féin puts such
              store by the equality agenda and the establishment of a Department
              to deal with it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Neither the Unionist parties nor the British
              Government, with their proven track record, can be fully trusted
              to deliver on equality unless it is open and subject to public
              scrutiny on an ongoing basis. In that context, A Chathaoirligh,
              Sean&nbsp;Farren, speaking on behalf of the SDLP in an earlier
              discussion, indicated support for our call for a scrutiny
              Committee. Unfortunately we have not had any further details of
              this proposal placed before us today. We hope that this is not an
              empty promise, and I invite the First Minister (Designate) or the
              Deputy First Minister (Designate) to share their thoughts on this
              vitally important matter with us in their concluding comments.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A Chathaoirligh, those who advocated placing
              responsibility for the equality agenda under the influence of
              David&nbsp;Trimble have clearly disregarded his inability, thus
              far, to act impartially on issues of equality. The most glaring
              example of this lack of impartial perspective is his support for
              the Orange Order and other Loyalists in their attempts to trample
              over the rights of the Nationalist residents of the Garvaghy&nbsp;Road.
              He too has persistently refused to meet with the residents or
              their elected representatives even though they are his
              constituents.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We believe that the SDLP has advanced the
              rather disingenuous argument that Unionists would take control of
              the equality Department under the d’Hondt system and apply a
              dead-hand policy to prevent any implementation of equality
              policies. The SDLP, in making this argument to journalists and to
              ourselves, appears to accept that the Unionist parties will
              continue to behave in the discriminatory fashion that has
              characterised their attitudes in councils throughout the North
              over the years.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Discrimination must be confronted, a
              Chathaoirligh, and the parties in this Assembly must set their
              faces against any practice that discriminates against any section
              of our community. This is the basis of the Good Friday Agreement
              and the new political beginning that we all signed up to.
              Discriminatory policies and practices —</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr A Maginness:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Member agree that the SDLP’s
              position is to be preferred in relation to equality since this is
              not the province of one individual Minister? Rather it is a
              cross-departmental matter that is controlled, directed and
              inspired from the centre by the First Minister (Designate) and the
              Deputy First Minister (Designate), a much more effective means of
              equality-proofing the policies of the future administration.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr J Kelly:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The short answer is no. The reason — if I may
              continue — is that this is the basis of the Good Friday
              Agreement and the new political beginning that we all signed up
              to. Discriminatory policies and practices have distorted the
              political landscape in the North for many generations, and the
              Assembly should make it clear that that situation will no longer
              be tolerated.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should, indeed, go further and ensure that
              there is no room for those who would discriminate or for those who
              would return to the bad old practice of Unionist domination and
              the denial of rights to Republicans or Nationalists or, indeed,
              Unionists. The argument that the matter of equality would become a
              battleground if placed in a separate Department ignores the fact
              that equality will be a battleground in any case.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is better to have a dedicated Department
              with a cross-party scrutiny Committee than to let the issues
              become an ongoing bone of contention between the First Minister
              (Designate) and the Deputy First Minister (Designate) at the
              centre or, alternatively, to ignore or long-finger them in order
              to avoid dissension. If equality is placed at the centre and then
              ignored or treated with less importance than other issues, we will
              all come under severe criticism from a community that will feel
              let down in respect of the promise made to it by the agreement.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister (Designate) and the Deputy
              First Minister (Designate) can play an arbiter’s role in any
              dispute between Departments on this matter. They cannot be
              independent arbiters of their own Department. Equality in all of
              its dimensions is a critical element of the peace process and
              cannot be left to the vagaries of internal Unionist political
              dynamics. Equality of treatment, in all walks of life, has long
              been a central plank of Sinn Féin’s political agenda. Equality,
              and the eradication of discrimination, are central to the building
              of a stable and cohesive society.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Paragraph 3, under the heading &quot;Human
              Rights&quot;, in the Rights, Safeguards and Equality of
              Opportunity section of the Good Friday Agreement, sets out a mode
              of working for public bodies which will be very different from the
              relationship that such bodies have had with the public until now.
              New Departments with new Ministers will need a great deal of help,
              advice and encouragement if we are to set out proper work
              practices from the outset. A new Department of the centre will
              simply not be able to give sufficient weight to this along with
              its other responsibilities in the early months.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In overseeing the new statutory duty on public
              bodies, both inside and outside the Assembly, an Equality
              Department could have worked successfully with the new Equality
              Commission, thus creating a strong internal and external mechanism
              for bringing about equality.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There can be no lasting political settlement
              which is not built on a solid foundation of equality. This is a
              fundamental democratic right which must be seen to be being
              delivered, and the most transparent manner by which that could be
              achieved is through an independent Department of Equality which
              was subject to examination by a cross-party scrutiny committee.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Good Friday Agreement, a Chathaoirligh, was
              heralded as the beginning of the end of our shared history of
              misery, conflict, violence and grief. Throughout the island of
              Ireland our people have welcomed and voted to support the
              political accommodations and compromises that were so
              painstakingly negotiated over so many months. In all of this, a
              key concept — possibly the key concept — has been equality.
              The brave new beginning that the people of Ireland voted for, the
              democratic society that we are attempting to create, can only be
              built on the most solid foundations of equality.</p>

              </i><b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs E Bell:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, I would like to concur with the remarks
              of my Colleague Mr&nbsp;Neeson on the report as a whole. However,
              I will concentrate on the proposals for the Civic Forum. The
              Alliance Party will be supporting the report of the First and
              Deputy First Ministers (Designate) as we are very keen to see this
              Forum established. We do have some concerns over certain aspects
              of the proposals, and I will outline them now.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First of all, I would like to take the
              opportunity, as a member of the consultative sub-group, to thank
              all those organisations and individuals who made submissions. As a
              local representative and a community activist, I can appreciate
              the need for the Civic Forum, and I do hope it will be set up as
              quickly as possible. The development of civil society in
              Northern&nbsp;Ireland, and the Assembly’s interaction with it,
              are fundamental requirements upon which to build on the foundation
              laid by the agreement. The Civic Forum can complement the
              institutions of representative democracy and provide a greater
              sense of legitimacy to their decisions. It should not, and will
              not if it is set up effectively, threaten anyone. It is accepted
              that the Civic Forum should be consultative; nevertheless, there
              is great scope for its having a substantive and innovative role
              that will complement the Assembly.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Civic Forum should be encouraged to look at
              cross-sectoral, inter-departmental themes. It could initiate new
              strategic thinking, bring forward fresh ideas and show policy
              creativity in areas where the Assembly would perhaps not be so
              flexible. There are a number of policy areas in which it would
              have important things to say — for example, on sustainable
              development, social inclusion and the competitiveness of
              Northern&nbsp;Ireland. It could also play a useful role in
              addressing society’s divisions and help to promote
              reconciliation, and we need that. It is noteworthy that we in
              Northern&nbsp;Ireland are lucky to have a large part of civic
              society organised on cross-community lines.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This report, at times, bears no resemblance to
              the areas in our sub-group report, and I am sorry about that.
              Comments and suggestions made by all parties have been left out,
              and those omissions take away from the credibility of the report.
              It is disappointing that the First and Deputy First Ministers
              (Designate) have not reflected the hopes expressed by myself and
              others for the success of the Civic Forum — sometimes even their
              own hopes.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important that the Assembly take the
              Civic Forum seriously. The Civic Forum should act largely on the
              basis of matters referred to it by the Assembly, and it should
              have a useful role to play in commenting on any programme of
              action coming from the Executive — if we ever get that far.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report is not clear about whether the Forum
              will have the ability to raise matters on its own initiative, nor
              is it clear on the relationship that should be built up between
              the Assembly and the Civic Forum.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am also concerned about the proposed
              nomination process for the 60 members. It should not just comprise
              the great and the good, although those people have made a
              contribution, they have been to the forefront of the voluntary,
              community, trade unionist and commercial worlds; but it should
              also include people who have worked long and hard in dreadful
              conditions and without recognition. They have had a great effect
              on their own communities and on Northern&nbsp;Ireland in general.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am therefore concerned that the First and
              Deputy First Ministers (Designate) have the authority to nominate
              six personal choices. That was never suggested to us in the
              sub-group. We have heard a number of Members expressing concern
              that the UUP and the SDLP have taken too much power onto
              themselves. It is vital that this Forum maximise, as far as is
              possible, the diversity of opinion in Northern&nbsp;Ireland. We
              would lose an opportunity were we not to do it. I therefore ask
              the First and Deputy First Ministers (Designate) that information
              be given to us with regard to the criteria for nominating these
              six direct appointees. There must be no chance of marginalisation
              of any group or section, and no preference should be given. The
              rigid division of the make-up of the different sectors is,
              perhaps, overly inflexible. I hope that no significant groups have
              slipped between the cracks and, as a consequence, will feel
              aggrieved.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am also unclear as to what was meant by the
              First Minister (Designate) when he said that they would have
              oversight of the nominations. Does that mean that the public will
              nominate these individuals for selection by the First and Deputy
              First Ministers? Or will they select them after they have
              discussed it with them and reached an agreement as to who they
              would put forward? Oversight is not enough. We must be clear
              regarding the line of selection and nomination.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do hope that paragraph 10(2) will be adhered
              to: that the evolution of the Forum will produce an ongoing
              monitoring programme in the remit of the proposed subcommittee
              that is mentioned. The review must be effective and constructive
              to ensure the maintenance of a Civic Forum that represents truly
              the rich and diverse civic society that abounds in
              Northern&nbsp;Ireland. After the proposed review of 12&nbsp;months
              they can have an ongoing monitoring programme by way of a proper
              and effective review. It will be like the Assembly, an evolving
              thing. It is new.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are starting off from a completely new
              scenario, and in the Civic Forum we must take all the advantages
              of the work that has been done in society over the years. We have
              had more than enough of majority rule in Northern&nbsp;Ireland, so
              politicians and citizens must now go forward to build an
              equitable, responsible, accountable and truly inclusive
              Northern&nbsp;Ireland. The Civic Forum must be equipped to do this
              and to proceed with the confidence and the respect of the
              Assembly.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr O’Connor:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Tony&nbsp;Blair stated at the time of the Good
              Friday Agreement that he felt the hand of history on his shoulder.
              Twenty-five years after the collapse of the Sunningdale Agreement,
              history must not be allowed to repeat itself. This process is not
              perfect, but it gives us the best chance in 25&nbsp;years to
              deliver good, accountable government to the people of
              Northern&nbsp;Ireland on the issues that really matter — health,
              education, jobs and economic development.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As we consider the contents of the document
              before us, we must make that step forward. The overwhelming
              majority of the people voted for that accountable government, and
              we must deliver it to them. The determination must be made to
              agree the numbers on departmental responsibilities in order to be
              able to take this process forward and be ready to assume power on
              the appointed day.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The agreement is a principled compromise which
              allows Nationalists and Unionists an equal say in the way our
              country is to be governed. It is fitting, therefore, that an
              Executive should reflect this equity by having 10&nbsp;Ministers
              and 10 Departments. By having five Nationalist Ministers and five
              Unionist Ministers we will have to work together for the good of
              all the people.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some people have suggested seven ministerial
              Departments: four Unionist and three Nationalist. This would be a
              perversion of the election. The combined first preference vote of
              Nationalists and Republicans for the SDLP and Sinn&nbsp;Féin was
              320,821. The combined first-preference vote for the Ulster
              Unionist Party and the DUP was 318,142. It is inconceivable that
              with Nationalists and Republicans achieving more votes at the
              polls than the DUP or UUP, the process should be gerrymandered to
              allow Nationalists less representation on an Executive. That would
              be totally unjust. The designation of the 10&nbsp;Departments
              provides many overlaps, thus making it necessary for all the
              Ministers to work together collectively for the good of all the
              people.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the proposals for the Civic Forum. I
              pay tribute to the six parties which took part in the round-table
              discussions on it. The Civic Forum is very important in that it
              will complement the Assembly. It will act as a valuable
              consultative body, and its membership will be inclusive. All
              sections of the people will be represented through industry, trade
              unions and voluntary organisations.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Kelly, a Sinn&nbsp;Féin Member for Mid
              Ulster, touched on the Equality Department and why his party felt
              that it was necessary to have a separate Equality Department. I
              welcome the fact that the Equality Department is being retained
              within the office of First and Deputy First Ministers. It is much
              too important an issue to be the remit of one Minister.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;Kelly said that the Unionists, the
              British, could not be trusted with equality. That is exactly why
              it cannot be the remit of either a Nationalist or a Unionist. It
              is much more important than that. By retaining it within the
              office of the First and Deputy First Minister, each can police the
              situation for the benefit of both Nationalist and Unionist; they
              can ensure that equality is a real issue in each of the
              10&nbsp;Departments, and it is not sidelined. The political
              integrity of the whole equality issue will be maintained as long
              as it stays at the centre.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There can be no blaming Unionists for doing
              this or Nationalists that. By retaining it within the collective
              office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister, we ensure
              that it is dealt with correctly.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Every Member is responsible for ensuring the
              full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. Within the
              agreement parties must use their influences to achieve full
              decommissioning of all illegal weapons by May 2000. This is still
              the case. The Deputy First Minister (Designate) has said that if
              it does not happen he will vote to exclude those who do not fulfil
              these obligations from ministerial office, and I support him in
              this.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But today violence in our streets has subsided.
              People now focus on punishment beatings. They are terrible and an
              abuse of human rights. We all accept that. But people are walking
              our streets today who would not otherwise be. Before the
              ceasefires between 80 and 100 people lost their lives through
              terrorist violence each year. Since the ceasefires in 1994, there
              are between 300 and 400 people alive in this country who would not
              be otherwise. This is something that we should not lose sight of.
              Had only one person been still alive, this whole process would
              still have been worthwhile and to suggest otherwise is total
              nonsense.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many Members have talked about decommissioning,
              including the decommissioning of guns. Perhaps some of them —
              those former members of the Ulster Resistance — would use their
              influence to ensure that the illegally held weapons brought in
              from South Africa are also decommissioned.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.30 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I remind the House that guns do not kill
              people. People kill people. Guns are sometimes used, but the
              weapon can be a knife, a hammer or a crowbar. It is far better to
              decommission the mindset that makes people want to kill. That can
              be achieved through the democratic process in which we are
              engaged. By listening and learning from each other we can build
              the trust that will move this society forward.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I should like to finish my maiden speech by

              </font></b><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have had a useful debate in which many of
              the issues that surround the report have been well aired. Perhaps
              it has not been as colourful as the debate on 18 January. Mr&nbsp;Mallon
              has not been flying his aeroplane, and Mr&nbsp;Close has not been
              pushing his wheelbarrow, but we have dealt with some of the
              issues.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Two aspects of the report have been skirted.
              The Ulster Unionists have been guilty of that because they fear
              where the report will take them, and Members of other parties have
              done it because they know that the contents of this report, the
              compromise as they call it, is not the essence of good government
              for Northern&nbsp;Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will use a metaphor which I am sure Members,
              and especially Sinn Féin Members, will understand. The report is
              a political time bomb that people started to construct in
              December. Bringing the report to the Assembly has put in place its
              timing mechanism, and the leader of Sinn Féin has said &quot;When
              we take the vote, we will trigger that mechanism.&quot; Perhaps he
              knows all about triggering mechanisms.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister (Designate) has told us that
              we then simply hand it to the Secretary of State to do as she
              wants. She has no intention of defusing that bomb if things do not
              go the way that the Ulster Unionists think they should go. It will
              explode and destroy democracy and the Union because it will blow
              into government members of Sinn Féin/IRA.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not care what we have heard from Members
              of Sinn Féin in the debate. Gerry&nbsp;Adams spoke about being
              concerned that there was no Minister for children. Many were left
              as orphans by the work of his organisation. Gerry Adams also
              talked about there being no special provision for the elderly,
              many of whom have lived all their adult lives in the shadow of the
              gun and the bomb, and perhaps lost loved ones as a result. Sinn
              Féin portrays this new image, which was probably just as
              nauseating on the television upstairs as it was in the Chamber.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">David&nbsp;Ervine turned all his bile on DUP
              Members because they dared to highlight the true nature and
              affiliations of Sinn Féin. I do not regard him as a traitor.
              However, I do regard him as a sad case, who comes from the
              Unionist community and spends the 10 minutes he has in the
              Assembly attacking fellow Unionists and defending Sinn Féin. You
              would think that he might have learnt by now — the man who gave
              Gerry&nbsp;Adams the benefit of the doubt at the time of Canary
              Wharf. You would think he would have learnt by now not to trust
              IRA/Sinn Féin.<i> [Interruption]</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will come to the Member in a minute. I do not
              want him to feel left out.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have this new face of Sinn Féin — Martin
              &nbsp;McGuinness tells us he is offended because when he walks
              along the corridors in this building, David &nbsp;Trimble will not
              say &quot;Hello&quot; to him. Of course, he does not say
              &quot;Hello&quot; to half of his own party, so it really does not
              make much of a difference. This is the new sensitive face, the
              caring face, of Sinn Féin that is being presented — they plant
              trees instead of bombs, and we are supposed to think that this is
              progress. Well, I do not believe it is progress to set in train a
              string of events which will place people who still wish to retain
              their arsenal in a government.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second thing I wish to say is this: quite a
              lot of Members have mentioned aspects of this report which they do
              not like. It is not a report set for good or efficient government
              — it was never designed for that. The First Minister said that
              it had been his aim to have seven Departments, and indeed Members
              of his own party have said that more than seven Departments were
              unnecessary. Anyone who wanted more than seven departments just
              wanted to get his snout in the trough. Yet the First Minister
              (Designate) said that he gave up the idea of seven Departments not
              because it would be good for efficient government but because it
              gave him a negotiating tool. We have finished up now with 10
              Departments which will cost the taxpayers £90&nbsp;million and
              give us a form of government which is most inefficient.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People have asked why the DUP did not put
              forward proposals. We did. We said that there was nobody in the
              House who had any experience of government in Northern Ireland in
              the past and that, rather than jump in with both feet, we should
              start with what we had. Then, if we needed to expand Government
              Departments after we had learnt about how they operated, we could
              do that later. But, oh no. Now we have a set of new Government
              Departments.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let me talk about something that was mentioned
              this morning. The education and library boards will now find
              themselves responsible not to one Minister but to three Ministers.
              For schools, it will be the Minister for Education; for student
              support, the Minister for Higher Education; and for libraries the
              Minister for Culture, Arts and Leisure. Is that going to lead to
              better government? In no other part of the United Kingdom are, for
              example, schools and libraries separated.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have got a programme which the Department of
              Education has been promoting and which I understand all parties in
              the Assembly have been promoting — Education for Life-long
              Learning. The whole essence of this programme is that we have an
              integrated system of education. Libraries, schools and further
              education are all integrated. What has this report done? This
              report has fragmented that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also have some knowledge of planning. In
              England, unitary authorities are being set up because it has been
              recognized that it is a nonsense to separate development control
              from strategic planning. What does this report do? It separates
              strategic planning from development control, and transport
              planning, urban planning, social regeneration and social
              development are elsewhere. Three elements of planning are in three
              different departments&nbsp;— and this is supposed to give us
              more efficient government.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Indeed, some of the report’s authors do not
              have a clue about what is meant by some of the terms. I always
              understood &quot;sustainable development&quot; to encompass all
              aspects of government — where one integrates it, and where one
              plans to make sure that communities are sustainable. Therefore one
              has to make sure that schools, roads and housing, for instance,
              are in the right location. Sustainable development is a kind of
              overarching concept in planning, yet it has been stuck into one
              department. I suppose the rest of those engaged in planning will
              feel that it is not their responsibility.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I could go on, but I do not have much time.
              Were Assembly Members to be honest with themselves, they would
              recognise this report for what it is — a piece of political
              chicanery and nothing to do with effective government. That is why
              we will be rejecting it.</p>

              was that he did not read from a prepared text. All Members of the

              order, and I shall make two responses to it. First, should Members
              wish this to be included as a note in Standing Orders, the proper
              thing to do would be to bring it to the attention of the Committee
              on Standing Orders. It is constructing the draft Standing Orders
              which I hope will be presented to this Chamber fairly soon. Should
              it be included in Standing Orders, I hope that Members will also
              indicate how the matter might be policed — for the sake of
              myself or whoever else is in the Chair. Secondly, in the absence
              of a Standing Order, should the Member concerned be very persuaded
              by the value of speeches being produced with the tremendous
              vitality and enthusiasm of his Colleague, he could perhaps draw
              that to the attention of some of his other Colleagues who have
              perhaps been a little less impressive.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A Chathaoirligh. First, I give today’s report
              a qualified welcome. It is a welcome if belated step forward in
              the political process towards setting up the Executive and the
              all-Ireland bodies. My Colleagues have been outlining our party’s
              concerns with this report and I share those concerns, especially
              with regard to the placing of equality in the centre. Equality and
              human rights provisions were central to the Good Friday Agreement.
              Outside the confines of this Assembly, equality and human rights
              have been scarce commodities in Portadown. The small Nationalist
              community in that town has endured more than seven months of an
              orchestrated campaign of sectarian terror and intimidation carried
              out by the Orange Order and its supporters.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since last July there have been more than
              150&nbsp;protests and demonstrations, most of them illegal, held
              by the Orange Order and Loyalists in the town. These have been
              carried out on an almost nightly basis, effectively corralling the
              small Nationalist community centred on the Garvaghy Road into
              their homes. The Nationalist population of Portadown cannot go
              about their normal, everyday business in the town. They cannot
              shop, go to the bank or to the post office or visit the local
              leisure centre for fear that they will be attacked and beaten.
              Those areas are out of bounds to them. Loyalists have verbally and
              physically abused schoolchildren whose uniform marks them out as
              Catholics. The case of Robert Hamill —</p>

              absence — that Members had to confine their remarks to the
              issues that are contained in the motions on the Order Paper. It is

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is against the background of the shameful
              events in Portadown that the failure to implement the Good Friday
              Agreement is set. The continuing political vacuum, caused by the
              failure of Unionism to deal with Nationalism on the basis of
              equality, is the reason for the crisis in Portadown.
              David&nbsp;Trimble, despite his roles as MP and Assembly Member
              for the area and the First Minister (Designate), has consistently
              refused to meet the representatives of the Garvaghy Road
              community. His latest refusal occurred just last week.
              David&nbsp;Trimble is a member of the Orange Order, and he should
              use his influence to halt the organised campaign of violence that
              is being carried out by the Orange Order in Portadown.</p>

              responsibility of the First Minister (Designate) and the Deputy
              First Minister (Designate). How does Mr&nbsp;Trimble propose to
              ensure that the people of the Garvaghy&nbsp;Road are treated with
              equality, given that he refuses to speak to them?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That community has a right to expect
              Mr&nbsp;Trimble to ensure that their rights are protected. The
              Good Friday Agreement, under the section Rights, Safeguards and
              Equality of Opportunity, states that the parties to the agreement
              affirm the right to freedom from sectarian harassment. From July,
              events in Portadown show the inability of Unionism to live up to
              the Good Friday Agreement. Those events also call into question
              the ability of the First Minister (Designate) to treat
              Nationalists on a basis of equality. Peace requires change that is
              based on equality, justice, human rights and respect.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is time to stop Unionist terror and violence
              in Portadown. David&nbsp;Trimble has the power and influence to
              end the Nationalist nightmare in that town and to resolve the
              crisis in the political process and set about the implementation
              of the Executive. If he is serious about peace and sincere in his
              desire to create a new political atmosphere, he must act and act
              quickly.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report from the First Minister (Designate)
              and the Deputy First Minister (Designate), which has been put to
              the Assembly for a determination by a cross-community vote, feeds
              into the Armalite and ballot box strategy of Sinn Féin/IRA. The
              report does not even mention the word &quot;decommissioning&quot;.
              This means that in its negotiations since July 1998 on the detail
              of the Belfast Agreement, the UUP leadership has failed to
              incorporate into this report the logic of its own understanding of
              the agreement, that the agreement requires the decommissioning of
              the IRA’s terrorist arsenal as a condition of Sinn Féin’s
              taking its seats in the Executive. The failure to build this into
              the report as an explicit requirement for Sinn Féin’s
              participation in the Executive amounts to total capitulation on
              the part of the UUP negotiators to what Mr Adams, in the politics
              of Irish freedom, has called &quot;the vital cutting edge&quot; of
              the Republican movement.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The UUP negotiators have also capitulated to
              what Mr Adams refers to as &quot;the non-armed forms of political
              struggle&quot;. The reason for this is that the UUP negotiators
              have conceded the full Nationalist demand for the number of seats
              in the Executive. The result of this UUP capitulation is that the
              role of Sinn Féin/IRA in the Government of Northern Ireland and
              in the North/South Ministerial Council has been maximised. The
              overall import of the report can be seen with brutal clarity: the
              UUP negotiators, in agreeing this report, have finalised the
              retreat that they have been making throughout the period of the
              so-called peace process from virtually every position of strategic
              significance for Unionism. This means that, in the terms of the
              Belfast Agreement and the detail of this report, the UUP
              negotiators have capitulated to a moral and political indignity of
              almost unbelievable proportions.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The terms of the Belfast Agreement and this
              report provide for the citizens of Northern Ireland to be governed
              by the architects and activists of the Republican terrorism that
              has been directed against them for 30 years while the IRA
              maintains its terrorist arsenal and organisational structures
              intact.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is why no Member authentically committed
              to democracy and to the integrity of the rule of law could
              possibly vote for this report. But the UUP position is that the
              report should be agreed by a cross-community determination and
              then either &quot;parked&quot; or &quot;reviewed&quot; in case the
              IRA refuses to decommission its terrorist arsenal. The problem
              with both these proposals — apart from their inherent ambiguity
              — is that they are not provided for as options in the terms of
              the agreement.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is nothing in the agreement that provides
              for a &quot;parking&quot; of the implementation of the agreement,
              whatever that term may mean. There are certainly no provisions in
              the agreement for a &quot;review&quot; in the case of a refusal on
              the part of the IRA to decommission its terrorist arsenal. These
              considerations mean that any attempt to &quot;park&quot; or
              &quot;review&quot; the agreement would not have the support of
              either the Government of the United Kingdom or the Government of
              the Republic.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The ultimate strategic blunder on the part of
              Mr&nbsp;Trimble in putting the report to a determination is that
              he will either split his own party or the determination will have
              cross-community support. But in the event of cross-community
              support, the political initiative will pass immediately to a
              Secretary of State whose commitment to Irish unity is set out in
              unambiguous detail in a Labour Party policy document entitled ‘Towards
              a United Ireland’, which was co-authored by Mo Mowlam. The
              determination of the report would mean that the introduction of
              the Standing Orders to trigger the d’Hondt mechanism to seat
              Sinn Féin/IRA in the Executive would be entirely at the
              discretion of a Secretary of State committed to Irish unity.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Secretary of State would then have to make
              a choice between &quot;facing down&quot; Unionist opposition to
              the seating of Sinn Féin in the Executive without IRA
              decommissioning or a return to terrorism on the part of the IRA.
              The choice of the Secretary of State is entirely predictable,
              since the whole political rationale of the agreement is to meet
              the requirements of Sinn Féin/IRA for what the Mitchell Report
              describes as &quot;taking the gun out of Irish politics&quot;. If
              need be, this means that the Secretary of State would almost
              certainly choose the option of neutralising any attempt to
              &quot;park&quot; the implementation of the agreement, particularly
              in the wake of the entire detail of the agreement’s being
              accepted in a cross-community vote in the Assembly. A Unionist
              vote supporting the report would therefore amount to a virtually
              irretrievable strategic blunder.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The consent principle in the agreement would
              provide no protection to Unionists once the Rubicon of accepting
              this report was crossed. The reason for this is twofold.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, the consent principle in the agreement
              relates only to the issue of the final choice for Irish unity.
              Secondly, the consent principle in the agreement is not based on
              recognition of the legitimacy of Unionism. On the contrary, the
              repeated references in the agreement to &quot;the people of the
              island of Ireland&quot; and their right to self-determination
              concedes a fundamental point of Irish Nationalism — that there
              is a single nation or people on the island of Ireland. Ulster
              Unionists who took part in the negotiations leading to the
              agreement were, obviously, unaware that by making this concession
              to a fundamental tenet of Irish Nationalism they were undermining
              entirely the legitimacy of Unionism and the status of Northern
              Ireland within the Union.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The consent principle mentioned in the
              agreement is not related to any recognition of Unionism but is a
              purely pragmatic requirement for political stability in a united
              Ireland. This separation between the principle of consent and the
              legitimacy of Unionism is a fundamental element in the attitude of
              Irish Nationalism to Unionist consent. It can also be seen in
              Dr&nbsp;Mowlam’s policy document ‘Towards a United Ireland’.
              This view is that, since Unionism is itself devoid of legitimacy,
              Unionists have no right of veto over how their consent to Irish
              unity — or any other issue — is obtained.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The logic of this position is developed in
              detail by Mr&nbsp;John&nbsp;Hume in his book ‘Personal Views’.
              Mr&nbsp;Hume’s central thesis is that the recognition of
              successive British Governments of Unionists’ right to veto with
              regard to Irish unity was the fundamental cause of the last 30
              years of terrorism in Northern Ireland. Mr&nbsp;Hume turns the
              victim into the culprit and is prepared to follow through
              unambiguously in the logic of his view on what he calls the
              Unionist veto. His position is that, if coercion is required to
              obtain Unionist consent, then Unionists must be coerced. This
              means that if this report were given cross-community support while
              its implementation is &quot;parked&quot; Mr&nbsp;Hume would not
              align the SDLP with those who demand that the IRA should
              decommission its terrorist arsenal before Sinn Féin can take
              seats in an executive. On the contrary, Mr Hume would, almost
              certainly, see such a situation as an appropriate opportunity
              finally to &quot;lance the Protestant boil&quot;.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The presentation of this report to the Assembly
              brings Northern Ireland to the edge of the Union. The Unionist
              electorate should, therefore, take this moment to evaluate their
              leaders coolly, avoiding both political disorientation and
              defeatism. In short, they must avoid doing what some
              self-proclaimed leaders of Unionism have done. I take no pleasure
              in the development of this point.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the debate on this report the leader of
              the UKUP set out his reasons for opposing it, just a few days
              after his party conference had indulged in the political
              tomfoolery of conferring honorary life membership on Dr Conor
              Cruise O’Brien. Dr O’Brien is now an unqualified advocate of
              old-style Irish unity. The argument set out in the final chapter
              of his memoirs is that Unionists have no option but to negotiate
              their status as Protestants in a united Ireland. Dr O’Brien
              dismissed the Union as a mere abstraction and argues that his plan
              for Irish unity would put the IRA out of business. That is indeed
              the case, as Dr&nbsp;O’Brien’s plan would concede to the IRA
              everything for which they have terrorised the Unionist community
              for 30 years.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The political disorientation of the UKUP under
              Mr&nbsp;McCartney’s leadership is such that the author of a plan
              for Irish unity, involving the appeasement on a massive scale of
              IRA terrorism, has been reinstated to the party as an honorary
              life member just a few months after I, with the support of my
              Assembly Colleagues, and in the face of opposition from
              Mr&nbsp;McCartney, forced him to resign.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This insight into the politics of the UKUP is
              entirely relevant to the current situation. A vote to approve the
              determination of the structures proposed in this report would
              precipitate a crisis for the Union not seen since 1912. That is
              why I appeal to UUP Members to vote against the report. If this
              report is accepted on a cross-community vote, the first task for
              the Unionist electorate will be to deal with Unionist leaders who
              have nothing more to commend them than a lethal combination of
              strategic ineptitude and political stupidity at a time of serious
              crisis for the Union.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First of all, I advise Mr&nbsp;Roche to read
              more carefully what Mr Hume wrote, because he has been quite
              selective in his dissertation on Mr&nbsp;Hume’s views. He might
              also recognise that it was the SDLP, under John Hume’s
              leadership, that was the first party on these islands to write the
              word &quot;consent&quot; into its Constitution.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.00 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report is the culmination of a lengthy
              process of negotiation and consultation among the parties in the
              Assembly, and it represents yet another step in the implementation
              of the Good Friday Agreement. Let no one forget that this
              agreement has the support of three out of four people in Northern
              Ireland and 85% of the people of this island. Those people voted
              for an agreement which they understood to be a compromise, an
              accommodation requiring give and take on all sides. They have a
              right to see the agreement working, and all of us in the Assembly
              share the responsibility to fully implement the Good Friday
              Agreement to the letter and, as Seamus&nbsp;Mallon said earlier,
              in spirit.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The setting up of Departments, as proposed in
              the report, will allow Members, as democratically elected
              representatives, to influence in a practical and accountable way
              the important decisions which affect the lives of their
              constituents. It will put an end to situations, such as the one
              which arose last week, when the Government, having announced an
              injection of resources for pre-school education last year,
              summarily changed their mind and reallocated the resources
              elsewhere. Members do not know what priorities influenced this
              volte-face; we do not know why the money was reallocated, and
              Members had no say in the matter. That is an intolerable
              situation, one which can be remedied when Members take the next
              step of assuming the right to influence and make decisions on
              these important issues themselves.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I listened to the tired old rhetoric of the
              past from some of the Benches in the corner opposite. Members
              heard the usual attempts to represent the proposition — and
              indeed the whole agreement — as a danger to the Unionist
              identity. Dr Paisley raised the question of victims of violence
              — an understandably emotive issue, unfortunately affecting all
              sections of society. However, the real question is how can Members
              ensure that there will be no more victims of violence. By raising
              the temperature and, unnecessarily, the fears of the Unionist
              community — and we know, from people such as David Ervine, the
              effect that that has had in Northern Ireland in the past — do
              Dr&nbsp;Paisley and the DUP think that that is going to do
              anything to ensure that there will be no more victims of violence?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The agreement which is being implemented, and
              which I hope will continue to be implemented, is about achieving a
              situation where there are no more victims of violence and where
              Members can change the face of this community. Sammy&nbsp;Wilson
              talked about past atrocities and about blighted and lost lives. I
              want to know what contribution he and his party have made to bring
              about the changes which will ensure that no more lives will be
              blighted or lost. I have not seen that contribution to date.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The leaders of the political parties in this
              Chamber (John&nbsp;Hume, David&nbsp;Trimble, Gerry&nbsp;Adams and
              David&nbsp;Ervine — all of them) have taken risks when it was
              necessary, risks to move away from past attitudes. They have seen
              the option of sticking with past attitudes and where that has
              brought the community. I do not need to illustrate it; we have
              seen it all around us for the last 30 years. They have seen this
              and have taken the option of taking risks, moving forward and
              changing the face of this community. This is why, as Danny O’Connor
              said, &quot;We are where we are and not where we used to be.&quot;</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">May I remind the pro-agreement parties that we
              need to rededicate and recommit ourselves to what we signed up to
              and what the people supported:</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;We, the participants in the multi-party
              negotiations, believe that the agreement we have negotiated offers
              a truly historic opportunity for a new beginning. The tragedies of
              the past have left a deep and profoundly regrettable legacy of
              suffering. We must never forget those who have died or who have
              been injured, and their families. But we can best honour them
              through a fresh start, in which we firmly dedicate ourselves to
              the achievement of reconciliation, tolerance, and mutual trust,
              and to the protection and vindication of the human rights of all.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We pledge that we will, in good faith, work to
              ensure the success of each and every one of the arrangements to be
              established under this agreement.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What we need to do is to concentrate on the
              commitment we have made and ensure that we deliver on it. Each of
              us needs to concentrate on what we can deliver, not what the
              others must deliver.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have firmly committed ourselves to achieving
              mutual trust. Decommissioning has been raised time and time again.
              The issue of decommissioning is about establishing mutual trust.
              It is about building confidence. To rephrase a statement made by
              the late John&nbsp;F&nbsp;Kennedy, it is not about what we can do
              for ourselves but what we can do for others. It is about what we
              can do for the agreement and not what the agreement can do for us.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The agreement is the people’s agreement. I
              have not heard people from either side of the community saying
              that they are desperately concerned about decommissioning. Of
              course decommissioning is an issue, but what people are really
              desperately concerned about is that this agreement should be made
              to work and that it should be implemented as agreed. That means
              everyone playing his part in achieving that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, I want to see decommissioning. My
              party wants to see decommissioning. The people want to see
              decommissioning, and I want to ask the Democratic Unionist Party
              in particular how they are going to bring about decommissioning
              outside of this agreement which they are opposed to and which they
              want to see ended. How are they going to do it? It has not been
              achieved in 30&nbsp;years.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Seamus&nbsp;Mallon rightly said this morning
              that the only vehicle we have for bringing about decommissioning
              is the Good Friday Agreement. If we want it to happen then each of
              us will play our part in implementing that agreement, in building
              the necessary confidence and trust to make sure that we can
              implement it. We cannot implement it and work together in a
              government where that trust is not built. It is a matter for each
              of us to build each other’s confidence.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I leave Members with those thoughts and support
              the motion as another step in implementing the will of the people
              of Ireland and the people of Northern&nbsp;Ireland.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Paisley Jnr:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A number of questions arise out of this debate
              today. A number of questions must be heavy on the minds of
              Members, no matter what section of the Assembly they come from.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is Northern Ireland ready for self-government?
              Of course, every democrat would say that Northern&nbsp;Ireland
              deserves self-government. Northern&nbsp;Ireland should never have
              lost its own parliament in the past. It should never have lost the
              opportunity to govern itself and the citizens of
              Northern&nbsp;Ireland. However, with that question comes a solemn
              responsibility. What type of self-government does
              Northern&nbsp;Ireland want? What type of self-government does
              Northern&nbsp;Ireland deserve?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the report offered by the First Minister
              (Designate) and the Deputy First Minister (Designate) there is
              nothing resembling good and stable government for the people of
              Northern&nbsp;Ireland. My Colleague Sammy&nbsp;Wilson went through
              the report looking at each Department and pointing out the
              ramshackle arrangement of the various Departments. It does not
              make sense.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is not only the Democratic Unionist Party
              that has taken this view about the structure of government in
              Northern&nbsp;Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Leading members of the Ulster Unionist Party,
              people such as Ken&nbsp;Maginnis, have said that this is the worst
              example of snouts in the trough — old Fianna Fáilism —
              politics that he has ever seen. Other leading Members, who could
              by no means be described as belonging to the &quot;no camp&quot;
              of Unionism, have said that it is a waste of £96 million of
              Government resources. If that is their view — and they are in
              favour of the agreement — then how can they expect my party,
              which is critical of this report, to agree with its contents?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Just this morning, Mr&nbsp;Trimble’s office
              passed around corrections to pages that were not in the original
              report. The accurate report shows us the way in which this
              oligarchical structure has been designed. Indeed, in the Office of
              the First Minister (Designate) and the Deputy First Minister
              (Designate) there are something like 27 areas of responsibility
              — three times the size of any other Department. They really
              trust their friends, you know! They are not prepared to dish out
              any of this responsibility to anything, to anyone, or to any other
              Member, even to those in their own party.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The only other Department which comes close,
              with 14 areas of responsibility, is either John&nbsp;Taylor’s or
              Reg&nbsp;Empey’s Department — the Enterprise, Trade and
              Investment Department — and there will have to be a political
              carve-up in that one. Mr&nbsp;Trimble’s Office has
              responsibility for freedom of information. Imagine that, when it
              cannot even arrange for this information to be disseminated among
              Members in good time.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Going through the report, many Members,
              including Eileen&nbsp;Bell of the Alliance Party, dwelt heavily on
              the issue of consultative —</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Haughey:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The logic of Mr&nbsp;Sammy&nbsp;Wilson’s
              intervention was that there should really be only one Department
              of Government. The logic of Mr&nbsp;Paisley’s intervention now
              appears to be that there should be 143 Departments of Government
              since each Government Department, as set out in the report, is
              packed with far too many responsibilities.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Paisley Jnr:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member for Mid Ulster is just being silly.
              He should listen to what some of his Colleagues in his new
              coalition shadow Executive have been saying — one of the
              Back-Benchers in the Ulster Unionist Party made it clear that with
              six Ministers in Northern Ireland, we would have three too many.
              Three could perform the task of administering Northern Ireland
              adequately. This is the view of the people with whom he wishes to
              share power.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the consultative Civic Forum,
              the share-out of responsibilities is unbelievable — our largest
              industry gets a minority position on this body. The
              voluntary/community sector — that sector of failed or aspiring
              politicians — gets the greatest number of representatives in
              Northern&nbsp;Ireland. That is a shame, and this consultative
              Civic Forum will be a waste of space and a waste of resources.
              Northern&nbsp;Ireland will have about 168 legislators and advisors
              when other areas of the United Kingdom, which are considerably
              larger, will have less than half that number to administer those
              areas.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On ‘Good Morning, Ulster’ this morning,
              Mr&nbsp;Trimble said that this was not a significant day by any
              means and that today’s vote does not really matter. If this is
              such an insignificant vote, why can the Ulster Unionist Whips not
              lay off their Members? Why can they not say that today there will
              be a free vote for all of the Ulster Unionist Members? I would
              like to see just how many would vote for this report then. In
              their election manifesto the Ulster Unionists made a very straight
              commitment — they said that they did not wish to sit in a
              Government with unreconstructed terrorists. This report will usher
              those very unreconstructed terrorists into government, as
              Mr&nbsp;Weir said earlier today, and I agree with his view.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The euphoria of 1998 is evaporating — we can
              see that all around us in Northern Ireland. Look at the recent
              poll findings in the ‘Belfast Telegraph’. A total of 84% of
              respondents said that they wanted the decommissioning of all
              terrorist weapons immediately. A massive 93% of Protestants, and
              almost 70% of Catholics, said that they wanted decommissioning to
              start straight away.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.15 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I notice that Ms Rodgers, who is a touchstone
              of Unionist opinion, does not seem to know that 70% of the
              community that she comes from want decommissioning right away. On
              day four of this survey it went on to say that four out of five
              people — over 83% of the population of Northern Ireland — want
              the early release of prisoners stopped. This deal is currently
              unravelling, and it is doing so on issues that we predicted.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Then, of course, there are the negotiators of
              the Belfast Agreement who told us this was the best deal possible
              but who are now running away from that deal. People such as Ken
              Maginnis, who boasted that he had negotiated the Police Commission
              for Northern Ireland, last Friday distanced himself from it and
              said he wanted nothing more to do with it. If that is the best
              they can offer us, dear help this country.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Secretary of State should realise that what
              she sows in Northern Ireland she will reap, not just in Northern
              Ireland, but right across the United Kingdom. She will reap what
              she sows when people bow not to democracy only to terror and she
              realises that, as has been happening in Northern Ireland for too
              long, coffins are being put in the ground across the entire United
              Kingdom. Instead of leading us towards a situation where peace
              ought to come about, this Government is taking us back to a
              situation where peace can never come about.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I listened carefully to many of the speeches.
              Mr&nbsp;Trimble said there were functions missed out of the 18
              January report, and it has taken until now to include them. Of
              course there were functions missed out. The most glaring omission
              in this report is the absence of any mention of decommissioning
              — it has not got a look in. Mr Trimble must have been really
              embarrassed yesterday whenever he was shown up by Bertie Ahern who
              dared to mention decommissioning, while he has been running away
              from it and not daring to mention it in his reports.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister (Designate), Mr&nbsp;Mallon,
              said that we have overcome the difficulties. The only reason he is
              able to say that the difficulties have been overcome is that he
              has avoided including decommissioning in this report; he has
              avoided grappling with that issue; he has avoided tugging that
              little flower that he said he wanted to tug.</p>

              today — that within this agreement and this report there is no
              prospect of decommissioning either. Everyone must face that
              reality — and I wish we all could. There is not the slightest
              chance of our seeing decommissioning coming out of this report or
              this agreement.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Farren, in his little gambit to be a
              Minister in Northern Ireland, said that there was no alternative.
              There are countless alternatives to this agreement but none which
              will suit the Provisional IRA, and that is why Sinn Féin/IRA are
              for this agreement. That is the reality. There is no mention of
              decommissioning in this report.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I say to the Back-Bench Unionists that they
              should not put their faith in Bertie Ahern; they should not vote
              for this because Bertie Ahern says he will give them some support
              further on down the road. They cannot trust his words. They should
              not put their eggs in Bertie Ahern’s Fianna Fáil basket; they
              should put them in the basket of Unionism; they should stay with
              Unionism today and give it the endorsement it requires.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a Chathaoirligh. I was
              absorbed in the Reverend’s young son’s rhetoric.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to address Section 5 of the report which
              deals with the setting up of the Civic Forum. Sinn&nbsp;Féin
              subscribes to and supports the setting up of the Civic Forum. We
              have made constructive and positive inputs through our full and
              active engagement in the working party set up to bring forward
              proposals to the First Minister (Designate) and the Deputy First
              Minister (Designate). Over the weeks of its deliberations Sinn
              Féin brought forward comprehensive proposals for the setting up
              of a Civic Forum. During those deliberations we flagged up a
              number of concerns such as representation, nomination bodies,
              remit — all the issues which have the potential to make the
              Civic Forum a truly representative body reflecting civic society.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We were concerned lest the Civic Forum become a
              performing poodle. We note that some of our concerns have been
              addressed in the final report. However, we are disappointed that
              this report today contains fundamental flaws and falls far short
              of producing a body that will address the democratic deficit and
              its effect on civic society that 50&nbsp;years of Unionist misrule
              and 30&nbsp;years of direct British misrule have given us.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sinn&nbsp;Féin believes that our proposals for
              the development of a Civic Forum would address the democratic
              deficit, complement the work of the Assembly, add to the quality
              of decision-making and be not only consultative but innovative as
              well. Sinn&nbsp;Féin set out proposals which we hoped would
              impact on civic society by structuring the Civic Forum in such a
              way that it would provide the potential for establishing a new
              relationship between people and politicians — a bridge from the
              community to the Assembly.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the working party we argued for quality time
              for the Civic Forum, more and wider consultation, equality of
              representation, the core principles of accessibility, transparency
              and accountability. We promoted and encouraged the concept that
              the Civic Forum, by embracing core democratic values, could become
              a dynamic body influencing and contributing to the process of real
              change.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our proposal for setting up Comhdháil an
              Phobail, the people’s forum based on constituency panels
              connecting directly with local Assembly representatives, had the
              overall aim of providing an effective and expert structure to the
              Assembly on development, policy performance, legislation and
              administration. We argued and will continue to argue that such a
              structure would be preferable, in terms of democratic
              participation, to an exclusive and predetermined clutch of
              organisations designed to meet the needs of the First and the
              Deputy First Ministers (Designate) in meeting the needs of civic
              society. Constituency panels would also ensure an effective
              mechanism, not only for equality proofing and maximising
              representation, but also for providing a sound basis for debates,
              drawing upon the knowledge of those who are expert in any given
              area of discussion.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some of our concerns have been addressed in the
              report, but there are still areas where we have serious
              misgivings. We argued in the sub-group for a further period of
              more extended consultation to address the concerns and the
              suspicions in the broader community that the Civic Forum would be
              nothing more than a body of the great and the good, already well
              represented in civic society — a sort of Trimble and Mallon fan
              club.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Despite these concerns Sinn Féin has struggled
              to uphold the principles which underpin the agreement and to
              devise mechanisms for developing the Civic Forum which are
              consistent with the core principles of equality, accessibility,
              transparency and accountability. It is for those who have
              participated in the formulation and endorsing of the report to
              explain, not only to the Assembly but also to the pro-agreement
              public, how precisely this report can overcome the inherent and
              fundamental flaw which gives ultimate control of selection, remit
              and representation of the Civic Forum to the First and Deputy
              First Ministers (Designate).</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No matter what the recommendations of the
              sub-group, the invitation to the umbrella groups, the process of
              selecting the voluntary community sector, the public
              advertisement, appointments, and so on, at the end of it all the
              First and Deputy First Ministers (Designate) — not the Assembly
              — will hand-pick 60&nbsp;individuals. This will be a
              double-edged sword for them. In terms of equality proofing the
              buck stops with the First and Deputy First Ministers (Designate).
              Despite the fact that it allows for review after a year in terms
              of the Civic Forum delivering what everyone expects of it —
              participative democracy — this report falls far short of such
              expectations.</p>

              secondary to the opinion of the First Minister (Designate) who, it

              agreement the First Minister (Designate) hoped that his inactivity
              and hostile approach to it would make it disappear — like other
              issues in the agreement which he did not like, but signed up to.
              But it did not. Indeed, the UUP’s submission contained in the

              Minister (Designate) and Deputy First Minister (Designate).</p>

              continues to say &quot;No&quot;, refused to participate in the

              democracy, which it keeps shouting about here. It is called
              political cowardliness.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A Chathaoirligh, I raised my party’s concerns

              First Minister (Designate) and the Deputy First Minister
              (Designate) represented a narrow cross-section of civic society. I
              raised the issues of quangos, which are actually given the
              authority to nominate members to the Forum. I asked time and time
              again for consultation to be extended to incorporate the opinions
              and ideas on the Civic Forum of marginalised and excluded
              communities.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This report does not accommodate such
              communities, unless the additional six representatives which the
              First Minister (Designate) and the Deputy First Minister
              (Designate) have slipped in, outside the recommendations of the
              sub-group, will be drawn from those excluded by the report — for
              example, ex-prisoners, travellers, grass-roots community economic
              organisations, human rights groups and victims of state violence.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is more likely that the additional 10% of
              the Forum, the magnificent six appointed by the First Minister
              (Designate) and the Deputy First Minister (Designate), will be the
              friends of friends — the great and the good; a Civic Forum
              quango in what is supposed to be a consultative body.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nevertheless, the Civic Forum will be set up,
              and we in Sinn&nbsp;Féin will give it our critical support. It
              will be up to the First Minister (Designate) and the Deputy First
              Minister (Designate) to demonstrate that the Civic Forum will be
              explicitly, directly and systematically equality-proofed.
              Sinn&nbsp;Féin will continue to press for a Civic Forum which

              soldiers of the First World War. The interesting thing about those
              soldiers was that irrespective of whether they came from North or
              South, or whether they were Catholic or Protestant, and although
              they fought in the one army, they fought for different political
              objectives and from two different political perspectives. A
              further interesting thing about the card was the name of the group
              that designed this monument, and I know that the Member for North
              Down, Sir&nbsp;John&nbsp;Gorman, was actively involved in that

              Trust, and it struck me today that we are also on a journey of
              reconciliation. Without that key goal in mind, the Assembly will
              fail because it exists, not for our entertainment or for political
              point scoring, but for the creation of genuine reconciliation in
              this society. The report is an attempt to create a structure and a
              network in which reconciliation can take place. We have
              constructed an Executive that has built into it power-sharing
              between the two communities and among all the Assembly’s
              political parties.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have a unique opportunity to develop that
              theme of reconciliation. Today is a good day for reconciliation
              because the report provides a vehicle for that. I note the sneers
              from DUP Members when I mention reconciliation. I am used to that
              and to the negativity of the DUP. Its corner of the Chamber should
              be called &quot;No corner&quot; because the DUP represents the
              biggest negative in our politics. Its attitude to the report
              entirely reflects its negativity. Its Members are the no-men. They

              in the House?</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am talking about a situation where we all
              have an opportunity to rebuild this community. The DUP is not
              taking that opportunity because it is so negative in its attitude
              to everything at present. And the problem for some people is that
              they made a mistake about a year or 18 months ago when they
              refused to go back into the negotiations. Now they are left in a
              situation in which we have an agreement which has the support, not
              just of the political parties that signed it, but of the vast
              majority of people in Northern&nbsp;Ireland, and, indeed, in the
              whole of Ireland. Their boycott, negativity and abstentionism have
              brought them into the cul-de-sac that David&nbsp;Ervine has
              rightly described them as being in, and they cannot get out of it
              without losing face. But if they had had a leadership that was
              brave enough and imaginative, they would have got out of it long
              before now.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The people who are giving leadership in the
              community are Seamus&nbsp;Mallon and David&nbsp;Trimble. Through
              today’s report they have provided — <i>[Interruption]</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not surprised at this layabout attitude
              coming from those Benches. The problem with them is that they have
              narrow minds, and worse than that, they have withered hearts. They
              have neither the bigness nor the generosity to get on with
              rebuilding the community and trying to repair its divisions and
              wounds.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today we have a report that provides a way
              forward. It creates institutions of government that are innovative
              and imaginative. The Department of Social Development, for
              example, will do much to help a community that suffers from
              multiple deprivation. The creation of a Department for Regional
              Development will do likewise, in terms of developing our resources
              in the community and providing a new infrastructure as we approach
              the new millennium.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition, we will have a Department which
              will ally Higher Education with Training and Employment. That is
              innovative and a major step forward. We will also have a
              Department of Enterprise, Trade and Development that will create a
              new basis for industry and commerce in the community. And that is
              what we need because the public sector here, which employs 40% of
              the total workforce, is too big. By developing an alternative
              enterprise-based economy and culture here we can do much to
              develop our human resources and physical and natural resources.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is why this is a good day for the people
              of Northern&nbsp;Ireland. Members who sneer at this report have
              nothing at all to put in its place. This report provides us with a
              common way forward. It provides the basis for sufficient trust in
              the community, and all the major political parties here who are
              dedicated to rebuilding the community can help to build on that
              together.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many Members have talked about time running
              out, about there being little hope and about people despairing.
              Between little hope and despair there lies an ocean of
              opportunity. We have that ocean of opportunity. Let us now embark
              on that journey of reconciliation, through that ocean of
              opportunity, and provide for our children in the years to come.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Carrick:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will first pick up on a comment which the
              Deputy First Minister (Designate) made this morning. I was quite
              mystified when he referred to the fact that there would be no
              decommissioning outside of the agreement. I wonder if the thought
              ever crossed his mind that a straightforward solution would be
              simply to do the proper and honourable thing: renounce terrorism
              as a means of obtaining a political objective, dismantle the war
              machine and disband the terrorist organisations and decommission
              all the weaponry. Sometimes we are guilty of overlooking the
              obvious, but I would have thought that that was a fairly obvious
              solution to the problem.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Comment was also made today in relation to
              democracy and the core democratic values that we all should be
              embracing. I remind Members that the graves of the murdered cry
              out this evening for justice and for equality. No doubt this
              evening the families of the victims marvel at the hypocrisy of
              some Members’ contributions today.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As elected public representatives, we have a
              duty to provide stable and credible government for the citizens of
              Northern&nbsp;Ireland, and the establishment of a local
              accountable Assembly is an objective that all democrats can
              identify with. And the machinery for achieving that consists of
              free and fair elections. The problem is that, as a result of the
              Belfast Agreement and the subsequent legislation, which the DUP
              opposed, we have a mongrel form of Administration. This hybrid
              system of government was of course devised to placate Republican
              terrorists and other terrorists who want to have their cake and
              eat it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To put it another way, those wedded to
              terrorism succeeded in the talks process in duping the other
              negotiators by pretending to follow the democratic path, yet they
              had no intention of abandoning the terror tactic. Hence, today we
              have a report brought about by an agreement, the aim of which is
              to accommodate unrepentant terrorists and which is designed to
              ensnare Unionism in a web of Irish Nationalism, leading eventually
              to a united Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The whole exercise of establishing local
              accountable democracy, as envisaged in this report, is seriously
              flawed, operating, as it has to, on the basis of the Belfast
              Agreement. And it lacks democratic credibility while
              representatives of terror remain in the Chamber of democracy.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the weekend I heard Members express fears
              about a retreat from the agreement and its possible consequences.
              But I have never heard the same passionate calls for a retreat
              from terrorism, punishment beatings, the tools of terrorism, or
              the threat of terrorism. Democracy cannot afford to be polluted by
              terrorism or the threat of terrorism which this report contains.
              Those who believe in the purely democratic process have great
              difficulty with the diluted system incorporating pretend democrats
              and unrepentant terrorists.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another element of the Belfast Agreement is the
              establishment of the consultative Civic Forum. This is another
              deviation from true democracy. The system of appointees and the
              concept of quangos are contrary to proper accountable democracy.
              There is no substitute for democratically elected public
              representatives. The Belfast Agreement, however reprehensible it
              is, makes provision for such a Civic Forum, and, with all its
              intrinsic weaknesses, that will become a reality.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.45 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It must also be said that, as far as
              consultation with groups and individuals is concerned, the
              facility is normally afforded to Government committees to access
              information and expertise by meeting such delegations as and when
              required.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I must also state that no Member has a monopoly
              on wisdom, knowledge or ideas. There are valuable contributions to
              be made by those outside this Chamber from all walks of life.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Civic Forum, under the Belfast Agreement,
              is a fait accompli. It is essential, in the interests of fairness,
              equity and justice, that representation on such a body should
              reflect the community as much as possible, but it is questionable
              whether such fair representation can be achieved under these
              proposals.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, according to the proposals before us,
              the health sector, which is vital in Northern&nbsp;Ireland, is not
              to be represented. As my Colleague Gregory&nbsp;Campbell pointed
              out, there will be no representation for local government either.
              Secondly, nominations by the First Minister (Designate) and the
              Deputy First Minister (Designate) are a further manifestation of
              the undemocratic nature of the proposed forum. Thirdly, the
              appointment of the chairperson to the Civic Forum by the First
              Minister (Designate) and the Deputy First Minister (Designate) is
              further evidence of the manipulation and the contrived democratic
              process that we have to experience. Fourthly, the victims of
              terrorism are clearly going to be under-represented in the Civic
              Forum and will once again find themselves victimised and
              discriminated against.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Hence, we will have, under these proposals, a
              defective and deficient Civic Forum, a conclusion that is
              inevitable for all true democrats, especially given the other
              elements of the report and particularly the absence of any
              reference to decommissioning or dismantling of the Irish
              Republican war machine.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I appeal to my Colleagues in all shades of
              Unionism to vote against this report. This report, if adopted,
              will be damaging not only to the Unionist position but to the
              Union itself, and I will be voting against it.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In relation to the system for nominating
              Members to the Civic Forum, I hope that victims of British state
              violence will be given a strong voice, because this category of
              victim has been denied a voice for too long. There must be an
              equivalency of victim status, an equality of grief, and an
              equality of memory. There must be no hierarchy of victims, no
              distinctions drawn between those, on whatever side, who have died
              because of this conflict.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I expect that when it comes to nominating
              sporting appointees to the Civic Forum the Gaelic Athletic
              Association, the largest sporting organisation in this country,
              will be given due recognition for its contribution and importance
              in every county the length and breadth of this island, and for its
              contribution to society generally. If the Sports Council does not
              see fit to nominate someone from a Gaelic athletic background then
              I hope that the First and Deputy First Ministers (Designate) will
              nominate such an appointee.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should be getting on with our work. Anxious
              communities are waiting with bated breath for a more considerate,
              more local, more relevant and understanding policy approach to
              many issues. This can be done only by politicians who come from
              this country and not from England, Scotland or Wales.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In relation to hospitals, the Health Service,
              rural schools and, as we approach the new millennium, the issue of
              connecting rural homes to a water supply, I look forward to
              working with the Department for Regional Development. Those are
              crucial issues on which English, Scottish and Welsh Ministers have
              never done a proper job. Let us do a proper job on those matters
              because we understand our own country best. Let us remember that
              we have to give political and institutional effect to what the
              people have said. Eighty-five per cent of the people of this

              that it is proper for a Member to bring into the building, and

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to respond to that point of order,
              as it may obviate the need to respond to others. If it does not, I
              will take the other points of order in turn.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As far as the matter raised by
              Mr&nbsp;C&nbsp;Wilson is concerned, I have asked for, and have
              already received, a preliminary report, which I will read after
              the suspension of today’s sitting. It is likely that I will wish
              to return to this matter tomorrow. Does that answer all the points
              of order?</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">May I ask that the firearms held by other
              Members be left outside the building?</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am surprised to find that you are unaware
              that since the first sitting of the Assembly, there has been an
              armoury at the entrance to the building, and that all those who
              —</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McElduff:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That means the Members opposite — all the
              Unionist Members’ weapons.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Initial Presiding Officer:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member may wish to be cautious about the
              comments he is making. As regards this particular matter, all
              those who work in this building, including civil servants who were
              not Assembly staff but who were in the building in the early days
              of the Assembly’s life, were asked to place any weapons they
              held in the armoury. Also, anyone who is not a Member of the
              Assembly — and that has included some very senior people —
              must submit themselves to an examination on the way in. This is
              not the case for Members, and the point that the Member for
              Strangford is making is that we should consider whether this
              should also apply to Members. Everyone else has to go through the
              security devices.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I emphasise that Members bringing firearms into
              the building are requested, on their honour, to place these in the
              armoury — a request which has been set out in various documents.
              Members can then pick up their firearms when they leave the
              building. I am a little disappointed to see that this is not
              common knowledge, as it has been pointed out on a number of
              occasions before.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I appeal to Members to observe this. If there
              is a general feeling among Members that they should not be
              excluded from the search procedures, this should be communicated
              either to party Whips or to members of the Commission. The matter
              will then be raised at a subsequent meeting of the relevant
              bodies.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Further to that point of order. In previous
              Assemblies, the procedure you have outlined was operated very
              successfully, but I feel that it should be put on record that if a
              person brings an unlicensed weapon into the building, that will be
              a different matter. In the past, each Member had to produce his
              certificate, and that should be the rule today, especially as the
              Government are prepared to allow people to carry unlicensed
              weapons.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The regulations are there. To my knowledge,
              they have been used in the case of a small number of Members.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will return to the other matter tomorrow.</p>
