                </font></b><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr Speaker. On Thursday
                7 December, my party was informed that today’s business would
                include a motion from the Executive on the Civic Forum. I
                understand that the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister
                have withdrawn that motion and will not proceed with it at this
                time. I do not know their reason, but that is not relevant to
                the point of order.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A hole has been left in our business that
                could have been filled by one of a long list of motions that are
                queued up for consideration. May I move the suspension of
                Standing Orders to allow the Business Committee to consider over
                lunch whether it might take one of the motions from the list and
                put it at the end of today’s sitting after all other business
                on the Order Paper has been dealt with?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the House will know, sometimes the
                business that the Business Committee has agreed — whether a
                motion, a Bill or some other matter — is withdrawn. That is
                the case for private Members, and I regret to say that it has
                happened on several occasions. It also happens from time to time
                with Ministers and others.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member is correct that that alters the
                business, but at least Members know what the business is when
                they receive the Order Paper. I regret that it is not possible
                to table a motion for a suspension of Standing Orders, on this
                or any other matter, without its being on the Order Paper.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Robinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Further to that point of order, Mr Speaker. I
                am grateful, but I wish to make certain that I understood what
                you said. I see no stipulation in Standing Order 72 that that
                must be done by way of a written motion.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members have not had written notice, which
                must be on the Order Paper. That is how we have proceeded
                heretofore.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Robinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I accept that. Perhaps I should have
                expressed myself more clearly. I refer to Standing Order 72,
                which would enable us to suspend the Standing Order to which you
                refer, if Members so wished. There was no edge to my comments
                about the withdrawal of the motion. It is simply a matter of
                good business practice to let everyone deal with a motion sought
                by one or more Members in the normal way, rather than give them
                the afternoon off.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I understand that the Member is referring to
                Standing Order 72. However, a motion for suspension is no
                different from any other motion, and under Standing Order 12(7)
                a motion for suspension of Standing Orders — a motion on the
                business of the House — would have to be on the Order Paper. I
                make no comment about whether that is a good way to arrange
                business under Standing Orders; I am simply doing my best to
                interpret Standing Orders and keep everything in order. I regret
                that we must now move on.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </font></b><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Under the powers given to me in Standing
                Order 34(1) I have decided to accept a late amendment to this
                Bill, tabled by Mr P Robinson, on the ground of exceptional
                circumstances. I trust that the circumstances will indeed prove
                to be exceptional.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill was, as I understand it, listed in
                the forthcoming business sheet for the week beginning 15 January
                2001, or later. At an earlier stage a number of points,
                including the matter at issue, had been raised by Mr Robinson,
                and a ministerial reply was expected. I understand that when the
                Bill was rescheduled for today the ministerial reply had not
                been received. I cannot say whether it was sent. As I pointed
                out to the Business Committee, the whole purpose of the Further
                Consideration Stage becomes nugatory if Members are unable to
                table amendments. They only know from the Order Paper of the
                final opportunity for amendments after the deadline for the
                submission of amendments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that these circumstances will be
                exceptional, and on that ground I have accepted this amendment.
                It is the only amendment on the Marshalled List, and I trust
                that Members have received it.</p>

                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I had expected, at the beginning of Further
                Consideration Stage, some explanation from the Minister as to
                why the Bill was being debated earlier than had been
                contemplated. It was on the list of forthcoming business
                scheduled for the week commencing 15 January 2001.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The handling of the Bill has perhaps been the
                worst practice of any Department that I have seen for a long
                time. First, the Bill was introduced without consulting those
                who have to enforce it, namely local authorities. To this day,
                they complain about aspects of the Bill and the fact that they
                have never been asked to comment on it. In her reply, which I
                eventually received, the Minister offered as an excuse the
                circumstances relating to the setting up of devolution in
                Northern Ireland as the reason why proper consultation did not
                take place. Of course, she and her Department did have time to
                consult with the Ulster Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
                Animals (USPCA), but she did not have time to consult with the
                statutory body responsible for enforcing dogs legislation —
                namely, local government in Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Even after receiving complaints from local
                government, the Minister did not attempt to consult it on the
                issue. In effect, if it had not been for the exercise of the
                Speaker’s discretion, the Department would have succeeded in
                time-barring the Assembly from putting down any amendments. I
                shall quote the undertaking given by the Minister at the
                Consideration Stage, when she could not answer the questions
                that I had asked:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;As regards the other questions to which
                the Member seems to think he has received no answers, I am
                perfectly open in saying that I have not answered all his
                questions because I had no notice of them. There are issues
                involved which I, as a Minister, would be foolish to address off
                the top of my head.&quot;</p>
                </font><i><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">10.45 am</p>
                </font></i><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Agriculture and Rural
                Development undertook to answer in writing, and she made it
                clear during the course of the debate that if Members were
                dissatisfied, they could table amendments at this stage.
                Therefore it was not unusual for a Member to hold back before
                tabling an amendment to see whether the Minister could resolve
                the difficulties raised at the earlier stage.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, I had to ring the Minister’s
                Department last Thursday to ask for a copy of a letter that it
                said had been sent to me. Indeed, it was sent to me, after the
                request had gone to the Business Committee to consider this
                matter for this week’s business. Therefore, in effect, when I
                received the communication it was too late, according to the
                Standing Orders, to put down any amendment. However, with the
                exercise of your discretion, Mr Speaker, it has been possible
                for this amendment to be taken.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important that I set my amendment in
                context. As Members will know, a district council has no
                discretion at present — if a dog is proven to have attacked a
                person or to have worried sheep, the council must seek a
                destruction order in the courts. Equally, the courts have no
                discretion if they find that a dog did attack a person.
                &quot;Attack&quot;, in this sense, it is worth pointing out, has
                a wider meaning than would otherwise be assumed. The
                interpretation given in the Dogs (Northern Ireland) Order 1983
                includes not only a physical attack on a person but the case in
                which the dog has behaved</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">

                person apprehension of being attacked&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At present, if a person is left with the
                apprehension that he or she is being attacked, that is
                sufficient for the courts to make a judgement on the matter, and
                they have no choice on what that judgement should be. They have
                to issue a destruction order on the dog.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is obvious that this piece of legislation
                is intended to give some limited scope to the courts. In fact,
                the Bill itself does not offer any discretion to the council. It
                will still be necessary to take the case to the courts, and the
                courts will then have only limited discretion as to what they
                may do. They can, of course, issue a destruction order, or they
                can consider some other measure that should be taken by way of
                what might be described as punishment if it has been proved that
                an attack took place.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill does not provide the courts with the
                discretion to determine that the dog should be exonerated in all
                the circumstances. How can the Minister argue that it is right
                to let the courts have discretion to determine whether the dog
                should be destroyed or whether some measures falling short of
                destruction should be applied, while not giving them the
                discretion to determine whether no action should be taken?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the case comes to court, if an attack
                has taken place and the dog has been found guilty, only the
                extent of the punishment is to be determined. The Department is,
                in effect, saying to the Assembly that there are no
                circumstances in which a dog might attack or behave</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;in such a manner so as to cause a
                person apprehension of being attacked&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">that can be justified. A dog can never be
                justified in attacking an individual. That is the Department’s
                argument. I do not agree. I mentioned one such set of
                circumstances at the Consideration Stage.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall refer to it as the &quot;Rover to the
                rescue&quot; scenario, in which a dog comes to the rescue of its
                owner if the owner is under attack. One could perhaps
                hypothesise about several other possibilities: if a dog were the
                subject of severe brutality, it might be justified in its
                attempts to extricate itself from those circumstances. I have
                not tried to stretch my imagination too far in providing those
                examples, but I am sure, given the vivid imagination of some
                Assembly Members, that they could provide other examples.
                However, that does raise the question of why the Minister is
                insisting that a dog must be punished in those circumstances.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Minister not trust the courts to
                exercise their discretion properly? One can only assume that she
                has confidence in the courts, otherwise she would not be giving
                them that additional element of discretion. Indeed, given the
                courts’ past practice, there is no justification for not
                giving them this further element of discretion. My amendment is
                framed to ensure that the courts know that only in rare and
                manifestly justifiable circumstances will they be able to
                exercise their discretion to the extent of exonerating the dog.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker, you set an excellent example when
                you exercised your discretion and said that you are prepared to
                do so only in very limited circumstances. The amendment is
                framed in such a way that it is made clear to the courts that
                they can exercise their discretion only in very rare and limited
                circumstances. It would be unreasonable for the Minister to
                resist the amendment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have attempted to determine why, in her
                response to me, the Minister was not prepared to accept the
                substance of the amendment. I suppose that when attempting to
                guess other people’s motives, one is treading on dangerous
                territory, but it strikes me that this is, perhaps, departmental
                arrogance. Is it a question of &quot;Our officials framed this
                piece of legislation; the experts drafted it. How dare those
                Assembly Members think that they will be able to find some
                imperfection in our handiwork.&quot; Perhaps there is a direct
                rule legacy in the Department — &quot;We are the people who
                will decide these matters, and we do not want any interference
                in the process from elected representatives.&quot;</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Even in the correspondence that I received
                from her, the Minister gives little glimpse as to why she would
                turn down the amendment. From her correspondence, I can only
                deduce one explicit reason that she offers and, perhaps, one
                implicit reason. I want to deal with both of these. In her
                letter to me, she says:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;I fully understand the kind of
                situation you describe, i.e. where the dog is defending his
                owner and bites an attacker or intruder, and in those
                circumstances I could foresee the courts operating with a fairly
                light touch.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is a telling sentence. It is a
                recognition on the part of the Department and the Minister that
                they recognise a set of circumstances as being valid. However,
                in dealing with that, all the Minister has to say is that she
                recognises that that set of circumstances could come about, and
                she hopes that the courts will let the dog off lightly &quot;for
                its gallantry&quot;. That is only a &quot;hope&quot;, of course,
                because it is left to the discretion of the courts as to how
                they interpret the legislation. That seems to be a strange
                approach by the Minister. I suspect that if a soldier were to
                come to the rescue of a member of the public he would be
                mentioned in dispatches.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If another citizen came to the rescue of a
                member of the public, he or she might be awarded a medal. The
                press might even bestow some credit on that person. However, if
                a faithful dog that loves its owner is prepared to put itself in
                harm’s way in order to protect its owner, the Minister’s
                answer is, &quot;Well, you do not necessarily have to kill it;
                you can just punish it slightly.&quot; That does not seem to be
                a very humane approach to the matter, and it is a definition of
                mercy and compassion that I would not want to share. I can see
                no logic in the thinking behind that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The other implicit reason given by the
                Minister in her correspondence for making no change in the Bill
                is that, based on past experience, there would be very few such
                occasions. The Minister said</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;There are relatively few destruction
                orders made each year; in 1999 there were 40 attacks on people
                and 16 attacks on livestock; and I would envisage only a very
                few of those raising issues which might lead the Courts to
                consider that measures other than destruction could be taken to
                prevent the dog being a danger to the public or to
                livestock.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not know for how many years we might
                expect this piece of legislation to be in force in its present
                form. The last similar piece of legislation came forward in
                1983. Therefore, for the purpose of my calculation, I am going
                to take a period of 17 years. On the 1999 figures provided by
                the Minister, that makes about 1,000 cases that may come before
                the courts.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not know — and neither does the
                Minister — how many of those cases would be of the kind for
                which the amendment might be applied. I do not think that it is
                a sensible approach for the Minister to say that it is not worth
                making the change that we could make today with so little
                effort. She would rather punish gallant dogs and be unjust than
                allow her Bill to be changed in any way.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker, you will know from your
                experience in another place that amendments generally fall into
                one of three categories. First, amendments can be tabled with
                the intention of doing violence to the Bill, of changing its
                direction, of attempting to undermine the key principles. In
                those circumstances, I would never be surprised if a Minister
                were to oppose an amendment. The second category is where
                somebody takes the opportunity that the Bill raises of riding
                his hobby horse across the pages of the Bill and putting down an
                amendment to extend it in some direction. I would seldom be
                surprised if a Minister might resist his or her Bill being used
                in that manner of convenience. However, there is a third
                category where Members try to improve the legislation to enhance
                the intention of the Bill, and are being helpful to the Minister
                and the Department.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is obvious that this amendment does no
                violence to the principle that the Minister has included in this
                Bill. It is consistent with the purpose of the Bill, which is to
                allow the courts to have more discretion. I do not see how the
                Minister could argue that the amendment takes the Bill off in
                another direction — it is riding the same path that the
                Minister is riding. The only issue is whether it is right that
                in certain circumstances it might be opportune for the court to
                have the discretion not to destroy or to instruct that measures
                be applied to punish the dog for any action in which it has been
                involved.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.00 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As my amendment seeks only to improve and
                enhance the stated intention of the Bill, any attempt by the
                Minister to defeat the change will leave her defending the
                incomprehensible and appearing obstinate and arrogant. She will
                be seen to be defending her Department’s shortcomings with the
                same vigour as she might defend her honour or virtue.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For the sake of completeness, I should say
                that there is at least one type of amendment in addition to the
                list that the Member has given. It is not uncommon for probing
                amendments to be put down. Their purpose is not to wreck or
                divert the Bill or divide the House, but to ensure that the
                Minister will put something on the record. That could be by way
                of an undertaking for a later stage, which is not relevant at
                this stage of the Bill, or something might be said by the
                Minister that could, subsequent to the Pepper v Hart judgement,
                be used by the courts in the interpretation of a piece of
                legislation, if it were unclear what the legislation intended.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member has helpfully referred to the fact
                that there are different kinds of amendments used by the House,
                and by Members, in different ways. This amendment has, however,
                been tabled and proposed.</p>

                tempered by the Minister’s intervention.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr S Wilson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the amendment. I know that the
                Minister has said that she will accept the amendment, but I
                cannot leave this issue without reiterating the criticism of the
                handling of the Bill. There has not been the kind of
                consultation for which one would have hoped for, especially with
                those who will have to enforce the legislation. As has been
                said, this is not unique to the Department of Agriculture and
                Rural Development. There is still a pervading sense in
                Departments that the expertise lies with their own legislative
                draftsmen. How dare anybody from outside criticise that?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We shall also find that problem with other
                Bills. Ministers ought to give due consideration to the people
                who have to implement legislation. They know where difficulties
                arise and where problems have occurred in the past. Therefore,
                they can see the flaws in the legislation, which in many cases
                is drawn up from the point of view of academic expertise rather
                than experience.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall reinforce my Colleague’s point. I
                am glad that the Minister has accepted the amendment, for a
                couple of reasons. First, one thing that has attracted much bad
                publicity to councils — and it has been the case in the
                council on which I serve — is when a destruction order on a
                dog has been made that, in the circumstances, has been patently
                unfair. Councils have no powers of discretion. The officer on
                the ground cannot make a judgement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He cannot say, &quot;There are mitigating
                circumstances that persuade me not to pursue this case in the
                courts.&quot; Under the terms of the Bill, the courts will not
                be able to exercise discretion in the circumstances that were
                described by my Colleague. Ultimately, the council will be at
                the front line when it comes to making destruction orders and
                will therefore attract all the bad publicity. The Bill gives the
                court some limited discretion, but, without the amendment, it
                does not give the court the discretion to do nothing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was ironic that the Minister had to rely
                on the argument that a court might &quot;deal lightly&quot; with
                a dog &quot;in certain circumstances&quot;. What does that mean?
                The options open to a court, if it decides not to require that a
                dog be put down, are to muzzle it, confine it, exclude it or
                neuter it — all that from a Minister whose party has
                complained vigorously about the Government’s attempts to
                muzzle terrorists.</p>

                how the Speaker should deal with Members. The Member should
                review what he said about the meaning of the phrase
                &quot;dealing lightly&quot; in tomorrow’s Hansard. He should
                be cautious about making comparisons with other areas, as the
                Speaker might be tempted to do so as well. The Member must
                remain tightly within the confines of the amendment and not
                wander too far from it.</p>

                Minister’s party has deemed to be inappropriate for
                terrorists.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The clause sets out how a court might
                &quot;deal lightly&quot; with a dog that has been protecting its
                owner or his owner’s property. The Department should accept
                the amendment. We must be vigilant about allowing Departments to
                think that they know better and that they can railroad measures.
                That would be against the whole ethos of devolution.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am aware of the practice of tabling probing
                amendments, and deliberately did not mention it lest it give the
                Minister an easy route out.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The courts often consider the intentions of
                legislators. There is a sentence in the Minister’s letter that
                follows on from what my hon Friend said about the four specific
                measures mentioned in the Bill. In the letter the Minister says</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The kind of restrictions mentioned in
                clause&nbsp;1 sets the parameters for the restrictions which the
                court could place on a dog but there is no reason why the courts
                should not, if it thought circumstances so dictated, define
                other measures sufficient to prevent the dog being a danger to
                the public or to livestock.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I simply put the matter on record because the
                courts may want to know that they have that additional measure
                of flexibility.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr S Wilson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important to have that matter on the
                record because — as Mr Robinson pointed out — the courts
                will often look at the intention behind legislation when it was
                being debated.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally — and I know that this has been
                raised before — there is concern as to how this legislation is
                to be enforced. The restraining, confining or exclusion of dogs
                will mean additional work for a local authority, although that
                is not being made clear. If that is to be the case, perhaps the
                Minister will clarify whether she intends for additional
                resources to be made available. Will those funds have to be
                found by local councils?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Rodgers:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It seems that the mover of the amendment has
                pre-empted my thinking and has presumed that I would not accept
                his amendment. Perhaps he underestimates his own powers of
                persuasion. He is very good on rhetoric but sometimes not so
                good on substance. It was interesting; perhaps he is not used to
                dealing with people with open minds. I am pleased that the
                Members opposite recognise the value of devolution and hope that
                they will continue to recognise it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I did not have any amendments at the
                Consideration Stage, but Members will be aware that the Bill
                passed Committee Stage and — as Mr Robinson acknowledged when
                speaking at Consideration Stage — missed some key points. It
                is interesting that the Committee, of which he seemed to be
                somewhat critical, is chaired by his party leader and includes
                two more of his party members.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The timing of the Bill is not a matter for
                the Department, as the Member will probably be aware. The issue
                of consultation has been discussed at length in the House and at
                Committee Stage, and the reasons have already been given. I do
                not intend to go over them again. As regards additional
                resources, application of the legislation would be a matter for
                the RUC.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have carefully considered the proposed
                amendment to clause 1. It seeks to further extend the courts’
                discretion on whether to order the destruction of a dog or apply
                a lesser penalty, such as muzzling or confinement, where the dog
                has attacked people or livestock. The clause was drafted on the
                basis that if it were proved to the satisfaction of the court
                that an attack had taken place, the court would take any
                mitigating circumstances into account. Nevertheless, the court
                would still have to apply a penalty provision at whatever level
                it thought fit, in accordance with the provisions in the Bill.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That said, insofar as the terms of the
                proposed amendment offer the court the option of not applying a
                penalty at all, I am happy to accept it on the grounds that it
                is limited to circumstances in which exceptional mitigating
                factors exist. As such, it will offer the courts the widest
                possible discretion in any case of a dog attacking a person or
                worrying livestock. The Bill will therefore be amended
                accordingly.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister has said that the timing of the
                Bill is not a matter for the Department. That, of course, is
                correct. It is, however, a matter for the Executive Committee,
                under Standing Order 12(4). It was at that Committee’s request
                that the Bill was introduced at this time.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Robinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister is right in saying that I am
                somewhat surprised that she has accepted the amendment. It is
                not because of her ability to take into account any reasoned
                argument put forward, nor is it because I consider the Minister
                to be incapable of comprehending reasoned arguments. When the
                Minister wrote to me regarding the matters that I raised, which
                included this one, at Consideration Stage, I expected her to say
                that she was willing to accept an amendment, or to put down an
                amendment herself. She did not; therefore I tabled the
                amendment. I am pleasantly surprised, if not delighted, that the
                Minister is prepared to accept it.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.15 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not wish to appear churlish, but the
                amendment does improve the Bill considerably. Despite the
                Minister giving me what might be described as dog’s abuse in
                her remarks, I must say that at no stage did I offer any
                criticism of the Committee — neither at Further Consideration
                Stage nor at Consideration Stage in November 2000. My criticism
                was of the Department, which has a responsibility to consult
                with those persons responsible for enforcing legislation that
                passes through the House. A Department cannot assume that a
                Committee will do the work for it. Instead, Departments should
                to be managing the wider consultation, especially in the light
                of the amount of work with which Committees are faced. It is not
                possible for Committees to bring in various interested parties
                for every Bill that comes before them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister may think it a telling point
                when she says to us that there is a value in devolution. I do
                not know where the Minister has been, but the Democratic
                Unionist Party is a devolution party. We believe in devolution.
                We believe that devolution is in the best interests of the
                people of Northern Ireland for precisely the reasons she is
                explaining. Certainly, we have major difficulties and objections
                to the form of devolution being exercised in Northern Ireland,
                but that does not detract from our adherence to the principles
                of devolution, which we believe is in the best interests of the
                people of Northern Ireland.</p>

                Less Favourable Treatment) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2000
                be approved.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall refer to these Regulations as the
                Part-time Regulations. They were brought before the Assembly on
                27 June 2000 and came into operation on 1 July 2000. They are
                subject to confirmation by the Assembly within six months of the
                date that they came into operation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Regulations implemented European
                Directive 97/81/EC, as extended to the UK by Directive 98/23/EC,
                in Northern Ireland, and correspond closely to those made by the
                Secretary of State for Trade and Industry in Britain, which also
                came into force on 1 July 2000. Their aim is straightforward:
                they make it unlawful for unscrupulous employers to treat
                part-time workers less favourably than comparable full-timers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Part-time workers, therefore, must receive
                the same hourly rate of pay as full-timers, the same access to
                occupational pension schemes, the same access to training and
                the same entitlement to annual, parental and maternity leave on
                a pro rata basis. In that way we can ensure that part-time
                workers are not treated less favourably in their contractual
                terms and conditions than comparable full- timers, unless
                different treatment is justified on objective grounds.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I commend the Regulations to the Assembly.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Higher and Further
                Education, Training and Employment Committee (Dr Birnie):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am grateful for the opportunity to make
                some comments on my own behalf and on behalf of the Committee. I
                appreciate the Minister’s remarks. It is of note that
                equivalent Regulations now apply in the other parts of the
                United Kingdom and that these Regulations have been in operation
                in Northern Ireland since July. As the Minister said, it is
                somewhat imperative that we confirm these Regulations today so
                that in meeting required timescales we comply with European law.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The underlying reason is the possibility of
                so-called Frankovich cases. The European Court has now made
                provision for individuals to sue the Government in their
                jurisdiction if that Government fail to implement current
                European Directives and Regulations. The Committee regrets that
                suspension between February and June cut short any contribution
                from the Committee at drafting stage of the Regulations in
                Northern Ireland. Notwithstanding that, on 9 November, the
                Committee took evidence on the Regulations and, on 10 November,
                we wrote to the Minister, listing some of our main concerns. It
                was not felt that those concerns merited a special report to the
                Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The burden of our concern is with respect to
                the limitation on the comparators against which part-time
                workers under this Directive are to be compared. It implies that
                only some, not all, part-timers will be able to avail of
                protection under the Regulations. Particularly of note is the
                fact that in these Regulations, unlike the Sex Discrimination
                (NI) Order 1976, there is no provision for a so-called
                hypothetical comparator.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee supports the motion because it
                approves of the broad principles of equity contained in the
                Regulations. At the same time, it is concerned about some of the
                details. In this matter, we are constrained to a great extent to
                comply with the rest of the European Union. Nevertheless, the
                Committee stresses the value and appropriateness of an early
                review on the part of the Minister and the Department of the
                implementation of the Regulations to ensure that they are
                achieving their objective, which is the equitable treatment of
                part-timers relative to full-time workers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I urge support for the motion.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy Chairperson of the Higher and
                Further Education, Training and Employment Committee (Mr Carrick):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with Dr Birnie. I welcome the
                extension of statutory rights of equal treatment to part-time
                workers. Although the Committee raised several issues with the
                Minister, it is aware that the legislation needs to be brought
                into force. Apart from the absence of the hypothetical
                comparator referred to by Dr&nbsp;Birnie, the Committee was
                concerned at the absence of a code of practice, which many of
                the bodies responding to the Department’s consultation process
                had asked for. Although that is not a flaw in the legislation
                itself, we believe that a statutory code of practice would give
                extra weight to the legislation and give clear guidance to
                part-time workers on their rights.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many part-time workers are employed by small
                organisations that do not have the resources to make the advice
                available. A code of practice conveys good practice guidelines.
                I note that a similar document supporting legislation on
                recruitment and selection helped to change the culture in that
                area, as well as providing useful guidance for employers and
                employees alike.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee also examined guidance on the
                Regulations that has been made available in all jobcentres.
                Although easily readable, the guide, we found, was confusing in
                some areas, and at times it gave misleading or perhaps unlawful
                guidance. Our views on that have been submitted to the Minister.
                In particular, the lack of statutory guidance on what comprises
                objective grounds for an appeal under the legislation leaves the
                whole issue to be sorted out at a tribunal. The onus is on the
                individual to identify his or her rights as a part-timer. We
                consider that employers should periodically review how
                individuals are provided with information on their rights as
                part-time workers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I note that House of Commons staff are
                specifically mentioned in the corresponding legislation.
                Individuals in the Assembly have not been included in the
                Northern Ireland Regulations that we examined. I am especially
                concerned that staff working in the Northern Ireland Assembly
                should be covered by the legislation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I too wonder how the effect of these
                Regulations will be evaluated. There should be some form of
                future inspection to ensure that the Regulations have been
                implemented properly and are being adhered to by employers.
                Despite my reservations, I agree with the Chairman about the
                importance of the Regulations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion and commend it to the
                House.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Nelis:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I
                welcome the extension of the statutory right of equal treatment
                to part-time workers. The Committee raised several issues with
                the Minister. One of those issues was a code of practice that
                would give clear guidelines to part-time workers on their
                rights. The Committee believes that a statutory code of practice
                would not only add weight to the legislation but also guarantee
                protection for the most vulnerable workers, especially those
                working in smaller firms.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the moment, part-time workers on
                fixed-term contracts cannot pursue a claim to win equal rights,
                even if they can find a full-time worker with a similar contract
                to act as a comparator. The absence of comparators is a serious
                weakness in the legislation and means that a large number of
                workers in low-paid jobs such as cleaning and catering, mainly
                women, will have limited protection. Similar limitations mean
                that the rights and terms of employment of term-time workers —
                a subject much discussed in the Assembly — cannot be properly

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, the legislation is welcome as a step
                in the right direction, although it is also a missed opportunity
                to really put in place legislation that would impact on the huge
                number of part-time workers in the North — approximately
                200,000. The estimate that this legislation will impact on only
                7,000 of those part-time workers indicates some of the
                legislation’s weaknesses. It is obvious that the legislation
                promised businesses and employers a light touch, and certainly a
                minimum of red tape. However, I welcome the introduction of the
                legislation. Go raibh míle maith agat.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Morrice:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We also welcome the introduction of
                legislation that puts part-time workers on the same footing as
                full-time workers. That is important. However, we have several
                important concerns on which we would be grateful for further
                clarification from the Minister.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Obviously, the Regulations are of particular
                interest to the Women’s Coalition, because 83·1% of
                part-timers are women. Some 36% of women work part-time,
                compared to 6% of men.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are aware that these Regulations are the
                implementation of the European Commission Directive on part-time
                workers, brought into Great Britian legislation, and now
                extended to Northern Ireland. We are concerned that, in the rest
                of the UK, the Directive has been given the narrowest possible
                interpretation. However, on listening to the Minister, I have
                been given some assurance that several areas of concern could be
                alleviated — for example, the issue of the rates of pay. There
                is a marked incidence of low pay among part-time workers in
                Northern Ireland. The figures show that, in 1999, 22% of
                part-time employees earned less than £4 an hour, and, of those,
                80% were women.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The earlier notes to the Regulations gave an
                example of a justified difference in hourly rates where
                employees are shown to have a different level of performance,
                measured by a fair and consistent appraisal system. I am
                assuming that the Minister, in his opening statement, said that
                there would be no difference in hourly pay between full-time and
                part-time workers. We welcome movement on that issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our second point is on training. We are all
                aware that training has been much less available to part-time
                workers. In the Minister’s opening statement, we heard that
                this also is to be clarified and that part-time workers will
                have access to training. That is vitally important, given that
                the majority of part-time workers are women. It is vital that
                they have access to training.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Birnie raised the issue of comparators. Mr
                Carrick raised the point of the code of practice, which is
                important. We have a further question about situations when
                differential treatment is justified on objective grounds. It is
                important to understand what &quot;objective grounds&quot;
                means, so that we do not leave too many loopholes that could be
                used by unscrupulous employers to discriminate against people.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those are the main points on which we wish to
                seek assurance. We support the calls from Dr Birnie and Mr
                Carrick for an early review of the implementation of the
                Regulations to ensure that they are being properly applied and
                that there is absolutely no discrimination against part-time
                workers.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Farren:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank all the Members who have spoken on
                this issue. I share their objective of ensuring that part-time
                workers enjoy the same level of protection as full-time workers
                — the same guarantees in their terms and conditions of
                employment and, insofar as it is necessary, the enhancement of
                those terms and conditions to the highest possible standard.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should not assume that all, or many,
                employers of part-time workers are unscrupulous in their
                approach or that they are intent on denying workers their
                rights. It has been pointed out that only a small number of
                part-time workers will be affected by the Regulations to be
                implemented under the legislation. However, many part-time
                workers already enjoy the same standards as their full-time
                counterparts, and that is the case throughout the public sector.
                If, as Mr Carrick suggested, there are deficiencies in the
                conditions of employment of part-time staff in this institution,
                I would be very anxious to hear about them and to be assured
                that all part-time workers were receiving the level of
                protection required by the legislation. I would be very
                concerned if that were not so.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Points were made on the comparators used to
                determine terms and conditions for workers. The Regulations
                require a comparator to be in a job broadly similar to that of a
                full-time worker,</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;having regard … to qualifications,
                skills and experience&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Part-time employees are allowed to compare
                themselves to their predecessors in their posts, and that should
                be particularly helpful to women returning to work. I am very
                aware that a significant majority of part-time workers are
                women. All the evidence shows that many women receive a lower
                level of remuneration than their male counterparts. I trust that
                the Regulations that are to come into force under this
                legislation will go a long way towards enhancing the situation
                of women.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the subject of review, I am anxious to
                ensure that we monitor the implementation of the Regulations,
                and I am sure that that will happen. We shall be assisted in
                that by the statutory agencies involved and by the trade union
                movement, and I shall welcome all their comments, observations,
                reports and evaluations. We are at the first stage of this
                legislative process in Northern Ireland. It was introduced
                shortly after suspension. Before that, there was very limited
                opportunity for making detailed comment on such legislation, as
                Dr Birnie pointed out, but that should not prevent the Committee
                and others from making additional evaluations, which might be
                helpful to us as we move forward. I trust that I have covered
                most of the main issues.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The legislation is a significant advance and
                I commend it to the Assembly.</p>

                Order 1996 provides for an experiment in the use of courses as a
                sentencing option for convicted drink-drive offenders. On
                satisfactory completion of the course, the offender may receive
                a minimum of three months reduction and a maximum reduction of
                one quarter of the period of disqualification from driving.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The aim of the scheme is to prevent
                reoffending. The purpose of the experiment is to test the
                viability of the courses and to facilitate the evaluation of
                their effectiveness in preventing reoffending.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An Order to reduce a period of
                disqualification can be made where the following conditions are
                met: where an offender of 17&nbsp;years of age or over has been
                convicted of a relevant drink-driving offence resulting in a
                driving disqualification of 12&nbsp;months or more, and the
                court has explained in ordinary language the provisions of the
                Order to reduce the period of disqualification to the offender,
                also informing him or her of the amount of the fees for the
                course and of the requirement that he or she must pay them
                before the beginning of the course, the court must be satisfied
                that a place on the course specified in the order will be
                available for the offender. Then, with the agreement of the
                offender, the order may be made.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An experiment has been running in the petty
                sessions district of Belfast and Newtownabbey since
                1&nbsp;April&nbsp;1998. That experiment will end on
                31&nbsp;December&nbsp;2000 unless the Department makes an Order
                before that date to extend the period. The Probation Board for
                Northern Ireland was appointed as the sole course organiser, and
                the fee payable to the organiser is £100. Courses include
                information about alcohol and its effect on the body, on driving
                ability and on behaviour; an analysis of personal drinking
                patterns and how they relate to the driving offence; the impact
                that drinking and driving can have on victims and their
                families; alternatives to drinking and driving; and personal
                strategies and sources of advice to prevent repeat offending.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Each course is made up of nine weekly
                two-hour sessions. To complete a course successfully a
                participant must attend all nine sessions in full. To date, 12
                courses have been completed; 113 people attended and, of those,
                109 — 96% — completed all nine sessions. The remaining four
                participants withdrew for personal reasons.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The main criterion for judging how successful
                the courses have been is whether offenders who have attended a
                course are less likely to re-offend within three&nbsp;years than
                those who have not. From 1993 to 1999, courses for drink-drivers
                were run experimentally in 18 designated areas in England and
                Wales. The scheme will become permanent there with effect from
                1&nbsp;January&nbsp;2001. In England and Wales it was found that
                offenders who had completed a course were almost three times
                less likely to be reconvicted of a serious drink-driving offence
                than those who had not.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Initial indications are that courses in
                Northern Ireland are effective. Participants have shown a marked
                increase in knowledge about alcohol and its effect on the body,
                as well as a better attitude to not drinking and driving.
                However, more time is required for fuller evaluation of the
                impact of courses on reoffending. The Order before the Assembly
                will extend the current experimental scheme for a further period
                of five&nbsp;years, to the end of 2005. The Lord&nbsp;Chancellor
                will make a separate Order designating all petty sessions
                districts in Northern Ireland. That will allow all relevant
                drink-drive offenders in Northern Ireland the opportunity to
                attend a course. It will also allow the collection of data on a
                sufficiently large sample of offenders to permit the carrying
                out of reconviction rate analyses.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I commend the Order to the Assembly.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Drink-driving is a very serious issue.
                Nothing that has been discussed today, or the Courses for
                Drink-Drive Offenders (Experimental Period) (Extension) Order
                (Northern Ireland) 2000, should be understood as taking the
                issue of drink-driving with anything less than the seriousness
                and gravitas it deserves. Many innocent people have lost their
                lives through drink- driving. The Minister brings the motion to
                the House to try to help people who have been disqualified from
                driving to see the seriousness of their conviction and to stop
                them from reoffending. I am grateful for the opportunity to
                address the House on behalf of the Committee.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Statutory Rule was brought before the
                Assembly’s Environment Committee on 7 December 2000, and it
                was unanimously recommended that the Order be affirmed by the
                Assembly. I fully support that recommendation. However, the
                Committee had several questions, and officials from the
                Department of the Environment appeared before us. We still have
                some concerns that I ask the Minister to consider.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If someone is keen to drive again, surely it
                must look like a very attractive offer to have his or her
                suspension reduced if he or she satisfactorily completes a
                course approved by the Department. We are concerned that the
                actual take-up rate is very low — some 6% of all offenders.
                The fee to join the course is £100. To many in the House, £100
                may not seem a lot of money. However, for some people who would
                like to take up this course, and would greatly benefit from it,
                the fee could be regarded as a substantial amount. Is it not
                possible to provide the course at a lower cost? Has the
                Department considered some form of support from the car
                insurance industry? After all, it is in its interest as much as
                anyone else’s for the courses to be successful.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee was told that the experiment is
                to be extended throughout Northern Ireland. However, we were
                also informed that there will only be four centres — in
                Belfast, Ballymena, Armagh and Londonderry. Surely this will
                disadvantage people from outside those areas. For example, how
                can people from Enniskillen, Larne or Newry be expected to
                travel to a two-hour session at night? Remember that they do not
                have a driving licence. Those are questions that have exercised
                the Committee, and I hope that the Minister will take them on
                board.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I assure Members that the Committee and I
                support the Order and urge the House to do likewise.</p>

                I would like to reiterate the points made so expertly and
                comprehensively by our Committee Chairperson to reflect the
                views of the Committee.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This motion represents an enlightened
                approach to a significant and growing social problem. I commend
                the point about the vested interest, almost, of the driver who
                has been convicted and disqualified, and who wishes to drive
                again and be reinsured.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In those circumstances, the insurance
                companies impose a significant increase in the cost of insurance
                cover. It is important to encourage a greater uptake of this
                important form of counselling and awareness training. A 6%
                uptake is really a record of failure, but the concept of the
                course itself is worthy of strong support. We should try to
                redress the difficulties faced in obtaining a more appropriate
                level of uptake. If the Minister could address the insurance
                brokers directly they may be prepared to make an allowance upon
                successful completion of the counselling course. I understand
                that one broker already provides that incentive.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The statistics demonstrate that those who
                complete the course are three times less likely to reoffend than
                others with similar convictions who did not opt for the course.
                All the evidence points to the value and efficacy of that
                approach, but we must find ways and means of encouraging more
                and more people to avail themselves of it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I strongly support the measure. Does the
                Minister agree that it would benefit us all if we could
                encourage more convicted drivers to take up the course? One
                effective means of doing that would be to provide the incentive
                of an insurance premium deferral or reduction upon successful
                completion of the course. We would all gain from that.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Shannon:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the Minister’s proposals. As
                Dr&nbsp;McCrea mentioned, we also want to keep in perspective
                the reasons why drink-driving remains one of society’s ills.
                The television advert launched by the Minister only a few weeks
                ago highlights the gravity of drink-driving and the need to
                curtail it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There has been a decline in drink-driving
                cases, which we welcome, but much more must be done. The graphic
                nature of the advert hits home to everyone, but those of us who
                are parents can relate especially to what happens to the wee boy
                playing football in the security of his back garden.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the same time, we must look at the
                proposal to extend the experimental period, because, in its own
                way, it addresses some of the important issues. The road
                accident figures for the past year make horrific reading. They
                are just up on this year, with 577 alcohol-related and
                drug-related accidents, 34&nbsp;fatalities and 1,072&nbsp;total
                casualties, ranging from the slightly injured to the seriously
                injured.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many of us believe that we should consider
                zero tolerance of drink-driving. Many people would like to see
                that. The experimental method in Northern Ireland and in the
                rest of the United Kingdom has not been very successful.
                However, it has had a marked level of success. The fact that a
                solicitor or a barrister, pleading on behalf of an offender, can
                ask for his client to attend the nine-stage course as a means of
                rehabilitation through treatment and education is a positive way
                of addressing the issue. However, I wish to see more of those
                who have been convicted taking up the course. Perhaps that tells
                one a lot about the people as well; perhaps they need their jobs
                more and perhaps they are prepared to redress the wrongs that
                they have done.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is fair and just that a successfully
                rehabilitated offender should be allowed back on the road after
                a series of courses that will treat and educate him. Many have
                made mistakes; many are genuinely sorry and wish it had never
                happened. None the less, it did happen, and they make amends for
                it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Can the Minister provide figures broken down
                into separate categories for driving offences involving drugs
                and those involving alcohol? Is the Minister considering adding
                to the existing categories, perhaps creating one specifically
                for accidents caused by excessive speed? Excessive speed is the
                biggest killer on the roads and also causes the greatest number
                of casualties. Dr&nbsp;McCrea mentioned assistance for those
                travelling to take part in courses. Will such assistance be made
                available? The four locations are not accessible to everyone in
                the Province, and the Minister should consider that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The extension of the experimental scheme for
                another five years keeps Northern Ireland in line with the
                position on the United Kingdom mainland. It builds on the
                limited success of the scheme and gives offenders the chance to
                address their mistakes and learn from them. I hope that that
                will allow offenders to contribute to society more fully than
                previously.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Foster:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Article 36(2) of the Road Traffic Offenders
                (Northern Ireland) Order 1996 states that a court can reduce the
                period of disqualification imposed on a drink-drive offender,
                provided that the offender satisfactorily completes a
                rehabilitation course. By providing for the continuation of that
                power until the end of 2005, the Order will facilitate a
                comprehensive evaluation of the experimental scheme. Such an
                evaluation is necessary if we are to assess the scheme’s
                ability to deter those who participate from reoffending within
                three years of the relevant conviction. The scheme is a
                significant road safety measure and will contribute to a
                reduction in road casualty figures. I hope that, in due course,
                it will become permanent, but in the meantime I look forward to
                its continuation and to the evaluation of its effectiveness.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall answer the questions asked by
                Members. I take on board the points that Members have made about
                the course. These days, when there is terrible carnage on the
                roads, it is important that we do all that we can to ensure that
                the number of accidents is reduced. Indeed, it has been
                suggested that we should have a policy of zero tolerance.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was asked why the courses could not be
                provided free or at a reduced fee. It is reasonable that the
                participants finance the courses, although the cost of the
                course must not be a disincentive for potential participants.
                The Probation Board has set the fee with that in mind. The cost
                of running one course has been estimated at £1,000, which means
                that 10 participants are necessary for a course to break even.
                Thus far, the average number of course participants has been
                just under 10. I assure Members that fee levels will be
                considered when we make a decision on the scheme’s permanency.
                I am sure that Members appreciate the difficulties.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr&nbsp;McCrea referred to the locations in
                which the courses will be available. Under the extended
                experiment, courses will be available in Belfast, Ballymena,
                Londonderry and Armagh, and the offender will choose the
                location. The provision of courses in other places will be
                considered, if experience suggests that that is necessary. One
                of the first points that I made was about the situation for
                people from isolated areas, such as Enniskillen, my home town,
                Newry and other areas. My staff will examine that point.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Insurance companies in Northern Ireland do
                not normally offer reduced premiums to those who have completed
                a course, although one broker claims to offer such a reduction.
                Offenders are advised that there is a possibility of obtaining
                reduced premiums from an insurance broker, but it is up to them
                to trawl the market. My officials will pursue the matter with
                insurance brokers and companies in Northern Ireland. However, we
                cannot make promises, as it is a matter for the individual and
                the insurance company.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How will the Department increase uptake from
                the current level of 6%? For the extended experiment, the name
                of the course will be changed from ‘Rehabilitation Courses for
                Drink Drive Offenders’ to ‘Courses for Drink Drive Offenders’.
                That should, to some degree, address the perception that courses
                are for people with an alcohol problem.</p>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">From August 2000, all offenders referred have
                received a letter and information leaflet from the course
                organiser, explaining the purpose of the course and outlining
                its content. Leaflets are to be redesigned to present
                information in a simpler and more attractive way. The Department
                will issue a press release early in 2001 to highlight the
                extended scheme and what it offers. Solicitors will receive
                direct mailing, and magistrates will be informed of the extended
                experiment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Shannon asked whether courses were
                available for persons convicted of drug-related road traffic
                offences and whether they could be extended. He asked for the
                present breakdown of drink-related and drug-related offences.
                Alcohol-related offences are the main offences taken into
                consideration at present. Although drug-related offences are
                rarer, we shall consider them too.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This presentation on behalf of the community
                in general is most important as far as road safety is concerned.
                I trust that I have addressed Members’ questions to their
                satisfaction. My officials will identify any questions or points
                made that I have overlooked, and I shall write to those
                concerned. I thank Members for their interest in the debate and
                for their commendation. I am glad that everyone is in favour of

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Northern Ireland Tourist Board and Bord
              Fáilte have co-operated on joint advertising since 1987.
              Following the creation of the overseas tourism marketing
              initiative in 1995 and Brand Ireland in 1996, annual joint
              expenditure of approximately £10 million has generated
              approximately 400,000 annual enquiries. The Northern Ireland
              Tourist Board’s initial contribution of £500,000 was followed
              by annual contributions of £300,000.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Whatever the merits of joint advertising and
              marketing between Northern Ireland and the Republic, it is
              important that Northern Ireland’s product be clearly identified
              for potential visitors. Will the Minister assure the Assembly that
              Northern Ireland will be represented properly in the joint
              promotion logo?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The answer is &quot;Yes.&quot; We have to
              understand that the objective is to increase the number of
              visitors to Northern Ireland. People coming from abroad see Europe
              as a unit and these islands as a unit; they do not see particular
              regions within those units.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is clear, under the terms of the
              arrangements that have been entered into, that the Northern
              Ireland Tourist Board, in conjunction with Bord Fáilte, will be
              establishing this company. It is the creature of the two tourist
              boards. The Northern Ireland Tourist Board will retain the
              responsibility and requirements to continue with regional
              marketing. It was specifically written into the arrangements
              setting up the company that it treat, be aware of and take into
              account in its campaigns the particular circumstances that
              pertained here over the past 30 years. I am confident that that
              will be achieved.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister for his comments on the
              figures. With regard to the amount of money allocated and spent
              from Northern and Southern Ireland, can he indicate, for each
              region, the number of people who have made Northern Ireland and
              the Republic of Ireland their tourist destination? Is the joint
              advertising campaign providing value for money to the Northern
              Ireland Tourist Board? Also, when will the new chief executive be
              appointed?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to value for money issues,
              advertising of any kind, as the Member will know, is extremely
              difficult to measure. At the same time, if it is not undertaken
              people will complain. We can only point to the fact that in the
              last few years there have been steady increases in the number of
              tourists and in the amount of their spend. Also, 400,000 enquiries
              per year have been generated as a result of the advertising. There
              is evidence on the web sites, and surveys are carried out to ask
              people where and how they heard about Northern Ireland. That gives
              some indication.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member will know that in any walk of life
              or in any commercial activity it is difficult to measure precisely
              how much activity comes through any particular type of advertising
              promotion — there is a variety of types. I am satisfied that the
              position with regard to advertising and promoting tourism is
              essential. Here in Northern Ireland, we are operating at one third
              of the capacity that I believe our industry has, if you compare us
              with our nearest neighbours in Scotland and the Republic.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the last point, proposals are
              under way for such an appointment. As the Member will understand,
              the current appointment is temporary, and I hope the situation

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will answer questions 2 and 12 together.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On 26 October 2000 I issued a consultation
              paper to ministerial colleagues, the Enterprise, Trade and
              Investment Committee, the business representative bodies and other
              social partners of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The consultation has ended, and I have received
              many helpful comments and representations. I plan to make a

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Kennedy:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Minister’s response. He is
              undoubtedly aware that local authorities in Northern Ireland play
              an important role in economic regeneration. In his review, will he
              undertake to give positive consideration to increasing that role?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member knows my views on the role that
              local government can play in economic development, since I have
              experience of it, and was involved with it at the start of the
              1990s. The answer to his question is &quot;Yes&quot;. However, I
              have to add the caveat — which we have announced in the
              Programme for Government — that we will be carrying out a review
              of public administration generally, and that will include local
              government.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That reform proposal, when carried out —
              which I hope will be sooner rather than later — will result in
              the capacity of local government being increased in order to deal
              with many of the social and economic issues that local authorities
              face.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, there already is, and will continue to
              be under any new proposal that I will be bringing forward to this
              House, a meaningful role for local authorities in such things as
              the Business Start Programme and in other partnership models,
              where I believe local authorities can bring not only resources and
              expertise, but local knowledge, which is absolutely critical to
              ensure that agencies of the Department are fully informed and
              aware of local needs and local sensitivities.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Minister agree that the proliferation
              of quangos in Northern Ireland was the result of the many defects
              of direct rule, that it led to unaccountable government and that
              it was wasteful of public money? Can the Minister assure the
              Assembly that he will move speedily to dismantle these quangos and
              introduce accountable government to the people of Northern
              Ireland?</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I entirely agree with the remarks of the hon
              Member. I believe that quangos were a substitute for, and a
              visible expression of, the absence of genuine accountable
              democracy. As the Member knows, the Department of Enterprise,
              Trade and Investment has a limited number of agencies. We are
              currently examining those. I hope that, in time, he will see my
              determination to ensure that the number of such organisations is
              fewer rather than greater. However, we have to understand that
              there are a considerable number of quangos. There are scores of
              organisations; some are very large and some deliver significant
              services. I believe that in the review of public administration
              that the Executive has indicated it will be undertaking, these are
              exactly the issues that will be considered. I hope that all
              Assembly Members will have input into that review. I entirely

              local entrepreneurs in trying to progress their business at a much
              quicker pace, does the Minister agree that effort should be made
              to cut out all unnecessary red tape? Perhaps a single agency,
              properly resourced, would contribute to that.</p>
              <b>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I take the point. I have answered previous
              questions about regulation and red tape. I have carried out a
              review of my Department, and, indeed, later this week I shall meet
              my officials again to examine whether particular regulations are
              absolutely necessary. Section by section, my Department will
              examine every piece of paper that has been generated to see
              whether it is essential.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The need for quicker responses is growing all
              the time, because of the changing nature of the businesses that we
              are being asked to support. The Assembly is committed to assisting
              the knowledge-based economy, and companies require quick responses
              — the old way is no longer the right way. I fully understand the

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I certainly expect to make use of the

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am disappointed to hear that the Minister is
              only considering an IDB presence. He has already referred to
              Northern Ireland’s untapped tourism potential — a matter that
              is within his Department’s remit. There are moves to promote
              inward investment, which is a necessary part of local economic
              development, so the Minister should say definitely that there will
              be a Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment presence in
              the Brussels office — not that he is just considering it.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Responsibility for establishing the office lies
              with the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First
              Minister. I have made representations on this subject, but it is
              for the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister
              to decide the shape and nature of the Brussels office.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When I was a director of the Northern Ireland
              Centre in Europe I encouraged moves to establish the office. I was
              also involved in designating the site that has now been obtained;
              it is an excellent location directly beside the European
              Parliament building. The former Northern Ireland Centre in Europe
              had some IDB support to enable it to hold functions and bring
              people in, and the centre was used for that purpose on a number of
              occasions. I hope and expect that the same will apply in this
              case, but it requires the agreement of the Office of the First
              Minister and the Deputy First Minister. We have some
              representation in Germany, and we have organised a campaign to
              raise our profile in mainland Europe for early next year.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope to give a positive response to the
              Member’s question in due course. I hope that that will be the
              outcome.</p>

              an IDB presence in Brussels. Does he agree that co-ordination
              would be enhanced greatly if the IDB office were to be located in
              the Executive Committee’s office?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree. It would make sense for IDB to be in
              that office, rather than in a separate one, and I have made
              representations on that basis. I also hope that it will be
              possible to reach whatever accommodation is required with the
              Northern Ireland Centre in Europe. Any Executive business on the
              European mainland should be carried out there, thus creating
              economies of scale. Anyone working in the office would have a
              status within the European system that would give them certain
              advantages. I am sure that you will appreciate that point, Madam
              Deputy Speaker. Anyone operating separately from and independently
              of that office would not have the same status, and that would
              diminish their role. I therefore fully support the Member’s
              views.</p>

              ensuring that electricity prices are cost-effective rests with the
              independent regulator. Northern Ireland Electricity plc (NIE) and
              the regulator issued a joint statement on 7 December on the
              introduction of a comprehensive package of measures aimed at
              mitigating the effects of the 9% increase in tariffs from January
              2001.</p>

              the Minister, has direct responsibility in this area, I am sure
              that the Minister will accept that all of us in the Assembly have
              a duty to address the problem of fuel poverty, which leads to
              hundreds of deaths every year. Will he and his Colleagues in the
              Executive Committee undertake to persuade NIE to take account of
              those in fuel poverty before it hikes its prices again?</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am very conscious of the anger that was
              expressed in this House on the day that the increase was
              announced. You will recall, Madam Deputy Speaker, that we were
              having a debate on that very day and the views of Members were
              expressed from all sides of this House with equal vehemence.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member for East Londonderry (Mr McClarty)
              will be aware that the question of fuel poverty rests with my
              Colleague, the Minister for Social Development. However, my
              Department and I are conscious of the overall position with regard
              to electricity prices in Northern Ireland, which is and remains
              totally unsatisfactory.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Members know, part of the problem rests with
              the contracts that were entered into in 1992, and part rests with
              the costs of distribution and transmission — which remains an
              NIE matter. Another part, which is outside our control, relates to
              rising world fuel prices throughout the year 2000. A cocktail of
              issues is involved.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are trying to address those issues through
              more open competition — 35% of the market will be open for
              competition by April 2001. That primarily affects the commercial
              sector. However, the reality is that we are continuing to seek a
              long-term viable solution to this energy problem which has haunted
              us for the last nine years. It is only when we try to look at the
              global picture that we can get a response. Every time that there
              is an increase we are increasing upon a very high base. That is
              the fundamental problem, and we are trying to address its core
              rather than take a piecemeal approach to it.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister’s reply illustrated the problem
              and the extent to which he appears to be powerless. He pointed out
              very strongly that the Assembly had debated this matter and that
              there had been accord right round the Chamber. Surely it is
              important, after nine or 10 years of these impossible contracts,
              that we should in some way be able to buy ourselves out of the
              horrible situation where domestic electricity prices are 53%
              greater than in the Republic and industrial electricity prices are
              75% greater. How can we compete in the industrial sector?</p>

              executive of NIE on two issues — first, on the prices which have
              been referred to; secondly, on shareholders taking less and
              passing more profits back to the consumer, given the total cartel
              situation? Will he look at legislation to give the independent
              regulator more power to address the gross distortions that have
              been mentioned in relation to transmission and distribution?</p>

              legally binding contracts.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He talks about buying out, but we are talking
              about huge sums of money here — and I emphasise that. This is
              not small change; we are talking about hundreds of millions of
              pounds. I am trying to find a mechanism to deal with this that
              does not break the bank of the Department of Finance and
              Personnel. Consultants have been appointed, and a team is looking
              at this every few days with a view to finding a solution. I can
              assure the hon&nbsp;Member, however, that it will not be easy.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At present, the regulator is engaged in a

              Northern Ireland Electricity have some control. The differential
              between distribution costs here and those on the mainland is
              growing, and that is a worrying factor. I said in a previous
              debate, and I repeat now, that we are planning to introduce a new
              utilities Bill in the next session. That will look at the
              regulator’s powers. It is my intention to increase the regulator’s

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to fuel costs, the Member will know
              that the contracts that have been entered into with the generators
              have two parts. There is a standby cost, which is an availability
              payment that the generator gets for having the facility available
              to Northern Ireland Electricity. There is also the direct cost of
              the fuel that is necessary to generate the electricity. The
              contract therefore has a variable part in the sense that the fuel
              cost element of it is directly linked to market prices.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The problem with this is that they are starting
              from a high base. When the contracts were entered into, the extent
              to which generators could make efficiencies in the power stations
              was underestimated. The efficiencies that were made have resulted
              in there being large gaps between the cost of generation and the
              contracts themselves, and so the generators have very lucrative
              contracts under those circumstances. The only solution to that is
              contained in my reply to the hon&nbsp;Member for South Down
              (Mr&nbsp;McGrady).</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The other matters that the Member referred to
              — if I picked them up correctly — are primarily ones for the
              regulator to deal with. When we introduce a utilities Bill, which
              we will have the opportunity to discuss in great detail, it is my
              intention to get down to the actual cost detail. That is the
              position, for instance, in Great&nbsp;Britain. Then there is the
              whole question of who and how. The consumer’s interest, of
              course, has to be represented in these matters, but that is a
              question for another day.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first objective is to increase trade.
              Clearly, the Republic has been one of our fastest- growing markets
              for a number of years. Looking at other examples in the EU where
              two countries have a land border, the relevant trade here is on a
              much smaller scale than is the case in France, Germany, Holland or
              Denmark. We are building supply chains. For instance, if there are
              companies on this island that could be trading with each other,
              there are opportunities for reducing supply chains, thereby
              reducing stockholdings. Goods could be sold on a just-in- time
              basis.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We will be looking at measurement. Output can
              be measured, in part, by the growth or otherwise of the amount of
              trade undertaken between companies here and companies in the
              Republic of Ireland. There will be networking opportunities, and
              we have already tried to promote some trade shows — we have had
              four so far — to try and get people to realise the potential of
              trading with those who are close to them. For example, Belfast
              City Council had &quot;meet the buyer&quot; days, which were
              intended to bring in people whom the council traded with, and
              people whom they did not trade with. New people came in and we
              generated new suppliers that we did not have before. The principle
              is exactly the same. One of the best methods of measurement is to
              see how trade actually increases, and we intend to do that.</p>

              million, designated over a six-year period, is rather small.
              However, the programme will identify best practice through a
              number of highly focused projects, which will deal with all issues
              of equality in the workplace, for those already in work and for
              the unemployed. There are a range of other programmes attracting
              greater levels of investment from my Department, which go directly
              to the training programmes that the Member has expressed concern
              about.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not aware of any concern regarding this
              matter. Written consultation with almost 150 interested bodies was
              undertaken in June and July of this year. In addition, a number of
              workshops were held for special interest groups to outline their
              views on the EQUAL Programme.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The findings indicated that the greatest
              support was for facilitating access and return to the labour
              market, which is in the employability pillar. Under the equal
              opportunities pillar, reducing gender gaps and supporting job
              desegregation was also well supported. These two areas are
              included in the draft proposal. Promoting lifelong learning and
              opening up the business creation process for all were also popular
              areas in which initiatives can be taken. However, these areas are
              already being dealt with by significant Government and other EU

              allocating and administering funds under the European Peace
              Programme. EGSA is contracted by the Department to undertake this
              role. In allocating funding it is required to contribute to the
              peace objective of benefiting communities in an equitable and
              balanced way, focusing particularly on those areas and sections of
              the population most affected by conflict and suffering most
              deprivation. Its specific contribution is to direct support

              question on equality. Does the Minister agree that there is a
              continuing need for education in all constituencies? Is he aware
              of the £4·3&nbsp;million spent during Peace&nbsp;I? Only
              £26,000 was spent in my constituency of East Antrim. If there is
              a continuing role for EGSA during Peace&nbsp;II, can the Minister
              ensure that the funding will be spread more widely to areas of
              need throughout Northern Ireland in the future? I am sure he will
              agree that all constituencies have such areas.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree that there are areas of need. EGSA
              responds to need. However, EGSA allocates its resources not on a
              constituency basis but on the basis of need that has been
              identified. That is in accordance with a fundamental principle of
              the current Programme for Government — namely, Targeting Social
              Need and simultaneously ensuring equality of opportunity for all.
              If, however, the Member has specific concerns I will be only too
              pleased to receive the details and to discuss the situation with

              centres are located in large towns, in urban environments. This
              has the unfortunate effect of discriminating against those in
              rural areas, where such centres are not available. Twenty-four per
              cent of the working population make up what we call the low skills
              base, and this is largely centred in rural communities. In view of
              that, I propose the creation of a mobile literacy centre, which
              would enable the more widely distributed rural communities to take
              advantage of adult learning programmes. Will the Minister consider
              funding such a scheme?</p>

              has particular suggestions in mind, I am open to receiving them
              and giving them detailed consideration.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Part of the question may anticipate issues
              relating to initiatives that may be taken with regard to a
              University for Industry, and the learndirect centres that will be
              established under its auspices. These are beginning to take root
              right across the North. Using modern means of electronic
              communication in particular, and ensuring that people from all
              backgrounds — and particularly those with special needs — have
              access to these centres, we will be able to go a long way towards

              undergraduate enrolments at higher education institutions in
              1999-2000 against the 18-to-54-year-old population, and these

              full-time undergraduate enrolments at Northern Irish higher
              education institutions per thousand of the population was just
              under 30 at 29·8. That compares to ratios of 32·4 in England,

              Minister raised the issue with other UK Ministers, and what plans
              has he to expand undergraduate enrolments, perhaps through using
              the institutes of further and higher education to ensure that more
              graduate places can be supplied?</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is amazing how frequently the same issues
              come up under different questions. I addressed the issue in a
              previous question pertinent to the Member’s supplementary. I
              repeat myself for the Member’s benefit. As a result of the 1998
              comprehensive spending review and my announcement earlier this
              year of Government support for the Springvale educational project,
              some 2,240 additional university places will be phased in between
              1999 and 2004. Any further expansion will be subject to
              consideration of budget proposals. With respect to our further and
              higher education institutions — the FE colleges, as they are
              more commonly called — the Member may be aware of initiatives I
              am taking to expand enrolment in those institutions. In
              particular, as the experimental phase of the foundation degrees,
              which will be introduced next September, rolls out, we will see
              over the coming years an increased number of places made
              available.</p>

              afford students the opportunity to pursue studies across the water

              their work with their other responsibilities. Members may have

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The campaign itself has grown out of a number
              of previous initiatives within my Department, focusing on
              childcare needs and the development of what might be described as
              family-friendly policies in the workplace. It is designed to be
              much more inclusive, prompting employers to take account of many
              of the needs and interests of their workers, as opposed to
              focusing exclusively on the family needs of workers.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In many respects, it is likely to focus on the
              management of time, flexitime and part-time work. In this age, as
              the use of electronic means of communication in the workplace
              increases, we will have to consider whether it is necessary for
              all work to take place on the actual premises of an enterprise. It
              will consider a wide range of related issues, as well as workers’
              outside interests, such as service to the community. It will ask
              how employers might make adjustments to take account of those
              factors and create more positive conditions for employees,
              particularly in enterprises. Obviously, over the next three years
              of the campaign, time will tell how effectively those broad
              objectives are being met.</p>

              this sector. Can the Minister assure the House that during this
              review good, clear policies will be proposed to counter arguments
              of abuse and that there are people in the Department and in the
              Executive who are well able to devise such policies to enable
              house sales to be made available to the over-60s?</p>

              potential abuse. I agree, and for that reason we have a degree of
              ambiguity. However, there is enough expertise and knowledge to
              ensure that we can get the problem sorted out reasonably well and

              elderly people, he can purchase it. However, someone over the age
              of 60 who moves into the same house cannot. Can the Minister
              assure us that that aspect will be dealt with in the review? And

              planning permission for a sizeable development of land for housing
              purposes is asked for, part of the land is allocated for social or

              As a result, I sincerely hope and believe that the CAB’s

              given through SSA offices, it must follow that fewer people will
              be going to the Citizens’ Advice Bureau (CAB). Having said that,
              I also wish to express my appreciation of the CAB’s work. It
              does an excellent job across the Province. I recognise that, along
              with other groups, the CAB has had a moratorium on funds, but that
              is the position. We hope that after the announcement of 11 October

              designed by the Northern Ireland Housing Executive to meet a
              particular need in that part of the city. The Housing Executive
              has a duty to tackle north Belfast’s chronic housing need
              aggressively, to stamp out bad housing and cut down on urgent
              housing need. I am determined that that will be done with energy
              and creativity. This is an operational matter, however, and, that

              the means whereby this strategy can be fully implemented. As he
              knows well, north Belfast has the worst housing in all of Belfast
              — indeed, throughout Northern Ireland. The Minister’s reply is
              therefore somewhat laissez-faire in its thrust and lacking in the

              the concerns of Mr&nbsp;Maginness and myself. Its members do not
              give this the same priority as we do. I regret that, and I have no

              and the consequences of 60 job losses at this time of the year, or
              indeed at any time of the year, cannot be overstated. These job
              losses will take about £1 million out of the local economy —
              spending power that will be lost to local business, which will
              have to grapple with the knock-on effects. It is conceivable that
              some businesses may be forced to re-examine staffing levels to
              take account of the loss of these manufacturing jobs. In essence,
              we are not just talking about 60 jobs, because more may depend on
              this long-established company’s subcontracts and the money it

              level playing field for this sector. However, I ask the Minister

              context. In addition, can the Department’s agencies,
              particularly the IDB and LEDU, undertake a comprehensive review of
              textiles to determine what can be done to protect remaining jobs
              and safeguard some of the Province’s older companies?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I deeply regret the fact that a consultation
              process has begun with the trade unions. It may be that some
              redundancies will take place in the first quarter of 2001, with
              the remainder towards the end of 2001. However, I want to make a
              couple of points. First, while the company advised the IDB of the
              impending job losses, it did not seek financial assistance. I
              understand that the decision reflects on the inability of the
              Hilden operation to match the cost of synthetic thread products,
              which can be sourced more cost-effectively from Asia.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also understand that they have a strategy of
              focusing on speciality products and that the company is receiving
              Industrial Research and Technology Unit assistance on a number of
              technical matters. These include a method of bonding and sewing
              threads using an innovative curing system rather than the current
              solvent-based system.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Department initiated a review last June. We
              appointed Kurt Salmon Associates as consultants. The report has
              been completed, although I have not yet received it. However, I
              hope to make a statement about it after the recess because a
              number of Members have asked me questions on those matters and
              have great concerns. However, what can be done is being done.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ironically, in the next few days when certain
              figures will be released, Members will find that there is still a
              degree of buoyancy in certain sectors of the textile market.
              However, in this particular case the company has taken a strategic
              decision to protect its position, bearing in mind that it is a
              substantial company currently employing some 300 people.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I understand and sympathise with the Member’s
              concerns that such a large concentration of job losses in the
              Lagan Valley area has a knock-on effect. However, I believe that
              the company has made the strategic decision to specialise in areas
              where it will not be facing the wall of Asian competition with its
              low-wage economies, as it is very hard to compete under those
              circumstances.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Close:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister for his reply to my
              Colleague from Lagan Valley, Mr Davis. I wish to place on record
              my and my constituents’ concern at such a potential loss of jobs
              at such a historic company — one which has its roots deeply
              imbedded in the Lagan Valley constituency.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is the Minister aware that rumours have been
              circulating for a protracted period about the firm? Will he ensure
              that there is no asset-stripping in the concern? Will he also
              ensure that all the grants that have been provided — for
              example, through IDB — are secured and that there will be no
              attempt to remove machinery, et cetera, from the country?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, I will say to the Member for Lagan
              Valley that the company has made no request for financial
              assistance. The company took a strategic decision, and this
              announcement was made. To be precise, Hilden is to become a centre
              of excellence for speciality threads to be used in the manufacture
              of car airbags, seatbelts, sportswear and upholstery products.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to what the Member describes as
              asset- stripping, IDB, of course, has rules about how assets are
              treated if those assets are currently in receipt of IDB resources.
              That may not be the case in this matter, but we are acutely aware
              of the sensitivities of these matters. Any company that has an
              agreement with us has to honour its terms and conditions. It is a
              legally enforceable document — and I draw that to your
              attention, Mr Deputy Speaker.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I stress that the company will remain a
              significant employer in the Lagan Valley area. It has a clear
              strategy as to what it wants to do. It was its decision and the
              company has made no recourse to us for assistance.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Lewsley:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I add my dismay to that of my two Lagan Valley
              Colleagues concerning the number of job losses at Barbour Campbell
              Threads. One of the issues raised by many of its workers was the
              lack of consultation. I am glad to hear that consultation started
              in June, yet well over a year ago I spoke to some people from IDB
              about concerns that had been raised. One of the biggest issues was
              the lack of consultation between the workforce and the management.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.15 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Also, machinery was removed from Barbour
              Campbell Threads and sent to Hungary, and Coats&nbsp;Viyella has
              another venture in Asia. Is the streamlining a bit more sinister
              than we thought? In the past, it was suggested that Lisburn would
              be a centre of excellence, but how many people will be employed in
              it? Very few, compared to the current numbers.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The work force at Barbour Campbell Threads is a
              tightly knit community, and two or three people in the same family
              could lose their jobs. The impact on the quality of life for many
              in that community will be horrendous. Many of those people have
              been kept waiting to hear when they will lose their jobs; they
              could not find other employment, because they were not told when
              they would be made redundant. If they wished to take redundancy,
              the company would not let them. People have been badly put upon,
              and the Minister should take that into consideration.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I sympathise with the people who find
              themselves in those circumstances. It is not a unique situation;
              people elsewhere, particularly in the textiles industry, have
              experienced exactly those problems. However, the Member must be
              aware that consultation with trade unions is a matter for the
              company and the unions.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I appreciate the local circumstances and that
              individual families can be disproportionately affected, but I must
              point out two things. First, there is the whole question of
              outsourcing, which is the process by which companies based in the
              United&nbsp;Kingdom carry out part of their functions overseas.
              That will be a growing problem. Some indigenous
              Northern&nbsp;Irish companies are now, as a matter of policy,
              outsourcing in regions such as Sri&nbsp;Lanka, north&nbsp;Africa
              and South&nbsp;Africa. That will not change, and we will be
              confronted with that in a range of situations. We will have to
              return to the issue because, sooner or later, someone will seek
              assistance for outsourcing. That will be a big issue for the
              House.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must also consider the general position in
              the Lagan Valley. There are 41&nbsp;IDB client companies in the
              Lagan&nbsp;Valley area, employing almost 5,000&nbsp;people. I
              shall put that in context: selective financial assistance of £80
              million has been made available in support of projects worth some
              £240&nbsp;million in the past five years. There has been
              substantial IDB activity in the constituency. Even in the worst
              case scenario, Barbour Campbell Threads will still have
              230-240&nbsp;employees and will still be a substantial force. They
              have the technical ability to turn the plant into a centre of
              excellence, as has been discussed for some time. Funding has been
              made available, and the Industrial Research and Technology Unit
              has assisted them with the technical aspects. We are trying to
              take the necessary steps to protect the long-term future of the
              company.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Poots:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The size of the company makes this a serious
              blow to the local economy. What investment has IDB made in Barbour
              Campbell Threads? Does the Minister know how many jobs will be
              available when the new centre of excellence is created?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall write to the Member with details of the
              assistance that has been available for the long term. I repeat
              that we were not asked for anything additional.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It will remain a significant player in the
              constituency. Also, Coats&nbsp;Viyella has decided to sell certain
              parts of its businesses, and a number of Northern Ireland
              companies in its clothing and household furnishing sector are for
              sale at the present time. The thread business is going to remain
              the core business for Coats&nbsp;Viyella. I cannot say how much
              long-term funding was put into it, but I do know that in 1997 a
              letter of offer was issued to Barbour Campbell Threads in the sum
              of £1·4 million. To date, £733,000 has been drawn on the basis
              of that letter of offer, so there is an ongoing arrangement, which
              I assume is linked to either sales or employment targets. It might
              be better if I were to write to the Member with the precise
              details, but that is the statistical situation at this stage.</p>

              </font></b><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I
              brought the issue of the Toome bypass to the attention of the
              House by way of an Adjournment debate because of the anger and
              frustration felt by people west of the Bann at the Minister’s
              shock announcement that this project was once more going to be put
              in suspension, delayed or cancelled.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It may be that the Minister is playing hardball
              with the Executive or with the Minister of Finance and Personnel,
              or it may be that he is playing politics with a very critical,
              strategic issue around the Toome bypass. If he is playing hardball
              with the Executive or with the Minister of Finance, knowing that
              this is a vexatious issue that has caused hardship for a great
              number of years, he may feel that by creating a lot of controversy
              around his remarks he can force the hand of the Minister to give
              him the extra moneys that he is looking for.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I suggest that the Minister would have had a
              more responsible and responsive position had he carried on this
              debate in the Executive, and not outside the Executive, and that
              the place to decide these issues of urgency, of hardship and of
              crisis is in the Executive and not outside it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is barely a year since the Minister’s
              predecessor, Peter Robinson, arrived in Toome, to a fanfare of TV,
              newspaper and Department of the Environment personnel coverage, to
              launch, in a blaze of publicity, the Toome bypass project. We,
              along with the assembled gathering, were told that the money had
              been secured. We were told that construction would commence by the
              end of 2001. It may be that it will commence towards the end of
              next year, but we do not know. We are waiting for the present
              Minister to indicate, perhaps in a more realistic way, what his
              intentions are regarding an issue that is critical, that has
              caused hardship, and that we know from the reduction of the acute
              services in the Mid-Ulster Hospital could cause death itself.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some 21,000 vehicles — a conservative
              estimate — travel this road daily, and some 5,000 people in
              construction, education and the health services travel from areas
              west of the Bann to Belfast and back.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Each day we have two-mile-long queues, and
              average speeds are seven to 14&nbsp;miles per hour. This occurs
              for one or two hours in the morning and for one or two hours in
              the afternoon.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These are critical issues for people who live
              west of the Bann. The road infrastructure west of the Bann is bad
              enough as it is. A bypass around Magherafelt has been awaited for
              many years. We are disadvantaged, yet we are being further
              disadvantaged by this Minister. He lives west of the Bann, and one
              would think that he would have a vested interest in ensuring that
              the Toome bypass be put in place quickly. Perhaps, politically,
              the Minister would be chopping off his nose to spite his face —
              I do not know.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want Members to consider the critical issue
              of health and the Health Service west of the Bann, where people
              currently have to travel from Magherafelt to Antrim in
              emergencies. Travelling times have increased. From Swatragh to
              Magherafelt took 19&nbsp;minutes. The time taken from Swatragh to
              Antrim rises to 36&nbsp;minutes. Travelling time from Draperstown
              or Ballynascreen has risen from 13&nbsp;minutes to
              36&nbsp;minutes. The small towns of Tobermore, Bellaghy, Moneymore,
              Castledawson and Magherafelt have all had extra travelling time
              imposed upon them, just on the one simple issue of health. They
              are also bedevilled by the traffic congestion that ensues on the
              way.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Increased travelling times to Antrim will
              increase mortality rates. That is borne out by the Ambulance
              Service. It tells us that in cases of acute pain — such as when
              people are in a traffic accident or are having a heart attack —
              people’s lives are in danger unless they are dealt with inside
              of eight&nbsp;minutes. We now have a situation where it takes
              16-36&nbsp;minutes for people to get from west of the Bann to a
              hospital in Antrim — principally because of the difficult
              situation caused by the absence of a Toome bypass.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We can play politics with this issue, and it
              would be the simplest thing in the world to do so. However, I
              contend that this is too important an issue, too critical an
              issue, and an issue that has been outstanding for too many years,
              to play politics with. It is an issue that is economically
              damaging. We talk about the price of fuel, but if people are
              sitting in a traffic queue for an hour in the morning and an hour
              in the evening, just imagine how much fuel is being used up. That
              is apart from the damage that is being done to the environment. It
              all mounts up over time.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I notice Mr&nbsp;Peter Robinson talking through
              his hand as usual. Perhaps he will take his hand away from his jaw
              and let us know what he is trying to say — he being the Minister
              who promised this bypass less than a year ago. However, the DUP is
              playing its usual funny little games.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We could play politics with this issue, and we
              could develop it into a political debate. Unfortunately, it is all
              the people west of the Bann who are suffering as a result of this
              delay at Toome. It is all the people — DUP, UUP, PUP, Sinn Féin
              and SDLP — who are affected, damaged and hurt by this delay. It
              is a daily delay at Toome. It occurs seven&nbsp;days a week, not
              just on the five working days.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister allocated £460 million in the
              recent Budget. In detail, where is this money going? Can he tell
              us of an area in the North of Ireland — in the Six Counties —
              that is in greater need of this money than the area affected by
              the Toome bypass? Can he detail exactly where and into what areas
              that £460 million is going? Can he tell us that he is not playing
              politics with the Toome bypass but is committed to alleviating the
              hardship that is being inflicted on a daily, weekly, monthly and
              yearly basis on the people west of the Bann?</p>

              Northern Ireland to fix and to renovate after the work of the
              terrorist army linked to Sinn Féin.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This has further led to the lack of real
              investment in any future development in Northern Ireland. These
              people complain that they are treated as second-class citizens.
              Surely we are being treated as second- class citizens at the hands
              of these terrorists, who have prevented any real development in
              Northern Ireland. How can Sinn Féin have the face to ask for more
              money in Northern Ireland when, in the past, they have easily
              allowed Government money to go up in smoke?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am surprised to hear the DUP Minister for
              Regional Development announce that his Department has difficulty
              in funding major work. In January 2000 Gregory Campbell’s
              predecessor, Peter Robinson, announced at a press conference in
              the O’Neill Arms Hotel in Toomebridge that the Toome bypass
              would go ahead. Mr Robinson gave a commitment to the people of
              Northern Ireland, claiming that he would listen to the people and
              explain why decisions are taken. Mr Robinson said that
              construction would start in late 2001 and would take approximately
              18 months to complete. The finance was to be provided by the 1998
              Chancellor’s Initiative package.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Robinson described the Toome bypass as a
              major development that would help the people of Northern Ireland
              and relieve traffic congestion. Did Mr Robinson not plan ahead at
              the time? Why was there so much hype, if there was not enough
              money to pay for the bypass? Could Mr Robinson not have told us
              the state of his Department’s finances at the time, rather than
              indulging his party in a blaze of publicity?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is now apparent that a major challenge to
              the policy has taken place, both at departmental level and with
              the DUP Minister. Both Mr Robinson and Mr Campbell are prepared to
              engage in political stunts rather than address the real needs of
              the people of Northern Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Toome bypass is absolutely necessary to
              link industry with the east and the west, whether it is stock in
              transit, people travelling to and from work, or sightseers on a
              tour of our beautiful Province. Direct rule has prevented the
              direction of finance to the most needy areas of Northern Ireland.
              Now, with the devolved Administration, we have the opportunity to
              prioritise as we, the people of Northern Ireland, see fit. Toome
              is a significant bottleneck, a narrow bridge over a river flowing
              north from Lough Neagh. In modern life, people do not want to be
              delayed. Aeroplanes or boats do not wait for customers if they are
              stuck in traffic congestion.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Excess pressure is put on commuters and
              frustration arises. Over the years, Mid Ulster has been socially
              and economically neglected, and it seems to have been considered
              unimportant in many regards, including road infrastructure. Being
              centrally situated, the area is ideal for businesses targeting the
              whole of Northern Ireland. Fifty-four of the top 1,000 Northern
              Irish businesses are situated in the Sperrin area. If Mid Ulster
              were more accessible, industry would be more attracted to set up
              in the region, thus producing more jobs and encouraging people to
              live there instead of in the city.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unemployment rates in the area are
              significantly higher than the Northern Irish average. There is a
              higher proportion of self-employed men and women in Mid Ulster
              than in Northern Ireland as a whole. There are a huge number of
              farmers in Mid Ulster, and we all know the problems they face at
              this time. Unfortunately, with the present depression in
              agriculture, it is becoming more commonplace that farming alone
              cannot bring in sufficient income for a satisfactory standard of
              living. The result is increased commuter traffic.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A bypass at Toome is essential for the future
              of the region west of the Bann. We must make Mid Ulster more
              accessible, for otherwise our efforts to promote the area for
              tourism and other industries will be wasted. The people of Mid
              Ulster want to share the benefits and attractions of our area with
              everyone across Northern Ireland and beyond. The bridge at Toome
              will carry traffic in both directions and will therefore benefit
              everyone.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McClelland:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker, I will take your advice and
              be very brief. I understand that there are several Members waiting
              to speak, and that the Minister will want to respond. All those
              who have spoken said that they did not want to play politics with
              this issue. What did they do then? They played politics with it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have a special interest — if not a vested
              interest — in this subject. I am very proud to have been born in
              the village of Toome. I attended primary school there — they
              have not yet put up a blue plaque on the wall, but perhaps they
              will. I represent Toome on Antrim Borough Council.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This debate is not new. Since first elected to
              Antrim Borough Council, I have met with every direct rule Minister
              to present this case. No one needs to be told that this road joins
              the two major cities of Northern Ireland and several surveys have
              been carried out on traffic density. Approximately 20,000 vehicles
              pass through the village every day and it is estimated that the
              number will increase to approximately 30,000 by 2017. Where was
              the planning during the decades of direct rule that did not
              envisage this level of traffic density on this main road bridging
              our two major cities? With the ending of direct rule, and the
              start of our own Assembly, the people of the area — and of the
              whole of the north-west — had very high expectations that this
              programme would receive a high priority in government.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to pay tribute to my colleagues on
              Antrim Borough Council who, for decades, have been pressing
              successive Ministers for this bypass. One of my colleagues on the
              council can affirm that even during the latter part of the 1980s
              — when it was not politic for local government Ministers to be
              meeting with Ministers of State to discuss issues such as the
              Toome bypass — Antrim councillors were regularly meeting with
              Ministers to press for this development. The council has also
              worked very closely with the local community group in Toome,
              Tidal, in providing finance for a variety of surveys on the
              density of traffic going through Toome and the environmental
              impact on the village.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Any delay in this programme will be disastrous
              for the people of the village and will have wider implications for
              the economy of the north-west as a whole. For years, the people of
              Toome have had to suffer the impact of traffic congestion,
              pollution, noise and delays. In addition, there is now what is
              called &quot;rat running&quot; — cars taking short-cuts through
              the small rural areas surrounding Toome village, with the
              attendant destruction of the rural and farming communities in the
              area.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All these issues impact on the people of Toome
              and mean a poorer quality of life for them. They also have a
              dramatic impact on economic and tourist development. Environmental
              plans and the commencement of a new industrial development
              strategy for the area are badly needed if unemployment levels are
              to be reduced.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need the road for many reasons. We need it
              for the people of Toome, for economic growth in the whole of the
              north-west and to improve road safety. We need it, as Mr&nbsp;J
              Kelly said, because of the importance of acute services and the
              fact that the Ambulance Service has to move between the Mid-Ulster
              Hospital and the new Antrim Area Hospital. We need speedy access
              to our ports and airport, and to provide tourism, not only
              locally, but throughout Northern Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not subscribe to the view of one of Mr
              Kelly’s colleagues, who wrote to my local paper recently to say
              that the Minister’s decision not to proceed with the bypass was
              sectarian. I do not believe that there is some sad little civil
              servant sitting in a car in Toome counting the number of Catholic
              cars and Protestant cars going through the village. I would,
              however, impress on the Minister the need to proceed with this
              project for the benefit of the people of Toome and the whole of
              the north-west.</p>
              <b>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am delighted at the interest — albeit
              belated — that some Members have shown today in Toome and the
              Toome bypass. To the best of my knowledge some of them have never
              made a statement about Toome in their lives. It is always good to
              find that there are some takers and comers along the road, but I
              will return to that shortly.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some Members told us that they are endeavouring
              to assist in getting the project off the ground, but they are
              giving misleading information. The Minister never said that he was
              going to put the Toome scheme into suspension, as one Member from
              Mid Ulster said — a Sinn Féin/IRA Member. To the best of my
              knowledge, the context was that if necessary funding were not
              forthcoming, all the schemes that were being processed at that
              time might not be carried out in the timescale that was mentioned.
              That was the tenor of the Minister’s speech.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There was talk about the fanfare of publicity
              in Toome a year ago. I remember that morning well. My hon Friend
              Mr&nbsp;P Robinson attended as Minister, and everywhere the
              cameras went, Mr&nbsp;J Kelly followed or tried to get in front of
              them. One could see his neck stretching out every time a
              photograph was being taken of my Colleague and me. He wanted to be
              sure he was in it. When it comes to fanfares and cameras, the said
              person is far from shy; he wants to be there in the forefront, if
              humanly possible. There is so much hypocrisy about this issue that
              it is sickening for those who have been campaigning for Toome for
              over 20 years. However, let us push aside some of the minutiae
              that are being brought up.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is and has been an important issue. It is
              so important for the area west of the Bann and for Mid Ulster that
              the Member of Parliament for Mid Ulster and an Assembly Member for
              Mid Ulster — the same person, representing Sinn Féin/IRA — is
              missing. He is not here for this important discussion. This issue
              is so important that it has frustrated Members and engendered
              anger in their bellies. However, it seems that the matter is not
              so important to the Member of Parliament. Of course, MP does mean
              &quot;Missing Person&quot; so far as the constituency is
              concerned.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There has been so much hypocrisy about the
              Toome bypass. It is interesting that they say that they are
              worried about people’s lives. There is a fly in the ointment;
              they were not interested in people’s lives during the past 30
              years of terrorist violence, when people were murdered and maimed
              and the ambulances needed to get through Toome to get not to
              Antrim Area Hospital but to the excellent services at the Royal
              Victoria Hospital. We have heard an awful lot of hypocrisy; they
              want to grab the headlines, rather than deal with the situation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am glad that the hon Member for Mid Ulster
              (Mr Armstrong) has found out where Toome is. I must be honest —
              over the 28 years that I have been in public life, I had never,
              until now, heard him making a statement about a Toome bypass.
              However, it is better late than never, I suppose. It is good that
              he has found out that Toome and the rest of the constituency
              actually exist. However, it ill becomes people to chide those who
              are endeavouring to do their best for the area, when those people
              have done nothing for the area themselves.</p>

              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr William McCrea:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was delighted that one of the first
              ministerial acts by my hon Friend the Member for East Belfast (Mr
              P Robinson) was to come to Toome and announce the proposals for
              the design of the bridge. Now, that was not regarded as sectarian,
              but it is regarded as sectarian to consider the wider financial
              aspects. Toome was not an isolated scheme; all schemes of similar
              magnitude were considered as part of the overall package. The
              people west of the Bann appreciated the fact that a DUP Minister
              was taking their interests into consideration and putting
              something in motion by unveiling the design proposals for the
              bridge and the bypass.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the Chancellor announced his initiative
              and talked about his proposals, few elected representatives
              actually heard him — it is amazing how they listen to what they
              want to listen to, and then shut off. They welcomed the Chancellor’s
              statement, not realising, of course, that the Chancellor said that
              the scheme would happen as one of a series of proposals that would
              benefit from the money accrued by the sale of Belfast port. It was
              simply and directly connected to that sale.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At that time Minister Robinson prioritised the
              roads programme, and Toome was a beneficiary of that. Mr Campbell
              followed Mr Robinson’s policy, but — and he would be right to
              tell people all about this — the moneys allocated to his
              Department were changed. It would have been possible to make a
              start on all the schemes that were included in the proposal in
              year one. That is what the Ministers — past and present —
              wanted to do, but, of course, they did not have the money. Not
              even the Jews down in Egypt, who were receiving special help from
              the Almighty himself, were able to make bricks without straw.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The debate may be helpful. Although the money
              for year one was safe, the capital roads budget for years two and
              three seemed to be under question. To the best of my knowledge, we
              are politicians and this is a debating chamber for politicians,
              though that is not always evident, given that some contributions
              are always read, and sometimes badly read. If those speaking in
              this debate today are politicians of conviction — though it
              seems that we are not politicians if we are bringing politics into
              this — and if this debate means something to the parties and is
              not just &quot;huff and puff&quot;, today could mark progress in
              this Chamber.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the Members from Sinn Feín/IRA, the Ulster
              Unionist Party and the SDLP who have spoken are making commitments
              on behalf of their parties to do everything in their power to
              ensure that the finances for the road budget are restored,
              progress will have been made today. But I have a feeling that, as
              usual, when their arms are twisted up their backs, they will cave
              in and prove themselves to be jellyfish, rather than men.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, I would be happy to be proved wrong.
              If that is the case, we can be assured that the Members I referred
              to are not seeking headlines but are trying to ensure that the
              Minister has the finances to do the job. My conversations with the
              Minister have convinced me that no one would be happier to make
              sure that this scheme and others in the programme were processed
              properly.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I ask the Minister to ensure that there is no
              delay and that everything necessary is being done. Have the
              necessary procedures been put into place and into operation to
              ensure that there will be no delay in the programme for the Toome
              bypass, if the funds become available? We have seen that the
              goodwill in the Chamber has grown, and I have no doubt that the
              issue will be easily overcome. Are the planning process, the
              environmental studies, the vesting programme — if that is the
              way forward — being processed now to ensure that there will be
              no undue delay in the creation of this bypass?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unlike some who have spoken, I have campaigned
              with genuine conviction for the creation of a Toome bypass for
              over 20 years. Mr McClelland of the SDLP said that he is familiar
              with the congestion because he comes from the area. I appreciate
              that, and I understand his conviction, because he has experienced
              the problem himself. I too speak with conviction, for I believe
              that the bypass would benefit not just the west of the Province
              but the entire region. It would be beneficial because it would
              remove the west-east divide. There should be one Province with the
              people of Northern Ireland enjoying all its benefits.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are two industrial sites in the area, one
              of which is at Creagh, on the verge of Toome. The other is on the
              Ballymena side of the town. This road is vital to attracting
              industry. It is important to ensure that people and industries do
              not avoid this area because of congestion, delays and pollution.
              Many issues hinge on this decision. That is why I know that my hon
              Friend will listen carefully to those whose belief in this issue
              is genuine and not based on political gain or belated interest.
              The Toome bypass is necessary to the well-being of the people of
              that vast area in the west and in the adjoining constituencies and
              council areas.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is why I ask my hon Friend to ensure that
              nothing impedes progress. I hope and believe that all Members of
              the Assembly will unite in pressing for additional finances for
              the second and third years. If they do so, there will be no
              problem in ensuring that the Toome bypass becomes a reality, and
              that is what really counts.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An advantage of speaking at this stage in a
              debate is that one does not have to repeat everything everyone
              else has said. A disadvantage is that one directly follows the
              Member for Mid Ulster, who has dictated the Minister’s
              winding-up speech to him.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I certainly acknowledge the Minister’s quite
              clear problems in the realm of finance, but I do not think that
              they are entirely inflicted on him by others. Sometimes I wonder
              if they are not inflicted by the &quot;hokey-cokey&quot; policy of
              the DUP. Perhaps if one pulls Peter out to put Gregory in, one
              pulls out Peter’s proposals and aspirations at the same time. I
              trust the Minister will show this afternoon that he has not
              forgotten all the commitments that we thought were given earlier
              this year.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One project in the Department for Regional
              Development’s proposals that is worrying to me when compared to
              the Toome scheme is that to upgrade — I believe that is the
              euphemism — the Westlink in Belfast. I certainly acknowledge
              that there are problems with freight going through the city and
              that the Westlink can get thoroughly jammed. However, examining
              the possibilities, there are alternatives — particularly with
              public transport, but also with roads — which could reduce the
              demand for over £40 million worth of improvements on that
              stretch. There is a real fear on the part of many experts that all
              it will achieve is to speed the traffic jams up to three quarters
              of a mile through the city with a deterioration in air quality for
              those living in the area.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">By contrast, the Toome proposals would cost
              under a third of the amount required for the Westlink. There is no
              alternative, and there would be significant environmental
              benefits, not only for those who travel through the village, but
              more particularly for those who live in and around it. Mr John
              Kelly referred to the problems of ambulances and to the fact that
              hospital services are now centralised. However, this is not just a
              problem for ambulances; it is a problem for freight vehicles,
              private cars and buses as well.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a bizarre situation in which the
              Maiden City Flyer, the most efficient way of getting between
              Northern Ireland’s main two cities, cannot get through Toome in
              the morning in time for people to catch the Enterprise to Dublin.
              It is hard to imagine anything more bizarre than businessmen from
              Derry driving to Belfast to catch a train to Dublin because of the
              inadequacies of public transport resulting from the congestion
              that is solely in Toome.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of course, the railway might make a slight
              difference at some stage, but even if it removes the north-west
              traffic we cannot expect it to take out traffic from the mid
              Ulster and mid Tyrone areas, and possibly parts of west Tyrone as
              well. There is a major need for the bypass, for in its absence we
              shall see the entire area grinding to a halt. There is no
              incentive for people to use public transport to improve their
              travelling times for, because of the jams, it is even slower than
              private transport.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Representing South Antrim — and therefore two
              thirds of the length of the proposed bypass, rather than the third
              which others represent — it is my great fortune that I rarely
              travel through Toome in the rush hour. When I do, it tends to be
              in the opposite direction to the main traffic flow. However, what
              I see is quite enough to convince me of the need for a bypass
              soon.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Reference has been made to the previous
              Minister’s visit to the O’Neill Arms Hotel to launch the
              exhibition on the bypass proposals. I have a confession to make. I
              did not manage to squeeze into any of the pictures; I was not seen
              beside Mr J Kelly, Mr McCrea or Mr P Robinson. I was in this
              Building on Assembly duties while the exhibition was being
              launched. However, I travelled there that evening, which gave me a
              much better opportunity to see the exhibition, though a slimmer
              chance of getting on television. I had the opportunity to speak to
              local people, and it was quite clear that there is deep feeling in
              the village and its surroundings on both sides that the bypass is
              needed now. It is very rare that one finds people whose land is to
              be affected by a vesting scheme for a main road saying &quot;Yes,
              this area needs it.&quot; However, I heard that said in the O’Neill
              Arms Hotel that night. Clearly, the feeling in the district is
              that priority must be given to the bypass, and we must take note
              of that.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.00 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Currently, we have a temporary throughpass in
              the village, which seems to have made a marginal improvement in
              travelling times. This was clearly accepted by people in Toome,
              and certainly by Antrim Council, as a temporary expedient until
              the bypass was built — and it will only be accepted as such.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Why is there such reluctance from the Ministers
              responsible to do something about the Toome bypass? The Minister
              for Regional Development travels here most days from Londonderry,
              and the Minister of Finance and Personnel travels here most days
              from Derry. Perhaps they are being so careful about their own
              interests that they do not want to be seen to be promoting the
              Toome bypass, lest anyone have any suspicions of their personal
              motives. We could accept and understand that if they felt that
              they wanted to make progress on the scheme. People would not
              criticise them of being solely interested in their own
              circumstances.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To give one hint to the Minister, perhaps he
              and his Colleague the Minister of Finance could set an example.
              Instead of coming in two cars, some day they could meet up at
              Lisnagelvin and travel to Stormont in one car. That would at least
              cut down the traffic jam through Toome slightly. I am not going to
              suggest that they bring the Minister of Education as well — I am
              not trying to be unrealistic. The Minister for Regional
              Development and the Minister of Finance could co-operate that far,
              and the people of Toome would appreciate it. I have no doubt that
              what they would appreciate much more is giving this scheme its
              proper priority within the region — doing something to put the
              bridge and bypass in place immediately.</p>

              Toome for most of my adult life.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is an important development as it is a key
              access route to the west of the Province. However, we are now
              hearing that there is no money available for this, and it may have
              to be put back. That was not always so, and listening to Mr McCrea
              we hear revisionism at its best. We had a press release on 25
              January, wherein Minister Robinson announced, quite clearly —
              and there was no question about it then — that the Toome bypass
              would be built. He went to the O’Neill Arms to produce an
              exhibition and unveil plans. He even had a very public row with Mr
              J Kelly to make sure it made the headlines on the news that night.
              He went into enormous detail about the length of the bridge and
              how this would be and that would be. However, the new Minister, Mr
              Campbell, claims that there is no money for funding. At that stage
              there was no doubt at all, and this was the Department for
              Regional Development’s press statement:</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Funding for the bypass is being provided
              from the 1998 Chancellor’s Initiative, which announced
              investment for the physical infrastructure in Northern
              Ireland.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There was no doubt at that stage — no doubt
              at all — that this was to happen.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The question is &quot;What is the game?&quot;
              You could argue that Minister Campbell has been hung out to dry
              and has been left to carry the rap for a complete volte-face in
              the Department. With friends like these, who needs enemies? Mr
              McCrea told how he has been after this for 20 years. I wonder who
              was the MP for Mid Ulster for many of those 20 years. The only
              reason we are able to have Minister Campbell bringing this
              development forward is that the Ulster Unionist Party produced the
              agreement. Otherwise we would still be looking for funding for all
              this.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is there now an opportunity for Mr Campbell to
              do some lateral thinking? Perhaps there is a chance to look at the
              Toome bypass as a public-private partnership (PPP) — to develop
              it as a toll road. You could argue that it is clearly defined, it
              is outside the village and people will have a choice of coming
              through the village or taking the faster route. It would save £13
              million of Mr Campbell’s budget. Has he thought about that? He
              tells us regularly that there is no money for roads — they are
              underfunded — and he is absolutely correct. There is a serious
              crisis in Roads Service. Does his vision of the future include
              looking at alternatives, now that he has this opportunity of a
              complete turnaround — no money when Mr Robinson said there was?
              Perhaps he will comment on that when he gets the opportunity.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I
              support the motion from my Colleague Mr John Kelly, Assembly
              Member for Mid Ulster. I reaffirm our position that the Toome
              bypass should be put in place as quickly as possible. It is a
              long-awaited scheme, and we have heard how long people have been
              lobbying about it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unfortunately, the then MP for the area did not
              deliver that particular scheme, even when at the time he was
              propping up the Conservative Government. Even when he was
              maintaining his own position and theirs, and allowing them to
              continue to run down the services and the infrastructures, he
              could not extract a concession from them to make funds available
              for this simple bypass.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The scheme itself cannot be delayed any longer.
              It has been planned for a long time. People living west of the
              Bann have suffered decades of discrimination by the Stormont
              regime and the British Government. We are talking about
              discrimination not against Catholics, but against the people of
              the west — Catholics, Protestants and Dissenters. They have all
              lived in that area.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">From early on in the Unionist regime there was
              an awareness that repartition might be considered at some future
              stage. Therefore nothing at all was developed in the west. All the
              infrastructures, all the industries and all the hospitals were put
              east of the Bann. The attitude was that the rest of the population
              could come to the east if it wanted to avail of those services.
              However, the people were not provided with the necessary
              infrastructure to come and get the good of those services.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If one looks at the river Bann on the map one
              will see that the M2 stops just beyond Antrim, the M1 at Dungannon,
              and the railway at Portadown. There is no infrastructure right
              across from east to west.</p>

              he agree that the same east-west divide is highly apparent in the
              Republic of Ireland — so much so that it has repartitioned the
              country itself for purposes of positioning the west of the country
              better for EU grants?</p>

              better myself. We have often said that the west of Ireland has
              been discriminated against by the Dublin regime, by Stormont and
              by the British Government. In the South we now see a rebalancing.
              They are actually talking about repopulating the west of Ireland.
              We need to ensure that the same happens in the North and we will
              get repopulation of the Six Counties, so that we will get a fair

              that of the Minister, to the Omagh throughpass. Just like the
              Toome bypass, it is deemed to be at risk and may be deferred as a
              result of the 15 November announcement. I find it very unusual
              that the Member for South Antrim — sorry, the Member for Mid
              Ulster — Mr McCrea, was putting the onus on all the other
              parties to secure funding for the Toome bypass and these other
              road schemes. The Minister’s self-exclusion from the Executive
              table has cost many communities the money for these schemes.</p>
              <b>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree. Not only has the Minister not come to
              the Executive and argued for the money to be made available, but
              the previous Minister took advantage of the situation by making
              the announcement, laying down the plans and leaving it to the
              Executive to provide the money. He knew that he was not going to
              be there for the second round. He simply left Mr Campbell to clean
              up afterwards.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are now in a situation where we do not have
              the Minister who announced it, and we do not have the funds to
              deliver it, because there was no plan in place to ensure that the
              Executive would support it. It was simply a public relations
              announcement by Mr Peter Robinson at that time.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The village of Toome has suffered severely. It
              has been destroyed by pollution, traffic congestion and noise. The
              quality of life has been affected. Even the plaque that Mr
              McClelland was looking for would be splashed all over if it were
              put up at the moment, given the amount of traffic that is going
              through the village.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have to take all that into account if we are
              going to improve the situation and improve the quality of life for
              the villagers. One of the things that we have found down through
              the years is that villagers often feel that their village will be
              destroyed by putting a bypass around it. In this situation the
              village has been destroyed by the failure to put a bypass around
              it, and the failure to put the bridge in place. We need to address
              this problem. This is one of the main east/west arterial routes.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important that this bridge is put in
              place and that the infrastructure is developed. Not only is this
              the main east/west arterial route, but it is also the main
              arterial route for the DUP/LVF spokesperson from Mid Ulster, South
              Antrim, or wherever he is currently representing. He now travels
              between one constituency and the other, so it is vital that this
              bridge be built, for that would allow him to move between his
              constituencies quickly.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we are going to develop the west — and
              this is one of the main issues we need to address — we have to
              have the necessary infrastructure. Industrialists say that they
              cannot get their goods out or their materials in. If TSN is to
              mean anything in this Assembly, and if the Executive is sincere in
              trying to implement it, we need to target social need by providing
              adequate finances and resources. I ask Members to support this. It
              is unfortunate that the people who caused the whole east/west
              problem in the past are badly represented in the Chamber. There
              are only three Members — <i>[Interruption]</p>

              Campbell):</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The notes that I prepared before the debate
              have been borne out by most of the Members’ speeches, in that
              virtually everyone is agreed that Toome needs a bypass. It would
              improve journey times and reliability on the vitally important
              trans-European route between Belfast and the north-west, and it
              would also deliver environmental, community and safety benefits by
              substantially reducing the amount of traffic travelling through
              the village of Toome. I want to assure the House that my
              Department and I are keen to deliver a well-designed solution as
              soon as possible.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The proposed scheme is for a 3·5-kilometre —
              that is just over two miles — dual carriageway bypass to the
              north of Toome. The estimated cost is £13 million, and the likely
              contract period is 18 months. To ensure that local people were
              fully consulted about this scheme, my predecessor, Mr Peter
              Robinson, opened an exhibition in the village in January of this
              year. Good progress has been made since then, and the following
              steps have been and are being taken.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the statutory planning process, the
              direction order attracted one objection, but this was resolved by
              negotiation. The Committee for Regional Development and I have
              approved the direction order, and it will become operative in
              February 2001. That will complete the planning procedures.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The statutory environmental procedures have
              been completed without objection, and a notice to that effect will
              appear in the press later this week. That will allow my Department
              to proceed to the next stage of the statutory process, which is
              the vesting order stage. Roads Service has made an initial visit
              to all the relevant landowners, and I understand that they have
              proved co-operative so far. It is planned to publish the notice of
              intention to make a vesting order next month.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Department has further demonstrated its
              commitment to the scheme by advertising for project management
              consultants to oversee the design and construct contract. It is
              intended to appoint the consultants in the next 10 days, and the
              value of that scheme is about £400,000. I also plan a 16-week
              site investigation contract, to start next month, to obtain
              detailed ground survey information along the route of the bypass.
              That contract is valued at £100,000. An advertising —<i>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Campbell:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Also, there was advertising last week for
              horticultural contractors to undertake a contract to harvest and
              propagate local seeds to provide native planting to be used in the
              subsequent landscaping of the new road. That is a Northern Ireland
              pilot of a new UK-wide initiative.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to pay tribute to Roads Service staff,
              and their consultants, for all of their work to date. If all goes
              well with the land acquisition, the design and construct contract
              could be advertised in the summer of 2001, with the successful
              contractor undertaking the detailed design in the autumn and
              starting work on the ground early in 2002.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, despite all the progress that has been
              made, it is vital that my Department receives sufficient funds so
              that this and the other schemes in the major works preparation
              pool can proceed on schedule. Clearly, insufficient funds could
              delay the start date of some of these key schemes.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This matter seems to have escaped the notice of
              some Members, despite the fact that my predecessor sent them a
              letter on 20 July which not once, not twice, not three times, not
              four times, but five times indicated that these schemes would
              proceed subject to finance being available. It was stated five
              times in the one letter.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The recent Budget statement by the Minister of
              Finance and Personnel announced draft allocations for the year
              2001-02. That was done since my hon Friend, the previous Minister
              for Regional Development, made the announcement about the
              exhibition in Toome. However, using the normal financial planning
              assumptions, it seems that the funding available to my Department
              for the years 2002-03 and 2003-04 may not be sufficient to enable
              construction to start on all the schemes in the preparation pool
              which it is anticipated will be ready to start in that period.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I felt it important to make members of the
              Regional Development Committee aware of the possible funding
              shortfall when I met them on 15 November, and I welcome the
              opportunity today to discuss the matter further in this
              Adjournment debate.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the Toome bypass, I want to make
              it clear that when my predecessor, Peter Robinson, opened the
              consultation exhibition in Toome last January the scheme was
              subject to the statutory procedures and the availability of
              funding. I want to make that crystal clear, and I hope to have to
              say it only once — not five times. That is the case for every
              major works scheme. There is no scheme that I know of that
              proceeds irrespective of funding — none. If people do not
              understand that, then I do not know what they would understand.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Similarly, when I advised the Regional
              Development Committee several weeks ago of a possible funding
              shortfall, that was not a cancellation or a postponement of any
              scheme. It was merely a statement of the obvious: to build roads,
              I need resources. I am convinced that, through our consultations
              with local people and with our extensive environmental studies, we
              have come up with a bypass scheme that is an excellent solution to
              a very serious problem as well as being a scheme which enjoys
              widespread support throughout Northern Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have no wish to delay or defer this important
              project. I am aware of the benefits that it will bring. I am sure
              that with the goodwill and support of this House the necessary
              finance can be made available to my Department in the years 2002
              and 2003 in order to allow it and the other vital schemes in my
              major works preparation pool to proceed as soon as is practically
              possible. I hope to receive the support of this House to get the
              necessary resources so that these roads can be constructed.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One or two political comments have been made
              about where I would, or would not, go in order to get the
              necessary resources. I will do all in my power to ensure that
              these roads are built. The one constraint that I am faced with in
              ensuring that I get the resources is the manifesto election pledge
              upon which I was elected. I will not be departing from that.</p>
