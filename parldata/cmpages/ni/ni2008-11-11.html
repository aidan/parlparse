        <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The Assembly met at 10.30 am (Mr Speaker in the  Chair).</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Members observed two minutes&rsquo; silence.</p>
        <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="1"></a>Assembly Business</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I wish to inform Members that the Business Committee has agreed to suspend the  sitting for 10 minutes, from 10.55 am to 11.05 am, to accommodate Members who  wish to mark Armistice Day.</p>
        <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="2"></a>Ministerial Statement</p>
        <p class="H4StageHeading">Contingency Arrangements in the event of Apprenticeship  Redundancies</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I have received notice from the Minister for Employment and Learning that he  wishes to make a statement regarding contingency arrangements in the event of  apprenticeship redundancies.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning (Sir Reg Empey)</strong>: We are all well aware of the  current economic conditions, which affect each and every one of us in so many  different ways. We must all make adjustments to how we lead our lives and  manage our financial affairs. It is at times like these that businesses  naturally look to reduce their running costs to offset loss in revenue.  Usually, the apparently easy options are targeted. Often, however, those  options, while perhaps effective in the short term and offering a quick fix,  are not beneficial in the longer term.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Training is one of the easy targets, but, although cutting  that perceived luxury will save money and release staff time for the production  line, it can only end up halting the development and improvement of skills that  would otherwise improve performance and competitiveness. At the end of the day,  we train staff to create a better business. Cutting training provision may offer  a short-term fix for cost-saving purposes, but, in the longer term, it  threatens future growth. When the upturn comes &mdash; and it will &mdash; those who have  not kept up their training investment will be stuck at the starting gate, while  their competitors who did not take the quick fix will be well ahead, grabbing  the opportunities that will be there for the taking. We must ensure that  continuous professional and technical training is available, so that employers  are in a better position to strike when the iron becomes hot again &mdash; as it  will.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">However, I am not so naive as to think that resisting  simple cost-cutting measures will sort out all the problems. I understand  employers&rsquo; hesitancy to commit resources when the future appears so uncertain.  Unfortunately, people are losing their jobs as the downturn tightens its grip &mdash;  a situation that is particularly evident in the construction sector. There have  been several company closures and attempts to control costs through staff  layoffs. Sadly, apprentices are often the first to go because they are the easy  target.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">An apprenticeship has long been recognised as a respected  pathway to good training, a good career and good prospects. Apprenticeships  have ensured the continuity of the skills that industries need in order to compete  and grow in a vibrant and dynamic economy. We cannot, and dare not, lose that  route to skills development. Therefore, I announce several interventions that  my Department will implement to support the sectors that have been hardest hit,  namely the construction, engineering and motor-vehicle sectors, and to protect  the ethos and value of apprenticeships and preserve the skills pool. These  interventions are a measured response that is tailored to suit the point in the  economic cycle that has been reached. They can be reviewed quickly and built  upon should the situation change significantly.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Aware of the tightening of the labour-market situation, my  Department has been working on its response for some weeks. The first step is  the Department&rsquo;s engage&shy;ment with the Alliance of Sector Skills Councils, and other  relevant employer bodies, to encourage employers to take on any apprentices who  have been made redundant. Employers who have a strong tradition of investing in  apprentices will be encouraged to do that, as well as employers who have not  yet engaged with the provision. The Department will contribute a modest amount  of conditional funding towards the additional wage costs. This is an  opportunity for employers to stand up and be counted in this time of need; an  opportunity for leading employers to demonstrate why they are leaders; and an  opportunity for smaller employers to put their heads above the parapet and to  show competitors and customers what sets them apart.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I am delighted to report that several major companies have  indicated that they are prepared to foster additional apprentices. I appreciate  that a lot is being asked of employers; it is a difficult sell and will demand  sacrifices. However, I am already encouraged by the sense of partnership because  it demonstrates an acceptance that whatever affects Northern Ireland as a whole affects  everyone on an individual level. I am convinced that the co-operation of spirit  that has been demonstrated, and the willingness of industry representatives to  provide a safety net for apprentices, will go some way to resolving the present  difficulties.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Department is implementing provision to allow  apprentices who have been made redundant and cannot find an alternative  employer to continue training and to work towards completing their  apprenticeship framework. Under the Steps to Work employment initiative,  apprentices in the construction, engineering and motor-vehicle sectors, who are  aged 18 and over, will be offered level 2 or level 3 placements with employers  for up to 52 weeks. That will allow those apprentices to continue their NVQ  training and assessment. Separate arrangements will be implemented for further  education colleges to offer technical-certificate and essential-skills training  free of charge through evening or weekend classes. Apprentices will be entitled  to a benefit-based training allowance and may also qualify for other benefits  while they are on the Steps to Work programme.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Apprentices aged 16 or 17 who have been made redundant will  be eligible for the pre-apprenticeship component of Training for Success, which  allows them to return to training in order to complete the technical training  certificate and essential skills elements of an apprenticeship framework. It is  anticipated that the skills and knowledge developed during that training period  will make the participants much more employable, thereby allowing them to  complete the NVQ after they return to employment.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I recognise that the success of these interventions depends  on employer placements, which appears to run counter to the cause of problem  being addressed. However, I appeal to employers to help with the initiatives  and to work collectively for a solution. A basic tenet of apprenticeships is  that apprentices must be in employment in order to complete the framework and  to demonstrate competence in the workplace. No full-time training option can  deliver that.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The options that I propose also cost relatively little  extra &mdash; in the range of &pound;250,000 for every 100 apprentices, either in the  fostered employment or in Steps to Work. The pre-apprenticeship intervention  will be cost-neutral as part of the normal Training for Success provision.  Therefore, at present, the costs are reasonable and the interventions are  appropriately measured. I must say, however, that my Department and I will  continue to monitor the economic conditions as they change. Should these  interventions seem no longer appropriate, I will ask my officials to explore  further measures. I also believe strongly that there is no substitute for real  work experience while in training. That must always be a prime consideration  when arriving at any solution.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">My Department remains committed to the provision of  apprenticeship training and to the already substantial financial investment  that has been made in it. Furthermore, my Department remains committed to  ensuring that, despite the current economic predicament, a resolution will be  found that ensures the continuous provision of high-quality skills training. I  call upon all Members to work with my Department and me in order to promote  these interventions and to ensure that they succeed.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Employment and Learning (Ms S Ramsey)</strong>: Go raibh maith  agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his statement, which my  Committee will study carefully when it meets tomorrow. I have no doubt that  members will have questions for the departmental officials who will appear  before the Committee tomorrow on this very issue.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister is aware that the Committee has long been  interested in the issue of apprenticeships. The Committee recently produced a  report for the Assembly on Training for Success, which is a Department for  Employment and Learning (DEL) programme for apprenticeships. In the past few  weeks, the Committee has twice written to the Minister about its concerns over  the loss of apprenticeships during the current economic downturn, to which the  Minister referred.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">As the Minister said, one of the most worrying aspects of  losing an apprenticeship with an employer is losing the associated college  place. That is often a devastating blow to someone who has set their sights on  a particular goal and an occupation, which they cannot work towards once their  apprenticeship is lost. That has been highlighted by the Minister.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee has learned from the Department that between  September 2007 and the end of October 2008, the six regional colleges lost 230  apprenticeships because employers cancelled them. Construction industry  apprenticeships alone accounted for 164 of those places. On 5 November, the  Committee heard from the Construction Industry Group about the poor work  prospects in the industry and the knock-on effect of the downturn.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Committee members have also been approached by constituents  about the situation in relation to appren&shy;ticeships, and the Committee wrote to  the Minister in order to highlight those concerns. The Committee believes that  the interventions announced today may not be sufficient and it again wrote to  the Minister seeking further action, which resulted in his statement.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">As the Minister pointed out, the measures that he has  announced greatly rely on employers stepping forward to take up redundant  apprenticeships. It must be accepted by everyone that that will be difficult  and that it requires everybody to work together. I also encourage employers to  step up to the mark and to take on apprenticeships. The Committee supports  employers who help in such a way. However, as we move towards greater economic  difficulties, Committee members remain to be convinced that these measures will  be enough. It is likely that more and more employers &mdash; who often regard  apprenticeships as an unaffordable luxury &mdash; will have to tighten their belts.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister and his Department should consider measures  that fundamentally address the problems in an apprenticeship system that relies  heavily on the goodwill of employers and can unravel in an economic downturn,  as we are now witnessing. The Committee is aware of that situation and plans to  give the proposals further consideration.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I also welcome the statement personally. Will the Minister  outline the cost of his proposal to give money to employers who become foster  parents to apprentices? From the outset, it is important to find out the cost  of that proposal. The Committee is committed to working with the Minister to  tackle the crisis. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">10.45 am</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I thank the Chairperson of the Committee for her  comments. She said that the measures may not be enough, which may be true. This  is a calibrated response &mdash; over the past few weeks, we have examined the  options open to us, because we could see trends developing. I have made it  clear that, rather than being the end of the matter, the measures that I propose  are a response to circumstances. Those circumstances may change, and I do not  rule out further interventions.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We will pay around &pound;40 a week to an employer who fosters an  apprentice. There is no substitute for experience gained in the workplace. A certain  amount can be done in a classroom, but work-based experience is essential in  order to gain an NVQ. There has been a response from some employers, even in  the hard-pressed construction sector, who say that they are prepared to examine  the proposal. On a visit to a major factory last week, I received one  commitment to consideration of the proposal, and officials will visit that  factory in the next couple of weeks. Other significant employers have said that  they are prepared to examine my proposals.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Intervention is never easy. The fundamental driving force  is that we have encouraged young people to take up apprenticeships, and we have  encouraged employers to provide apprenticeships, only for young people to  discover that their contracts have been cancelled in the middle of their  courses and work placements. There are few more demoralising circumstances that  those young people could face. Rather than losing the work that those  apprentices have done, we are trying to find a way to continue the apprenticeships  so that they can attain the qualifications that they are working for and become  more employable. That is the rationale behind the proposals.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The proposals are not perfect. We have concentrated on  three sectors, because a critical mass of students is required for  technical-certificate classes to be viable, and the students are distributed  throughout the countryside. The proposals are by no means perfect and may not  be the last word on the issue.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I thank Committee members for their contribution, and  officials will explain the detail of the proposals to them tomorrow. We are  also thinking about the next stage, in case it comes to that. I hope that the  economy does not further deteriorate, but there is little point in having a  devolved institution if we are not prepared to respond to local circumstances  as they arise. That is one of the main reasons for the Assembly&rsquo;s existence. If  necessary, we will make further changes to the proposals.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I allowed the Chairperson of the Committee some latitude. When there is a  ministerial statement, it is only right to afford some latitude to the  Chairperson of the appropriate Committee. However, I remind Members that I  expect them to ask the Minister questions about his statement.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Newton</strong>: I  welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement. Like the Chairperson of the Committee, I wish  to express my concerns at the increasing number of apprentices who are being  made redundant before they have completed their training. All Members will be  sympathetic to that situation.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Department for Employment and Learning has made a great  deal of progress on apprenticeship training, but the Chairperson of the  Committee made the fundamental point that the current system is subject to  economic ill winds. Will the Minister examine policy and operational out-turn  in order to ensure that the system is not subject to a downturn in the economy  just so swiftly as has happened on this occasion?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I take the Member&rsquo;s point about the economic ill  winds, but we are living in the real world and apprenticeships are part of that  world. It would be difficult to be completely insulated from the economic  tsunami that we have faced in the past few months. I take the Member&rsquo;s point,  but the very fact that we become involved in these interventions makes its own  point. My Department and the Committee for Employment and Learning need to  reflect on the Member&rsquo;s statement rather than give an off-the-cuff reaction to  it.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I am very reluctant to go back to classroom-based apprenticeships.  Equally, if the employer were removed from the calculation, the quality of the  apprenticeship could deteriorate, because the employer will have made an  investment in the young person to make the apprenticeship viable. Having said  that, we are entering uncharted waters, and it would be unwise for any of us to  say definitively what we should or should not do in any circumstance. However,  I am prepared to reflect on what the Member has said, and I am sure that the  Committee will also reflect on what has been said.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Before I call Rev Dr Robert Coulter, I ask Members to keep their questions  brief as the sitting will be suspended soon.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr Robert  Coulter</strong>: I welcome the statement and congratulate the Minister and his  Department on the initiative. Will he agree that the problem of apprenticeship  redundancies may extend beyond the construction, engineering and motor vehicle  sectors?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: Sadly, the answer to the Member&rsquo;s question is yes.  We identified the sectors that have been most obvious to us in recent weeks,  and, indeed, the construction sector&rsquo;s position is well known. However, I will  keep the matter under review.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">If a critical mass of apprentices in other sectors were in  similar circumstances, and provided there were sufficient numbers that classes  could be provided in further education colleges, for instance, to help them to obtain  their certificates, we would be prepared to revisit the matter. At the moment,  however, the construction, engineering and motor vehicle sectors have the most  significant numbers of apprenticeship redundancies, but I will keep the matter  under review.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Business Committee has agreed to suspend the sitting to accommodate Members  who wish to mark Armistice Day. I, therefore, propose, by leave of the  Assembly, to suspend the sitting until 11.05 am.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The sitting was suspended at 10.54 am.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">On resuming (Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Molloy] in the  Chair) &mdash;</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">11.05 am</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I also welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement, but I do so with a heavy dose of  caution. This matter was raised at a meeting of the Committee for Employment and  Learning several months ago. I recall the somewhat passive responses of  officials on that occasion, and there is an echo of that in the Minister&rsquo;s  statement. Twice during his statement, the Minister told us that officials have  been working on the matter for a few weeks, even though the problem has been  emerging over many months. Therefore, I view the proposals as a first step  only, as does the construction industry, whose representatives referred to them  as &ldquo;broad-brush&rdquo;.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I will ask the Minister a specific question. In Scotland, the  contracts that are awarded by public bodies &mdash; including Government and public  authorities &mdash; require a certain percentage of apprentices to be employed in the  public works in question. Is the Minister prepared to consider doing the same  with regard to the &pound;16 billion of investment that was endorsed in the Assembly  &mdash; despite some opposition &mdash; in the past few months? Is he prepared to consider  making the employment of apprentices a condition of contracts for public works  for those who have been awarded tenders?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: The Member will have heard me say that I am open  to examining how the situation that confronts us will evolve. I also said that  I am open to further interventions if they are required. I do not necessarily  see this as being the end of the matter, because we cannot anticipate the  cycle&rsquo;s development.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Several different types of clauses are now written into  public-works contracts, and I am happy to write to the Minister of Finance and  Personnel, who is responsible for such matters, to draw his attention to the  Member&rsquo;s comments. The Department of Finance and Personnel has the overarching  responsibility for matters that relate to the construction industry, such as  procurement.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I say to the Member that it is not a matter of being  cautious, or of not responding to events. It is precisely because of my  concerns about this matter that my Department is responding. I have made it  clear that further responses and interventions will be made if they are deemed  appropriate and necessary.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement: I hope that it will be part of a series of  statements from Ministers trying to address problems in the Northern Ireland  economy. I am sure that the Minister agrees that the most important  intervention that the Executive could make would be to bring forward several  major capital projects, particularly to assist the construction industry.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Has the Minister&rsquo;s Department made any assessment of the  risks to the economy that may result from intervention? Is there any danger  that subsidising certain members of staff and companies may lead employers to  release other members of staff, which would have an impact on the unemployment  figures? Has he sought assurances from companies that all staff will be  retained if extra assistance is given to apprentices?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I agree that the Executive should consider a  series of measures that could be taken, but, without trying to politicise my  statement, the first priority for the Executive is to meet. Interventions can  be made across a number of Departments, including consideration of the profile  of the capital programme and planning policy statement (PPS) 14.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Undoubtedly, intervention involves risks, and my Department  is aware of those. We are concerned that we do not distort the market and we  are conscious of the criticism that payments made to young people and the  provision of young people to employers lead to a certain degree of  exploitation. I assure the Member that we are conscious of those issues and  that any involvement that we have with employers will take those matters into  account. We have been considering the issues and we are aware that intervention  in the market carries risks.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">However, that must be balanced with the demoralising plight  of many young people, who, having put their heart and soul into their work,  lose their job at a critical stage, perhaps when they have only a short time to  go before achieving a qualification, meaning that all of their work is  completely lost. I assure the Member that we will engage closely to ensure that  such exploitation does not take place.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hilditch</strong>:  I declare an interest. I have a son who has just finished a second-year  apprenticeship in plumbing but is already on his third employer, having been  made redundant twice.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We have seen at first hand in our communities the distress  and anguish that the current situation is causing to young people at the outset  of their working lives. I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement: as he said, it is a  start. Will he take the opportunity to pay tribute to and acknowledge the  efforts of the frustrated but resilient young people who wish to complete their  apprenticeships and remain in their chosen industries rather than walking away  and taking another job such as stacking shelves in the local supermarket?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I thank the Member for his comments; he is one of  several Members who wrote to me about individual cases in which people found  themselves in such a plight. My Department is trying to encourage young people  to get involved in apprenticeships, because they provide a route to long-term  employment.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">As I said in my reply to the Member for North Down Dr  Farry, we were concerned that those young people, having taken that first step,  may suddenly discover that all their effort has been wasted. They may have  spent 18 months working towards a qualification, and, through no fault of their  own, that may be taken away from them. In such a situation, it would be  difficult to motivate that person again. For that reason, the Department has  considered options to try to protect those people and to ensure that the work  that they have put into their apprenticeships can be carried forward and is not  lost to them.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I can think of little else that would demoralise people  more. The Member may recall that, in the past, people circulated on various  training schemes, time and again, like a merry-go-round, but achieved few  qualifications.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">11.15 am</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I agree with Mr Hilditch, and I commend young people who  decide to undertake an apprenticeship. The number of apprentices aged 24 and  over who have come forward to start apprenticeships has been encouraging and  interesting, and illustrates that it is not only younger people who want to  become apprentices. People are prepared to make career changes, and we  encourage them to do so because they may start a course when they are 17 or 18  years of age but, after a while, discover that the path that they have chosen  is not for them. The age limit has been removed, and we have improved flexibility  and provided people with an opportunity to take a different career path. I  strongly support Mr Hilditch&rsquo;s view that those people deserve to be commended.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Butler</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Ba mhaith liom f&aacute;ilte a chur roimh  r&aacute;iteas an Aire. I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Recently, I met the director of Belfast Metropolitan   College, who said that  his biggest concern was the number of apprentices who were unable to complete  their courses. Of the 230 apprentices who have been unable to complete their  courses, 164 are involved in the construction industry.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister said that, if the measures do not work,  colleges would offer full-time training with simulated practical work  experience. How long will those measures be given to take effect before that  option is implemented? Questions were asked about whether colleges and training  organisations could offer those facilities. However, even that would not be an  ideal situation, given that the other leg of apprenticeships is work  experience. There will be a skills gap, which the Minister mentioned. When the  economic climate improves, will colleges be up to speed and ready for that step  change, and will their apprentices be fully skilled and ready to go into the  workplace?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: It is for precisely that reason that we are  examining those interventions, and possibly others. Those measures will ensure  that, when there is an upturn in the economy, the workforce is prepared and  fully skilled.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Member will know that companies that invest in their  employees, and in their employees&rsquo; skills, are two and a half times more likely  to succeed in the workplace and in their chosen businesses than those that do  not. We are examining those interventions to protect apprentices&rsquo; skills bases  and to ensure that our aims, objectives and targets for improving the skills of  the workforce are not deflected. A simulated work environment forms part of  those measures. The colleges are fully engaged and working closely with the  Department. As I said, we are prepared to examine other interventions. To some  extent, the issue of timing will be dictated by events. We will want to work  closely with the Committee and with Members who are providing feedback about  what is happening on the ground in their constituencies. Collectively, we can  make a difference.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The measures will involve using a certain amount of  resources, because this cannot be done for nothing. Nevertheless, it is  incumbent on the Department to put its money where its mouth is and to  encourage employers to continue to invest in their workforce, even during the  financial downturn.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We are working closely with the colleges. They will be an  integral part of the entire process, because they are developing large elements  of the courses and qualifications. We are also working on those interventions  with the sector skills councils and the Alliance of Sector Skills Councils.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">That will, I suspect, be an ongoing process for quite some  time &mdash; well into next year &mdash; and I believe that there will be opportunities to  tweak and amend things according to circumstances.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>: I  welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement. It is a very difficult time for business, and  I look forward to other Ministers bringing forward the views of their  Departments on how they can help.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Although companies often see training as a cost, does the  Minister agree that it is also an investment opportunity that may help to  ensure the longer-term viability of companies, even in this time of recession?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>:  I, too, welcome the Minister&rsquo;s announcement. Will the Minister confirm whether  his Department will find the foster companies, or will apprentices have to find  their own foster companies? Will the Minister&rsquo;s measures cover those  apprentices who have lost their jobs over the past month or two, or will they  be covered by the new measures from here on in?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I apologise, Minister. Maybe you would like to answer both  questions at the same time.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: With regard to Mr Cree&rsquo;s question, I said in my  statement &mdash; and in speech after speech &mdash; that companies investing in their  workforce is good in principle, but it is good for their future bottom line. We  are not asking companies to do it for anything other than their own benefit.  All of the evidence points to the fact that companies that invest in training  survive recessions and emerge from them in a much stronger position. That is a  well-established fact.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We must, however, be realistic. If a company has a huge  cash-flow problem, and a wages bill to pay on a Friday, it is easy to stand  here and pontificate by saying that all the evidence suggests that companies  that invest do better. That is fact. However, I understand the difficulties; I  have been in that position myself. I know that it is tough to meet a wages bill  of whatever size, and training and maintenance and suchlike are easy to cut. I  say to companies &mdash; and I do not do so lightly &mdash; that leading businesspeople,  trade unions, and other Ministers with responsibility for skills throughout the  United Kingdom have come together in recent weeks to encourage companies  nationally not to slash their training budgets. We are doing that for very  obvious reasons.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">To answer Mr Easton&rsquo;s question: my Department is, so to  speak, going round leading suppliers of apprenticeships. We are, basically,  knocking on companies&rsquo; doors, explaining that we have a particular individual  in difficulty and asking if they can help by taking that person on and giving  him or her an opportunity to complete an apprenticeship. We are telling  companies that it is difficult to predict the numbers involved. Mr Butler  quoted figures from September, but I suspect that they have been overtaken by  events.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Member also asked what happens to someone who found  themselves in that situation on 20 September &mdash; has that person missed the boat,  or can that person avail of some of these opportunities? The answer is yes &mdash; we  will do everything we possibly can. We cannot solve every apprenticeship&rsquo;s  problem by these measures.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">They are confined to three sectors; therefore, individuals  in other sectors will not be covered. The Department&rsquo;s objective is to place as  many people as possible in order to give them an opportunity. As long as the  time gap is not too great, they ought to be able to be accommodated.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">From the colleges&rsquo; point of view, the new academic year has  started. However, it is not too far into it and, therefore, I hope that as many  people as possible can be placed. The Department will be as flexible as it can.  However, I cannot guarantee that every individual will be sorted out; that  would be misleading. We will do our best to accommodate as many people as  possible.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement. He is aware of the difficulties in my  constituency and in other constituencies. Further to Mr Cree&rsquo;s point; it is  important that other Ministers are proactive in tackling problems in these  difficult times.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister mentioned the possibility of a wage subsidy  for fostered apprentices. Has he raised with the Low Pay Commission the more  general problem of maintaining a living wage for younger apprentices who do not  fall under minimum-wage provisions?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: The Member is aware that the issue has been  debated on the Floor of the House on several occasions because it was feared  that there could be a degree of exploitation of younger people by employers.  One may suggest that the Department, while it has tried to rescue apprentices,  has, in the same breath, put an additional burden on employers.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Member is aware that, some months ago, I made a  submission to the Low Pay Commission about how much apprentices are being paid,  because, at present, they are not covered by the current national minimum wage  arrangements. I do not know the outcome of that submission yet. Therefore, the  only arrangements in place are between apprentices and employers. Until a  decision is made by the Low Pay Commission, the Department will be unable to  enforce any particular rate. The Department has decided on the particular rate  at which it will intervene. Thereafter, it will be up to the employer and the  apprentice to agree terms.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The situation is not satisfactory, and I hope that it will  be corrected. The Department has made a clear submission to that effect  because, on several occasions, there has been widespread support for that from  around the Chamber. I will inform the House as soon as I am aware of the Low  Pay Commission&rsquo;s response.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>:  Earlier, the Minister said that we have entered uncharted waters: that is  absolutely true. Will he assure the House that he has set his compass for the  future and that he will take every opportunity to ensure that further education  colleges and other education providers offer courses that are appropriate for  each area of industry?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: The Member is aware that substantial investment  has been made in further education colleges during the past years. Not only has  substantial and ongoing investment been made in the estate, investment has been  made in the curriculum and in the variety of courses available.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I assure the Member that the Department regards the further  education sector as a critical delivery mechanism: it is at the core of the  Department&rsquo;s view for further education. In fact, in the Programme for  Government &mdash; and, perhaps, people have forgotten that we have a Programme for  Government &mdash; the Executive made strengthening the economy the first objective.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">11.30 am</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Each Department with an input into boosting the economy has  several sub-targets. My Department is making further education a major element  of its mechanism for economic delivery, although it is more than a purely  economic issue. I assure the Member that the colleges are highly capable of  dealing with our current demands on them.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">However, as the Member said, we are in uncharted waters,  and I fear that, as time goes on, we may have to knock on their door again  soon. The Department funds the colleges from the block grant. The colleges may  argue that ever more is being asked of them by the Department. In trying to  salvage as much as possible from the apprenticeship programme, resource issues  may have to be considered, and, if necessary, I will do that.</p>

        <p class="H4StageHeading">Alcohol Misuse</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Ramsey</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
        <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly considers that the misuse of alcohol in  society causes serious damage to the health and social well-being of individuals  and communities; and calls on the Executive to formulate, and implement,  policies designed to reduce alcohol misuse.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to place on record that I am a director of Foyle  Haven, which is a drop-in centre for street drinkers and alcoholics in Derry. I thank Members and the Minister, who is on his  way to the Chamber, for their attendance today.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The abuse of alcohol is the single most challenging social,  health and economic problem that faces society. Recently, the Royal College of  Physicians of Ireland  called on the Dublin Government to take strong action on alcohol abuse, and it  proposed several measures. In January 2008, the college detailed the following  statistics: 88% of public order offences relate to alcohol; 34% of marital  breakdowns &mdash;</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. I support the motion, and I am sorry to  have interrupted the Member while he was in full flow. However, when a Sinn  F&eacute;in Minister is due to respond to a debate, but is not present in the Chamber,  everyone in the House highlights that fact. Today, the Minister of Health,  Social Services and Public Safety is not present, and I would appreciate being  given some idea of his whereabouts.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I understand that the Minister is on his way, and it is up to him  and the Executive to respond to the debate.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Ramsey</strong>:  I thank the Member for her comments, but the debate began earlier than  scheduled, and I assume that the Minister is on his way.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Alcohol is cited as the major cause of 34% of marital  breakdowns, and Members will have seen many such breakdowns as a direct result  of alcohol. How many families in our communities across Northern Ireland  have we watched become estranged because of alcohol? How many families live in  poverty and hardship due to alcohol?</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">One in every eight patients who attends an accident and  emergency department in the Republic does so as a direct result of  alcohol-related injuries. The recently announced figures for Northern Ireland  show that 6,000 people attended accident and emergency departments for the same  reason, many of whom were under 18.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I propose the motion because it is difficult to identify  another single factor that causes so much damage to people, particularly the  young, and to our communities and economy.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I will first consider what signals the Assembly should send  to the Executive, drinks companies and the public, after which I will detail  the extent of alcohol consumption. Finally, for the record, I will propose  several initiatives that I would like to see introduced.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the Minister to the debate. Members should signal  to him and his team that they have the full support of the Assembly for the new  strategic direction for alcohol and drugs. A signal must also be sent to the  Executive that it is essential that the issue of alcohol misuse is not simply  left to the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety (DHSSPS),  while other Departments consider it a mere add-on. Each of the relevant  Departments must treat cross-departmental issues as core responsibilities.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">People who are working to reduce alcohol misuse are  concerned at the level of buy-in of some of the other Departments. We need to  send out a signal to the independent community and voluntary-sector  organisations that we endorse strongly their work on alcohol misuse and  alcoholism.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">It is important to acknowledge the good partnership work  that is being done in many areas in Northern Ireland. Derry City  Council, the council with which I am most familiar, has a proactive  civic-alcohol forum that is working hard to reduce alcohol misuse. The council  is working with vintners to design and implement responsible codes of practice,  and community organisations &mdash; such as the Divert project &mdash; are offering  alternative activities to young people and educating them on the dangers of  alcohol misuse.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The PSNI in Derry have  worked hard to reduce on-street drinking, particularly among underage drinkers,  and many community and statutory organisations deal with addiction problems.  Derry City Council passed a proposal recently to ban on-street drinking in more  areas, and many residents in Derry &mdash; and in many other communities in Northern  Ireland &mdash; believe that on-street drinking should be banned in all areas.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that we send a strong signal to the people  of Northern Ireland  that demonstrates that we recognise the damage that alcohol abuse does to  communities, families and individuals. Alcohol abuse also has direct health  implications, and most importantly, we must demonstrate that we recognise the  associated behavioural, social and economic problems.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly should also send the signal that it is  concerned about, and for, alcoholics, many of whom end up homeless and on the  street. I know three alcoholics who, in the past month, have been found dead on  Derry&rsquo;s streets, having committed suicide or  died because of physical and mental-health problems that were related to their  addiction. The Assembly must demonstrate to alcohol companies and retailers  that we are taking the problem seriously and that we intend to deal with it.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In my introduction, I referred to some of the findings of  research that was done on the matter in the Republic. Those findings give a  stark overview of the scale of the problem and are similar to statistics and  trends in Northern Ireland.  Ireland, France, Luxembourg  and Denmark  top the world rankings for alcohol consumption. Those findings correlate with  those of the Department of Health and Children in Ireland,  which demonstrate a greater increase in alcohol consumption in Ireland than in  any other European country. The Irish Government take the problem seriously and  are enacting several measures to reduce alcohol misuse. The Strategic Task  Force on Alcohol in Ireland  aims to reduce alcohol consumption to the European average, and we should try  to do the same.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">England  has similar problems. According to the UK Department of Health&rsquo;s Alcohol Needs  Assessment Research Project in 2005, alcohol misuse in England costs  &pound;55&middot;1 billion a year, which is an extraordinary amount of money. Moreover, the  Scottish Government are consulting on a range of robust and imaginative  initiatives that are designed to reduce alcohol misuse. Given that all  Administrations experience similar problems, the Assembly should conduct its  initiatives in partnership with the Republic  of Ireland, Scotland,  Wales and England. Some  jurisdictions are ahead of us in their ideas and in good practice. The Assembly  should examine those models.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly should also examine policy initiatives that  are in place &mdash; or are being considered &mdash; in other regions. The big-ticket  issues relate to price consumption, accessibility, regulation and the promotion  of a cultural shift away from alcohol abuse towards healthier lifestyles. Some  of those measures fall within the remit of the Executive, and some are reserved  matters. However, the Assembly should pursue them all.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">There is a negative correlation between price and  consumption. The higher the price of an alcoholic drink, the lower its  consumption rate. Therefore, the Assembly should consider banning price  promotions and below-cost alcohol sale. In many supermarkets &mdash; which I will not  name &mdash; a six-pack of beer is much cheaper than milk or water. Furthermore, the  Assembly should consider banning alcohol advertising in the same way that  cigarette advertising has been banned.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We need to put measures in place to ensure that alcohol can  be traced back to the point of sale, and back to the purchaser if that is  technically possible. We need to ensure that anyone supplying alcohol to  underage drinkers is caught and dealt with effectively.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I thank the Member for taking my intervention. He refers to those who sell  alcohol. Yesterday, I met the Quinn family. In south Armagh,  and in other areas across the North, grave concern is caused by the sale of  counterfeit alcohol, sold &mdash; allegedly &mdash; in some pubs and clubs across the North  and from the back of ice-cream vans. That particular type of alcohol has  devastating consequences; we do not know what all is in it. Some say that after  one or two glasses of it, young people are going off their heads. I hope that  anyone with information on that will help the PSNI to track down these pedlars  of poor health and poor futures for young people.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Ramsey</strong>:  That is a good point. Alcohol is a poison in itself, but if young people are  being poisoned with additional substances, we should hand over any information  that we may have on that to the police.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We should raise the age limit for purchasing alcohol from  off-licences to 21, in order to prevent alcohol from getting into the hands of  children. We should charge a social responsibility tariff on bars and  nightclubs so that they contribute to the additional spending on policing and  health that is incurred as a result of the sale and consumption of alcohol. We  need to ensure that no bar will sell alcohol to a person who is drunk; we have  all been in bars where drunk people are standing at, or rather holding up, the  counter and yet alcohol is still sold to them. The law on that is only loosely  observed, and it needs to be tightened up.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We need a sustained programme of education in the dangers  of alcohol to be taught in schools, colleges, universities and workplaces. We  need to step up the public-awareness campaign against binge drinking and the  antisocial behaviour associated with it. There should be a blanket ban on  on-street drinking and drinking in public places, with restricted permission  given on a case-by-case basis.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In addition to the legislative &mdash;</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Will the Member bring his remarks to a close?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Ramsey</strong>:  Each of us adults needs to send out a strong signal that drink must be taken  responsibly.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Deputy Speaker, I thought that I was entitled to an  extra minute for taking an intervention from another Member.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: You have had your 10 minutes.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: I  thank the Member for tabling the motion. I have listened to him describe the  damage to families and relationships. Later today, I will bring before the  House a motion on drink-driving and the difficulties that that creates.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">This morning, I wish to talk about issues that relate  mainly to younger people. Over the past couple of days, we have heard and seen  evidence that more and more people under the age of 30 are showing signs of  early-stage liver disease. &lsquo;The Irish News&rsquo; reported that there has been a 22%  rise in referrals for that condition over the past 12 months.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">My stance is not anti-drink; it is possible for people to  go out and enjoy alcohol responsibly. However, we must examine the damage to  health and society that alcohol abuse causes, and see what Government can do  about it. Other European countries do not have alcohol-related problems on the  same scale that we have in the United Kingdom  or the Irish Republic. Here, the culture among many  young people is to get as drunk as possible as quickly as possible.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Not so long ago, I was a student in Dundee.  I was offered drink promotions of all kinds in virtually every bar and student  venue that I visited. It was commonplace for pints of beer to be offered at &pound;1  and vodka at 30p. Those were some of the offers advertised specifically to  young people and students. I recall that young people were often carried out of  bars and nightclubs or involved in alcohol-fuelled violence at the end of the  night. My experience is supported by police evidence, to the effect that much  of the violence that occurs on our streets &mdash; some 45% &mdash; is caused primarily by  alcohol.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">A culture of excessive drinking is now promoted in universities,  and the perception of university students is that they go out and get drunk  every night. Unfortunately, that image prevails in the media, and students in Belfast conform to that  stereotype. In January, the &lsquo;News Letter&rsquo; reported that, last year, Belfast had the highest  percentage of emergency admissions to hospital for alcohol-related conditions.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Universities are focusing on violence and antisocial behaviour,  and making efforts to stamp them out. Much of the blame has been levelled at  the drinks industry; it has a responsibility to ensure that it does not target  its drinks at teenagers. Ultimately, however, the choice to abuse alcohol rests  in many cases with the individual. Guidance must be forthcoming from parents.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">11.45 am</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I am unconvinced that further stigmatising alcohol is the  right way forward. When I was a student, I worked in the United States of America  for four months. I was struck by the fact that teenagers and other people under  the age of 21 did not drink alcohol. Liquor stores did not sell alcohol to  people who were under that age, so the age limit of 21 seemed to work very  well.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">However, I noticed that many of those younger people took  recreational drugs as a direct substitute. That led me to believe that the  important issue is not so much the price of alcohol or the age at which one can  buy it, but the attitude of young people towards alcohol. That is not to say  that price is not a contributing factor &mdash; because cheap drinks and longer  opening hours obviously offer young people more opportunities to abuse alcohol  &mdash; but there is a bigger issue that must be addressed.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In preparation for the debate, I read a number of articles  that argued that we should follow the lead of countries such as Sweden or Iceland  and increase the price of alcohol in our bars to somewhere near &pound;6 or &pound;7 for a  pint of beer, which is approximately the cost in Iceland. I am not convinced that  that is the way to go, because that would penalise people who act responsibly.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">However, we must recognise that cheap-alcohol promotions  are causing a problem, as Pat Ramsey said. I see merit in ensuring that people  are not encouraged to abuse alcohol. In the news yesterday, we heard that the  Westminster Home Affairs Committee called for pubs to ban happy hours and for  supermarkets to cease their cut-price drinks promotions. Individuals have a  responsibility to look after themselves, but it is unfortunately the case that  many young people avail themselves of the supermarket drinks promotions and get  very drunk before they even go out at night. That is a huge problem.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I support the view that laws on cheap-drinks offers, pub  happy hours and advertising campaigns that target young people should be  toughened. There is a list of medical conditions &mdash; such as heart disease, liver  disease, diabetes, strokes and mental-health issues &mdash; that young people do not  seem to care about at all when they go out and get drunk.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Unfortunately, many parents are also to blame. We have  talked about individuals&rsquo; responsibilities, but parents also have  responsibilities. Right across the country &mdash; from the most socially deprived  areas to the more affluent ones &mdash; parents buy alcohol for their children and  send them out for the night to drink on the streets. That is a problem that  society must tackle.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Some of the statistics that I read yesterday &mdash; such as the  fact that 648 children under the age of 10 had been hospitalised due to alcohol  &mdash; are shocking. The Assembly must take the lead in tackling the problem.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I welcome the opportunity to speak  in the debate. I apologise in advance because there is another engagement that  I must attend later, so I will miss some of the debate.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The misuse of alcohol can have a devastating effect on the  physical, emotional and mental health of individuals, their families and the  wider community. We have already heard about the direct and indirect costs of  alcohol misuse &mdash; those are very well documented. Although there is a clear onus  on individuals to ensure that they use alcohol wisely, there is also a very  clear responsibility to put controls and adequate preventative measures in  place to warn people &mdash; particularly the young &mdash; about the long-term effects of  binge or heavy drinking.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">There has been a marked change in patterns of drinking,  among young people in particular, over the past 10 years. Statistics  increasingly show that young people are misusing alcohol. Sometimes, children  begin drinking alcohol as young as 11. Ireland  as a whole has one of the highest levels of binge drinking among 15- and  16-year-olds in Europe, so those people are  particularly vulnerable.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Alcohol abuse can lead to a number of problems for  individuals. Young people are more likely to suffer physical, emotional and  social harm due to alcohol. It can also lead to their experiencing mental-health  problems in later life, or becoming involved in antisocial activity. In some  cases, it can lead to more serious crime.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The choices that we make when we are young can often have a  long-term impact on the course of our lives. Therefore, there is a responsibility  on parents, Government, schools, communities, the police and, particularly, the  drinks industry to ensure that young people have positive influences when  making those choices.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I do not want to concentrate solely on young people, but  some are addicted to alcohol. It is very important to highlight that fact,  because they need residential services, help and support to overcome that  addiction. That goes for all people who are addicted to alcohol, not just young  people.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We must be proactive in deciding how to intervene. I have  worked on an initiative that was established by the Inter-Church Addiction  Project, which is pushing for a dedicated residential facility to help young  people with addiction problems. It is clear that people with such problems need  more help and that a strategic approach must be adopted to providing that help,  which must include the provision of adequate resources at a community level. I  am aware that there is an overall strategic direction with respect to dealing  with the problem, but there must be more facilities at a local level.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">It is not only the individuals directly affected by alcohol  who need that support, but their families. People misuse alcohol for a variety  of reasons, some of which may relate to traumatic life experiences. Often,  alcohol abuse is a symptom of a wider problem. It is essential that people be  treated in a holistic manner and with respect and dignity. We need only  consider the case of the young man who died on the streets of Derry  a few weeks ago to appreciate that.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">More must be done to provide shelter for people with  addiction problems. It is hard enough for people to cope with an illness such  as alcoholism without having to worry about where their next meal is coming  from or where they are going to shelter from the cold each night.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The way in which alcohol is marketed also contributes to  the problem. For instance, there is evidence of a link between the number of  outlets that sell alcohol in an area and the level of alcohol-related problems  there. There is also a link between the price of alcohol and the level of its  consumption. Therefore, there is an onus on off-licences and supermarkets that  sell alcohol to ensure that it is done in a responsible manner. Drink  promotions need to be more controlled, and advertising should be banned on  television or other media outlets to which children and young people are  particularly vulnerable.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">A voluntary code of practice has been agreed by some  off-licences, and some community initiatives have strived to stop the sale of  alcohol to minors. Those schemes should be welcomed, but there needs to be more  of them. We all have a part to play in ensuring that effective preventative  strategies are in place to warn people of the dangers of alcohol misuse to  their health and their emotional and mental well-being, including the risk to  their family relationships. We must also ensure that adequate support services  are available to people with an alcohol addiction, and to their families. Go  raibh maith agat.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I am glad that the House has the opportunity to debate the issue of alcohol  misuse. I am pleased to state that the Ulster Unionist Party will be supporting  the motion. Alcohol misuse &mdash; or, indeed, abuse &mdash; is a serious problem in  today&rsquo;s society. Not only is it having a devastating effect on the health and  well-being of very many people in Northern Ireland, but it is  stretching our Health Service to the limit.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">It is well known that alcohol has massively damaging  effects on the health of those who abuse it. Alcohol can negatively affect  almost every part of the human anatomy. It is the second major cause of throat  cancer after tobacco, it can lead to high blood pressure and, if consumed  regularly, it can lead to an irregular heartbeat. It also has a devastating  effect on the lungs and the liver.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Owing to the increase in the overall consumption of  alcohol, increased numbers of people are dying as a direct result of alcohol  abuse. The figures speak for themselves: in the United Kingdom, the alcohol-related  death rate doubled between 1991 and 2006 from 6&middot;9 per 100,000 people, to 13&middot;4.  Alcohol has truly become a silent killer in our society.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">People can be affected badly in many ways because not only  does alcohol have a devastating effect on a person&rsquo;s physical health, but it can  lead to emotional problems, placing enormous strains on personal relationships.  Unfortunately, alcohol abuse is becoming a key contributor to the break-up of  many families here. Alcohol can become an addictive substance and, as such, it  commonly contributes to depression and many other mental-health problems. As  other Members have indicated, alcohol abuse is also a major factor in instances  of suicide and self-harm.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">It is well known that young people often abuse alcohol &mdash;  one only need walk around our town centres on a Friday or Saturday night to see  the evidence of that. I have absolutely no problem with people going out and  enjoying themselves at the weekend, but some are abusing that privilege. We  need to move away from the mindset that people must get drunk on a night out.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We live in a society in which binge drinking is considered  the norm. I wonder whether people would continue to drink such vast quantities  of alcohol if they really knew what was going on inside their bodies.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We must adopt a proactive approach to this matter. Therefore,  I welcome all public attention that is brought to bear on it. The mindset that  has developed over the past decade must not be allowed to continue.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The alcohol industry and the licensed trade have key roles  to play in tackling this matter head on. Recently, I have been pleased to see  some of the big supermarkets adopting the Challenge 21 initiative, in which  people who appear to be younger than 21 are asked for identification. Mr Ross  mentioned the time that he spent in the United States &mdash; most bars there  have agreed to seek identification from anyone who appears to be under 40 years  old. On my last visit there, obviously, I was keen to be asked for  identification. Hopefully, measures such as Challenge 21 will have the desired  effect of limiting alcohol abuse by people under the age of 18.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">It is too easy to buy large quantities of alcohol, and Mr  Ramsey highlighted the fact that the availability of cheap alcohol is a major  contributor to its misuse. I agree with that; however, over-taxing alcohol  tends to impact too hard on those who drink and act responsibly.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: The  Member mentioned the tighter regulations on selling alcohol to young people in America. Does  the Member also recognise that there is a massive drug problem among young  people in America?  In many ways, one form of abuse is being substituted by another, so there is a  bigger question about attitudes to alcohol and drugs that must be addressed.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member will have one extra minute.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Although I accept that a drug problem exists throughout American society,  including that in our discussions raises the problem that the people in the United States  who are penalised most for drug abuse are often not the heaviest users. There  are differences in drug usage even among people from the same ethnic  background. Drug abuse in America  raises a complex range of issues. Here, alcohol is the drug of choice, and it  has enormously damaging effects.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The availability of cheap alcohol must be addressed, and it  is encouraging to see some supermarkets acting responsibly and tackling the  problem head on.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In 2005, the Church   of Ireland released a  report on young people&rsquo;s drinking habits. Worryingly, it concluded that binge  drinking among Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  teenagers is the highest in Europe. I am glad  to see that the Health Minister recognises that trend and is being proactive,  and I look forward to the young people&rsquo;s drinking action plan being published.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">As other Members said, this matter affects a broad range of  Departments, and, therefore, it is time for it to be brought to the Executive  table; the Executive must meet and operate in order to tackle the problem.  Departments such as the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister  (OFMDFM), Education and Social Development, which is in charge of licensing,  will wish to feed in to any discussions &mdash;</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member should conclude his remarks.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  The Ulster Unionist Party is more than happy to support the motion.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  I thank Pat Ramsey for tabling this important motion, which my party fully  supports. However, given that the Executive have been on strike since early  summer, the part of the motion calling on them to act on the House&rsquo;s  deliberations seems slightly presumptuous. Given the serious legislative  shortcomings and worries throughout the community, I say shame on the lot of  them; they must get back around the table immediately and show people that they  can earn their salaries. The Executive&rsquo;s failure to act tars all Members with  the same brush and denies us the means with which to provide everyone in Northern Ireland  with a better future.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Alcohol, like everything else, if used in moderation, hurts  no one. Indeed, I am reliably informed that, in some instances, it can be good  for one&rsquo;s health. When it is abused, horrendous problems can be, and are,  created, and every Member is aware of the damage caused by alcohol misuse.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">It is not only the unfortunate person who succumbs to the  addiction of alcohol who suffers terribly, but their friends, relatives and the  public who see the sorry state that such an addiction can inflict on a person.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">12.00 noon</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Only last week, we heard the cries of a mother from Derry who lost her son. He was homeless, because of his  addiction to alcohol. I offer the sympathy of the Alliance Party to that mother  and her family, and I urge the Assembly to do something that will ensure that  such a tragedy does not happen in our society again.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Alliance Party is thankful for and grateful to the  groups that work day and night to help alcoholics, wherever they are. The Link  Family and Community Centre in Newtownards does extraordinary work, as do other  organisations, which work quietly at all hours of the day and night to help  addicts. Statutory groups and the Health Promotion Agency are also working to  overcome the scourge of alcohol.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Ramsey</strong>:  Does the Member agree that there needs to be cross-departmental action on the  proposals that have arisen from the new strategic direction for alcohol and  drugs? Such an approach would help to ensure that there was an integrated  service and a one-stop shop for people with addiction problems.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member has one minute extra.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  That suggestion is included in my speech; help must come from all Departments.  Alcohol abuse causes much despair and is the cause of many horrible road  accidents &mdash; as has been mentioned &mdash; as well as accidents at work and in the  home. The cost to hospital services is huge. It is estimated that the Health Service  spends some &pound;12 million on the provision of services to those affected by  overindulgence in alcohol.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Some of our great sportspeople who are seen as role models  have been hooked on drink. They earn high wages and are able to purchase  alcohol, but they do not see the disaster that is befalling them until it is  too late.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Every effort must be made to steer young people away from  alcohol. Advertising by the big suppliers must be curtailed. Pat Ramsey  mentioned the ban on cigarette advertising; there is no reason why the same ban  could not be imposed on the alcohol trade. Unfortunately, alcohol has become  inexpensive and too easily accessible for young people. They are hooked on the scourge  of alcohol before they know what is happening.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I support and encourage new policies to tackle the scourge  of alcohol misuse. As Mr Ramsey said, the Health Department should take the  lead in the fight against alcohol misuse, but the Education, Employment and  Learning, and Social Development Departments must also play their part.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Parents and guardians have a major role to play. It is  disgusting to hear about some parents encouraging their youngsters to drink  alcohol and buying it for them; that is scandalous. The parents should have the  sense to know where such habits can lead.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Sellers of alcohol must play a bigger part in ensuring that  their products do not get into the wrong hands, and they should refuse to sell  alcohol to a customer who has had too much already. Unfortunately, the recent  trends and habits of continuous heavy consumption that lead to weekend binge  drinking &mdash; particularly among the younger generation &mdash; make a mind-boggling  contribution to family breakdown, loss of employment and damage to health.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive must return to the table immediately; they  must lead our people out of despair and into a bright new future. I support the  motion.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: I  endorse Mr McCarthy&rsquo;s comments about the need for the Executive to meet again.  The DUP Ministers are available to attend an Executive meeting this Thursday,  along with the Ministers from two of the other parties that are represented in  the Executive. I trust that the other party will make itself available to  attend the Executive meeting on Thursday.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome Mr Ramsey&rsquo;s motion. The human cost to society of  alcohol misuse is huge. That is often demonstrated to its worst excesses on our  streets, where young people are involved in fights, which can lead to serious  injuries. Knife culture is often associated with alcohol misuse. As a  consequence of excessive drinking, accident and emergency staff in hospitals  are abused, while hospital beds are taken up with people whose injuries come  from their drinking alcohol, as well as with people whose injuries were caused  by someone who had drunk excessively. Alcohol misuse can also lead to people  developing seriously damaged livers and forms of cancer. No one can  underestimate the damage that excessive alcohol use can cause.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Having said that, drinking to excess is an individual  choice, although many people who choose to take alcohol start very young,  because of considerable peer pressure, or because they think that it is cool  and trendy or good fun to drink. Many of those young people do not realise the  risks involved. Consequently, they end up drinking far more than they ever  wanted to, or planned to, and end up damaging their health.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Pubs are part of the problem, and happy hours, and so on,  are a contributory factor. However, to some extent, we must look beyond pubs  and the drinks industry to the unregulated drinks industry. By that, I mean  those clubs that sell cheap booze that is made available illegally and  illegitimately, as Mrs Kelly pointed out. We must do what we can to eradicate  those clubs from the marketplace. Everyone has a role to play in ensuring that  illegal alcohol is not readily available throughout the country.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I support the view that off-licences should not sell to  anyone under 21 years of age. Many 12-year-olds, 13-year-olds and 14-year-olds  are getting drink from older brothers and sisters or from friends who are 18 or  19 years of age. Were the legal age at which people can buy drink to rise to 21  years of age, that would make a considerable difference, and that has been  shown to be the case in an area in Scotland, where, for a trial  period, off-licences were not allowed to sell alcohol to anyone under that age.  As a result, antisocial behaviour, crime and underage drinking dropped  significantly during the trial period.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We should also ensure that off-licences put the products  that they sell in labelled bags. Why is it that, wherever one goes, every shop  has its label on its bags, except for off-licences, which use blue bags?  Off-licences should be made to print their names on their bags. If underage  drinkers were spotted walking down the street carrying labelled bags, the  offending off-licences could be identified. Moreover, supermarkets should not  be allowed to use alcohol as a loss leader.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The use of advertising has been mentioned. I remember, from  when I was a young lad, a Guinness advertisement that involved folks  waterskiing. It showed the surf on the water and beautiful girls, and so on,  while a glass filled up with Guinness, with froth appearing on the top. The  advertisement made Guinness look very attractive &mdash; something that people would  want to drink. However, at the same time, people were living in broken homes,  lives were being destroyed and husbands or partners were out every night of the  week drinking, with no money left over for their families.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Advertisements portray the good side of alcohol  consumption, never its negative side. We must address that. Perhaps as much  money should be spent on portraying alcohol&rsquo;s negative side.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle I, too, support the motion, and I  welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate. In common with other  Members, I commend Pat Ramsey for bringing this timely motion to the House. I  also want to welcome the Minister. I know that some of his party colleagues  were annoyed that I mentioned that he was not present earlier, but it is a case  of give and take, John McCallister &mdash; Sinn F&eacute;in Ministers get it in the neck  when they are late. &ndash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I did not hear what the Member said, but John will tell me  later.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">On 1 April this year, my colleague Jennifer McCann and I  tabled the following motion:</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;That this Assembly expresses concern at the levels of  underage drinking and calls on the Minister for Social Development to introduce  effective measures to help combat alcohol misuse, including the clear and identifiable  marking of carrier bags provided by off-licences.&rdquo; &mdash; <span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; ">[Official Report, Volume  29, No 2, p80, col 1].</span></span></p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">That falls in nicely with what Edwin Poots has just said  about the marking of carrier bags, which was a key issue during April&rsquo;s debate.  Other Members mentioned the problems caused by alcohol misuse, which was  useful.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I see that there are many young people in the Public  Gallery, and I must point out that a lot of the damage that occurs in our  communities as a result of alcohol misuse is not always done by young people.  We must be careful to point out that fact, of which I know other Members are  conscious. Much of the damage that I see in communities and families as a  result of alcohol misuse is caused by adults. We must be careful, therefore,  that we do not portray young people as being responsible for all the damage and  antisocial behaviour.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  No, Kieran: I listened to you for six minutes, and that was enough.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I want to emphasise a few points. It is critical that the  House unites behind social justice motions and establishes a positive way  forward. I thank the BMA (British Medical Association) for its briefing note on  alcohol misuse, which gives a useful insight into the medical profession&rsquo;s  perspective. The BMA says that there has been an increase in binge drinking. It  says that that increase has been fuelled by irresponsible activity such as  happy hours and sales promotions, and that those activities should be banned.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">As far as I am aware, the Minister of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety does not have much of a remit in that area, so we  must turn our attention to the role of other Ministers &mdash; for example, those  with responsibility for health promotion, education in schools or licensing  laws. Before I expand on that point, I want to give a special mention to  professionals in the community and voluntary sector who work long and hard to  tackle alcohol misuse in communities. They are faced with some of the most  horrific cases of alcohol misuse day and daily, and they are all too aware of  the knock-on effect of such alcohol misuse.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">When my colleague and I tabled the motion on underage  drinking in April, we wanted to call on the Minister of Health, Social Services  and Public Safety to take action but were advised that the Minister for Social  Development is the relevant Minister. It is crucial that the Minister for  Social Development becomes the lead partner in this matter, because she has  responsibility for liquor licensing legislation.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">During that debate, she informed us that she would consider  all the issues that were raised as part of the licensing review, which started  in 2004. We were told that the review&rsquo;s recommendations would be implemented in  2007. However, in the debate in April 2008, we were told that the review was  being considered again. It is important that the Minister gives the House an  idea of where matters stand with the review and that she takes on board the  point about exploring the possibility of putting identifiable markings on  carrier bags provided by off-licences. The Minister also told us about a good  scheme in Dublin  and that she would meet her counterpart there, so it would be useful to get an  update on that work.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Deputy Speaker, I would appreciate it if a copy of  today&rsquo;s debate could be sent to the Minister for Social Development, the  Minister of Education and the junior Ministers in OFMDFM, because they accepted  during April&rsquo;s debate that they would take lead responsibility for underage  binge drinking and the development of all the strategies that the Departments  are promoting.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  I support the motion.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">12.15 pm</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I declare an interest as a member of the Policing Board. Other Members have  spoken about the impact that alcohol misuse has on the health of young people  and the work of accident and emergency staff. However, it also affects  policing. I was out with the police force over the weekend, and some 70% of the  incidents that it deals with are alcohol related.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Members are often tempted to quote statistics, but some of  the figures in respect of alcohol are stark. Mr Ross referred to his  experiences in the United    States, where the legal age for drinking  alcohol is generally 21. However, research carried out by the US National  Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism found that 75% of people of  sixth-form-equivalent age in the United States drink alcohol; 66% of  people of GCSE-equivalent age drink; and 20% of people of third-form-equivalent  age drink. When attempts were made to change attitudes to alcohol in the United States,  it was discovered that the initial education measures were not very successful.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Some Members have advocated tackling the problem of alcohol  misuse by advertising the associated dangers. However, research in the United States  indicated that although such advertising scared people, it did not change their  activity. It was found that the problem required more advanced treatment such  as norm-setting, addressing social pressures, and teaching young people to say  no. Family and parental responsibility is also crucial; parents can influence  their children&rsquo;s behaviour.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Home Office figures on alcohol consumption among young  people in the United Kingdom  are unbelievable. They show that 88% of 16- to 17-year-olds have drunk alcohol.  Some 29% of children aged between 10 and 13 have drunk alcohol. Therefore, some  primary-school pupils are drinking. In addition to adversely affecting the  health of our young folks, alcohol misuse increases instances of crime. Many  people who drink are involved in crime. The Home Office statistics indicate  that the 14% of people who drink more than once a week committed 37% of crime.  Conversely, the 45% of people who do not drink &mdash; or who seldom drink &mdash; committed  16% of crime.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The findings of research jointly carried out by the Centre  for Public Health at Liverpool   John Moores   University, Trading  Standards North West and the Home Office are incredible. That research found  that, on average, 15- to 16-year olds drink 177 pints of beer a year, which is  three pints a week. The research also indicated that there are 57,000 people in  Liverpool who binge drink at least once a  week.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The natural reaction to such figures is that something must  be done about alcohol consumption among young people. Who is to blame for the  problem? Where, and from whom, do young people get alcohol? Mr Ramsey referred  to the role of supermarkets. However, some Members will be aware that many taxi  drivers keep a crate of vodka in the boot of their car and provide a quaint  service called &ldquo;dial-a-vodka&rdquo;. That vodka is unlikely to be Smirnoff &mdash; it is  more likely to be cheap and dangerous. Alcohol can also be ordered from  reputable retailers online. Who checks that that alcohol is delivered to the  intended recipient at a particular house?</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The attitude of some parents is the most disturbing aspect  of alcohol misuse among young people. A report carried out in Stoke-on-Trent,  &lsquo;Underage Drinking, Stopping the Supply&rsquo;, stated:</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;most commonly young people acquire alcohol at their  own or their friends&rsquo; houses&hellip;There is a noticeable reliance on older people  and/or relatives to get the alcohol for them&rdquo; .</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The study also stated:</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;71 per cent of young people said their parents/carers  were aware that their children drink regularly&rdquo;.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">It is not right to point the finger at off-licences  in particular.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member&rsquo;s time is almost up.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I beg your pardon; I was just getting going. However, Members get the gist. It  is important that something is done about children drinking and that parents  are involved.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  Excessive alcohol consumption costs the Department of Health, Social Services  and Public Safety an estimated &pound;12 million every year and more than 250 lives.  A range of measures can be taken to tackle that problem.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Irresponsible promotional activities such as happy hours  should be prohibited. There is strong and consistent evidence that price  increases result in reduced consumption. The cheaper and more accessible that  alcohol is, the more people drink. It has been estimated that a 10% price rise  will cut consumption by 10%. Areas in Europe  with the highest alcohol prices tend to have the lowest levels of consumption.  Reductions in opening hours and outlets selling alcohol are associated with  reductions in alcohol use and related problems. The density of outlets that  offer alcohol ought to be more carefully considered by planners. Strong  enforcement of licensing laws is essential. School-based alcohol educational  programmes are positive and should be encouraged.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Alcohol consumption is associated with a wide range of  medical conditions. Medical staff are already seeing young people present for  treatment with significant liver damage caused by alcohol abuse. Alcohol misuse  is associated with crime, violence and antisocial behaviour, and it can impact  significantly on family and community life. Alcohol misuse can cause family  breakdowns, is a major factor in domestic violence, and it ruins job prospects.  Alcohol misuse has direct costs for hospital services and the criminal justice  system. There are also indirect costs such as loss of productivity and the  impact on family and social networks.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Five years ago, the Department of Health, Social Services  and Public Safety estimated that every year of excessive alcohol consumption  costs 266 lives, &pound;300 million in total lifetime economic worth, 4,037 expected  life years, 140,000 sick days, &pound;13&middot;2 million in lost productivity and &pound;12  million to the Health Service.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Do the figures, background and problems quoted by the Member provide a good  reason to have an agency within the Department of Health, Social Services and  Public Safety that will address public health and social well-being?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member will be allowed an extra minute.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  I thank the Member for his question. Public health and social well-being can  still be addressed in the same manner and to the same effect within one  regional board; therefore, I do not agree that two tiers of bureaucracy are  needed.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Addiction problems are an increasing challenge in Northern Ireland and across the rest of the United Kingdom.  Treatment for addictions is not regarded as an emergency and does not attract  the same resources as other services. Northern Ireland would benefit from  many more hospital beds dedicated to addiction services. In 2005, 271 people  received help for addiction to alcohol and drugs; today, that figure is closer  to 1,000. About 15% of those individuals received help for addictions before  they were 18 years of age. The number of people under the age of 18 who are  admitted to hospital for alcohol-related conditions has increased significantly  in recent years.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Habits learned early in life can persist through to  adulthood and prove difficult to change. Addictions can have a knock-on affect  on so many areas, such as crime. For example, from 2004 to 2005, 359 young  offenders committed to Hydebank Wood Young Offenders Centre and Prison declared  a dependency on alcohol. Of the inmates, 460 admitted to a dependency or misuse  of drugs; only 58 inmates did not declare a dependency on either alcohol or  drugs.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Tighter restrictions are required on how and when the  advertising of alcohol is permitted. The labelling of alcoholic-beverage  containers would be a useful method of explaining recommended drinking  guidelines and supporting other alcohol-control policies. In GB, recent voluntary  agreements with the alcohol industry have led to the inclusion of some  information about alcohol content on containers.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Individuals at risk of misusing alcohol should be  identified early, routinely screened and, if necessary, managed appropriately.  A detailed strategy paper, the &lsquo;New Strategic Direction for Alcohol and Drugs  2006-2011&rsquo; was published two and a half years ago. Will the Minister outline  how many of the desired outcomes in that paper have been realised, particularly  those that were short-term goals?</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">There is also a role for television. Scenes in many programmes  are set in pubs or focus on a drinking culture. Often, there is a lot of  drinking by young people in those programmes.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Dealing with the effects of alcohol eats into the health  budget. In response to a parliamentary question at Westminster a couple of  years ago, a direct rule Health Minister told me that the cost of tackling  alcohol-related illnesses and crime was more than the total spend on all health  promotion that year &mdash; that is a scary statistic.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We must try to eradicate the culture of binge drinking, which  is not as big a problem in other parts of the world.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Will the Member draw her remarks to a close?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  In other parts of the world, people seem to be able to drink without doing so  to excess. I congratulate the Member for tabling the motion, which I support.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs O&rsquo;Neill</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I also support the motion and  commend Pat Ramsey for tabling it. I welcome the continued focus on  alcohol-related problems since my colleagues Sue Ramsey and Jennifer McCann  tabled a similar motion in April.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Other Members have mentioned many of the facts and figures  around alcohol misuse, which I will not repeat. However, excessive alcohol  consumption costs the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety  an estimated &pound;12 million and claims 266 lives every year. Those are the most  startling of all the statistics, and they must be taken seriously by the  Assembly.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Department of Health, Social Services and Public  Safety&rsquo;s strategy to reduce alcohol-related harm is welcome. However, a more  co-ordinated departmental approach to the issue is required, and the motion  calls for that. Alcohol misuse is associated with crime, violence, antisocial  behaviour and can impact significantly on family and community life. It also  causes family breakdown, is known to be a major factor in domestic violence,  and can ruin people&rsquo;s job prospects.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Despite the strategy from the Department, and the various  targeted media campaigns in recent years, we have witnessed an increase in the  levels of alcohol misuse and in the pattern of heavy drinking and binge drinking.  There are concerns about alcohol consumption among young people, particularly  young girls. In the information that it sent to all Members, the BMA states  that doctors are reporting instances of serious liver disease in young people  because of alcohol intake.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">There are several initiatives that can be advanced, and  there are issues that must be examined to address the problem, which Pat and  other Members mentioned in the debate &mdash; for example, the controlling of price.  There is an argument that an increase in the price of alcohol will result in  less consumption. Some countries, such as Finland  and Sweden,  have seen a decrease in the alcohol consumption of heavy drinkers after a  reduction in licensing hours. As other Members mentioned, strict regulations on  marketing and advertising are required to govern the activities of licensed  premises, particularly price promotions on alcoholic drinks in supermarkets.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">More measures to reduce drink-driving are required &mdash;  hard-hitting media campaigns that were used in the past should continue because  they are very effective and hit home to people. Further qualitative research to  examine attitudes to alcohol misuse is required. There are different reasons  why people decide to drink too much alcohol, and we must get to the bottom of  that.There must be targeted public- and school-based alcohol education  programmes as part of the wider strategy.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">12.30 pm</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Some Members mentioned drinking guidelines and alcohol  labelling. Much of the strategy to reduce alcohol-related harm focuses on  guidelines to reduce drinking, but few people can recall those guidelines, let  alone understand them, or even appreciate the relationship between units, glass  sizes and drink strengths. More effort must be made to address those issues.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Early detection measures must be increased in order to  provide early intervention and the treatment of alcohol misuse. We need  dedicated front-line support services in order to assist people in need. The  BMA&rsquo;s report states that doctors have serious concerns about the lack of  facilities available for people to be referred for assistance. That is poor, to  say the least, and we must ensure that the necessary front-line services are in  place to address the needs of people who have alcohol-related illnesses.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Those are only a few of the issues that need to be addressed,  but it is clear that they are cross-departmental matters. On that basis, I fully  support the motion, which calls for a cross-departmental strategy to tackle  this very serious issue. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Business Committee has arranged to meet at lunchtime today. I  propose, therefore, by leave of the Assembly, to suspend the sitting until 2.00  pm.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The sitting was suspended at 12.31 pm.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">On resuming (Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Dallat] in the  Chair) &mdash;</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">2.00 pm</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Simpson</strong>:  By the time we reach this stage of the debate, when 11 or 12 Members have made  contributions, everything that needs to be said has probably been said.  Therefore, I do not wish to be repetitive.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Some people take the view that the real problem begins with  the production of alcohol, but I will not dwell on my personal views about  that. I will stick to the motion, and congratulate Pat Ramsey for securing the  debate on such a worthwhile and serious subject.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">There is no doubt that there is a major problem in our  community, not only with the abuse of alcohol, but with its misuse. Only last  week, one of the local papers in my constituency ran an article about an  11-year-old lad who was taken from his home by the police in connection with  alcohol. I understand that the story of that young person was briefly aired on  the radio this morning by a member of the YMCA from the Portadown area.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">All Members have had experience of similar problems in  their constituencies. I have heard of incidents in the Portadown area as well  as in Lurgan and Banbridge. It is major problem in society today. It has  already been mentioned that crime rates have increased because of alcohol,  which plays a major role in incidents of violence and antisocial behaviour.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The sale of alcohol is an important consideration. There  are issues about pricing, and we heard calls last week and this week at Westminster to finally  face up to the problem. Alcohol pricing is a problem, as are the opening hours  of outlets. As we all know, opening hours for public houses and other outlets  were extended, and that has caused a problem. We were sold a pup, because we  were told that extending the opening hours would solve many problems in  society, but it did not; it made things a lot worse. That is something that we  must face up to.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Over-consumption of alcohol and the binge drinking culture  is a problem in my constituency of Upper Bann.  I have had to deal with several complaints about alcohol abuse and misuse from  across the political divide. It does not matter which side of the House we are  from; the same social issue affects our respective areas.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The statistics are scary. It was mentioned earlier that on  average, there are 266 deaths a year as a result of alcohol abuse and misuse. I  am sure that the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety will  refer to the amount of money that is taken from his budget &mdash; about &pound;12 million  &mdash; in order to help prevent those deaths. There are major difficulties that we must  deal with, but we must also keep in mind that this is a cross-cutting issue  that will involve several Departments.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In order for the Assembly to do the job that the motion  calls for, the Executive must meet so that decisions can be taken. Anyone who  speaks in support of the motion, or votes in favour of it &mdash; if it goes to that  &mdash; must keep that in mind. To voice support for the motion, and to vote for it,  only to trot off and refuse to attend an Executive meeting, is nothing but rank  hypocrisy of the worst kind, and is immoral, when there are social issues that  must be dealt with. The public, quite rightly, will condemn those who refuse to  attend the Executive. Members must forget about party wish lists and get down  to the nitty-gritty of social issues that affect everyone in society.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I have great pleasure in supporting the motion.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mr McGimpsey)</strong>: Alcohol misuse is  a major public-health issue in Northern    Ireland. Members have estimated the cost to  the Health Service in Northern    Ireland at &pound;12 million, but I feel that that  figure is a gross underestimate: it is at least double that, if not higher.  Alcohol misuse leads to considerable costs to society, which are estimated at a  further &pound;800 million. The physical and emotional cost to people, to families  and to children is enormous.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I can list countless shocking statistics on the serious  harm that alcohol causes to society. Each year, 7,000 people are admitted to  acute hospitals due to alcohol misuse, about 200 of whom are aged under 18. In  2005, 246 people died as a direct result of alcohol. In 2006-07, there were 387  admissions to hospital for liver sclerosis, which was an increase from 294 in  2002-03. Approximately one in six people who attends hospital accident and  emergency departments has alcohol-related injuries or problems. At weekends,  which are the peak times, the proportion rises to eight out of ten.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">American research suggests that one in three adolescents  who attempted suicide was intoxicated at the time. More than 70% of domestic  violence offenders had been drinking at the time of the assault. In 2003,  almost two thirds of sentenced male prisoners and four fifths of sentenced  female prisoners admitted to hazardous drinking prior to imprisonment. I could  go on with such statistics.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I recently witnessed at first hand the harmful impact of  excessive alcohol consumption when I spent a night with frontline emergency  services. It was shocking to see how much time ambulance and accident and  emergency staff have to spend dealing with injuries that are the effects of  alcohol abuse &mdash; time that should be spent dealing with genuine emergencies.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I witnessed what happens on a typical night with young  people staggering out of pubs, outside student unions and at the Odyssey  complex. I even saw young people being abusive to ambulance staff who tried to  help a man who had been knocked down. I want more parents to see the poor  behaviour and lack of respect and control of some of their children after  drinking. The Odyssey Trust Company and student bodies must take more  responsibility for young people&rsquo;s drinking and for their health and safety.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Alcohol is Northern    Ireland&rsquo;s favourite drug, and, worryingly,  there seems to be an ongoing process of social collusion. It is difficult to  persuade parents to educate their children on the harm that alcohol causes when  so many people enjoy a drink. Indeed, the main problem with alcohol in Northern Ireland  is our unhealthy attitude towards its use.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Christmas is around the corner, and with it will come the  usual excesses. Supermarkets and off licences will start to sell alcohol at  ridiculously low prices. We will all stock up and drink and eat too much, and  laugh off hangovers and bad behaviour. That attitude is deeply embedded in our  culture, and is one that is difficult to change. However, until we adopt a more  responsible attitude to alcohol, we can not become more responsible drinkers.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I am determined to tackle the consequences of alcohol  misuse. In May 2006, my Department launched a new strategic direction for  alcohol and drugs, which focuses on reducing excessive or binge drinking and  increasing public awareness of the real harm that is associated with alcohol  misuse. The strategy is supported by a wide range of Government Departments.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Much progress has been made, including the establishment of  treatment and support services across Northern Ireland, and the  development of a youth-counselling service. Education and information  programmes, which provide information for parents and young people, are being  taken forward in schools, clubs and across local communities. I acknowledge, in  particular, the work of the community and voluntary sector, which makes a real  contribution to preventing and addressing alcohol and drug misuse and the harm  that that causes.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Ramsey</strong>:  Given the contributions from Members from all parties today, does the Minister  believe and support the concept of establishing an all-party working group to  operate in tandem with the new strategy?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: Yes, I am more than happy to  support such a proposal. Departments work together, and they can introduce and  promulgate policy. However, an all-party working group would make a major  contribution to tackling the key issue of society&rsquo;s attitude to alcohol, which  is at the root of the problem. The alcohol culture in society must be changed.  More must, and can, be done.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">My Department has produced an action plan that focuses on  key areas in which I want to see rapid progress, and decisive and clear action  taken. Alcohol is far too cheap. Drink is 62% more affordable today than it was  in 1980. I want to see the price of alcohol increased so that people pay a  similar price for it in supermarkets and off-licences as they do in pubs. Some  alcohol is cheaper to buy than bottled water, and that creates too much  temptation. I want to explore the possibility of introducing minimum unit  pricing, meaning that every unit of alcohol will cost a set price. That would  mean, for example, that large bottles of strong cider could no longer be sold  so cheaply.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Alcohol advertising on television before 9.00 pm should be  banned. Our health messages cannot compete with those from the drinks industry,  which spends vast sums on advertising. I will, therefore, work with colleagues  across the UK  to ensure that existing legislation on alcohol advertising is rigorously  enforced. I will also raise the matter of not advertising alcohol before the  watershed. There must be a rigorous enforcement of the law, with test  purchasing in off-licences, pubs and supermarkets. It is clear that young  people are not simply accessing drink from friendly adults who buy it for them.  Anyone who is caught selling drink to underage buyers must feel the full force  of the law.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I will continue to work with my ministerial colleague  Margaret Ritchie to ensure that the review of liquor licensing is used to  further reduce young people&rsquo;s access to alcohol. The review must also consider  licensing hours, branding of carrier bags, and the number of licences issued,  which some Members mentioned during the debate. Every alcoholic drink must be  clearly labelled with easy-to-understand information about the number of units  that it contains and explanations of the damage caused to health because of  binge drinking or excessive consumption.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I will continue to push for action on the work that is  being implemented across the UK.  Happy hours and drinks promotions only serve to encourage excessive alcohol  consumption. There must be a clampdown on the number of drinks promotions in  shops and bars. If the drinks industry does not behave in a socially responsible  manner, we must introduce further legislation to end such practices. I have met  representatives from the alcohol industry, including those from the major  supermarkets. To date, I have had positive responses from Sainsbury&rsquo;s and Asda;  however, it took Tesco some four months to get around to responding to me. It  is disappointing that such a major player in the marketplace took so long to  respond. Supermarkets have a role to play in helping to promote sensible  alcohol consumption. They must continue to work proactively with Government on  the issue.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I will now pull together all the different strands to which  I referred. My Department is in the process of developing an integrated action  plan to deal with young people&rsquo;s drinking. The plan is cross-departmental,  because a wide range of departmental responsibilities is involved in tackling  the issue. Although the action plan&rsquo;s emphasis is on young people, it is  important to recognise that adult-drinking patterns significantly influence  young people and society. The plan must also contain actions that will impact  on the entire population. I am already encouraged by the work that is being  implemented from that agenda.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I mentioned the positive discussions that I have had with  each of the major supermarkets and with representatives from the alcohol and  drinks industry. Furthermore, I have met police to discuss the enforcement of  legislation on the availability of alcohol. However, we must go further in some  areas. I note Mr Ramsey&rsquo;s call to extend the designated alcohol-free zones in  his constituency.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">2.15 pm</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Two main issues must be considered in the action plan:  first, whether the current legislation is being enforced fully and effectively;  and secondly, what further legislation is required. I hope that the Department  for Social Development&rsquo;s forthcoming review of liquor licensing will address  some of those issues. We need to now consider how we can ensure that alcohol is  priced and promoted responsibly. However, that should not be about demonising  or criminalising our young people; I understand that they want to enjoy  themselves. The point is to ensure that all people are supported in making  healthy and responsible decisions about their alcohol consumption. The action  plan is being finalised and will be issued in early December. I will examine  urgently the actions that are being taken.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The drinking culture that exists in Northern Ireland  has been around for far too long. I am determined to take positive action now;  however, our biggest challenge is our attitude towards alcohol, but that will  not necessarily change overnight. Alcohol misuse is one of the biggest  public-health issues facing Northern    Ireland. However you measure the cost,  whether to the individual, the family, the community, the Health Service, or  society as a whole, alcohol misuse is one of our biggest public-health issues.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The new public-health agency that I am creating will have a  central role in driving forward the public-health agenda and in reinforcing  public-health messages about responsible drinking. We all have a responsibility  to tackle the issue, and we need to work together across Departments and  sectors. Above all, we must ensure that we are giving a clear and consistent  message about alcohol to our entire population.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  thank Pat Ramsey for tabling the motion. I also thank those Members who spoke,  and I thank the Minister for his response. We do not often see such a high  level of consensus on a motion. That is entirely appropriate, as there is no  doubt that the misuse of alcohol is causing enormous social damage. It has huge  consequences for individuals, families, and society as a whole. Almost every  Member has described the nature of those consequences by discussing the damage  that is done to health, the effects that it has on crime rates, and the consequences  that it has on our accident and emergency departments and the Health Service  generally. It is clearly a problem that is of particular significance in  contemporary society. It is also a particular problem where young people are  concerned. Members agree that the attitudes of many young people to alcohol  need to be challenged. When our doctors report cases of serious liver damage in  young people, we cannot be complacent.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">My views on the issue have changed over the years. At one  time, I would have favoured little regulation on the issue, accepting that  individuals must exercise their own responsibility and accept the consequences.  However, I now recognise that that will not work. The consequences are simply  too great for individuals, families, and society as a whole. We need  well-considered regulation and enforcement. It is clear, for example, that  increased opening hours are associated with increased alcohol consumption, as  is the increased number of outlets selling alcohol. We must respond to that.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">These are not new problems in society, although their  present manifestation may be different to what has happened previously. The Gin  Act was passed in 1751 to reduce the consumption of spirits, which was regarded  as one of the primary causes of crime in London.  At that time, the consumption of gin averaged two pints a week for every  Londoner.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Alcohol abuse was a major problem in Irish society in the  nineteenth century, and it was considered to be rampant. There was widespread  alcoholism. One response to that was the temperance movement that was  established by Father Mathew around 1838 with the taking of the pledge. It had  a dramatic effect and became an international movement. It did a great deal to  alleviate the problems associated with alcohol.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In 1898, the movement culminated in the creation of the  Pioneer Total Abstinence Association, which was set up by Father James Cullen.  It did similar excellent work to establish a climate of temperance. Indeed,  that organisation continues to do good work to the present day. That movement  was founded in the Catholic Church and system: clearly, an equal and strong  temperance movement exists among the Protestant churches and society.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Members will be aware that the Social Development Minister  is examining liquor licensing. I have no doubt that she hears clearly the  message that comes from the Assembly, the Health Department and many other  authorities. The issue of how alcohol is treated in society requires careful  consideration and control. In order to make progress, it is necessary for the  Executive to meet, as many Members have said, so that the Minister can put her  proposals to them.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">There are indications that the drinks industry has started  to come to terms with the fact that it must demonstrate more responsibility on this  matter. The Federation of the Retail Licensed Trade has demonstrated that it is  aware of its social responsibilities.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">It is important to recognise that there has been a  significant shift from drinking in pubs to drinking at home, which means that  alcohol is purchased in off-licences and supermarkets. As other Members have  mentioned, supermarket drinks promotions are, certainly, cause for alarm. I  have seen two litres of cider being sold for &pound;1&middot;18 and a can of beer being sold  for 22p. In order to strengthen regulation, the below-cost selling of alcohol  must be countered.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I call for much greater responsibility from the industry &mdash;  both the manufacturers and the retail trade. They must not simply pay lip  service to the issue, but accept that their product does immense social damage.  They must play a part in the creation of a remedy.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Approaches to the problem will consist of several elements.  First, further regulation and enforcement are, undoubtedly, needed. I welcome  the Minister&rsquo;s remarks on what is going to happen and what is being considered  for future action. Secondly, education and health promotion are needed. I noted  the Minister&rsquo;s comments on society&rsquo;s unhealthy attitude towards the use of  alcohol. That means, of course, that the answer cannot come simply from the  Assembly or the government system: many different sectors of society must take  responsibility for a solution to be anywhere near possible. Thirdly, there must  be more involvement and responsibility from the drinks industry. I repeat my  call for it to be actively engaged in the remedy.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I draw particular attention to the call from the British  Medical Association, whose opinion must be taken seriously. It echoes several  points that Members have raised in the debate. The BMA calls for:</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;prohibiting price promotions on alcohol beverages,  and &hellip; establishing minimum price levels &hellip; A statutory code of practice on the  marketing of alcohol beverages &hellip; a ban on:</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented" style="margin-left:33.0pt;text-indent:-21.0pt;">&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; broadcasting of alcohol advertising at  any time that is likely to be viewed by young people</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented" style="margin-left:33.0pt;text-indent:-21.0pt;">&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; alcohol industry sponsorship of  sporting, music &hellip; events aimed mainly at young people</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented" style="margin-left:33.0pt;text-indent:-21.0pt;">&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; marketing of alcoholic soft drinks to  young people&rdquo;.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I fully support all of those policies.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, I thank all the Members who have contributed  to this useful debate. On its own, the debate will not result in action, but it  sends out crucial signals from the Assembly to the range of Departments that  have a role in generating action. The debate also sends a message to wider  society that the misuse of alcohol is a problem that the Assembly wants to be  meaningfully addressed.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
        <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly considers that the misuse of alcohol in  society causes serious damage to the health and social well-being of individuals  and communities; and calls on the Executive to formulate, and implement,  policies designed to reduce alcohol misuse.</p>
        <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="4"></a>Private Members&rsquo; Business</p>
        <p class="H5StageHeading">Review of Environmental Governance</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to one hour and 30  minutes for the debate. The proposer will have 10 minutes to propose the motion  and 10 minutes in which to make a winding-up speech. All other Members who wish  to speak will have five minutes. One amendment has been selected and published  on the Marshalled List. The proposer of the amendment will have 10 minutes to  propose and five minutes in which to make a winding-up speech.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  beg to move</p>
        <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly expresses its concern at the failure of  the previous Minister of the Environment to take forward the recommendations of  the &lsquo;Review of Environmental Governance&rsquo;; believes that the Northern Ireland  Environment Agency is not adequate to deal with the challenges facing Northern Ireland;  and calls on the Executive to re-consider this matter urgently.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I have great pleasure in proposing the motion that stands  in my name and the names of my colleagues. The motion is similar to one that  Brian Wilson and I brought to the Assembly on 25 September 2007:</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;That this Assembly calls on the Executive to  establish an independent Environmental Protection Agency for Northern Ireland.&rdquo;  &mdash; <span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; ">[Official  Report, Vol 24, No 2, p72, col 1].</span></span></p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Following debate on a couple of amendments, that motion was  passed unanimously &mdash; or at least without dissension &mdash; by the Assembly. Even the  Minister, who subsequently took a different decision, did not oppose the  principle of an independent environmental protection agency. However, it is  well known that on 27 May 2008, the previous Minister of the Environment  refused to implement the recommendations of the review of environmental  governance. Rather, she put forward a plan that amounted to little more than  the rebranding, on 1 July 2008, of the Environment and Heritage Service (EHS)  as the body now known as the NIEA &mdash; I am indebted to Friends of the Earth for  reminding me that that stands for &ldquo;Not the Independent Environment Agency&rdquo;.  That is not a criticism of the agency&rsquo;s staff, but a simple statement of the  fact that, at a time when this region, along with every other region on this  island, must be seen to have transparent, open and independent environmental  governance, it is the only region not to have made any progress in that  respect.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Deputy Speaker, I am sure that you studied the Hansard  report of 25 September 2007 in detail. Indeed, I think that you supported my  call for an independent agency on that occasion. The House clearly accepted the  substantial piece of work that had been submitted by the review of  environmental governance (REGNI) team of Mr Burke, Professor Turner and Mr  Bell. The team submitted detailed arguments for significant changes to  environmental governance in general, and they argued in particular for the  establishment of an independent agency to meet the needs of our economy,  society and environment.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Several major issues that were highlighted during that  debate do not need to be reiterated today. However, some key points remain,  notably the court ruling that was made a short time before the debate. It dealt  with the draft northern area plan and the need for the Planning Service to  receive independent advice. Mr Justice Weatherup&rsquo;s decision stated:</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;By the terms of the Directive it is apparent, as the  Department accepts, that there be separation between the responsible authority  and the consultation body.&rdquo;</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Members are aware that the decision was subject to an  appeal by the Department. Nonetheless, it is clear that the Department accepted  the fundamental tenet held by the judge that separation is required. The  question is whether the Department can argue that there is adequate separation.  Patently, the Environment Agency, as currently established, is an executive  agency of the Department of the Environment (DOE) that reports to the Minister.  To those of us who understand the dictionary definition of the word, the agency  is, in no sense, independent.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Department ought to accept the strong likelihood that  it will lose any appeal that it mounts. It could learn a lesson from the  Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (DARD) decision this week and  not proceed with meaningless appeals and accept court decisions without wasting  more taxpayers&rsquo; money.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">2.30 pm</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">There is no sign that the Department is preparing for the  possibility of change. In May 2008, the then Environment Minister told the  House:</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The Minister for Regional Development, the Minster of  Agriculture and Rural Development and the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure  have all set out practical, and even constitutional, reasons why the transfer  of functions is not appropriate at this time.&rdquo; &mdash;<span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; "> [Official Report, Vol 31,  No 1, p2, col 1].</span></span></p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">She continued:</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;the Programme for Government commits us to a review  of Departments by 2011.&rdquo; &mdash;<span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; "> [Official Report, Vol 31, No 1, p2, col 1].</span></span></p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Given that the Executive will not engage in their present  responsibilities, Members will appreciate why those of us at this end of the  House are not holding our breath for a review of Departments by 2011.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I am interested to know the constitutional objections to  the transfer of powers among Departments. It seems that empire building by  Departments is not, in any sense, a valid constitutional reason for objection.  Since the Minister&rsquo;s decision, agencies and bodies that are appointed to advise  DOE have outlined their opinions on environmental matters. The Historic  Buildings Council was less than happy with the proposals, and the Council for  Nature Conservation and the Countryside (CNCC) issued a fairly strong criticism  in the minutes of its June meeting, in which it noted that the chairman of the  CNCC was the only member with an environmental background invited to sit on the  Department&rsquo;s better regulation board. The Department seems to have lost sight  of its key position.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">CNCC reiterated independence issues and noted that an  agency staffed by civil servants &mdash; regardless of those individuals&rsquo; skills &mdash;  will be responsible to a Minister and will not enjoy the necessary degree of  independence. As CNCC noted, such an agency will not facilitate the necessary  checks and balances. In those minutes &mdash; which I presume are not objected to,  given that they are published on the Internet &mdash; a senior official in EHS  explained that the rebranding process is likely to last some years. The fact  that that rebranding process, which will merely change the name of a  departmental agency, will take some years to complete suggests that taking time  to establish an independent agency might have been a better idea.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In recent weeks, an area of special scientific interest  (ASSI) at Lisnaragh near Dunnamanagh in Tyrone has had its status rescinded. It  has been alleged that there was ministerial interference in that process. I do  not make that allegation; I do not know whether there was ministerial  interference. However, as long as the Northern Ireland Environment Agency  (NIEA) reports to the Minister, a suspicion of ministerial interference in such  decisions will remain. The Assembly must avoid that situation in order to  secure good environmental governance and meaningful progress. It is not good  enough to say that nothing underhand occurred, because the suspicion exists and  will remain.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  am shocked at such an allegation. We cannot tolerate the appalling situation of  democratically elected politicians taking decisions in this country.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: If  Mr Weir is incapable of distinguishing political decisions from decisions based  on scientific evidence in accordance with European law, he is a worse lawyer  than I had thought.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Since that decision in May, flooding has affected people in  Northern Ireland  during this year&rsquo;s so-called summer. Not only did the REGNI report support the rebranding  of EHS but the merging of several agencies.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">It was specifically recommended that there should be proper  river-basin management, and that the Rivers Agency should be in the same body  as EHS and that the whole process of sustainable water management should be  dealt with by one agency.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The so-called flood map of Northern Ireland has just been  launched. Compared to the flood map maintained by the Environment Agency of  England and Wales,  which is on the Internet, it is fairly low-level. However, even that required  the co-operation of two Ministers. That is an example of how a single agency,  with absolutely clear and unambiguous responsibilities for dealing with river  management, would have had a much clearer line of responsibility and  accountability for dealing with flood prevention and its associated problems.  Such flooding is likely to continue, affecting homes, businesses and  agriculture across Northern    Ireland. That is a fundamental issue that  should be dealt with by a single agency. That is what REGNI reported, and that  is what Ministers deny.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Other issues that may not have the same day-to-day  resonance &mdash; such as establishing a national park or further aspects of planning  guidance &mdash; are clear cases where much-needed independent advice is not yet  present. That is why we need an independent agency.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  I beg to move the following amendment: Leave out all after &ldquo;calls&rdquo; and insert:</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;for the establishment of an independent Environmental  Protection Agency which must become fully operational within the lifetime of  this Assembly.&rdquo;</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">As the proposer of the motion said, a similar motion was  proposed last year. In that debate, I proposed an amendment similar to that  which I propose today.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I agree that we need an independent environment agency,  such as many other countries have. However, the amendment that I proposed last  year asked specifically for that independent agency to be established during  the lifetime of this Assembly. When it came to the vote, Alliance Members voted  against the amendment. Since then, they &mdash; and the rest of us &mdash; have seen what  has happened. As described by Mr Ford, we have ended up with an agency still  within the Department of the Environment and not properly independent.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I appeal to all Members to support the amendment; on this  occasion, the amendment is clear, and I ask Alliance Members in particular to  give it their support. If we are successful in persuading the House to adopt  the amendment, the leverage of elected representatives in support of a fully  independent environmental protection agency will be increased.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">For too long, environmental issues have been given a low  priority here. We have only to look around the Chamber to see how low that  priority is. It is well known that, around the Executive table, the needs of  many other Departments take precedence over those of the environment. The  Department of Enterprise,  Trade and Investment is one, and OFMDFM is another.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Since the 1980s and 1990s, countries such as the Republic of Ireland  and the other countries of the UK  have had independent agencies tackling abuses and properly enforcing  environmental legislation. We have fallen behind because we do not have the  system and structures in place with the capacity to produce the outcomes  necessary for better protection of the environment. Granted, the Northern  Ireland Environment Agency is an improvement on what went before. However,  although it has tried to address some of the issues, the fact is that the  Government cannot run with the hare and hunt with the hounds. In this case, it  is an Irish hare, but that approach does not work.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">As I have said, DOE is one of 11 Departments, and it is  very often overruled. Internal Government bodies pose other barriers to  effective environmental regulation. First, the necessary confidentiality of  departmental policy-making processes and interdepartmental debate creates a  serious lack of transparency with regard to the making of regulatory decisions.  Such decisions cannot command the confidence of the public or be regulated without  proper transparency.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, officials who administer the regulations are  exposed to the real and perceived risk of conflict of interest. The  effectiveness of the regulation of internal Government bodies is inhibited  since modern environmental governance requires a strong, focused regulator that  is able to adopt modern risk-based regulatory practices without a loss of  public confidence. Northern    Ireland needs such a strong, independent  voice to champion and safeguard the environment.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The &lsquo;Foundations for the Future&rsquo; report was launched in  2007. It made very clear recommendations about environmental regulation.  Following wide-ranging consultations, that report was well put together and  very detailed. It set out clearly the functions that should have been retained  by the Department in relation to planning and environmental policy. It also  spelt out the accountability mechanisms that were necessary for a new  environmental protection agency. It recommended that the agency&rsquo;s purpose  should be to protect and enhance the environment and, in doing so, contribute  to the achievement of sustainable development.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">It is quite clear that a well-resourced, independent  environmental protection agency would be crucial to building confidence about  environmental governance. There also needs to be a shared vision &mdash; one that is developed  by the Government and the other stakeholders &mdash; on local and agreed standards  for the protection of the environment. We must develop effective arrangements  for the integrated management of important material assets such as our rivers,  uplands and coasts.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We live on a small island, and problems such as air or  water pollution can spread very quickly. It is an obvious reality that we  cannot partition our environment. Therefore, an all-island strategy is needed  to manage the environment.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Last week, the catchment-management programme for Lough  Melvin, which straddles the border, was published. That was undertaken by  agencies on both sides of the border. The fact that they did that work meant  that they have a two-year head start on developing the directives in relation  to catchment-management plans. That is an example of the kind of work that can  be done when real co-operation occurs. An independent environmental protection  agency, to correspond to the same body in the South, would add greatly to such  work.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Co-operation is not limited to river catchment.  Organisations such as the RSPB and the corresponding body in the South &mdash;  BirdWatch Ireland  &mdash; have been working together for years and have formulated initiatives in the  interests of conserving some of the bird populations that were at risk.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The reports from those bodies are examples of how we can  highlight water pollution and nature conservation by identifying the risks and  responding to them.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Unfortunately, as I said, environment management systems  here are inadequate. We also have a reputation, particularly in Europe, of being behind with much of our work. The threat  of fines being imposed by the EU remains a real possibility.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Given the urgency of environmental matters &mdash; some of which  I have mentioned &mdash; and environmentalists&rsquo; concerns that the time for corrective  action is running out, we cannot procrastinate on the issue any longer. The  SDLP tabled the amendment because it wants to see action happening during the  lifetime of the Assembly.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome that the Minister is present for the debate. When  a similar debate was held before, it was clear that one party opposed having an  independent environment protection agency &mdash; that was the Minister&rsquo;s party.  Today, I appeal to him to prioritise the environment rather than his party  political interests.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: It  will come as no surprise that the DUP will be opposing the motion and the  amendment. As has been said, many of the arguments have been rehearsed in the  Chamber previously, and I doubt whether we will hear much that is new today.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The DUP advocates having a locally elected, devolved  institution, so that locally elected people can make decisions. All the parties  here adopted a similar view before the Assembly was re-established in May of  last year. Yet, all the other major political parties in the Assembly are now  supporting an independent environmental protection agency (EPA)and power being  handed to an independent body.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We are not a party of big Government; we are a party of  good Government. That is why the previous Minister of the Environment, Arlene  Foster, decided on an environment protection agency that is within Government,  rather than one that would not be directly accountable to the Assembly or the  Committee for the Environment, and that would result in increased bureaucracy  for the people living in the Province. That does not mean that the DUP is not  committed to preserving the environment for future generations. However, we  would rather do so in a way that keeps the Minister directly accountable.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I listened to Mr Ford&rsquo;s opening comments, in which he  mentioned certain things that have happened recently. I agree that we should  consider recent events &mdash; for example, those involving the energy regulator or  Northern Ireland Water. In such instances, Members from all sides of the  Chamber are calling for Ministers to take action, or intervene; but, of course,  those Ministers cannot do so because power has been devolved to an independent  body.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Ford also referred to how, when the Minister of the Environment  originally made the decision about the EPA, she noted that many other Ministers  had expressed their concerns on the practical difficulties in transferring powers  to an unelected, independent body. At that time, various unelected  organisations undertook a concerted campaign to establish an independent EPA.  However, rather than cave in, as some parties did, we stood firm in our belief  that an independent EPA would be expensive, bureaucratic, unaccountable and  particularly bad for the farming community in Northern Ireland.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Case studies from around the world have shown that an  independent EPA is not a panacea for all our environmental problems &mdash; such  problems are greater in some regions where independent EPAs operate. We need  only look to the Irish   Republic or to the  Scottish Environment Protection Agency for examples of those. Prosecution for  offences involving pollution is sixteen times more likely in Northern Ireland than in Scotland. The  new Northern Ireland Environment Agency has hardly existed long enough for  Members to come to a view on its successes or failings; therefore, today&rsquo;s  motion is premature, if even necessary.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The premise of the motion is that the Northern Ireland  Environment Agency has failed, but that is not the case. As was established in  previous debates and in the Minister&rsquo;s statement, the board of the proposed,  so-called independent EPA would be appointed by the Minister. Therefore, the  same people would end up doing the same jobs that they are doing now; the only  difference being that they would not be accountable to the Assembly or the  Committee for the Environment.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Our focus should be on ensuring that the efforts already  made by the Minister of the Environment and his predecessor are implemented  successfully and are producing the desired effect. Several convictions have  been secured since the new Northern Ireland Environment Agency was established.  Prior to that, the EHS was starting to make some inroads into catching and  prosecuting those responsible for environmental crime, particularly those  responsible illegal dumping, which is a serious issue.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">An independent EPA would not be as accountable as the  current body. It would cost taxpayers an additional &pound;2&middot;5 million to set up,  with additional annual running costs of &pound;500,000. It would be no more effective  than the body that has been established within Government. For those reasons, I  oppose the motion and the amendment.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Boylan</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat. I welcome the opportunity to speak to the motion and the  amendment, and I reiterate that Sinn F&eacute;in has continually called for an  independent environmental protection agency.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In May 2008, I stated in the Chamber that the then Minister  had missed a good opportunity to establish an independent environmental  protection agency. Instead, she chose to rebrand the EHS as the NIEA.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in calls on the current Minister to ensure that  environmental matters, such as illegal dumping, waste management, the built and  cultural heritage, and river pollution, are addressed properly through an  independent environmental protection agency.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Recently, we witnessed NIEA&rsquo;s failure to consult properly  about declaring Lisnaragh as an area of special scientific interest. Surely  that should have caused alarm bells to ring in the Minister&rsquo;s Department.  Although the matter received a great deal of press and media coverage and the  Minister spoke about it, opportunities were not afforded for a proper  consultation. I place on record the fact that Sinn F&eacute;in is not opposed to  designating ASSIs, but in this case, the consultation was inadequate.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Anglers throughout the Six Counties are incensed that the  pollution of local rivers, leading to numerous fish kills, happens regularly,  with NIEA taking little or no action. In addition, illegal dumping, especially  in border areas &mdash; which I am sure that Mr Ross will be glad that I mentioned &mdash;  continues unabated, with no co-ordinated response from NIEA.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Ross mentioned expenses. Although I am in danger of  becoming parochial, ratepayers in the Armagh City  and District Council area have paid to have illegal dumps cleared on numerous  occasions, and I want the Minister to take that on board. Armagh  people have yet to see results from NIEA &mdash;</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Boylan</strong>:  No; I am sorry.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In short, NIEA is perceived as those who are opposed to it  said that it would be; that is, as an ineffective, inefficient entity. The  dissatisfaction with EHS, which led to a sustained campaign by a coalition of  environmental organisations for an independent body, continues to be felt about  the rebranded, but unchanged, NIEA. The opportunity to replace lost confidence  by creating a transparent and accountable independent body was missed.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The latest campaign for an independent body is not new.  Between 1962 and 1996, several reports called for &mdash; and encouraged &mdash; the  creation of such a body. It has been argued that an independent body, operating  outside Government bodies, would have little impact on policy. However, the  same might be said about the EHS/NIEA to date, for all the impact that they  have had. If an independent body were given a chance, surely it could do  better.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">It should be noted that the purpose of an independent body  would be to deliver results, rather than to formulate policy. However, I do not  mean that policies and guidelines are not required. An independent body would  hold everyone &mdash; members of the public as well as private and statutory bodies &mdash;  to account, and Sinn F&eacute;in believes that an independent environmental protection  agency would get the job done and inspire confidence while doing so, much more  so than &mdash;</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Boylan</strong>:  No, I am sorry; I am in full flow. Members from across the Chamber will have a  chance to speak later.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Such a body would do so much more than the NIEA is doing.  Sustained criticism highlighting the failure of the EHS &mdash; and now the NIEA &mdash; to  deal with environmental governance must cause the Minister to realise that  change is required. The Minister must have witnessed the ridiculous role that  NIEA has played in planning &mdash; it is the last body that people consult in most  planning applications.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The only question that remains to be answered is whether  the Minister is prepared to accept responsibility and show leadership, or will  he, like Nero, continue to fiddle while Rome  burns. Comparing the Minister to Caesar is, perhaps, a bit much; Sid Caesar may  be a better comparison &mdash; he was a comedian as well.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that the Minister will take the views of the  majority of Members &mdash; and people beyond &mdash; into consideration. He should tell us  that he will reconsider the previous Minister&rsquo;s position and revisit the matter  of an independent environmental protection agency.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Before finishing, I inform the Minister that I have taken  his advice from last week, and I am now drinking from a glass. I tell him that  in case he wants to comment on it.<span class="Italic"> [Laughter.]</span></p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I support the motion and the amendment. Go raibh maith  agat.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for the Environment (Mr McGlone)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a  LeasCheann Comhairle. On behalf of the Committee for the Environment, I thank  Mr Ford, Mrs Long, Mr McCarthy and Mr Lunn for tabling the motion on the review  of environmental governance, and my colleague Mr Gallagher for his amendment.  Indeed, it was he who previously tabled an amendment to a motion on the  subject.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In July 2007, Professor Sharon Turner briefed the Committee  for the Environment on &lsquo;Foundations for the Future &mdash; The Review of  Environmental Governance&rsquo;, which had been published the previous May. I  compliment her and her colleagues for their detailed and comprehensive work on  that topic. She informed the Committee that, during the previous year, the then  Minister with responsibility for the environment, Jeff Rooker, had appointed a  panel of experts to conduct an independent review of environmental governance  in the North. The panel&rsquo;s challenge was to identify how the assets that were  available to manage Northern    Ireland&rsquo;s environment might be better  arranged to deliver higher-quality and more consistent environmental outcomes.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In thinking about those assets, the review addressed the  focus, structure, roles and relationships among the elements of the governance  regime, but it was notable that the review did not include an evaluation of  existing environmental policies.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">A few months later, the Committee for the Environment  considered Criminal Justice Inspection&rsquo;s report on enforcement in the  Department of the Environment. In July 2008, the Committee received a briefing  from departmental officials, who set out their goals for the future of  environmental governance. Those goals focused on the better-regulation agenda  of the previous Minister of the Environment, Arlene Foster. In considering her  approach to providing effective systems of governance and regulations, Mrs  Foster took account of the recommendations contained in the review of  environmental governance&rsquo;s final report and Criminal Justice Inspection&rsquo;s  report on enforcement in the Department.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister maintained that the restoration of the Assembly  and the Executive had changed fundamentally the context of environmental  governance, because the initial review had been commissioned under direct rule  &mdash; we have heard similar comments today from Members on the Benches opposite.  She noted that the Department was now being scrutinised by the Committee for  the Environment and that accountability arrangements were much improved under  devolution. However, that does not mean a great deal at present.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Arlene Foster argued against the review&rsquo;s suggested  organisational changes and said that Ministers from other relevant Departments  wanted to retain their responsibilities rather than have them transferred to  the Department of the Environment. As a consequence of that, her logic probably  leaned towards the establishment of an independent EPA. She also said that the  Programme for Government&rsquo;s commitment to a review of the Departments in 2011  meant that then would be a more appropriate time to consider any fundamental  restructuring of responsibilities among Departments. Those are the arguments  that the then Minister advanced, but we may hear more arguments today.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Minister Foster announced that she would retain the  Environment and Heritage Service and reorganise it as a DOE executive agency,  but, at the time of the announcement, some compared that to Marathon&rsquo;s  transition to Snickers. She acknowledged that some people would be disappointed  at that decision but maintained that, as Minister of the Environment, she,  along with her Executive colleagues, would make decisions that the Assembly and  the Committee for the Environment would scrutinise. She said that such scrutiny  would bring some degree of accountability to her Department and allow a close  degree of scrutiny that had not been possible under direct rule. She also  announced that the new agency&rsquo;s transparency and openness would be increased by  the appointment of two new independent members to its board and that board  meetings would be held in public.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Committee members asked for details of the new board&rsquo;s  position and to see the DOE&rsquo;s finalised action plan in response to Criminal  Justice Inspection&rsquo;s report.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Despite the time constraints and priorities placed on the  Committee for the Environment, it has kept a close watching brief on  environmental governance in the North. However, the Committee is not an agency;  it does not have to hand a full-time workforce working to capacity or with the  resources that are available to the Northern Ireland Environment Agency &mdash; I  almost reverted to form and said the EHS in error. I hope that the Northern  Ireland Environment Agency has not reverted to form.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">It takes its responsibilities in scrutinising the work of  the Department seriously and carries out those responsibilities conscientiously,  thus ensuring that it plays its full part in the accountability of the  Department conferred on it by devolution.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">3.00 pm</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Speaking as a constituency MLA, I have to say that we have  a long, long way to go on environmental governance, and with implementation in  full of the review of &mdash;</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Will the Member please draw his remarks to a close?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for the Environment</strong>: The Committee for the Environment can  help and can prepare a watching brief on environmental governance in the North.  However, it will be nothing like a well-resourced, independent environmental  protection agency with vision, as referred to by my colleague.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I  welcome the debate as an opportunity to raise this important matter. I support  the motion and am content with the amendment.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Ulster Unionist Party engaged constructively with the  review of environmental governance group and supported its subsequent  recommendations, chief of which was the setting up of an independent  environmental protection agency, and we remain committed to our manifesto.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">It is worth pointing out that the two main parties in the  current Assembly and Executive &mdash; the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in &mdash; did little to engage  with that review of environmental governance at the time. Perhaps it is  unsurprising that a DUP Minister decided to cherry-pick the report and ignore  its main findings. That decision, and the entire farce of the DUP stewardship  of the environment, mirrors the mismanagement of education by Sinn F&eacute;in, and  the dysfunctional nature of the current non-working Executive. We have the two  extreme ideologues that ignore expert opinion and have no comprehension of the  importance of achieving a consensus on issues that are important to the people  of Northern Ireland.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The authors of &lsquo;Foundations for the Future: The Review of  Environmental Governance&rsquo; were tasked to identify &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order, please. The Member has the Floor. Any remarks must be  addressed through the Chair.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: Mr  Deputy Speaker, the clock continued to move. I hope that you will take that  into account.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The authors were tasked:</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;to identify how the assets available to manage Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  environment might be better arranged to deliver higher quality and more  consistent environmental outcomes.&rdquo;</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">That was supported by the Confederation of British Industry  (CBI), which indicated its importance in giving confidence to those who wished  to invest, that decisions would be taken in a consistent manner. In other  words, it suggested the best way to organise our existing resources.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Even if one were to look at the area of the co-ordination  of river-basin catchment management, the report highlights the fact that the  Rivers Agency, the then Fishery Conservancy Board, the Loughs Agency, the  Drainage Council, and Waterways Ireland were all involved. If anything can be  done to reduce the number of bodies that are involved in discussions in  alleviating flooding &mdash; which is what we are actually talking about &mdash; the  bureaucracy would be reduced, leading to better and faster decisions. To run  with the line that an environmental protection agency would mean increased  bureaucracy is not true. There are many areas where more efficient and better  processes can be put in place.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">&lsquo;Foundations for the Future&rsquo; was first published in June  2007, and the experts set out in detail the reasons for their recommendations.  I encourage all Members who have not yet done so to read the report. The  failure to follow what the title of the report suggests, supported by such  cogent argument and content, does not bode well for the current rebadging  process. The report recommended that:</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Responsibility for environmental regulation in Northern Ireland  should be transferred to a new independent Environmental Protection Agency&rdquo;,</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">so that decisions would be:</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;immune from unwarranted interference by Ministers or  officials.&rdquo;</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The report also stated that the EHS, as an executive agency  of the Department of the Environment, would be:</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;increasingly out of step with good governance practice  elsewhere&rdquo;</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">in the United Kingdom  or the British Isles. A key recommendation  was:</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;to separate institutional policy making from  regulation&rdquo;,</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">which means that we are presently out of step. The  Minister and the Assembly would have the responsibility of setting the policy  in which the EPA would operate.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">It was proposed that a whole range of functions would  co-ordinate into one body, which would result in significant expertise being  amassed in one agency. Those resources would enable better and possibly speedier  decision-making and better governance.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">One finding of the report was that there is a serious lack  of transparency around the making of regulatory decisions. We know that there  were significant issues around the designation of Lisnaragh as an ASSI. First,  there was a lack of transparency in the process. Next, the Minister&rsquo;s  management board recommended approval, but the Minister decided against &mdash; a  lack of transparency, resulting in a conspiracy theory. Clearly, there are  failings in the process. How will the geologically significant features in that  general area be protected? The Minister must answer that question.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I am aware that there is concern about the percentage  targets for ASSIs. ASSI status must be clearly designated based on the quality  of the landscape and not purely by geographical area.</p>        
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I ask the Member to draw his remarks to a close.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I  support the motion and the amendment.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: It  will come as no great surprise that I oppose both the motion and the amendment.  Mr Boylan made a somewhat inaccurate reference to Nero fiddling while Rome burned. Given the  general attitude towards the establishment of an EPA, the historical character  with whom I most feel a connection is perhaps Custer.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">A range of issues must be tackled. The proposer of the  amendment, Mr Gallagher, said that there must be no more procrastination &mdash; I  certainly agree with that, but I have reached the opposite conclusion to him.  We are faced with several choices. Are we prepared to take action on the environment  now, or do we simply want to be seen to be doing something about the  environment? If it is the former, the House must reject the amendment and  support the NIEA, which can be developed now, rather than support the call for  an EPA that might take a couple of years to establish. Would we prefer to see  money spent on the environment or on administrative structures? We could take  advantage of the fact that an agency has already been set up, or spend  somewhere between &pound;2&middot;5 million and perhaps &pound;4 million to set up an EPA. Would  that money not be better spent on environ&shy;mental protection rather than  administrative structures? Indeed, it might be better spent in a range of other  areas where there are pressures on front-line services.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The nub of the matter is accountability. My colleague Mr  Ross mentioned places in which environmental bodies have been set up. It was  not that long ago that energy prices were raised, and, at that time, there were  many calls &mdash; particularly on the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment &mdash;  to intervene in the work of the energy regulator. However, the regulator was  set up in exactly the same way that the independent EPA would be set up. With  the best will in the world, the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment  did not have control over the regulator and was therefore unable to introduce  the range of measures that she would have liked to.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: No,  the Member will have his chance to speak later.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Likewise, mention has been made of ASSIs. In particular, Mr  Boylan mentioned the Lisnaragh ASSI. However, the overturning of that decision  &mdash; which was done by the Department &mdash; would not have been possible if an EPA  were in existence. The Member is very much arguing against himself. Having fought  long and hard to ensure that there is democratic accountability in Northern Ireland,  we should not lightly throw it away.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Similarly, complaints have rightly been made about the  level of consultation that EHS has provided for in the past &mdash; both about the  slowness of the consultation process and the lack of consultation in general.  However, if we establish an independent EPA that is completely outside the  Department&rsquo;s and Minister&rsquo;s control, who could apply pressure to ensure that  the consultation process is improved? The matter would be completely out of our  hands, and a level of accountability would be lost.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">When considering the effectiveness of an EPA, we must learn  from the mistakes that others have made. Have independent EPAs been successful  on other parts of this island? No, they have not. We have only to look down  South at the shambles over the development at Tara.  The matter is supposedly under the control of a Green Party Minister. However,  he is presumably not able to intervene as much as he wants to, because the  issue is in the hands of an EPA.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Scottish Government have had major problems with the Scottish  Environment Protection Agency. Let us consider the statistics: the number of  prosecutions for pollution in Northern Ireland  is 16 times the number in Scotland  &mdash; which has an independent EPA &mdash; and four times the number in Wales.  Therefore, if this is an argument about effectiveness, the statistics are very  much in favour of the current structures.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The current structures are also favourable in respect of  consistency and bureaucracy. I pay tribute to the consistency of the proposers  of the motion and those who tabled the amendment. The Alliance Party and the SDLP  have been fairly consistent on the issue. However, two of the other parties  that have spoken in favour of the motion have not been so consistent. The  Department for Regional Development (DRD) and DARD were two of the obstacles to  drawing in powers that could form part of an EPA. I wonder which party controls  those Departments.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The party to my right lectures the DUP on its failure to do  this, that and the other in respect of an EPA. Curiously enough, there were two  Ulster Unionist Environment Ministers during the last Assembly mandate &mdash;  Minister Sam Foster and Minister Dermott Nesbitt &mdash; but an independent EPA was  not established under their tenures, despite UUP assertions that the issue has  been on the table since 1962. That party has shown no consistency on this  matter.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">However, all the parties are consistent in the message that  they send out to farmers.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: The  Ulster Farmers&rsquo; Union is strongly opposed to  the substance of the motion. Therefore, I hope that parties will not be mealy  mouthed when explaining their position to farmers.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McKay</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I welcome the motion, as amended.  When the review of environmental governance was launched in Belfast last year, I recall the hope that was  felt by many people who work in environment-related occupations on a daily  basis. I recall the hope that was felt by non-governmental organisations &mdash;  which do not hold a particular political opinion &mdash; in respect of the review&rsquo;s  recommendations.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The review was broadly welcomed across the political  spectrum, but not by the predictable, naysaying Democratic Unionist Party.  Given the decision taken by the previous Environment Minister, Arlene Foster,  the current Minister&rsquo;s position is not surprising.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The independent experts who undertook the review took  account of the importance of a high-quality environment for the population&rsquo;s  immediate well-being. They also stated that a high-quality environment was a  key attractor for inward investment and tourism, and essential to sustain and  develop the sectors of the economy that are dependent on the environment.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Protecting our environment can yield many economic  benefits, such as increased tourism. Furthermore, if we do not take action on  environmental governance and climate change now, damage to the environment  could have a massively negative impact on the economy 20 or 30 years down the  line.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>: I  have listened to what the Member has said &mdash; after he was quite finished  striving to cover north Antrim with bungalows. When the then Environment  Minister discussed this matter within the Executive, the Sinn F&eacute;in Ministers &mdash;  the Regional Development Minister and the Agriculture Minister &mdash; sat on their  hands and did absolutely nothing. They were perfectly content with the  decision.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In public, they claimed that they were in opposition, but  they sat on their hands again when the matter came before the Executive after  Mrs Foster&rsquo;s statement to the Assembly. They did not lift a finger to oppose  her decision. It is all very well for the Member to say in the public that he  is in favour of an environmental protection agency, but his party is saying  something very different in private.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McKay</strong>: It  is important to knock that nonsense on the head. The decision that came before  the Executive clearly stated that an NI environmental agency would be set up.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: Did  you mean Northern Ireland?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McKay</strong>: It  is the North of Ireland. There was no decision on an environmental protection  agency that Sinn F&eacute;in could have blocked. Sinn F&eacute;in wants an independent  environmental protection agency to be established. The Rubicon must be crossed  in respect of that matter before the Committee can discuss what remit that environmental  protection agency will have.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  Does the Member agree that the establishment of an independent EPA falls under  the definition of a &ldquo;significant and controversial matter&rdquo; in accordance with  the ministerial code of conduct, which can force a collective decision to be  taken by the Executive?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McKay</strong>: No  proposal on an EPA has come before the Executive. That would be clear to the  Member if he had done his homework. He has had about six months to check the  facts, and I urge him to do some research on the matter.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Independence  is absolutely necessary. I agree with Members who said that independence is  needed because a regulator must command public confidence and act, and be seen  to act, in a consistent manner. Nevertheless, Ministers and elected  representatives must have a central voice in environmental regulation while  retaining the power to direct an independent agency as well as the right to  issue guidance on how its powers are exercised. Therefore it is not a question  of an independent environmental protection agency being totally beyond the  oversight of this political institution. The remit to do that exists and can be  put in place by the Assembly.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In May, the ministerial statement was made to the dismay of  many environmental non-governmental organisations. The new Environment Agency  was nothing more than a repackage; it has been no more effective than its  predecessor. It has been rebranded with no extra substance. The DOE has  continued to come under fire since the rebranding of the Environment and  Heritage Service, particularly in respect of water pollution.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore it is clear that the new Environment Agency, in  common with the new Minister of the Environment, is not fit for purpose and  delivers little of substance. On reflection, it seems that over the past two or  three weeks, hardly a week goes by without the Minister being criticised by all  parties bar his own. Every week more and more is heard about how the Minister  is falling behind with his work. He has a great deal more to do for the  environment; he must take responsibility for it rather than sit on his hands.  Go raibh maith agat.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  Members will not be shocked to learn that I will not be supporting the motion  or the amendment.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">On 1 July 2008, I attended the launch of the Northern  Ireland Environment Agency. Only four months later, the Assembly is debating a  motion more or less calling for the abolition of that agency.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">It is unbelievable that, after only four months, some  Members can be so certain that the agency is doing such a bad job. If an  independent environment agency had been established, I doubt that we would be  debating whether it should be abolished after four months. Some Members are so  fixated on the idea of an independent environment protection agency that they  do not want to see the Northern Ireland Environment Agency succeed. That is why  they ask for it to be abolished.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In the debate on 27 May 2008, the then Minister of the  Environment, Arlene Foster, stated her belief that an independent review should  be carried out in 2011. That review must consider any problems with the  Environment Agency and, as the then Minister said, make changes if necessary.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I accept that there were many problems with the EHS, and  other Members have spoken about the problems with planning consultations and  other issues. It seemed that the EHS was a law onto itself, and it took ages to  respond on planning matters. However, while others shouted from the sidelines  it was a DUP Minister who faced the issue head-on and took the right decision  to form the Northern Ireland Environment Agency &mdash; an agency that is accountable  to the Minister and to the Assembly and its Committees. The Committee for the  Environment is charged with scrutinising the Minister and the Department; as a  member of that Committee, I take that responsibility seriously. Yet the  Minister is once again being called upon to hand over his powers to scrutinise  the Environment Agency by making it independent.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In my Mid Ulster constituency, there was severe flooding in  August this year when the Moyola   River burst its banks.  Many homes were badly damaged and their contents destroyed, and farmers lost  livestock, crops, equipment and other material. Many people believe that the  flooding was made worse because environmental constraints meant that badgers,  fish and even trees were deemed more important than property. That is because  there are only a few weeks in the year in which the Rivers Agency can carry out  maintenance work &mdash; remove debris, cut back trees or repair river banks.Surely,  there must come a time when the lives and property of people are put before  fish, birds and badgers.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In January 2007, the Ulster Farmers&rsquo; Union  launched its campaign to cut excessive red tape in agriculture and received  unanimous support from the Assembly. If Members truly support a reduction of  red tape, it is time for them to support the Northern Ireland Environment  Agency and reject the notion of an independent environment protection agency  that would, ultimately, increase red tape.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McClarty</strong>:  The Ulster Unionist Party regards Northern Ireland&rsquo;s diverse and  beautiful natural environment as one of our greatest assets; it is also a  crucial component of our local economy and will be an even greater component in  a peaceful future.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">However, we are also acutely aware that we have not been  good stewards of our natural environment; for decades, we have been one of Europe&rsquo;s sick men and considered a special case. We have  continuously failed to meet European regulations and continued to pollute at  unacceptable levels. However, times have changed, and we must change with them.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The review of environmental governance held out some hope  for the reform that was required. However, as with so many issues, the Minister  has proven that he would rather go it alone, centralise power and remain  outside the considered mainstream. As a party of the Union, the Ulster Unionist  Party is deeply aware of the grave disparity that exists between the levels and  mechanisms of environmental protection in Northern   Ireland and those in the rest of the United Kingdom.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The review of environmental governance highlighted what has  been realised across the rest of the United Kingdom and in the Republic of  Ireland for more than a decade &mdash; to ensure the required environmental  protection, legislative responsibilities must be meaningfully separated from  the regulatory and enforcement functions of any environment protection agency.  The continual failings of the EHS have proven that over past decades. The  Minister is not allowing us to implement best practice.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The previous Minister of the Environment paid homage to  that fact in her statement on 27 May 2008, when she outlined proposals for the  new Environment Agency:</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;I want to see clear blue water between the role of  the core Department as policy-maker and legislator and the role of the  environment agency as protector, regulator and enforcer.&rdquo; &mdash;<span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; "> [Official Report, Vol 31,  No 1, p4, col 1].</span></span></p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">However, despite the former Environment Minister&rsquo;s sleight  of hand, it cannot be denied that the new Environment Agency remains firmly  under the control of the Department of the Environment and the Executive. No  clear blue water has been established and, like the continued pollution of  rivers such as the Six Mile Water, there is nothing but a murky opaqueness  between the two.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The former Environment Minister went on to make much of the  better regulation board, only to inform us that its members would be leaders in  the agriculture, construction, water and business sectors. The Minister made no  mention of representation from environmental experts or advocates. The former  Minister of the Environment called them critical friends &mdash; I am concerned that  in order not to offend a friend people sometimes refrain from telling them the  whole truth.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Unfortunately, such lazy thinking and language is what we  are coming to expect from the Minister of the Environment. However, the Ulster  Unionist Party does not support regulation for regulation&rsquo;s sake. That has been  proven by the actions and decisions of the Minister of Health, Social Services  and Public Safety. However, we believe in good and fair regulation, and the  creation of an independent environmental agency would be good regulation. The  recent incidences of flooding provided a less than obvious example of the  benefits that a functioning Department and an independent environment agency  can deliver.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Detailed flood risk assessments are produced by the EPA in England and Wales. That information is then  integrated into a climate-change adaptation strategy. However, although we have  created preliminary flood maps, our inability to join up the dots will mean  that we will probably not utilise them to their optimum. We have an Environment  Minister who does not believe in climate change, and we do not have an  independent environmental protection agency from which independent advice can  be sought. Under the DUP&rsquo;s leadership, we will be unable to join up the dots to  ensure that good regulation and reform are put in place.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">As Mr McGlone said, changing the name of Marathons to  Snickers did little to change their flavour. In the same way, the Environment  Agency has made little difference during its short lifetime, and it is time  that the Minister recognised that fact. I support the motion.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment (Mr S Wilson)</strong>: I am not sure whether people who have  listened to this debate will welcome it, because the Assembly is becoming more  like the BBC, with repeats almost every week, especially on issues relating to  the environment. Members trotted out the same old arguments, and no new ideas  were suggested. There was no recognition of the good, hard work that the  Department is doing on the entire area of the environment.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I want to address as many of the Members&rsquo; points as  possible, but I wish to make something very clear from the start &mdash; there will  be no review of the current governmental arrangements for the Environment  Agency during the lifetime of the Assembly. There are three reasons for that.  First, a new agency has been set up, and it needs time to be assessed and to  prove itself. We have heard Members speaking nonsense and writing the agency  off after only three or four months, without one shred of evidence that it is  not doing its job, and without one example of where it has failed. They have  simply written the agency off, saying that it is not fit for purpose, it is not  up to the job, and it cannot perform as well as other agencies. I could repeat  statements that other Members have made.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The proposer of the motion, Mr Ford, said that the  Environment Agency is not up to the challenge. Mr Ford was a social worker, and  I am sure that if anyone had dared suggest to him that a social policy could  have been evaluated and a judgement made on it after four months, he would have  said that they needed to have their heads felt, because he knows that a policy  cannot be evaluated in such a short time. He did not do himself or his argument  any justice when he came off with the nonsense that we heard in his speech  today.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Standards in the Assembly have been criticised at times,  but if a GCSE student had proposed some of the arguments that Members made  today, they would not even get a grade C for them, because no justification was  given for any of the sweeping statements that were made.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, new members of staff have been appointed to the  agency, and independent members have been appointed to the board. Those people  must be given some sense of security and a long-term objective to work towards.  Time and again, Members raised issues for party political reasons, but that  creates a degree of uncertainty. Some Members are simply pandering to groups  that will applaud them for it, despite the fact that many of them are not even  clear about what they mean when they talk about the role of an independent  environmental agency &mdash; but I will come to that issue in a moment.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I believe that we owe it to the agency&rsquo;s staff, who have  been given rigorous targets, to have some kind of stability over the next few  years.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">3.30 pm</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">My third reason for opposing the motion is that I have  worked with many of those staff members. They have presented me with policy  papers, arguments and plans, and I have visited them at their places of work,  some of which are not in very pleasant conditions. I have seen their commitment  to the agency. Some of them make their telephone numbers available to members  of the public so that they can be called out to incidents, 24 hours a day.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I owe it to those totally dedicated staff who, despite the  impression given by some Members here, feel aggrieved when the environment is  damaged, when some part of the job for which they are responsible has not been  adequately done or when someone has escaped prosecution for a pollution  incident. I have spoken to some of those staff members, and when a polluter escapes  prosecution, they feel as sore about it &mdash; sorer, perhaps &mdash; than those who, in  their mock rage, make statements to the papers that give the impression that  the agency&rsquo;s staff are doing nothing and turning a blind eye to some things  that are happening.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">For all those reasons, the Assembly, rather than  continually sniping at the organisation, ought to fall in behind those  dedicated staff. I do not always agree with them; sometimes I have rows with  them, and we have words. They may have different views and ideas, but at least  they are dedicated. They are owed, until they have shown otherwise, the support  of the Assembly. They do not deserve the headline-grabbing criticisms that are  sometimes made of them.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I will turn to some of the issues that were raised. The  agency has been criticised because it is not accountable or independent. I did  not have time to find quotes from every Member of the Assembly, although I  suspect that I could have found examples had I dug long enough. However, every  party in the Assembly that has talked about the importance of having an  independent environmental protection agency has, at some time or another,  questioned the value of having independent regulatory bodies, whether they are  for energy or for water. To use the broad language of the proposer of the  motion, there is nothing wrong with the objective of cutting back on  unaccountable and over-bureaucratic bodies.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Either we have an independent agency, or there must be some  regulation. I note that the Ulster Unionist Party&rsquo;s Minister has said that he  has no confidence in regulators. He did not want an independent body. He said  that, having seen how the electricity and gas regulator operates, he does not  do a particularly brilliant job for the consumer. Independence, therefore, does not guarantee  that a good job will be done.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in, of course, demanded in September 2008 that the  Minister of Enterprise,  Trade and Investment should interfere with the work of the Utility Regulator.  When we talk about independent regulators and independent bodies in the  Assembly, some Members do not like to see that independence being exercised too  strongly.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I suspect that they would have the same difficulty were an  independent environmental protection agency established.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Boylan and other Members let the cat out of the bag when  they mentioned Lisnaragh. I am not sure whether they welcomed the fact that,  given that the agency is not totally independent, the Committee for the  Environment was able to consider the issue and bring a recommendation to me. Mr  Beggs was not sure what recommendation was made because, according to the  minute of that Committee meeting, he said that he was not sure what was  proposed. He, therefore, sat on the fence on the issue.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Ford thought that it was so important to scrutinise the  work of my Department and that of the regulator that he did not even stay to  the end of the Committee meeting, so he did not know what decision was made.  Therefore, before Members start to criticise the Department and the agency,  they ought to consider their own involvement.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Members mentioned transparency. NIEA has open board  meetings, and on its website, it publishes papers that show how it reached  decisions, what decisions have been made, and what targets have been set. There  is information on team briefs, corporate plans, business plans, performance  data, accounts and other matters. The agency is totally transparent, and anyone  can see how it conducts its business and how the Department regulates it.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Gallagher&rsquo;s amendment calls for an independent agency to  be fully operational before the end of the current Assembly mandate so that it  can protect the environment. He ignored the fact that that will involve a cost,  but other Members pointed out that perhaps he would prefer &pound;4 million to be  diverted to the setting up of a new agency. I, however, would prefer that money  to be spent on better regulation and on ensuring that people are in place to  make sure that that regulation occurs. His amendment is an example of the  naivety of some Members who think that I am able to wave a magic wand tomorrow  that, hey presto, will create a brand new, costless, independent environmental  protection agency.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Establishing such a body would not be costless, and it  could not be done immediately, anyway. Primary legislation would have to be  drafted, and the legal entity would have to be set up to cover its management  and financial relationships with the DOE. An independent environmental  protection agency would have to seek resources from the DOE &mdash; money would not  fall from the trees or come from the sea. A chairperson and a board would have  to be appointed, and there would have to be a shadowing period to allow the  chairperson and the management team to bed in. That would not work, and it would  not happen overnight. An agency exists that is working towards achieving its  objectives.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Gallagher also said &mdash;</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  The reason that Ministers have given for not setting up an independent  environmental protection agency could equally be given as a reason not to  review public administration and local government. The redevelopment of local  government is progressing, so why does the Minister use that argument against  establishing an independent environmental protection agency?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: Every time that the Member opens his mouth on such issues,  he shows his ignorance. As I will demonstrate, the Northern Ireland Environment  Agency serves its purpose well. Local government, on the other hand, will be  reformed in order to give it additional powers and to improve it. That is why  the review is progressing and why the Northern Ireland Environment Agency  should stay.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Arguments were made about the effectiveness of the agency.  I will not repeat all the statistics that other Members gave, but the Northern  Ireland Environment Agency prosecutes more people than any independent agency  in the United Kingdom, even  though Northern Ireland  is a smaller area. The agency pursues polluters effectively, and its sentencing  is effective. It does not discriminate between semi-governmental bodies and  bodies that are unattached to Government; Northern Ireland Water feels the  weight of my Department as much as any private individual. Infraction  proceedings against other parts of the United Kingdom, whose agencies are  independent, occur more often.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, there is no guarantee that an independent  environment agency would lead to a form of governance in which pollution would  not occur and the environment would not be damaged.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Cathal Boylan asked about the border areas. The agency  pursues the issue of waste management in border areas to the point where it  forces councils in the Republic to pay for the removal of waste that was dumped  illegally in Northern    Ireland. I have pursued that vigorously to  the point where illegal dumpers have had their assets seized and some of the  illegal dumpers have been put in jail. Therefore, do not tell me that the  Environment Agency is not effective. The agency is effective, and, for that  reason, we ought to give it the opportunity to prove that is capable of doing  the job. In its short life, it has shown that to be the case, and over time, it  will continue to show that. The Assembly should fall in behind the agency&rsquo;s  staff and give them the help and encouragement to ensure that the environment  is cleaned up.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Minister&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  Something of Dr Paisley&rsquo;s legacy has clearly rubbed off on the Minister of the  Environment, who began his contribution to the debate with a no, no, never  approach.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I want, first, to set the record straight and to correct  the Minister&rsquo;s implications that I was attacking staff from the Department of  the Environment, or any other staff for that matter. I have never verbally  attacked staff, and I know that all staff work hard in difficult circumstances.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The motion, however, is not about staff, but the regulation  of the environment. We are debating the issue again because the Minister&rsquo;s  predecessor, Arlene Foster, with the support of her party, who contributed to  the debate on the day that the new agency was introduced, put the staff in a  difficult position. The Department of the Environment is the only Department  that tries to have it both ways: to be poacher and gamekeeper. Members from the  other side of the House attempted to draw other regulators into the issue. The  Department of the Environment is unique in having a regulator that tries to be  poacher and gamekeeper at the same time. That does not work. It is clear that  the public has no confidence in the agency, and that is why so many Members  have again provided their views on the issue.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, the views of experts were simply sidelined and  dropped. The review of environmental governance provided several  recommendations after long, drawn out consultations. Yet what we got from the  Minister of the Environment was simply moving furniture around and repackaging  the EHS. The Minister can shout for as long as he wishes, but he will not  change the fact that the public increasingly care about the environment, and  this issue will not go away.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We are criticised on this side for daring to say that we  need a better body after only four months. The Minister has tried to tell us  that the agency is the most effective regulatory body in the UK. May I  remind him of a well-known tyres incident that happened under the new  Environment Agency not so long ago when an individual was found disposing of  tyres illegally. He was intercepted by the agency, taken to court, and fined  &pound;200.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">It turned out that the true cost of the tyre disposal was  &pound;1,000. What has happened to the polluter-pays principle? That is just one  example of why this debate must continue until we have an independent  environment agency. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span> I will not give  way. The scale of protection &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order, please. The Member has the Floor.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">3.45 pm</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  The issue is the scale of protection for the environment and, as I have said,  that is completely inadequate; the public has no confidence in it. The way in  which regulation is being taken forward is not independent, and that is not the  fault of the staff of the Department of the Environment.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: We  are pleased that we have the opportunity to discuss this critical issue today.  Although it has only been a few months since the decision was taken by the  Minister&rsquo;s predecessor, this is a matter of considerable public concern.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Like many other Members, I have received a large postbag  full of letters from constituents on the issue. Ninety-nine per cent of them  are in favour of having an independent environment protection agency. People  recognise that the arrangements for institutional governance of the environment  in Northern Ireland  are not fit for purpose and need to be modernised. They also recognise that  independence and transparency need to be taken into account when decisions  about the environment are made.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">There has been a significant evolution in thinking during  the decade following the last review. The decision that the previous Minister  of the Environment took on the matter was not based on any sound rationale in  policy-making; the decision was political, and it was taken to reflect the  needs of a narrow section of the community in Northern Ireland rather than the  wider needs of society. It ran against the recommendations of the review of  environmental governance set up during direct rule by Lord Rooker &mdash; hardly an  example of a pro-environment Minister. Nevertheless, he went along with it.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Major environmental issues must be considered by an EPA,  including the prevention and control of pollution, waste management,  biodiversity, inland and coastal waterways and our built heritage, and some  Members have stressed that independent EPAs are the norm, not just in these  islands but in the world.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">A number of different themes have emerged in the debate,  one of which is the notion that having an independent environment protection  agency runs contrary to the idea of having a devolved Assembly with local,  elected MLAs and Ministers taking decisions. Democracy is more sophisticated  than simple majority voting in a legislature followed by a Minister doing  whatever he or she likes. Democracy is about having a rules-based system; it is  about the rule of law and putting in place proper checks and balances to ensure  that the law fully takes its course. Such checks and balances need to exist in  an independent environment protection agency. Other democratic jurisdictions &mdash; Scotland, which has its Parliament, and the Republic of Ireland &mdash; are able co-exist  satisfactorily with an independent EPA. There is no reason why we cannot do the  same while not undermining the quality of democracy in the Chamber.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The DUP is not consistent when making its comments. When it  comes to private finance initiatives, the DUP is quite happy for major  contracts to be handed over to the private sector to run on behalf of  Government &mdash; for example, the Workplace 2010 contract. Although that is on  hold, temporarily, it will potentially cover two-thirds of the Civil Service  estate. Once the contract is signed, Members will have no control over how it  will roll out because that will be set out in law. The DUP is happy to do that  while arguing against having an independent EPA &mdash; it is not being consistent.  It shows that the argument is more about political expediency than logic.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">A rather demeaning comment was made about unelected NGOs.  Let me tell the House something about the RSPB: it is a mass-membership  organisation throughout the UK  that, I dare say, has more members in Northern Ireland than every  political party in the Assembly combined. That puts the matter in context. That  organisation&rsquo;s views reflect those of its members.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We have been told that there cannot be an EPA because its  set-up costs might range from &pound;2&middot;5 million to &pound;4 million and it would incur  running costs of &pound;600,000 each year. We do not hear about the costs of not  having a proper system of environmental governance in Northern Ireland,  which may include financial costs in the increased likelihood of fines and  infraction proceedings, and the wider impact on the economy.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The DUP seems to operate on the notion that developing the  economy and protecting the environment are mutually exclusive. They are not at  all. Indeed, they are more than simply consistent; there is a social imperative  to grow a green economy. In the United    States, where there will be a change of  leadership in the next few months, one key aspect of the new Obama  Administration will be the development of the &ldquo;green new deal&rdquo;. It recognises  that development of the economy and protecting the environment go hand in hand.  That is significant, given the American legacy on the environment. Northern Ireland  should be heading in the same direction. Although change does not happen  overnight, as Jeffrey Sachs pointed out in today&rsquo;s &lsquo;Irish Times&rsquo;, it is  important that we start to head in that direction.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Clearly, much of what the DUP says on the issue has been  influenced by one sector of society, namely farmers, through the Ulster  Farmers&rsquo; Union. Other aspects of the economy  must also be borne in mind. That is reflected in the support of the CBI, among  other bodies, for an independent environmental protection agency. Members are  aware that the CBI tends to be hard-nosed when it comes to economic matters;  however, even it recognises the new opportunities to rebalance and transform  the Northern Ireland  economy. Many aspects of the economy depend on a good, clean environment.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Another notion is that there cannot be a review because the  Northern Ireland Environment Agency has been in place for a mere four months.  The reason for this debate is that there was no sound, policy-making rationale  for the decision that was taken on the agency: it was flawed. A proper review  has already been conducted &mdash; the review of environmental governance. Its  recommendation is quite clear: an independent EPA is needed. There is no point  in Northern Ireland  hanging around for years and missing out on the opportunities that arise from a  different way of doing things and for society to lose out as a consequence.  Rapid progress must be made now.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The decision-making process must also be examined. Four out  of five parties in the Assembly seem to believe in the importance of an  independent environmental protection agency. We are not too sure about Sinn  F&eacute;in; however, we will take it at face value for the purposes of this debate.  The DUP is the one exception.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">There is supposed to be power-sharing in this society. To  me, that means an Executive that can take collective decisions on &ldquo;significant  or controversial&rdquo; matters. However, the outcome on this important matter is  subject to the lucky dip of d&rsquo;Hondt &mdash; the fact that the DUP, rather than  another party, has taken on the Environment portfolio. My understanding was  that the St Andrews Agreement would stop that type of outcome. To use another  example, there is a risk of the Education Minister being able to take a  polarising decision on education simply because Sinn F&eacute;in has the Education  portfolio. Collective outcomes are needed from the Executive. Mechanisms for  that exist through the ministerial code of conduct.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">As far as the Assembly is aware, the former Environment  Minister informed her Executive colleagues of the decision that she was going  to take. However, her decision had a cross-cutting impact on other Departments  such as DCAL, DARD and DRD. However, it was also a &ldquo;significant or  controversial&rdquo; matter under the definition in the code of conduct. At no time  did any party in the Executive challenge the Minister&rsquo;s decision and seek to  force a collective vote in the Executive that could have delivered a different  outcome.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McKay</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  Sorry, I have no time.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">After the Minister was challenged on her decision through a  petition of concern, the First Minister and deputy First Minister accepted that  the issue of environmental governance was a &ldquo;significant and controversial&rdquo;  matter under the definition in the code of conduct. That means that all future  decisions on environmental governance will have to be collective decisions of  the Executive.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">However, given that all future decisions are supposed to be  collective, it begs the question of why the first decision was not. Had it  been, the outcome and the nature of today&rsquo;s debate would have been different.  Members must bear in mind that major flaws exist in the Executive. I am glad that  the Minister was listening to that part of my speech, and I hope that he will  heed the remainder when he reads the Hansard report, because he was rather  inattentive during the first half.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Alliance Party is happy to support the SDLP amendment.  However, I must point out that the SDLP&rsquo;s tabling of a similar amendment last  autumn was tactically unsound. At that stage, the priority was to seek the  maximum level of consensus in the Chamber on the principle of an independent  environmental protection agency.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">As it turned out, the motion received the support of all  parties in the Chamber, including the DUP, on that important topic. Since then,  the DUP has wandered off and, rather than acting for the common good, has given  in to special interests in society. However, that is a decision for the DUP to  justify in due course. I am happy to support the motion and the amendment.</p>

        <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr McClarty] in the Chair)</p>
        <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="5"></a>Private Members&rsquo; Business</p>
        <p class="H5StageHeading">Drink-Driving Limit</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to one hour and 30  minutes for the debate. The proposer of the motion will have 10 minutes in  which to propose and 10 minutes in which to make a winding-up speech. All other  Members who are called to speak will have five minutes.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: I  beg to move</p>
        <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly calls on the Minister of the Environment  to investigate the viability of reducing the current drink-driving limit.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Earlier, in the debate about alcohol misuse, I said  that we would debate this motion, so it is good that we are doing so.  Drink-driving is widely recognised as a major problem on our roads, and it is  no longer culturally acceptable to drink and then drive home. It is not only  the person driving who puts his or her life at risk but also the lives of  everyone else who uses roads or, indeed, footpaths.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Far fewer people drive after drinking alcohol than even 10  years ago. Nevertheless, worryingly, a recent survey found that 17% of people  said that they had driven home in the knowledge that they were probably over  the legal limit. Two people might drink the same amount of alcohol but be  affected differently &mdash; one person might be over the limit and the other not.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">When discussing such matters, it is important that we have  public backing, and, in recent polls, 75% of people support lowering the legal  drink-driving limit. Public support for a law often means that people abide by  it.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Although no specific measures are mentioned in the motion,  the most likely reduction would be to 50 mg, which would bring us into line  with the rest of Europe. Although I do not  usually wish to harmonise our laws with Europe, the UK,  Malta, Luxemburg and the Irish Republic  are the only countries in which the limit is set as high as 80 mg.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Some people have called for a zero limit; however, that is  unworkable and unenforceable. The body maintains a natural level of alcohol,  even as a result of digestion. In addition, those who use a mouthwash in the  morning and people who might have had a couple of pints the previous night  would find themselves in difficulty with the law.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Although we have among the highest drink-driving limits in Europe, we have tougher penalties, and that is important.  More than 1,000 people lose their licences every year for drinking and driving.  In Northern Ireland  last year, more than 600 drivers were caught drink-driving, and, scarily,  despite the fact that we have more campaigns against drink-driving than ever  before that is a higher figure than for the previous year.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Many people say that they are unsure of the drink-driving  limit and how much they can drink before driving, and we must consider that  grey area. Reducing the drink-driving limit would send a clear message from the  Assembly that it is unacceptable to drink any alcohol before driving a car.  People who argue that they are unaware of how much they can drink before  driving would support reducing the limit to 50 mg, because that would make the  law much clearer. If one intends to drive, one drink is far too much.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">On the other side of the debate, few people would argue  against the motion. However, some publicans say that lowering the limit might  criminalise innocent people. That is nonsense. Lowering the limit is, first and  foremost, about saving lives and reducing the risk of accidents.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In 2007-08, Northern    Ireland experienced 431 drink-driving road  accidents, in which 18 people were killed and 143 people were seriously  injured. In October 2008, &lsquo;The Irish News&rsquo; reported that one third of all road  deaths are caused by alcohol-related accidents. Moreover, the proposal to  reduce the drink-driving limit is supported by the Government&rsquo;s road safety  strategy, which points to evidence that reducing the limit to 50 mg can  significantly reduce road deaths. The Chief Medical Officer, Sir Liam  Donaldson, and the BMA in Northern    Ireland support that opinion, and the  association has actively campaigned for a reduction for many years.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The anti-drink-driving campaign is well established, and it  is making a particular push as we approach Christmas and the new year. Often  such campaigns are targeted at men coming home from sports events on a Saturday  or from a night out with their friends, because, unfortunately, men are more  likely to drink-drive, and evidence backs that up. However, it is not a problem  for men only. In August 2008, the &lsquo;Sunday Sport&rsquo; reported that the ladette  culture was responsible for a rise in the number of drink-driving convictions  among women in Northern    Ireland. The number has doubled in the past  decade, and that has been attributed to the fact that attitudes towards  drinking have changed, particularly the attitudes of women who go out with  their friends and have a glass of wine. Bars are serving bigger glasses of wine  than they used to, and that can often put the customer over the limit.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">One often thinks that it is older people who disregard  drink-driving laws, but that is not always the case. On 22 April 2008, I  proposed a motion on graduated driver licences (GDL), and, as part of that, I  called for a lower limit for novice drivers. That part of the motion was  supported by most young people; in fact, it was the only part that was  supported by young people. It is the law in New   Zealand, Australia  and many states in the US  where GDL is operated. The rationale is that novice drivers are most at risk  from road accidents, because they do not have much experience on the road. To  add additional risk by permitting them to drink alcohol is inappropriate. In  the areas in which GDL operates, the limit is reduced to 20 mg and increased to  40 mg or 50 mg on completion of the driver&rsquo;s restricted period.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The not-a-drop message is the most effective campaign, and  lowering the legal limit will reinforce that view. The message is simple, and  there are no grey areas. If someone intends to drive, he or she should not  drink any alcohol. One drink can impair one&rsquo;s ability to drive. That is because  people are two and a half times more likely to be involved in a road accident  if they have been drinking. Alcohol is a sedative, and the effects of alcohol  can hit the brain in a matter of minutes. It is not acceptable to gamble with  drink-driving.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Over the weekend, I am sure that other Members were as  disgusted as I was to see an Ipswich   Town football player,  David Norris, mock the fact that his friend had been imprisoned for  drink-driving. His friend Luke McCormick, who killed two young boys after  driving on the motorway while drunk, is, fortunately, serving seven years in  prison for that offence. It is hoped that Ipswich Town Football Club will  punish its player for making light of such a serious and tragic event.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  Today&rsquo;s newspapers report that the club has reprimanded the player. He has been  fined, and he has apologised to the family and stated that he regrets his  actions.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: I  am pleased that Ipswich   Town has taken action  against the player. I hope that that will send out a message to many people  across the country.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">From the moment that we take a drink of alcohol, it starts  to close down mental activity, and it progressively damages an individual&rsquo;s  ability to perform the complex skills that are required to drive safely. Our  ability to observe, implement and process information from our eyes and other  senses is impaired by even a low level of alcohol in the bloodstream. Taking  that first drink can often be a fatal decision.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">At under one eighth of the legal limit, basic driving  skills and the ability to concentrate are diminished. We begin to relax to the  point of sleep at times, and drivers who fall asleep cause some 16% of  accidents on major roads in England  and 10% in France.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">At one third of the legal limit, visual functions and  choice reaction time begin to show serious impairment, and at one half the  legal limit, vigilance, alertness and reactions are impaired on half of the  scientific tests conducted. At three fifths of the legal limit, perception and  visible functions are impaired, and, at four fifths, the driver&rsquo;s ability to  have sound judgement is damaged. Therefore, it is easy to say when a driver  increases his or her risk of an accident: it happens the moment that they take  one alcoholic drink.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I hold no truck with the assertion that those who go out  and enjoy a glass of wine with their meal will be targeted unfairly. Why do  they feel that they are different from a young man who has a couple of pints  after a football match on a Saturday? The same facts apply for everyone:  drinking and driving causes accidents and can also cause death. That is why I  am calling on the House to back the motion and send out a strong message from  the Assembly that drink-driving is unacceptable. I look forward to hearing the  views and comments of other Members and the Minister this afternoon.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for the Environment (Mr McGlone)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a  LeasCheann Comhairle. On behalf of the Committee for the Environment, I thank  Mr Ross and Mr Weir &mdash; who are members of the Committee for the Environment &mdash;  for proposing the motion on the drink-driving limit. The Committee considered  the issue earlier this year, following a presentation by the Minister of that  time, Mrs Arlene Foster, on her proposals to improve safety on the North&rsquo;s  roads. The Committee urged the Minister to ensure that drink-driving limits  would be enforced strictly, and it supported the proposal for random  breath-testing.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">However, in conjunction with that, the Committee noted that  it would be essential for enforcement to be consistent on both sides of the  border. The Minister advised the Committee that her counterparts down South had  announced their intention also to take steps to reduce their current  drink-driving limit. The Committee recommended that the Department consider a  high-profile media campaign to increase road-safety awareness and that it  include the need for compliance with new drink-driving limits.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">4.30 pm</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Committee members supported the proposal to lower the  blood-alcohol limit to 50 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood for most drivers.  That would bring the North into step with most other European countries. They  also backed the idea of introducing an even lower limit of 20 mg per 100 ml for  inexperienced drivers, LGV drivers and motorcyclists. Studies have shown that  the accident risk increases substantially for young or inexperienced drivers at  blood-alcohol levels of 20 mg per 100 ml. A lower drink-drive limit for novice  drivers has been introduced in some countries, with evaluation studies showing  that that resulted in fewer alcohol-related fatalities in that age group.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">To inform its thinking on the road-safety proposals, the  Committee engaged in extensive consultation with many interest groups. It is  worth noting that, although all respondents supported the proposals to reduce  the drink-driving limit, many stressed the importance of getting across the  message of never drinking and driving, rather than focusing on a specified  legal limit.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">During the consultation, the British Medical Association  informed the Committee that, in 2005, Northern Ireland saw 276  road-traffic accidents in which the driver was affected by alcohol. Those  accidents resulted in 529 casualties, including 24 people killed and 95  seriously injured. The Minister told the Committee that, in 2006, 18 road  deaths were accountable to drink-driving and/or drug-driving. That makes it  patently clear that more must be done to address the problems in the North.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">However, the Committee did not support in full all the  Minister&rsquo;s proposals. The consultation identified inconsistencies in the  success rate of alcohol ignition locks in countries that had tested them. In  the US,  where such locks are fitted in the cars of repeat offenders, either as an  alternative to disqualification or as a form of probation after a period of  disqualification, they appear to be effective while the order is in force.  However, reoffending occurs rapidly once the restriction has been removed. In Canada, where  the programme is much more tightly supervised, more long-term improvements have  been experienced. Consequently, although Committee members supported the  general principle of alcohol ignition locks, they wanted more information on  their effectiveness from other parts of Europe  before fully endorsing them.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In summary, the Committee for the Environment supports the  principle of lowering the drink-driving limit, with an even lower level for  inexperienced, motorbike and LGV drivers. The Committee wants to see the  drink-driving limit strictly enforced and notes the need for consistent  enforcement throughout the island.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I fully support the motion, and I commend Committee members  Mr Ross and Mr Weir for tabling it.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Boylan</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I will not be quoting from any  Sunday newspapers, or from any other newspapers.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">As road-safety spokesperson for Sinn F&eacute;in, I welcome the  opportunity to speak to the motion, and I thank the Members who tabled it for  doing so. Members should be aware that Sinn F&eacute;in has consistently called for  zero tolerance on drink-driving and drug-driving, and, therefore, it welcomes  any debate on the issue.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I raised the issue in the Chamber with the Minister&rsquo;s  predecessor, who, at that time, stated unequivocally that she was in favour of  lowering the existing limit.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">As Members are aware, the island of Ireland  is out of line with the thinking of the majority of European countries. Here,  the limit is 80 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood, compared with a 50 mg limit  in other countries. Indeed, throughout Europe, only Britain,  Ireland, Malta and Luxembourg allow such a high blood-alcohol  level when driving. Members should show leadership and correct that flawed  policy by arguing strongly in support of the motion. If we agree the motion, we  should ensure that the Minister acts. He must take responsibility for his  Department&rsquo;s actions rather than bemoan the lack of Executive meetings or his  reluctance to implement regulations, as he did during last Tuesday&rsquo;s debate on  introducing a levy on plastic carrier bags.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">As I said, Sinn F&eacute;in would welcome a zero-tolerance  approach throughout the island, but, beyond that debate, we would certainly  welcome a reduction in the current limit, be that down to 50 mg or 20 mg. The  previous Minister of the Environment pledged to have a public consultation on  the matter, and we still await that. I hope that the current Minister will move  the issue on at a pace in keeping with its importance.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I know that the Minister and many of his party colleagues  are reluctant to embrace scientific findings. Nevertheless, I hope that they  will accept that studies have shown that even one drink can lead to impaired  driving. The BMA has stated that a blood-alcohol level of 50 mg doubles a  driver&rsquo;s risk of crashing. At present, 80 mg will raise the risk tenfold. Some  56% of motorists who drink believe that it is unacceptable to drive after even  one drink, while 61% of drivers and non-drivers surveyed feel that people  should not be allowed behind the wheel after one drink. The majority of people  have already expressed their support for tougher drink- and drug-driving legislation.  We should ensure that their wishes are adhered to.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The 2007-08 statistics for road-traffic collisions and  casualties show that drink- and drug-driving was second only to excess speed in  being responsible for death and serious injury on our roads. The figures up  until September of this year show 14 fatalities involving drink and drugs,  accounting for some 18% of road deaths in 2008. It is our duty to ensure that  we do all that we can to reduce that figure. Our party would certainly welcome  and support any new measure that can be introduced and implemented.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Of course, we can bombard the airwaves with advertisements  and try to educate as much as we can. Certainly, we must continue to do  everything that we can to make a difference. However, it could be argued that  the issue of drug-driving is under-represented in current road-safety  advertising, given its increased prevalence. I ask the Minister to take that on  board and to address the problem, perhaps through the introduction of new forms  of technology.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Reducing the legal limit may put the thought in people&rsquo;s  minds that taking that first drink could lead to the loss of their licence, and  they would have to consider the effect that that would have on their social and  work life. That may lead to drivers making decisions that they do not currently  make. In turn, that may lead to someone&rsquo;s life being saved on our roads or the  prevention of a serious life-changing injury. For that reason, Sinn F&eacute;in is  willing to support the motion. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I,  too, welcome this debate about reducing the current drink-driving limit. PSNI  road traffic collision statistics show that in 2007-08, some 37 people were  killed as a result of excessive speed. The second highest cause of death on our  roads was drink-driving; some 18 lives were lost during that year. In addition,  a further 143 people were seriously injured as a result of drink and drugs, so  it is a major issue &mdash; something happens almost every other day.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">As others have said, the legal limit for driving in Northern Ireland  is 80 mg of alcohol in 100 ml of blood. There is no fail-safe guide to how to  stay under the legal limit or about the number of units of alcohol one can  consume and still drive safely. Much depends on age, weight, sex, stress  levels, when one last ate, and the amount and type of alcohol that was  consumed. Research shows that any amount of alcohol affects one&rsquo;s ability to  drive safely, as reaction times are impaired and there is a reduction in the  ability to judge speed and distances.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Although the UK,  Ireland and Malta have  prescribed limits set at 80 mg, most European countries, as a result of painful  experience, have now set a level of 50 mg. Given the number of fatalities and  lives ruined in Northern    Ireland, surely it is time that we followed  suit? Organisations such as the BMA are not suggesting a zero limit, because  there will be cases in which individuals would register slightly above zero  even when they have not been drinking &mdash; for example, diabetics and people who  have used mouthwash may register above zero. The BMA doubts whether an absolute  zero limit would be enforceable and acceptable to the public but argues that a  50 mg level, which would bring the UK into line with most other  European countries, would be effective and beneficial.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">A study by University College London showed that lowering  the limit from 80 mg to 50 mg would prevent 63 deaths and 230 injuries a year  in the UK.  The head of road safety for the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents,  Kevin Clinton, makes similar estimates. He says that cutting the drink-driving  limit from 80 mg to 50 mg:</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;could save 50 lives and prevent 250 serious  injuries&hellip;each year.&rdquo;</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">He went on to state:</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;At levels between 50mg and 80mg, drivers are 2 - 4  times more likely to be involved in a fatal accident than drivers with no  alcohol.&rdquo;</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The BMA&rsquo;s head of science and ethics, Dr Vivienne  Nathanson, commented:</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;There is clear evidence of the link between rising  blood alcohol concentrations and dangerous driving behaviour.</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">The introduction of the current limit&hellip;led to a  dramatic fall in the number of deaths on the road, but the position has been  stagnant since 1993.&rdquo;</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">She went on to say:</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;We need a new impetus to reduce the toll of injury  and death.&rdquo;</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In October 2007, the then Minister of the Environment, Mrs  Foster, told the Assembly that her Department was &ldquo;actively&rdquo; looking into  reducing the legal driving limit. Therefore, the Department has been actively  looking into the issue for more than a year. I ask the Minister: what progress  has been made?</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Regrettably, the UK Government decided last month against  reducing the legal limit for alcohol in drivers&rsquo; blood in GB. Instead, the  Department for Transport said that it was considering giving the police new  powers to stop and test drivers at random. Cathy Keeler, Brake&rsquo;s deputy chief  executive, said:</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Although better enforcement is needed and Brake is  pleased the government is consulting on improving police enforcement, cutting  the drink-drive limit would save lives.&rdquo;</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">A clear direction has to be travelled, and it is time for  the Minister to take action. What are the proposals for reducing the alcohol  limit to 50 mg? Has the Minister finalised the proposals? If not, why not? If  the proposals have been finalised, is the Minister waiting for Executive  approval? Is this yet another item that has been prevented from coming before  the Assembly and, therefore, prevented from becoming legislation? If that is  the case, shame on Sinn F&eacute;in for blocking such an issue. This legislation would  save lives, so it is too important to be blocked. I support the motion.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  This motion could almost be regarded as an extension of the earlier debate on  alcohol misuse. It is a very important issue, and we are grateful to the  Members who brought it to the Floor of the Assembly.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Drinking and driving is wrong; it is totally unacceptable.  It puts a lethal weapon into someone&rsquo;s hands and cannot be tolerated. The  result can &mdash; and most likely will &mdash; be serious injury or death on our roads.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The slogan &ldquo;don&rsquo;t drink and drive&rdquo; must be paramount. It is  as relevant today as it was on the day that it was introduced. The motion calls  for an investigation into the viability of reducing the current drink-driving  limit. I have no problem in supporting the motion. Indeed, I support efforts to  reduce the maximum alcohol level for drivers from 80 mg to 50 mg.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Drinking and driving invites trouble for drivers and all  other road users. We simply cannot take risks on our busy and congested roads.  The maximum alcohol level for drivers in most European countries is 50 mg. I  see no reason why Northern    Ireland should not have the same rules and  regulations if they would save lives.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO)supports a reduction  of the legal limit to 50 mg. Like the Ambulance Service, the Fire Service and  other rescue services, the police are first on the scene of some of the most  horrific road accidents. The police must be listened to because they are  expected to pick up the bodies of the unfortunate victims of drink-driving. As  legislators, the least that we can do is work with them to cut down and, we  hope, eliminate road accidents.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">4.45 pm</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The BMA states that in 2007-08 there were 431 road  accidents involving alcohol or drugs. On the subject of drugs, I compliment the  authorities in south-west Cork  for intercepting a vast quantity of drugs &mdash;</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. The subject is drink-driving, Mr McCarthy.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  Thank you very much, Mr Deputy Speaker.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The figures are staggering &mdash; 661 casualties, including 18  deaths and 143 seriously injured. We cannot allow that carnage to continue. It  has been mentioned, and I will do so again, that in February of this year, my  colleague Trevor Lunn asked the then Minister of the Environment, Mrs Foster,  whether she had any proposals to change the law on drink-driving. In a response  to a question for written answer, she said:</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Departmental officials are liaising with counterparts  in Great Britain  about a range of measures to deter drink-driving and reduce casualties. One  issue under consideration is appropriate blood alcohol limits. I have already  announced that I favour a reduction in the current limits, although no  decisions have been made yet. At a recent Environment Committee meeting, I discussed  lowering the limits from 80mgs of alcohol per 100mls of blood to 50mgs for most  drivers. This could be accompanied by a lower limit of 20mgs for inexperienced  drivers, LGV drivers and motorcycle riders, in line with European Union  recommendations.&rdquo;</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">She concluded:</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;I intend to consult shortly on these proposals and on  a range of other road safety measures.&rdquo;</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The former Minister certainly demonstrated  willingness. I hope that we will shortly hear the present Minister reply along  the same lines in an effort to reduce the carnage on the roads. I support any  moves in that direction, and I support the motion.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  I also welcome the motion. Sadly, too many people have lost their lives on our  roads through drink-driving. I fully support the motion because bringing our  limit into line with the majority of European nations could save many lives.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Hundreds of people die every year in Northern Ireland  as a result of drink-driving. The Republic  of Ireland &mdash; where the same  drink-driving limit as in the United Kingdom  applies &mdash; has one of the worst records in Europe  for alcohol-related deaths. The record of alcohol-related deaths in Northern Ireland might have matched or been  worse than the Republic of Ireland&rsquo;s, if it were not for the fact that the  penalties for drink-driving in the UK  are among the most severe in Europe.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">However, we have not reached the end goal. If anything more  can be done to save lives on Ulster&rsquo;s  roads and reduce the carnage caused by drink-driving, I will support it. I  endorse every effort that has been made by the Department to reduce road  deaths; in particular, alcohol-related road deaths. I fully support advertising  campaigns by the DOE and the Police Service of Northern Ireland to discourage  drink-driving, and I wholeheartedly support the message that they send out to  &ldquo;never, ever drink and drive&rdquo;.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The reason for not reducing the drink-driving limit to zero  has been discussed. I do not believe that a zero limit is the answer. First, as  my colleague Alistair Ross said, the use of mouthwash might result in a  person&rsquo;s being over the limit; and digestion can produce alcohol in the blood,  which can lead to an above-zero result. There is no point in having a limit  that will penalise drivers who do not drink and drive and who pose no danger to  themselves or to other road users.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Zero tolerance is also not the answer, as it would be  difficult to enforce. We must set an alcohol limit that utilises our police  resources fully so that those who are guilty of drink-driving are brought to  justice. If the current drink-driving limit were reduced to 50 mg in each 100  ml of blood, more drivers would avoid drinking alcohol altogether for fear of  being above the legal limit.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Research gives an idea of the difference that reducing the  alcohol limit would make to the risk of having a car crash. According to  figures that were compiled in 2003, those who drive with 80 mg of alcohol in  each 100 ml of blood are 10 times more likely to be involved in a crash than  those who have 50 mg of alcohol for each 100 ml of blood. Those figures show  clearly that a reduction in the drink-driving limit will make the roads of the  Province a safer place.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I support the motion and welcome the fact that all Members  who spoke supported it.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McKay</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I support the motion and echo what  many Members said, so I will try not to repeat any of the statistics that were  mentioned.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In the day that is in it, we have heard about other ways in  which alcohol is having a detrimental effect on our society. Unfortunately,  binge drinking and, indeed, drink-driving have been tolerated and accepted as a  cultural norm for generations. That is the challenge that we face, and there is  a great deal of work to be done to address that.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Several Members spoke about cases where people go out to  socialise, drink into the wee small hours, wake up four or five hours later and  assume that they are fit to drive. Unfortunately, that is commonplace. One  statistic that the Research and Library Service found on the issue relates to  drivers who endure a heavy drinking session: if they finish drinking by 12.00  midnight, it could take over 13 hours for the alcohol to leave their bodies;  that is, until 1.30 pm the following day. Unfortunately, many members of the  public are not aware of that, and it should be highlighted. I ask the Minister  to examine drink-driving in those instances, as more could be done to highlight  the dangers of the practice.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Other Members referred to different forms of technology  that can be used to prevent drink-driving. I am interested to know the  Minister&rsquo;s opinion on the acceptability of the morning-after breathalyser tests  that are on sale and that some people use at home to find out their  blood-alcohol level and to ascertain whether they are safe to drive.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I echo the comments of my colleague Cathal Boylan.  Ultimately, drivers must be responsible for their own actions. However, that  does not mean that we should not consider other preventative measures to save  lives on the roads. I know of several pub owners in rural areas, particularly  in my constituency, who drive customers home at closing time and discourage  them from drink-driving. That is proactive and responsible behaviour that  should be encouraged along with other initiatives to discourage drink-driving.  That does not take away from the fact that the buck stops with the driver.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I support the motion and urge the Minister to address not  only drink-driving, but the culture that permits it. I also urge the Minister  to implement preventative measures to ensure that drink-drivers do not get on  the road in the first place. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Robinson</strong>:  I congratulate my colleagues Mr Ross and Mr Weir for tabling the motion on a  topic that is of timely importance, given that the Christmas-party season is  fast approaching.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Alcohol is a curse on society. The increasing tendency to  use alcohol for social and leisure purposes is worrying, and, sadly, it tends  to result in some people drinking and driving after a night out.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Anti-drink-driving advertisements will soon be aired on our  television screens. I hope that they are graphic and memorable, so that they  serve as a warning to people who are tempted to drink and drive.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">PSNI figures show that in the past three years, the number  of accidents in which alcohol was a contributory factor has risen steadily. As  a result of alcohol, there were 72 fatalities, and 395 people were seriously  injured. Surely we cannot permit that trail of human tragedy to continue. The  Assembly has a moral duty to reduce that physical and emotional carnage. We can  make a contribution by reducing the legal blood-alcohol limit for driving. I  would prefer the limit to be zero, but, having read information from the BMA, I  accept that that would not be an easily enforceable proposal, because some low  alcohol readings could be biochemical in nature.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I am not alone in believing that the combination of alcohol  and driving is lethal. At times, it is necessary to introduce legislation to  protect people from themselves and from others. The reduction in the  drink-driving limit would act as a safety measure to protect some people from  themselves and, more importantly, to protect other road users.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">So far this year, approximately 90 people have died on Ulster&rsquo;s roads.  Each one of those people is not a statistic, but a human being. They may be  someone&rsquo;s wife, mother, husband, father, son or daughter. If we were to ask the  families who have suffered the loss of someone in a drink-driving-related road  accident, they would tell us to make the roads safer and to reduce the  drink-driving limit. Those people know first hand about the results of such  behaviour.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I support the motion, because the merits of reducing the  drink-driving limit can be seen in results across Europe.  However, I call for no leeway to be given if the reduction is enacted. The  tougher the punishment, the tougher the lesson, and, hopefully, the result will  be fewer deaths. If someone is caught driving while over the limit, he or she  must be prosecuted.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The DOE&rsquo;s summary of scientific evidence behind the &ldquo;Just  one drink impairs driving&rdquo; campaign of November 2005, states: &ldquo;Alcohol impairs  sensible decision-making.&rdquo;</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The first impaired judgement is to drive a vehicle, and the  second can cost the driver or someone else their life.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Drink-driving is an offence, it is against the law, and it  is unacceptable in our society. I sincerely hope that the motion will receive  unanimous support, and I wholeheartedly support it.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I support the motion and I thank the Members who tabled it. This is today&rsquo;s  second motion that relates to alcohol, and that reflects the importance that  the Assembly places on safe and responsible consumption.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Unfortunately, there are many accidents and deaths on Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  roads. PSNI statistics highlight that the second-biggest cause of deaths on our  roads is due to drink-driving or driving under the influence of drugs. In  2007-08, drink-driving resulted in 431 collisions, 143 serious injuries and 18  deaths in Northern Ireland.  When one considers all the knowledge that we have accumulated about how alcohol  impairs people&rsquo;s judgement, hand-eye co-ordination and alertness, it is  unacceptable that, in the twenty-first century, it continues to be such a  prolific killer on our roads.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The United    Kingdom drink-driving limit is 80 mg of  alcohol per 100 ml of blood. The introduction of that limit in 1993  significantly reduced the number of road deaths in the United Kingdom,  and the number of alcohol-related road deaths has levelled out. Malta and the Republic  of Ireland are the only other European  countries that have the same limit as the UK.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The most widely-accepted blood-alcohol limit in Europe is 50 mg, and the Minister should seriously  consider reducing the limit here.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">5.00 pm</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">A University College London study showed that lowering the  limit from 80 mg to 50 mg would prevent 65 deaths and 230 injuries a year  across the United Kingdom.  Therefore, a simple change in law and enforcement activities could save a  significant number of lives and reduce the number of debilitating injuries and  associated grief for families.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">However, it should be noted that organisations such as the  British Medical Association (BMA) do not suggest a limit of zero because there  are cases in which people could register blood-alcohol levels slightly above  zero even when they had not been drinking. For instance, people with diabetes  and those who have used mouthwashes can register above-zero levels of alcohol  in their blood. Therefore, enforcement of such a level would be difficult, and  that must be taken into consideration.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">As well as the potential for reducing the blood-alcohol  limit for drink-driving, other options are available to us. I congratulate the  Department of the Environment on its long-standing high-profile advertising  campaign on the dangers of drink-driving. Awareness-raising must continue to be  a crucial part of any campaign to reduce road deaths and accidents due to  drink-driving. The stringency of the law, the related penalties, and the  ability of the Police Service to enforce the law must also be taken into  consideration.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I do not believe that comparisons can be made with police  services on the Continent, where the drink-driving limit is lower. We have more  robust policing and penalties in relation to this issue, and we must continue  to give the PSNI the resources and the capacity to tackle drink-driving and  improve detection rates.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Our cultural rejection of drink-driving has come a long  way, and can compare favourably with most countries in Europe.  However, I disagree with Mr McKay: we have moved in the opposite direction, in  that binge drinking has almost become part of our culture, whereas  drink-driving has, at least, become culturally unacceptable. We cannot take  that for granted; we must continue to make drink-driving unacceptable. The  Assembly and the Executive must send out a clear message that any degree of  drink-driving is unacceptable.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Although I do not wish to deny anyone the enjoyment of a  civilised drink, there are many who suggest strongly that people have the  responsibility to ensure that they have a designated driver in their company or  that they have ordered taxis. Mention was made earlier of pub owners leaving  customers home. Anything that can help to reduce the number of people who are  drinking and driving is to be welcomed. It is especially important that, in the  run-up to Christmas, the Department and the Minister get that message out and  reinforce it. I support the motion.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  I commend Alastair Ross and Peter Weir for securing the debate, because it  draws attention to an important issue. It is to be hoped that the debate will  help to strengthen the message that drinking and driving do not mix, that  alcohol impairs judgement and that it is dangerous for anyone with alcohol in  their system to get behind the wheel of a car.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The greatest cause of accidents is speed, or a combination  of speed and alcohol consumption. The most accident-prone group of people on the  roads is, as we all know, young men aged between 17 and 25 years. It was  recently estimated that at least 6% of all road casualties occurred when  someone was driving while over the legal alcohol limit. In helping to  strengthen the message about drink-driving, we must all realise that the road  safety campaigns are important, and at this time of the year, it is important  that they are presented strongly.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">However, despite that and all of the other supporting  messages about the dangers, it is still clear that a small number of people are  not getting the message about road safety.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Drink-driving is a factor in accidents, and a move to lower  the limit would send out a clear message about its dangers. In a recent  Automobile Association study, two thirds of those questioned backed a reduction  in the current limit from 80 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood to 50 mg per 100  ml. The vast majority of people do not drink and drive, and, in supporting such  a reduction, the SDLP is not seeking to target people who consume a small  amount of alcohol and who are responsible for their actions. We support the  reduction in order to make the message on drink-driving clearer and to make the  law clearer for all drivers.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">John McCallister highlighted some good reasons why a limit  of zero would not work. It is often argued that a zero-tolerance approach of not  allowing any alcohol is the only way of dealing with the problem of  drink-driving. As Mr McCallister said, people on medication would encounter  problems if they were breathalysed. Reducing the limit to zero would not be  straightforward, and that is backed up by the BMA, which also doubts whether a  limit of zero would be acceptable to the public. The BMA argues that a  reduction from 80 mg to 50 mg would be helpful and beneficial.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP supports an all-Ireland approach to a range of  road safety issues, including the curbing of drink-driving. We want more work  to be done on that and, if possible, we want a decision to be taken together so  that both Governments are seen to be working in tandem on the issue. Apart from  the Republic of Ireland  and the UK,  only two or three countries operate the present limit of 80 mg.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member will draw his remarks to a close.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  I stress the importance of getting the message out and of an all-Ireland  approach to road safety.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  In 2007-08, there were 6,321 road traffic collisions that led to injuries, from  which there were 9,748 casualties. Of those, 110 people were killed and over  1,000 people were seriously injured, which was an increase from the previous  year. The leading cause of accidents was inattention. Some might ask what that  has to do with this debate &mdash; I will try to explain.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Scientific study has found that taking a single drink can  impair attention levels and reaction times. Therefore, having only one drink of  alcohol, which would leave a person well below the legal limit, will lessen  attention levels. That is a major factor in road traffic accidents. It is clear  that road safety must be improved, and the way to do that is to reduce the  level of alcohol with which one is permitted to drive.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">A wus scunnered aa the nummer o&rsquo; fowk at wur tuk ap las&rsquo;  yeir fer drunk-drivin&rsquo; &mdash; 3,546. Thon bes mair waefu when we realise efter  yairnin wi&rsquo; polis representatives at fer ivry driver cleekit they alloo at  thair ir a clatter mair oan the road aa the saime tim&rsquo; at irnae cleekit. A wus  gunked forebye tae fin&rsquo; at mae ain airt bes secon&rsquo; onie tae D an E polis  districts an this tae me isnae acceptable. The fact at in the fatalities oan  oor roads hit wus foun&rsquo; at 34% o&rsquo; deid drivers hed alcohol in thair systems an  at 14 ir allooed tae hae dee&rsquo;d directly fae bein&rsquo; unner the influence o&rsquo; drugs  an alcohol bes scairsum.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I was shocked by the number of people who were convicted  for drink-driving last year &mdash; 3,546. That figure is even more shocking when one  considers that for every drink-driver caught, the PSNI believes that there are  many more who escape conviction. I was also shocked to discover that the number  of drink-drivers caught in my area is second only to the numbers that are  caught in policing districts D and E. That is unacceptable. Even scarier is the  fact that, of the fatalities on our roads, 34% of dead drivers had alcohol in  their system, and 14% had drugs and alcohol in their system.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Research has shown that drivers experience a natural dip in  alertness in the afternoon. Therefore, if they were to drink even a small  amount of alcohol during that time, their alertness would deteriorate further.  That small reduction in alertness, combined with alcohol-impaired drowsiness,  can lead to tragic and fatal consequences. In fact, that is a factor in more  than 20% of motorway accidents on the mainland. However, I do not want to  labour that fact, because the figures are very clear.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Given that my sons have completed the new driving test, I  have a better idea of hazard perception. When I taught my sons to drive, I was  aware of hazards such as a child playing in the street or a dog barking. Those  things are everyday occurrences that can changes lives in a matter of seconds.  If a driver drinks what equates to half the legal limit, he or she would be  less aware of a child stepping out in front of the car. That made me think  twice about what the limit should be. I want to focus on that issue today.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In 2007, the Department of the Environment carried out a  survey in which respondents were asked whether they thought that it is was  acceptable to drive after having one drink. A total of 63% said that that was  not acceptable. In the same survey, respondents were asked whether they thought  it was acceptable to drive after having two drinks. A total of 76% said that  that was unacceptable. Clearly, as the figures suggest, it is not acceptable.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Some people believe that it is never right to drink and  drive, which Members have reiterated. Tommy Gallagher mentioned that most people  never drink and drive. Many Members know people who have been injured or killed  on the roads as a result of an accident in which alcohol was a factor. It is a  well-known and accepted fact that the two do not mix favourably.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Another reason that we need to reduce the drink-driving  limit is because of the morning-after belief that it is safe to drive, about  which other Members spoke. Many people do not realise that they might be over  the limit after a rough or long night. Many people believe that, because they  took a taxi home the previous night, they are fit to drive in the morning.  Young drivers who are under the influence are especially vulnerable to being  involved in a crash. The Assembly must send out the right signal about alcohol  and drinking any amount.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">At present, we have the highest drink-driving limit in Europe. Indeed, no country in the world permits a higher  blood:alcohol ratio than here. We must follow the example set by the rest of Europe and reduce the limit: it is that simple, and it  will save lives. I know that the Minister will introduce a rigorous campaign  coming up to the Christmas season. The Assembly should back that to the hilt by  sending out a message to the public today that drink-driving will not, and  cannot, be accepted. Never, ever drink and drive.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">5.15 pm</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment (Mr S Wilson)</strong>: I welcome this very useful debate, and I  congratulate Alastair Ross for tabling the motion. However, the research  materials that he mentioned during his speech caused a glimmer of worry to  cross my mind. &lsquo;The Irish News&rsquo; was bad enough, but when he spoke about the  &lsquo;Sunday Sport&rsquo;, I began to get very worried. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I suppose I had better.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: For  clarification, the research material was actually from the &lsquo;Sunday Sun&rsquo;, and I  am more than happy to provide that for any Member who doubts my credentials.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: It was commendable that Mr Ross picked out an article on  drink-driving from the &lsquo;Sunday Sport&rsquo;.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: He recovered that very well, before the Whip got to him. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The other thing that worried me was the level of knowledge  that some Members had about the after-effects of drinking and the impact that  that might have on their driving the next morning.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The debate is welcome for two reasons. First, we are  approaching the season when, maybe after a Christmas party or a drink at work,  people are more tempted than at other times to drive. Secondly, it comes at a  time when we are focusing on the success that the Assembly has had, across all  Departments, in trying to reduce carnage on the roads. The fact that we have  achieved, ahead of time, the targets for reducing the number of people killed  or seriously injured on the roads in Northern Ireland is a comment on the way  in which Departments have worked together in order to improve people&rsquo;s quality  of life by making the roads safer, and by ensuring that we do not have the  fatalities and associated tragedies visited on homes across Northern Ireland.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Nevertheless, there are still too many accidents that could  have been prevented had people not been careless or taken alcohol before  driving. A number of Members gave statistics: 20% of road deaths caused by  drivers having alcohol in their system, and 10 % of serious injuries caused for  the same reason. That represents 127 lives lost over the past five years. One  thinks of all the human tragedies behind that figure.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The first funeral of a friend that I attended as a teenager  was a young man who, when leaving Bangor one night, was driven through the wall  of Clandeboye estate by a drunk driver who was not even aware after he had hit  him that he had killed anyone. He got out of his car, and was found staggering  down the road unaware of what he had done. The tragedy that visited that family  has been multiplied time and time again. This is a serious issue that the  Assembly needs to address.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Despite what people know, the statistics show that last  year 6,619 people were stopped by the police and found to have been driving  while under the influence of alcohol. Of those, 3,546 were prosecuted, and more  than 3,300 lost their licences as a result. We want to send the message that we  take this issue seriously, and if people persist in breaking the law in this  way, they will find that all the attendant inconvenience, and worse, will be  visited on them.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Alastair Ross was right to raise the issue of public  support. The public do support more stringent action being taken. Sixty-five  per cent of respondents to the road safety monitor said that people should not  drink at all if driving, and 85% supported strict action by the police through  random breath-testing. I will talk about penalties and police actions later.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Ross also stated that some people may say that reducing  the drink-drive limit will criminalise those who might be innocent. That is a  reasonable argument if people do not know what the law requires of them. However,  if we decide that the limit should be lowered, and if the law is clear, then  someone who gets behind the wheel of a car with alcohol in their system cannot  claim to be innocent.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Clarity is the important issue. That is one reason that the  Department has rejected the idea of zero tolerance, because people could exceed  the limit and break the law innocently by taking medication or simply cleaning  their teeth. The Department will not opt for a zero limit because it wants to  ensure that the people who are caught and prosecuted have knowingly broken the  law. That means that the limit must be set at a level that does not catch  people who, inadvertently, have some alcohol in their system.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I want to deal with the question of consultation, and I  noted the remarks of the Chairperson of the Environment Committee on that  matter. I look forward to the Environment Committee&rsquo;s response to the  Department&rsquo;s consultation paper and on its support on those matters that I want  to bring into the public domain.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Chairman also raised the issue of a separate  drink-driving limit for younger people and professional drivers. There should  be a 20 mg level for younger people because they are less able to deal with the  impairment that alcohol causes to driving. Sometimes, their lack of experience  can lead them into trouble. There is, therefore, a rationale for having a lower  limit for younger drivers.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Several Members mentioned the promise that had been made by  my predecessor to bring the matter forward and questioned why it has taken so  long. However, no Member raised the issue of penalties, although the two  matters are related. If the limit is lowered, the implications for penalties  must be examined. The delay has been caused by the difficulty in getting a  clear picture about penalties across Europe  and in countries where a lower limit is in place. Northern Ireland has one of the  highest limits, but it also has some of the toughest penalties. Consideration  must be given to whether those tougher penalties should be maintained if the  limit is lowered. The necessary research on penalties has led to the delay.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I hope to introduce a consultation period before the end of  2008. Of course, that will depend partly on how the party opposite behaves. At  present, a range of matters is piled up for the Executive&rsquo;s consideration.  Although Sinn F&eacute;in complains about lack of action, it is responsible for the  fact that action cannot be taken on those matters because they cannot be approved  by the Executive for public consultation. I hope that Sinn F&eacute;in will start to  behave and that I will be able to make progress on departmental initiatives on  planning reform, the review of public administration, PPS 14, consultation on  the drink-driving limit, and a list of other matters.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">If consultation is allowed to progress, the Department  hopes that it will be finished by April or May 2009. Depending on statutory  changes that must be made, decisions on the way forward and subsequent action  should be taken within 12 to 18 months. Of course, that will depend on how the  Department decides to progress. The simplest way is to reduce the limit to 50  mg and to maintain current penalties.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">A decision to opt for two limits and differing penalties  would require more legislative change and delay the process of implementation.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">During the debate, the question of whether I would support  the use of morning-after test kits was raised. Rather than self-testing, I  prefer that people who are in any doubt simply heed the message that the  Assembly is seeking to get across: if unsure about being above the limit, do  not get behind the wheel of a car.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">One reason for considering a reduction in the limit is to  send out a message that it is simply not acceptable for those who have consumed  alcohol to drive &mdash; even if the drink was taken a considerable time before  driving. Anyone who thinks that they are still feeling the effects of alcohol  should not get behind the wheel of a car. As Members stated, alcohol affects  reaction times, and any individual who has had a drink is more likely to be  involved in a collision or another type of accident.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Boylan talked about education, and I agree with him that  that is important. One of the roles of my Department is to try to take the road  safety message to a wide range of people. Two of my Department&rsquo;s main  objectives have been to raise the awareness of the impact of alcohol and to  encourage people not to drink and drive.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">A reduction in the limit must be complemented by other  measures; not only a reconsideration of whether to introduce graduated  penalties. Should lowering the limit be accompanied by graduated penalties? No  country in Europe with a 50 mg limit imposes the mandatory 12-month ban that  exists in Northern Ireland.  Therefore, the issue of graduated penalties must be examined, along with the  question of whether police should be given additional powers to carry out  random breath tests.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The one message that I hope Members and the public will  take away from today&rsquo;s debate is that I as Minister, my Department, and all  parties in the Assembly take this issue extremely seriously. One way in which  the Assembly can improve the quality of life in Northern Ireland is by increasing  road safety, thereby reducing the number of people who are killed or seriously  injured.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I intend to act as quickly as I possibly can. Before the  end of the year, I hope to publish a paper, and I will take note of the results  of the subsequent consultation process. Although I do not wish to prejudge the  outcome, I have made it clear that my preference is to reduce the general limit  to 50 mg and the limit for novice and professional drivers to 20 mg.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">To ensure that the public are clear that the Assembly  intends to take this matter extremely seriously, I want the penalties to be  revised and police powers increased. I trust that I will have the support of  Members and the Committee, and that progress can be made as quickly as the  legislative process allows.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  am happy to conclude an appropriately sober debate on this subject. Members  from every party were unified in their approach, and speeches were consistent,  without being repetitive. I am heartened that the Assembly speaks with one  voice on this issue.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Tommy Gallagher and Jim Shannon were two of several Members  who said that the examination of the drink-driving limit is part of a wider  process of ensuring road safety.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Alastair Ross and others said that a level of cultural  change in the attitude to drink-driving should be acknowledged. However, their  reasoned argument is that there is much further to go, and perhaps cultural  change has not come quickly enough.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Over the past 20 or 30 years, the social unacceptability of  drink-driving has, undoubtedly, become increasingly clear. Education and  advertising were mentioned. Statistics indicate a high level of public  awareness of the deliberately graphic advertising campaigns that attempt to  emphasise the effects of drink-driving. Members can quote a multitude of  drink-driving statistics, but there is a human story behind every death and  every injury that results from a person&rsquo;s drink-driving. Each story is one too  many.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">5.30 pm</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The proposer of the motion said, as did Mr Beggs, among  others, that drink-driving affects people regardless of weight, age or sex.  Indeed, binge drinking has increased among women. A small amount of alcohol can  have a major impact on the system. I will not reiterate the statistics outlined  during the debate. However, if Members wish to investigate the subject further,  advertising campaigns, such as the Not a Drop campaign, reveal that low alcohol  consumption can have a major impact on people&rsquo;s perception and alertness.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Patsy McGlone highlighted the need for education and  emphasised that, even though advertising campaigns have been somewhat  effective, we cannot become complacent. All Members support sending out a  consistent message that one should never drink and drive. Mr McGlone called for  Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland to reduce the limit on the legal  level of alcohol in blood. I strongly support reduced levels in any  jurisdiction. Furthermore, he mentioned, and it is an important point, that the  Assembly must consider introducing a secondary, much lower blood-alcohol limit  for the most vulnerable groups, such as motorcyclists, LGV drivers and  inexperienced or novice drivers.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">To avoid any criticism, I should point out that Mr Ross  indicated that the proposals apply to inexperienced and novice drivers rather  than to young drivers. I assume that he does not want to be inundated with  emails again. Inexperienced drivers are vulnerable, and, therefore, a lower  blood-alcohol level is appropriate. Indeed, I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s remarks  that he will seriously consider that possibility.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Cathal Boylan highlighted the fact that, although it lies  second behind excess speed in the league table of causes of death and injury,  drink-driving is, nevertheless, a vital issue. He outlined the European  examples. As the proposer of the motion and others indicated, there is,  probably, a broad consensus that 50 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood is the  most appropriate level. Other major European countries, such as Spain, France,  Germany, Italy, Holland and Iceland &mdash; a country whose inhabitants have more  reason to drink of late &mdash; have a 50 mg limit. Being out of step with Europe has been detrimental to our citizens.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Roy Beggs, among others, highlighted the BMA&rsquo;s statistics.  Although the BMA recognises the need to reduce blood-alcohol limits in drivers,  a zero limit &mdash; no matter how attractive it appears &mdash; is not a practical  solution. Everyone has alcohol in their blood &mdash; even teetotallers. During the  debate, I wondered whether alcoholics would be battering down chemists&rsquo; doors  to obtain mouthwash, because that product&rsquo;s alcoholic effect was advertised  during the debate.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We must make proposals that are sensible, and the  blood-alcohol levels that have been discussed are sensible.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Kieran McCarthy highlighted the support of ACPO and the BMA  for a reduction in the limit, and he emphasised the direct human cost of  drink-driving. He also pointed out that this is part of a bigger picture. In  tackling the issue, we have also to consider the way in which society views  alcohol misuse. In many ways, this debate is an extension of the one that took  place earlier today.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Ian McCrea emphasised the severity of the problem and used  statistics to show that those at the drink-driving limit are 10 times more  likely to have an accident than those with lower blood-alcohol levels. Daith&iacute;  McKay drew attention to the problem of morning-after blood-alcohol levels. Even  responsible people do not always think that through; if one drinks in the  evening, the alcohol will still have an effect the following morning. He also  stressed the need for a proactive approach to be adopted by various agencies  and the private sector. Where there are proactive schemes, we should seek to  identify best practice.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">George Robinson stressed the timeliness of the debate, as  Christmas is approaching, and he stressed that this is about protecting both  individual drivers and others. Victims of drink-driving can be either those  behind the steering wheel, passengers or &mdash; as was illustrated movingly by the  Minister &mdash; bystanders caught up in an accident.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The need for proactive measures, and for a cultural  rejection of drink-driving, was stressed by John McCallister. Tommy Gallagher  pointed out that, despite the advertising, a section of the community is not  getting the message. We must target those irresponsible elements.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">From his perspective as a father, Jim Shannon emphasised  the difficulties faced by inexperienced drivers and the need to keep the roads  safe. The link between drink-driving and other issues is alertness.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister demonstrated the need for a joined-up approach.  The seriousness of this offence must be reflected in legal penalties.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the debate. In particular, I welcome the  Minister&rsquo;s response and his intention to take action if he can get the support  of the Executive and proceed to early consultation. On this issue, the House  speaks with a unified voice. If we can help to bring about a lowering of the  drink-driving limit, it will be seen as a real, positive benefit for the people  of Northern Ireland,  brought about by devolution. People will be walking around in five or 10 years&rsquo;  time who would otherwise be statistics on a tombstone. I urge the House to  support the motion.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
        <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly calls on the Minister of the Environment  to investigate the viability of reducing the current drink-driving limit.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Motion made:</p>
        <p class="Q3Motion">That the Assembly do now adjourn. &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Mr  Deputy Speaker]</span></p>
        <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="6"></a>Adjournment</p>
        <p class="H5StageHeading">Ambulance Provision in North   Antrim</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I remind Members that the proposer of the topic will have 15  minutes in which to speak; all other Members will have approximately seven  minutes.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ian Paisley  Jnr</strong>: I thank the Business Office for scheduling this important matter for  my constituency. I appreciate that. I also thank the Health Minister for  gracing the Chamber with his presence, and I look forward to his response  towards the conclusion of the debate.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I pay tribute to the men and women of the Northern Ireland  Ambulance Service (NIAS). Like most people in this country, I believe that they  do an absolutely smashing job, by helping people in immediate crisis and  danger. It is important that Members put on record their 100% support for the  unstinting work of the men and women of the Ambulance Service, and that we condemn  people who take it upon themselves to attack ambulance workers. It is important  that Members highlight such activities as callous and irresponsible.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">This debate, however, is about my genuine concerns  regarding the impact of the Minister&rsquo;s efficiency savings on the delivery of  front-line services in my North Antrim  constituency.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In common with many rural areas, my constituency gets a raw  deal. Patients will suffer, and Ballymena, in particular, will take the lion&rsquo;s  share of the impact that the efficiency savings will have on accident and  emergency ambulance cover. If the Minister&rsquo;s efficiency savings are followed  through and delivered in the way in which the Northern Ireland Ambulance  Service stated, 75% of the cut will come from rural cover, not from urban  cover. That is critical for not only my constituency &mdash; which is a large, rural  hinterland &mdash; but for other constituencies such as East Antrim, East Londonderry  and South Antrim. It will have a detrimental  impact on people who live in large rural areas.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">That occurs at a time when ambulance cover is becoming increasingly  strategically significant for the delivery of front-line health services. As  hospitals constrict and consolidate, the Ambulance Service is becoming a much  more strategically important tool. On that basis, the current Northern Ireland  Ambulance Service plans, as they affect my own constituency in particular, will  have an extremely detrimental impact.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Northern Health and Social Care Trust &mdash; which covers  Ballymena and the glens of Antrim &mdash; has the same level of ambulance cover as it  did when the Antrim Area Hospital opened almost 20 years ago. I was surprised  when I saw those statistics, because most people would have believed that  ambulance cover would have increased during that time, but it has not. For  almost 20 years, the Ambulance Service in my constituency has, effectively,  stood still. There has been no significant increase in ambulance cover, and the  trust is now asked to make an efficiency saving that will, in effect, reduce by  a third the number of ambulances that operate in the constituency.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">There has been no attempt to deny that claim, because it is  correct. An article in the &lsquo;News Letter&rsquo; on 30 July 2008 made that claim, and  it was discussed on &lsquo;The Stephen Nolan Show&rsquo; shortly thereafter. I wrote to the  Minister on 4 August 2008, highlighting my concerns that the daily ambulance  cover that operates from Ballymena will be cut by up to one third. The Minister  kindly responded on 5 September 2008, but he did not address that point. He  said that the significant investment that he announced in early October 2008:</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;will enable the service to modernise and to respond  more quickly and appropriately to life-threatening calls&rdquo;.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">However, the issue that the ambulance workers and I raised  was the reduction of the number of ambulances, which is critical to them. There  was a debate in the Assembly on 7 October 2008, during which the point was made  that reducing by one third the number of accident and emergency ambulances  available to a large rural constituency had not been properly addressed.  Ballymena ambulance cover will be cut by a third, and the silence from the  Department about the impact on patients is deafening.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">From where will the efficiency savings come? The answer,  starkly for anyone in the Chamber and in the constituency, is from front-line services.  I say that with sadness, because we were told that the number of rapid-response  vehicles (RRVs) will increase, and the profile of ambulances will, therefore,  change. However, that profiling means that, in order to meet the Minister&rsquo;s  target, 69&middot;26% of the efficiency savings that must be made will come from the  re-profiling of the accident and emergency vehicles.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In other words, ambulance-response hours in the  constituency will be reduced by 17,520, but the RRV service will increase to  43,750 hours.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">That means that &pound;931,000 &mdash; or 75% or the Minister&rsquo;s target  &mdash; will come entirely from front-line delivery services. I am particularly  concerned for patients because ambulance provision is being targeted for that  saving.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">5.45 pm</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The administration side of the Ambulance Service has  offered up only &pound;20,000, or 1&middot;6% of the Minister&rsquo;s target. The training side of  the service has offered up &pound;35,000 of savings, or 2&middot;8% of the Minister&rsquo;s  target. That means that the lion&rsquo;s share of the efficiency saving &mdash; I am not going  to call it a cut because I believe that the Minister is right: it is an  efficiency saving that he must find &mdash; is coming from the front line. What  concerns me most is that the public will lose out on the aspect of the service  that they see and that they consider to be important.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Those statistics come from the Northern Ireland Ambulance  Service itself. It wrote to its members and said that those statistics, which  briefly summarise the NIAS efficiency saving proposals:</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;must be seen for what they really are, a complete  sham.&rdquo;</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Those are its words; not mine. The letter goes on  to say:</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;When studying how NIAS are proposing to achieve the  Minister&rsquo;s efficiency savings, they have made it glaringly obvious that they  had no intention of actually making savings where they would have minimal  effect on the emergency/patient care side of the service. Instead, NIAS have  actually used the Minister&rsquo;s efficiency savings to force in their own agenda,  the phased introduction of single-manned RRVs, under the guise of achieving the  efficiency savings.&rdquo;</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">That gets to the heart of the matter. It must be questioned  whether a rapid-response vehicle is an adequate response to an emergency  situation, if ultimately an ambulance should arrive at the scene. The public  fear that the current policy is not meeting that challenge.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">When we consider where the efficiency savings will have the  greatest impact, we must remember that the Ambulance Service in Ballymena must  cover a large rural area that includes the glens of Antrim. Although the glens  of Antrim are very beautiful at most times of the year &mdash; during the spring,  summer and autumn &mdash; they are also very remote.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">That area is more remote during the winter and many places  become almost inaccessible; therefore, many people living in that area become  isolated and are cut off from services. To tell those people &mdash; my constituents  &mdash; that we are going to reduce the number of ambulances and emergency vehicles  that are operating in that area by one third is entirely wrong. That decision  will have a devastating impact on that rural constituency.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Ambulance Service workers wrote to the Minister, and it is  important that I put on record some of the points that they made to him, which  they have also raised with me. They indicated:</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The proposal for the Northern Health Board Area is to  remove one 999 ambulance from 9-5, Monday to Friday in Ballymena, leaving just  2 vehicles, a one third cut amounting to 40 hours per week. This is the entire  saving for that whole area.&rdquo;</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">They go on to say:</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;NIAS management &lsquo;claim&rsquo; this will be offset by a new  single manned rapid response vehicle (RRV) which they will provide, however,  this vehicle is already in place (callsign Romeo 18) so this is a false claim  designed to mislead the public.&rdquo;</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Again, those are their words; not mine.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The letter goes on to claim:</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;It is expected that NIAS management will seek to spin  the RRV as some sort of improvement, and this needs to be attacked head on by  highlighting the shortcomings of this option.&rdquo;</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In their letter, the ambulance staff then set out the  actual shortcomings, first explaining:</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The existing ambulance with a 2 crew, a Paramedic and  a Technician, can respond to any 999 call, administer various treatments on  scene and if necessary immediately transport the patient to hospital.&rdquo;</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Ambulance-treatment options include:</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Full 2 person Advanced Life Support (ALS) to a  cardiac arrest, including CPR, Defibrillation and Drug Therapy, with Airway  Protection.</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">Safe 2 person checking of all injected drugs before  administration, including pain relief.&rdquo;</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That is a standard that I know that the Health Service  wishes to maintain. In addition, there should be:</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Enough oxygen to provide multiple casualties at once.</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">Immediate transport for head injuries, strokes,  internal injuries, etc which can only be treated in hospital.&rdquo;</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The letter goes on to state that a rapid-response vehicle  with a lone paramedic can:</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Stop the 8 minute clock to falsely claim to meet  government targets.&rdquo;</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">We are getting to the real point; instead of recognising  constituents&rsquo; needs, the Ambulance Service is attempting to stop the clock in  order to meet targets.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, a rapid-response vehicle with a lone paramedic  can:</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Provide one person CPR only in a cardiac arrest.&rdquo;</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Anyone who knows anything about CPR knows that  two-person CPR is much more effective and quicker than one-person CPR.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, such a vehicle can:</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Provide basic pain relief and a maximum of 1 hours  oxygen.</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">Provide &ldquo;first aid&rdquo; treatment of any injury which  needs hospital admission.&rdquo;</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">However, importantly, an RRV cannot:</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Transport anyone to hospital.</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">Provide injected drugs safely, no second person to  check dosage!</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">Do CPR, Defibrillation &amp; airway protection safely,  as each requires stopping the others by the lone operator, thus providing sub  standard care!&rdquo;</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">NIAS management will also claim that an ambulance will  be dispatched immediately to back up the RRV&rdquo;.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">How can it, given that ambulance provision will  have been cut already by one third?</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Those points summarise ambulance workers&rsquo; concerns.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Although people on the front line will be expected to  deliver the service, at the back of their minds, they will know that it will  not be as efficient, or as proactive, as it ought to be and as it would be if a  full ambulance service were available.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The proposed rapid-response-vehicle scheme was tried and  tested in Wales.  However, having experienced the downside of delivering the service to remote  rural areas in the Welsh valleys, the ambulance service there accepted that  that level of provision did not meet the needs of people in those areas. It is  therefore now reverting to delivering a full ambulance service.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I appeal to the Minister to consider the policy afresh. I  recognise that he must make efficiency savings that will, of course, be  painful. Nevertheless, much more could be done by management instead of on the  front line. Further efficiencies could be identified in areas that are capable  of withstanding cuts.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Although the cuts that I described have been requested for  Ballymena and North Antrim, parts of Belfast,  for which considerably more ambulances are available, are being asked to make &mdash;  proportionately &mdash; substantially smaller cuts. For example, more ambulances will  serve Ardoyne than North Antrim. It is  preposterous that a large rural area, which suffers from the problems that I  outlined, will have fewer ambulances than an urban area such as Ardoyne. I am  not saying that Ardoyne is not entitled to those ambulances &mdash; it is, and  patients there have every right to expect such provision. However, to say that  people who live in rural parts of Ulster are entitled to a lesser  service is preposterous, and asking people in my constituency to accept the  lion&rsquo;s share of cuts is wrong.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McKay</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Member on the opposite  Benches for raising this matter. He made several good points, and I will  attempt not to repeat them.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">North Antrim is an extremely rural constituency, and the  comparison with Wales,  which is also a large rural area, is worthwhile. If the ambulance service in Wales has  already undergone such an experience, we should not repeat its mistakes.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Ambulance Service workers in North Antrim and the people  there &mdash; particularly those who live in the glens of Antrim, which have  traditionally suffered from a lack of, among other things, health provision &mdash;  have told me of their concerns about Ambulance Service provision. It would be a  great shame if that neglect were to continue under this Minister.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">North Antrim is served by  10 accident and emergency vehicles: three in Ballycastle; four in Ballymena;  and three in Ballymoney. All those vehicles have more than 100,000 miles on the  clock, and eight of them have travelled more than 150,000 miles. It is  important that we concentrate on those ambulances and ensure that they are  replaced and upgraded, where necessary, rather than replaced with  rapid-response vehicles.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">There are many rumours in the constituency, and I hope that  the Minister will provide clarity on his proposals. I hope that he will  consider the opinion of all the elected representatives of North   Antrim &mdash; as well as the public &mdash; and, primarily, those who work on  the front line in the constituency. Rapid-response vehicles are useful,  sometimes, in urban areas, but they will not make a huge impact in rural areas,  such as the glens, which are already alienated. Several people have come to my  office to complain about the Ambulance Service, particularly about the response  times of some ambulances. I know of numerous examples in which it has taken an  ambulance up to one hour to arrive at the scene of an incident. It is lucky  that none of those cases resulted in a loss of life, but that could happen in  the future &mdash; in fact, that is more likely if cuts are made.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The usefulness of the rapid-response vehicles must be  explored further, especially since they will be restricted in the medicines and  medical equipment that they will be allowed to carry. In some instances, as Mr  Paisley Jnr said, the rapid-response vehicle will have to wait for the arrival  of an emergency ambulance on the scene before drugs can be administered or the  patient can be transferred to hospital.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">There is a great deal of concern, particularly in the north  of the constituency, about the knock-on effects that the restructuring and  withdrawal of accident and emergency vehicles will have. There are rumours &mdash;  and I emphasise &ldquo;rumours&rdquo; &mdash; in the constituency among people who work on the  front line. They believe that the existing resources in the area will be  overstretched to other areas, such as Coleraine, when the cuts are made. It is  important that the Minister address those concerns and questions, many of which  remain outstanding.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Ultimately, one must look at the human effect that the  decisions will have on our communities. North Antrim  is one of the largest constituencies in the North, and many parts of it are  sparsely populated. The concerns of the constituents, and the constituency&rsquo;s  circumstances, must be considered when decisions on the Ambulance Service are  being made. One cannot compare North Antrim  with other constituencies; one must consider its situation and its communities  that live a considerable distance from the centre of service activity. Those  concerns must be taken into account before the Minister makes any final  decisions. He has to listen to the representatives from the area, its people,  and, above all, those who work on the front line.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr Robert  Coulter</strong>: I thank Mr Paisley Jnr for tabling the topic for the Adjournment  debate, because there is a great deal of concern in the constituency about what  is going on. Gossip has been circulating about the reduction of ambulance  cover, particularly in the Ballymena area. It is wise that we take a look at  it.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Putting the patient first must be at the heart of  everything that is done in the Health Service, and ambulance cover is no  exception. The proposals for changes in the pattern of ambulance provision in North Antrim are out for public consultation; perhaps  that is why gossip has raised concerns in the minds of so many people. It is  vital that proper, well-argued and prompt responses to the consultation are  made by everyone.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">6.00 pm</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I concur with what has been said about the rural area of North Antrim. However, North Antrim  cannot be compared with other places because it has wide rural areas and many  centres of industry. A major accident would place a heavy demand on the  Ambulance Service.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">For some time, there has been concern in the constituency  that ambulances are sitting in Ballymena in the evenings with no crews to work  them. If an accident involving multiple casualties were to happen late in the  evening, ambulances would have to be drawn from the surrounding towns, leaving  those areas exposed as no ambulance cover would be available. The proposal to  put an additional accident and emergency ambulance into Ballymoney, Coleraine  and the glens of Antrim would alleviate the problem and concerns in many ways.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The shift rotas are changing from Friday 21 November, and  the service for North Antrim will be reduced  by one ambulance, which will adversely affect the 9.00 am to 5.00 pm cover. How  can one situation be balanced against the other? In a hugely populated area,  ambulances are being taken away; in rural areas they are being introduced. How  will that sort of system get assistance to patients as quickly and as  effectively as possible? I know that the idea is to have three rapid-response  vehicles in Ballymena. However, as Mr Paisley has pointed out, patients cannot  be brought to hospital in an RRV. Are ambulances being replaced by RRVs as a  money-saving exercise? If that is the case, putting patients first has gone out  the window. When considering ambulance cover in Ballymena, patients must come  first.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I congratulate Ambulance Service personnel in the North Antrim area for the way in which they have coped  with many difficult situations. I congratulate them for their dedication, their  expertise, and the way in which they have, on many occasions, saved lives.  However, in an area where there have been so many fatal accidents, my real  concern is about what will happen when there is an accident in which many  people need to be taken to hospital, and when only one patient at a time can be  taken in our modern ambulance.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I can also see the dilemma faced by the Minister and the  Department. If someone can provide a more convincing answer, he or she should  come forward with concrete proposals. Those who criticise the proposed changes  must come up with something other than a cheap line that is easy to trot out  but, ultimately, means nothing. Debate must be intelligent and informed and,  above all, practical and realistic &mdash; especially in these financially stringent  times. I say: put the patient first; not the need to save money.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  congratulate Ian Paisley Jnr for securing the Adjournment debate on what is a  very important issue. However, I will not go the whole way, by any means, in  supporting the manner in which he presents his concerns.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">As has been said, this discussion occurs in the context of  efficiency savings. Like all other parties in the Assembly, I support the  achievement of greater efficiencies so that areas where improvements can be  made can be identified, the existing service can be costed, and better outcomes  can be achieved through transferring money within the service.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We all ought to support such efforts. Properly managed,  efficiencies are not cuts. That is not to say that, in certain instances, they  are not properly managed; in certain situations, across Government as a whole,  they are not. Sometimes when efficiency savings are not made properly, they are  cuts. However, I see no evidence of that in this case.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I will quote some figures, which might be somewhat  different to the ones that Mr Paisley quoted. Mine are from a letter, dated 28 August,  from the chief executive of the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service, Mr McIvor,  to Ballymena Borough Council. It states that in the northern division, it is  proposed &mdash; and Rev Robert Coulter is quite right that a public consultation on  the matter is about to begin &mdash; that there will be a reduction of 2,659 hours  per year of accident and emergency ambulance cover, which is conventional  ambulance cover. However, there is to be an increase of 11,263 hours of  paramedic RRV cover. Thus, for every hour reduced of conventional ambulance  cover, more than three hours of RRV cover is put in place.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In Ballymena, according to one document, that means that  there is a reduction of 40 hours of accident and emergency ambulance cover per  week, but considerably more RRV cover in its place. Mr McIvor, the chief  executive of the Ambulance Service, does not discuss that matter in terms of  hours, but he says that one 12-hour shift of accident and emergency cover is  replaced by three longer shifts of RRV cover. We can immediately see where the  savings will be made. Operating one-person crews instead of two-person crews  will automatically generate a considerable saving. We are told that those are  paramedic crews and that not all accident and emergency ambulances are  paramedic-covered, although most are. We are also told that RRV vehicles, as  their name would suggest, can get to the scene more rapidly than a conventional  ambulance.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In my opinion, managers must be given substantial  independence of action. It is not wise if they are repeatedly second-guessed by  the political system without very good reason. The political system has a role,  of course, but it is not to second-guess operational decisions without, as I  said, very good reason. I am concerned about a developing political culture in  that regard. I worry greatly that if that continues, we will deter good  managers from taking up posts and make managers who are in post over-cautious  in their decision-making. That should be seriously considered in the political  system.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We are talking about professional ambulance staff and  managers. If they tell us that an RRV response is appropriate in many cases,  then we should listen to them and take them seriously. Again, I refer to Mr  McIvor&rsquo;s letter, the last paragraph of which states that paramedic RRVs are in  common use throughout the United    Kingdom and provide early patient care,  improved clinical effectiveness and, therefore, improved patient outcomes. When  considering the issue, I must ask whether those people are competent or not. If  I have no reason to suggest that they are not competent, and if competent  appointed managers tell me that a proposed change in service will lead to  improved clinical effectiveness and patient outcomes, I take them seriously.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Paisley Jnr</strong>:  The Member is absolutely right that managers should be given their place, but  does he accept that they should also be accountable for their actions? The  people have determined that they are accountable to us as Assembly Members. We  are entitled to hold managers to account, and they should be rigorously tested  on the facts and figures that the Member has produced.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  agree with the Member in that regard. Indeed, I was going to say that the  outcomes should be monitored. A decision has not yet been made on the best way  of providing service delivery. However, if the new service structure is deemed  to be the best method of service delivery, the implications of that decision  and the outcomes of the service must be closely scrutinised. If anyone feels  that they are receiving an inadequate service, elected representatives will  want to hear about it.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Members have rightly raised the important issue of service  provision to a large rural area in North Antrim,  which includes the glens of Antrim. That area has steep, winding roads and many  homes that are at considerable distances from ambulance centres. We need  reassurance that the Ambulance Service will be of the required standard in that  difficult-to-serve area.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the new service structure with an element of  caution. The new structure is subject to consultation, which may yield further  information that I will want to consider. I strongly welcome the capital  investment that will provide a large number of new vehicles. I recognise what  the Minister has done in that regard, and I thank him for that.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I support the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service in what it  is doing. I will listen to any new facts that may emerge during the  consultation process, and I await detailed monitoring of any new service that  is implemented.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr Ian  Paisley</strong>: It is good for everyone that decisions have not yet been made on  the matter, because it gives the Minister an opportunity to listen to the views  of the North Antrim representatives. He will  also consult with the people directly involved, and that will grant him a  further opportunity to assess the exact lie of the land.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We are approaching the winter. It would have been better if  we could have had the discussion before now, because people are very worried  about what could happen this winter. North Antrim  has a large urban population and a large rural population &mdash; both must be  considered. We must give the Minister every opportunity to recognise that it is  not a one-way street.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I appeal to the Minister to examine immediately the  proposed arrangements, especially in relation to rural areas. The rural  community needs to be assured that they will have an ambulance service and that  they will not be hung out to dry. No one in our country knows what a day may  bring forth. It only takes one major calamity for the Minister to be  accountable to the people. I ask him to assess those rural areas very carefully  and ensure that, in the event of a calamity, the proper equipment and service  can be supplied to the people who need it. I am sure that the Minister will take  that into consideration when he maps out the way forward.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">6.15 pm</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">To be frank, with any change there will be problems. There  is no perfect solution that will close the book and make everything right. Any  departure from the status quo requires a correct fit, and that does not happen  overnight, particularly where life-or-death calls are involved. Ambulances are  the lifeline for people who must get to hospital in order to have their lives  saved.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">This is a very serious matter, and I trust that the  Minister realises that no one in North Antrim  is criticising him. They are glad that there is time to consider ambulance  provision. They want him to look into the issue and to listen to what they have  to say. They hope that, despite financial limitations, a system will be set up  by working together.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">This is a hard time for everyone, and it will get harder. I  do not share the optimism of some people who believe that we are out of the  darkness. There is greater darkness to come before it gets light. Therefore, it  is a serious time, in which the Minister has his difficulties. If he had the  money he could give this to us, but he has not. He must do his best with the  money that he has. I am glad that there is a good representation from North Antrim in the Chamber to show the Minister that we  are here to help him with the problem of ambulance provision. He will be blamed  if he does not get the answer right. We want the Minister to know that North  Antrim Members are with him and that we will do our best to encourage him and  to get him the information that he needs. There is no use in approaching the  Minister in three months&rsquo; time and saying &ldquo;I told you so&rdquo;. Now is the time to  inform him.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I am sure that all of us in the Chamber are dedicated to  doing that. Finally, I trust that he will give urgent consideration to the  matter that I have raised &mdash; in the event of a local calamity the proposals will  leave the rural part of the constituency in great difficulty.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mr McGimpsey)</strong>: I thank Mr  Paisley Jnr for requesting this Adjournment debate. Although the issue of the  comprehensive spending review CSR and its impact on the Ambulance Service was  debated in this Chamber a few weeks ago, it is clear that the debate on the  issue continues to be a matter of concern for the public and their  representatives. People are naturally focused on what effect the proposed  changes will have in their local areas.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In relation to Ballymena and North   Antrim, Ballymena Borough Council and Moyle District Council have  written to me to express their concerns. I, therefore, welcome the opportunity  to reassure Members of my total commitment to providing a quality,  fit-for-purpose, twenty-first-century Ambulance Service for the people of Northern Ireland, including North   Antrim. I say, once again, that the level of ambulance provision  is absolutely not being reduced.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I will start by repeating some of the remarks that I made  in a previous debate. The men and women of the Ambulance Service deserve to  have modern equipment and vehicles and the technology that enables them to  deliver high-quality emergency care to the public. That is why I am investing  almost &pound;100 million of capital funding over the next 10 years in the Ambulance  Service. That includes &pound;17&middot;4 million over the CSR period.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Northern Ireland Ambulance Service intends to use that  funding to replace its fleet and equipment on a regular basis and modernise its  estate. Over the next three years, it will purchase 60 new accident and  emergency vehicles, 60 patient-care vehicles and 26 new rapid-response  vehicles. In the longer term, that will allow the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service  to move to a rolling programme of replacement so that no vehicle will be more  than five years old.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">New vehicles and equipment will be matched by new ways of  delivering emergency care to people who require that vital life-saving service.  That is where the CSR comes in. The efficiency savings that the Northern Ireland  Ambulance Service Trust, in common with all other health and social care  trusts, must deliver were agreed by the Northern Ireland Executive. The CSR is  not simply about saving money &mdash; it is about the targeted, sensible and  effective reinvestment of those savings in front-line services.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In common with many other health and social care  organisations, the Ambulance Service is experiencing an ever-increasing demand  for its services, which amounts to 10% more emergency calls each year.  Therefore, it is crucial that the Ambulance Service, along with other health  and social care organisations, should seek to improve the way that it delivers  its services. That means developing news ways of working to reflect modern best  practice and enhancing the skills of its workforce so that they can provide a  greater range of clinical interventions in emergency situations. For example,  the introduction of the new rapid-response ambulance vehicles with a single  paramedic allows the Ambulance Service to realise an improvement in service  delivery, which will benefit patients.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The use of the RRVs sees the introduction of a model of  service that has been applied elsewhere in the UK and has been proven to work.  They are widely and extensively used in England  and Scotland.  They were being rolled out in Wales,  but union opposition prevented the completion of that &mdash; rather than the  service, it was union opposition that prevented RRVs from being taken up in Wales.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In no way does use of RRVs compromise patient care; their  greater use in no way represents a less effective emergency service. Members may  be aware that the Ambulance Service has a target of responding to 70% of  category A &mdash; life-threatening &mdash; calls within eight minutes. When an emergency  call is made, an RRV and an ambulance are dispatched at the same time. Each RRV  has a paramedic in it, and each ambulance has a paramedic and an assistant. It  is the vital service and support that the paramedic provides that is key. Each  RRV is equipped with the same life-saving equipment as an ambulance and &mdash;  typically &mdash; will get to the scene of an injury more quickly. That allows the  paramedic to treat and stabilise the patient prior to the arrival of an  ambulance to transport the patient to hospital.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">An ambulance service is not a snatch-and-grab operation &mdash;  rushing out, grabbing the patient and putting him or her into the back of the  vehicle. It is about getting the appropriate medical care to the patient as quickly  as possible. The quickest way to get a paramedic to a patient is to use a  rapid-response vehicle, backed up by the ambulance. Recently, I saw that in Belfast when I was in an  RRV &mdash; I saw how the RRV responds first, followed by an ambulance a few minutes  later. I was extremely impressed by the whole system.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">RRVs are more efficient, because the paramedic can assess  whether an ambulance is required. Around 10% of emergency calls do not require  an ambulance. In those cases, the RRV can stand down the ambulance and allow it  to be directed to another call. The effectiveness of the provision of ambulance  services cannot be measured by the number of ambulances on the road &mdash; a more  meaningful measure is the number of hours of emergency cover that the service  provides.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">By the end of the CSR period, paramedic response capacity  will have been increased by 61,000 hours to more than 600,000 hours of cover.  The other side of the efficiency savings coin is investment in new  developments, and I have made available substantial additional funding over the  three years of the CSR period. Over that period, I have made available an  additional &pound;12 million of revenue funding, which will deliver not only the  additional hours of rapid-response cover but which will also support paramedic  thrombolysis and the introduction of 28 clinical team leaders who will deliver  24/7 clinical supervision.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In effect, the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service&rsquo;s  operating budget will increase by about 24% from &pound;46&middot;5 million last year to &pound;57  million in 2010-11. That represents a substantial investment in the Ambulance  Service&rsquo;s most important asset: the people who work for it. The dedication of  the men and women to saving lives is a credit not only to themselves but to the  service as a whole.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">It is, of course, a regional service. It combines urban  areas such as Ballymena and Coleraine with rural areas such as the glens of  Antrim, both of which present challenges to the service in ensuring acceptable  response times. The Ambulance Service delivers regionally, according to area.  For example, Ballymena and the glens are part of the northern area, which has  36 accident-and-emergency ambulances, and it is proposed that it will have 35  by the end of the CSR period. However, the number of rapid-response vehicles  will rise from two to five. Coleraine has five accident and emergency  ambulances and one rapid-response vehicle; Ballymena has four accident and emergency  ambulances and one rapid-response vehicle.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Bob Coulter said that ambulances are not being manned. We  do not man all the ambulances all the time; we man roughly half of them. That  reflects shift patterns and the fact that peak times are from 11.00 am to 4.00  pm and from 10.00 pm to 2.00 am. Much of the rest of the day is downtime. A  large percentage of an ambulance crew&rsquo;s shift is spent in a station waiting for  a call. Therefore we do not man all ambulances all the time. There are about  130 accident and emergency ambulances in the system, about half of which are  manned at any given time.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Ambulance Service prepares for a major event, and I  visited a major event preparation a few weeks ago. It included police and fire  services, as well as all the accident and emergency units of the hospitals in Belfast and the Ambulance  Service.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Will the Minister draw his remarks to a close?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker.  Mister O&rsquo;Loan&rsquo;s figures are right. In the northern area, 2,000 hours of  traditional accident and emergency ambulance cover will be replaced with 11,000  hours of paramedic rapid-response vehicle cover, which will give a net gain of  9,000 hours of paramedic cover.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The consultation is important, as it gives everyone an  opportunity to make their point. However, the Northern Ireland Ambulance  Service is a net gainer from CSR savings. Other trusts would like to be treated  in the same way.</p>
