              <p ALIGN="left"><b><font SIZE="3">The Minister of Finance and
              Personnel (Mr Durkan):</p>
              </font></b><center><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish, with permission, to make a statement on
              the process for examining the Main Estimates for the services
              provided by the Northern Ireland Departments for the current
              financial year and the reflection of these Estimates in an
              Appropriation Act. The approval of the Estimates and the passing
              of an Appropriation Act are among the most important
              responsibilities of the Assembly.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members will recall that on 15 December 1999 I
              presented the Executive’s budget proposals for the financial
              year commencing 1 April 2000 to the Assembly. The intention,
              clearly expressed, was that the Assembly and the departmental
              Committees would have the fullest possible opportunity to
              scrutinise those spending proposals. Following that scrutiny the
              budget would be reviewed by the Executive before being placed
              before the Assembly for approval. The approved budget allocations
              are the basis on which Departments draw up their detailed spending
              estimates for the year and these require separate approval by the
              Assembly.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Suspension meant that the process of
              scrutinising the budget proposals through the Assembly could not
              be completed before the beginning of the financial year. However,
              during suspension the Secretary of State confirmed the allocations
              for the Northern Ireland Departments in line with the Executive’s
              December budget proposals. These allocations were further
              increased for health and education spending as a result of
              additional resources received in the Chancellor of the Exchequer’s
              Budget on 21 March.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although it is not feasible for the Assembly to
              resume the scrutiny of the budget, which was interrupted in
              February, there is still the opportunity for substantive
              consideration of spending proposals for this financial year
              through the process of approving the Main Estimates. Members will
              appreciate that approval of the main spending Estimates for
              Departments and the voting of money through an Appropriation Act
              are matters of the utmost importance. They are the essence of
              responsible government.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a result of suspension the Assembly was
              unable to deal with the spring Supplementary Estimates for
              1999-2001 and the vote on account for 2000-01. These were approved
              by Parliament in March.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Taking a vote on account in advance of the
              incoming financial year is normal practice to allow the
              continuation of public services until the Estimates are approved
              in the summer. For most services a uniform 45% of the anticipated
              expenditure for 2000-01 was approved to provide Departments with
              the legal authority to continue to incur expenditure on previously
              approved services for several months into the new financial year.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The vote on account is only to provide interim
              financing for services. In most instances this funding will be
              exhausted before the end of the summer recess. Unless the Assembly
              approves the balance of the funds for 2000-01 before then,
              Northern Ireland Departments will be unable to incur any further
              expenditure on services.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a limited amount of time available to
              us to consider and approve the Estimates and deal with the
              Appropriation Bill before the start of the summer recess, and I
              have taken that into account in what I am now proposing.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are two main elements in the procedure
              for approving Estimates, one of which is the consideration of a
              Supply resolution by the Assembly. That would seek the Assembly’s
              approval for the total amount of the balance required for the
              2000-01 Estimates. In effect the Assembly would be being asked to
              approve the spending plans as set out in the Estimates booklet.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will be tabling such a resolution for debate
              next week, approval of which will require cross-community support.
              The 2000-01 main Estimates were published today and copies have
              been placed in the Library. However, in order to give the greatest
              opportunity for consideration of this document, advance copies
              were given to Members last week.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As well as the Supply resolution, the Assembly
              has to consider an Appropriation Bill to confirm Departments’
              legal authority to incur expenditure. The Appropriation Bill is an
              important piece of financial legislation, the drafting of which
              must reflect the Supply resolution approved by the Assembly. A
              schedule to the Bill confirms the amounts approved for the
              services of each Department as set out in the Estimates. Only when
              this Bill has completed all its stages and received royal assent
              will the additional cash be available for services. I should add
              that Appropriation Acts are not permanent statutes but are
              repealed after the period they cover has expired.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The full procedure for the Assembly’s
              consideration of legislation as set out in Standing Orders cannot
              be completed between now and the start of the summer recess.
              However, Standing Orders also provide for Bills to be taken by an
              accelerated passage procedure in exceptional circumstances. The
              need for urgent approval of the Estimates and the passing of an
              Appropriation Bill is very clearly exceptional in current
              circumstances.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am therefore seeking leave to use the
              accelerated passage procedure for the Appropriation 2000 Bill,
              which is being introduced. The timetable I am proposing for the
              entire process, following the introduction and First Stage of the
              Bill today, is for the Supply resolution to be debated on
              Monday&nbsp;12&nbsp;June when the resolution will also be put to
              the vote. Also on the 12&nbsp;June, immediately following that
              vote on the Supply resolution, the Second Stage of the
              Appropriation Bill will be taken. That will be followed on
              19&nbsp;June by the Consideration Stage of the Bill, and on
              27&nbsp;June by the Final Stage. Even though accelerated passage
              means that there will not be a formal Committee Stage, I have
              discussed the matter with the Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the
              Finance and Personnel Committee, and my Department will give every
              assistance to the Committee if it wishes to examine the Estimates
              and the Bill within this timetable.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I accept that what I am proposing is not ideal.
              However, it allows the maximum opportunity both for consideration
              of the estimates for 2000-01 during the next month and for the
              passage of an Appropriation Act by a process allowed for in
              Standing Orders. The Assembly could attempt to take the
              Appropriation Bill by the normal procedure, but that would require
              special sittings during the summer recess. There would also have
              to be a Committee Stage, but that could not run for the full
              30&nbsp;days required by Standing Orders if the Bill is to be
              completed before the vote on account expires. I believe that the
              use of accelerated passage is acceptable in these circumstances.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that I will not have to seek the
              Assembly’s leave for accelerated passage for future
              Appropriation Bills. Generally, legislatures design special
              procedures specifically for routine financial business. It has not
              yet been possible for the Assembly to do this. I hope that we will
              do so as soon as possible, so that suitable procedures are in
              place the next time we consider Estimates and Appropriation. That
              could be as early as the autumn, depending on the requirement for
              any Supplementary Estimates in this financial year.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Department and I stand ready to provide
              whatever assistance the Assembly may find helpful in identifying
              and evaluating the possible options. In the meantime we must make
              the best use of the procedures available to us. That is what I aim
              to do.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members have up to 30 minutes for questions on
              that statement.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Close:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister emphasised the importance of the
              Appropriation Bill. Members will share that sentiment. The essence
              of government is the getting and spending of money and the
              choosing of priorities. However, the Minister went on to say that
              the proper procedures could not be fulfilled. Does he consider the
              importance of the Bill to be outweighed by the prospect of eating
              into the summer recess? We have had three months imposed holiday.
              Is it not important to give more credibility to ourselves and to
              this House by giving up some of the recess in order to do our job
              properly?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I take the hon Member’s point. I stressed the
              importance of the Appropriation Bill. The recess has been set by
              others acting quite properly on behalf of the Assembly. It is not
              for me to presume to change it. I have come before the Assembly to
              make it clear that if we are to be able to continue spending
              through the latter part of the recess we need to get the
              Appropriation Bill approved now. Even if we were to take this
              matter into the recess we still would not have sufficient time for
              a full Committee Stage and have enough money to spend. The options
              for the Assembly are clear.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr Ian Paisley:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with Mr Close. This is very important.
              I understand what the Minister is saying about the time factor.
              Will he tell us how much Assembly time next week has been set
              aside for the matters for which he is responsible?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to raise a further, important question.
              We have been delighted to hear the good news from Short’s and
              from the shipyard. There is still a big question mark over the
              shipyard. Perhaps the Minister could resolve newspaper
              speculation. Will he allay our worries about the shipyard? He
              knows that an Appropriation Order can travel &quot;from Dan to
              Beer-sheba&quot; — I am only travelling to East Belfast to ask
              him if he can allay our worries.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member’s first question was on timing.
              That is a matter for the Business Committee, not for the Minister.
              I can reassure the Member that the Business Committee is seized of
              the importance of the Assembly’s having a substantial amount of
              time to address this matter. When it meets tomorrow the Committee
              will undoubtedly consider that. I expect substantial time to be
              set aside. This statement is entirely on the process of
              appropriation. The Member may wish to ask his question again after
              the Minister has made his next statement on the Estimates
              themselves. He may be able to respond then. It would not be in
              order to respond to that question at this point because we are
              dealing now with the process, not the content, of appropriation.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">10.45 am</p>
              </i><b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr Ian Paisley:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have to abide by your ruling, Mr Speaker, but
              I do not agree with it. Appropriation is a very wide matter. In
              the House of Commons there is always liberty given on these
              matters, but this House —</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order. I am afraid that the Member
              misunderstands the process being followed at present. This is not
              the Appropriation debate, which is the kind of debate to which he
              refers, nor is it a statement on the Estimates, where it would
              also be appropriate. That is the next statement the Minister will
              be making. This is a statement purely on the process of
              Appropriation and the question of possible accelerated passage.
              However, I have no doubt the Member will wish to ask his question
              again after the next statement.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Molloy:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am pleased that the Assembly will have some
              opportunity to discuss the Appropriation Bill. It is a vital piece
              of legislation. As Members will be aware, the Finance and
              Personnel Committee would normally be handling the Committee Stage
              of the Bill. However, on this occasion we accept that is not
              possible because of the time factor. It is important that we look
              to the future and that we have an opportunity at different stages
              for the Committee to deal with the issues in question.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee is happy at this stage for the
              Appropriation Bill to be passed. That is essential so that the
              Departments are not left short of funds. The Finance and Personnel
              Committee must also be able to co-ordinate with other Committees
              to ensure that their concerns can be put before the Assembly.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the points made by the Chairman of
              the Finance and Personnel Committee. It is simply not possible to
              pass important legislation of this sort in the time necessary,
              using the normal procedure. I accept that this is not satisfactory
              for the Assembly, the Committee or the Executive Committee.
              However, these are exceptional circumstances, and I remind
              Colleagues that Standing Orders provide for accelerated passage in
              precisely such circumstances.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Paisley Jnr:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Can the Minister confirm that even if we
              proceed with the proposals he has outlined, the figures in the
              Estimates are fixed in stone? Can they be adjusted? For example, I
              am not convinced that the money set aside for the Department of
              Agriculture and Rural Development is sufficient to deal with the
              problems with which the agriculture sector is currently beset.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The budget allocations were effectively made
              during suspension. That followed the budget proposals as set out
              by myself in the Assembly in December. To that extent, it would be
              impractical to re-open the budget at this stage. However, the
              debate on the Estimates will give Members such as Mr Paisley Jnr a
              full opportunity to examine the budget allocations in each
              Department. If his question implies that there could be a further
              vote on account, to allow time for further consideration, that in
              itself would require a new Appropriation Act. It would not ease
              any of the problems I have identified.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
              </font></b><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to make a statement on the Main
              Estimates for the financial year 2000-01 and the Supply resolution
              that is being tabled, and which the Assembly will be asked to
              debate next week. I also wish to comment on the substance of the
              Appropriation Bill that I hope to introduce today.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is highly appropriate, on our first day of
              business following the restoration of devolution, to have an
              opportunity to review the full range of public services for which
              we are now responsible. As I emphasised in December, the
              management of public spending is one of the fundamental
              responsibilities of any Government.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The restoration of devolution again gives us
              the opportunity to assume our full and appropriate
              responsibilities — to move from championing a few issues to
              deciding among all the issues, and from opposing to leading. We
              have an opportunity to work together in a unique form of
              administration, pursuing quality and equality in the management of
              public services for the good of all the people. The Main Estimates
              and the Appropriation Bill are at the heart of our
              responsibilities. Under the Northern Ireland Act 1998, and in line
              with principles that apply in both London and Dublin, it is my
              responsibility on behalf of and with the agreement of the
              Executive Committee to seek the Assembly’s authority for
              spending on public services. These formal processes very strongly
              emphasise the Assembly’s role in protecting the interests of the
              public and ensuring that money is spent well.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have been working, and will continue to work,
              with the Finance and Personnel Committee on the process of
              planning public spending. Members can, and will, hold Departments
              to account for the money they approve in this process through the
              Public Accounts Committee. The Main Estimates document provides
              the reference point and detailed analysis of the spending plans of
              Departments for this purpose.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It may help if I set out briefly the main
              financial planning and control processes, which are now our
              responsibility under devolution. That is the context in which
              these financial issues should be considered. The key planning
              process is, of course, the formulation and approval of a programme
              for government, linked to a budget, which sets out the total
              expenditure which each Department or programme expects to incur
              over one or more years ahead.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In normal circumstances the Executive’s
              proposals for the programme for government and the budget would
              have been considered by the Assembly and settled before December.
              However, Members will recall that the start of devolution late
              last year meant that the budget proposals for this financial year
              were only put before the Assembly on 15&nbsp;December, and it was
              not possible to complete the scrutiny of the budget before the
              process was interrupted by suspension. During suspension the
              Executive’s budget proposals were confirmed at Westminster. The
              Secretary of State supplemented them by additional allocations for
              spending on the health and education programmes from new money
              provided by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in his March Budget.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The approved budget is the basis on which
              Departments plan expenditure. However, separate authority to spend
              money on specific services in a financial year must be sought from
              the Assembly through the process of Supply. The Supply process
              involves a number of distinct steps, each of which is important.
              In the first instance, the Executive must inform the Assembly of
              the amounts it seeks for specific services. That is the purpose of
              the Estimates booklet published today and made available to
              Members. Copies have also been placed in the Library. An advance
              copy was made available to Members on Friday. As Members will see,
              the Estimates are quite detailed requests for cash for specific
              services. They show the estimated amount that can be drawn from
              the consolidated fund to support each service this year. In some
              instances receipts will arise in an area of expenditure, and the
              estimate will show how much of these receipts can be set against
              spending to reduce the need to vote new funds.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The next stage is that the Assembly should be
              afforded the opportunity to scrutinise and approve the Main
              Estimates as published. The means by which that opportunity is
              provided is the Supply resolution that the Assembly will be asked
              to debate next week.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In order to give statutory authority to the
              moneys voted for services, and to ensure that funds provided to
              the Executive for one purpose are not used for other purposes, the
              sums voted are legally appropriated to the specific services and
              the authority to draw money to meet these expenditures will be
              confirmed in an Appropriation Act.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members will recognise from this brief
              description that the Estimates and the Appropriation Act are
              central to the Assembly’s control over the use of public funds.
              The appropriation accounts, which will be produced after
              expenditure has been incurred, will be produced on a corresponding
              basis to the Estimates. This will enable the Assembly to compare
              actual expenditure with the Estimates that it approved and to have
              an explanation of any significant differences.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I emphasise that the form of the Estimates is a
              matter to be agreed between the Executive Committee and the
              Assembly. For the moment I am content to proceed on the basis of
              the well established practice of presenting Estimates for the cash
              amounts needed to finance services.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Looking to the future, the Assembly should be
              aware that work is well advanced on moving the planning and
              control of government expenditure to a resource accounting and
              budgeting basis. This would bring the treatment of the Government’s
              finances into line with commercial practices. It would also allow
              a better appreciation of the full resource cost of pursuing each
              of the objectives in Departments and hence help to improve
              decision taking. This shift in accounting and budgeting practice
              would have to be reflected in changes in the form of the
              Estimates. I look forward to discussing these matters with the
              Finance and Personnel Committee and the Assembly in due course.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The figures in the Estimates booklet are
              testimony to the importance of the business we are dealing with
              today. For the health sector, we are seeking to spend almost
              £2&nbsp;billion this year to sustain hospitals and pay the
              doctors and nurses who provide health care for everyone. In the
              education programme, the £1·2&nbsp;billion we are seeking will
              fund over 1,300 schools and pay for 20,000 teachers to educate
              more than 350,000 schoolchildren.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The same holds across the total range of public
              services. Roads and public transport, support for industry and our
              farming community, support for the housing programme and the many
              other important services and programmes across all Departments
              depend on the money the Assembly is being asked to approve in the
              Estimates and in the Appropriation Bill.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that the Assembly has found this brief
              description of these important financial instruments helpful.
              There will be a full opportunity to examine matters in detail in
              the debate next week, but I will endeavour to respond to any
              general queries on the Estimates which Members may have.</p>

              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr Ian Paisley:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I misunderstood what was happening today. Had I
              heard about a second statement I would have reserved my remarks
              for that. If I offended you in any way, Mr Speaker, I apologise.
              As you have indicated, I can raise that matter now.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People were thrilled to know of the situation
              in the aircraft industry and delighted to know that the union
              between the Canadian company and Short’s has been so fruitful. I
              am sure we all wish them well. We were also delighted about the
              shipyard news, though what was announced was different from what
              happened with the investment from Canada in Short’s</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There have been some alarming newspaper
              accounts about a big question mark hanging over the company
              concerned. It is dealing with large luxury vessels of immense
              price, yet it can only find an office in a red-brick villa in a
              street somewhere in Luton. It could not be contacted by phone, and
              people who ought to know seem to have no knowledge of it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not know what truth there is in those
              rumours. However, I would like the Minister to set our minds at
              ease. Some of my constituents say that their jobs must now be in
              greater jeopardy than ever.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The hon Member is correct in referring to the
              great sense of encouragement everyone felt when they heard the
              news about Short Brothers plc and Harland and Wolff Shipbuilding
              and Heavy Industries Ltd. Some of the questions asked recently
              about these firms are connected with the issue of the Estimates.
              However, there are particular matters on which the Minister of
              Trade, Enterprise and Investment is working, and I am aware that
              the IDB is working closely with Short’s and Harland and Wolff to
              maximise the prospects that were apparent for both companies. It
              would be inappropriate for me to talk up any other difficulties or
              to speak out of turn about a matter which is the responsibility of
              the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Maskey:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a Chathaoirligh. I am
              seeking guidance from the Minister or from you, a Chathaoirligh,
              because, as has been said, the suspension made it impossible to
              deal with these Estimates in the normal way. I am reminded of the
              recent announcement about the IDB’s essential failure despite
              its substantial budget. I am concerned, even from my own
              constituency perspective, that if the money spent by IDB had been
              allocated in a better or different way there might be a far better
              record — or even a record — of job creation in quite a number
              of constituencies. Mr Durkan and you, Mr Speaker, have touched on
              a matter specific to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and
              Investment: when will we have an opportunity to discuss that
              Department’s estimates in detail? How was that money spent, and
              how might it be spent better in the future?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In my statement, I outlined the different
              stages that I propose would be used for the Appropriation Bill and
              the Supply resolution. I indicated that, next week, the debate
              would be much more comprehensive and detailed. Members will be
              able to pursue aspects of the Estimates that are of interest or
              concern to them.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I take it that the Member was referring in
              particular to the recent report of the Public Accounts Committee.
              The IDB is preparing a formal Department of Finance and Personnel
              memorandum of reply to the Public Accounts Committee, and it would
              be inappropriate for me to comment on the report until that
              document has been provided. That is established practice.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Leslie:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister for his statements and for
              his efforts to brief the Department of Finance and Personnel
              Committee on these matters. We realise that we have an inherited
              programme and, therefore, inherited costs. At this stage there is
              little opportunity to tweak them. However, we will have an
              opportunity to tweak them with the preparation of a programme of
              government which, the Minister has indicated, will be completed
              before December.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is essential to remember that when we move
              into the next set of Estimates the debate will, to a large extent,
              have taken place before it comes to the House. The allocations
              will have been horse-traded before that point is reached. Can the
              Minister advise us on the timetable he sees being pursued in order
              to have that debate carried out. Also, what role does he see for
              himself, as the person holding the ring in many of those
              negotiations?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Mr&nbsp;Leslie is aware from previous
              discussions we have had with the Finance and Personnel Committee,
              we want to improve the planning process in relation to public
              expenditure, and we want to make sure that the Committee and the
              Assembly have far more foresight in relation to these issues than
              the procedures that we have had to follow on this occasion have
              allowed. As I indicated in my statement, I believe that the shift
              to resource accounting and budgeting will help afford us greater
              opportunities in that regard in terms of the quality of
              information available and the sense of direction people will be
              able to give through the different sort of procedures we have been
              talking about. Clearly it is not a matter for me as Minister of
              Finance and Personnel to ordain precise procedures. We genuinely
              want to discuss and develop these with the Committee and with the
              Assembly. I previously had some discussion with yourself,
              Mr&nbsp;Speaker, on exactly how we could improve these procedures
              in everybody’s interests, but not least in the interests of the
              Assembly being able to have a significant and helpful say, in
              terms of both scrutiny and proper planning of expenditure.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Close:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister refers to the key planning process
              of government as being the formulation of a programme of
              government. I totally agree. Does he agree that we are indulging
              in what is, to a large extent, a cosmetic exercise? The cart has
              been put before the horse. In effect we are following, rather
              slavishly, certain attitudes. We are seeking to impose a form of
              government which is being brought about by a totally unaccountable
              regime. If we are to fulfil people’s dreams and achieve a new
              beginning, we have got to change — fundamentally change — the
              direction in which government has been going and the way in which
              it has been applied to the people of Northern&nbsp;Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Very recently, for example, we all received a
              press release from the Housing Executive. This year the Housing
              Executive is faced with a budget reduction of about
              £13·7&nbsp;million compared to last year. We know, for example,
              that 40,000 dwellings are unfit for human habitation, yet, by
              following slavishly a programme drawn up by unaccountable
              administrators, we are going to be approving these types of
              figures. Until we get a programme of government — one which has
              to be fundamentally different to that which applied before — we,
              if we are truly going to be doing the job for which we were
              elected, have got to move in a totally different direction. If we
              do not, we will be failing the people, failing to give them new
              opportunities and new hopes and failing to fulfil their
              aspirations.</p>

              being told that their circumstances will have to be assessed.
              Forms will be sent out on which they will have to give details of
              income. I am sure that the Minister will agree that that is not
              right. We must restore student grants and get away from the fact
              that the ability to pay is some sort of gauge as to whether
              students can afford to go to university. Does the Minister agree
              that there are many areas like this where direction must be

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A Member:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Which question?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was going to ask the same thing.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The hon Member, in his opening remarks,
              described today’s exercise, and, I assume, the exercise that I
              have talked about for the coming weeks, as cosmetic. It is not a
              cosmetic exercise; it is a vital legal requirement. If we were not
              to go through such a process we would not have the money to
              continue to discharge the vital public services that we have been
              talking about.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When I originally brought the budget proposals
              to the House on 15&nbsp;December I did not pretend that we were
              working on any basis other than that of the allocations previously
              laid down by the Labour Government in the comprehensive spending
              review. We have been upfront and open about it. It was agreed by
              each Member of the Executive Committee, and we put proposals to
              the House on that basis. It was the only way we could conduct
              business in the absence of the programme of government, which we
              are seeking to develop.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some aspects of the points raised are for
              relevant departmental Ministers. However, the gross resources
              available for housing under these Estimates could be around £602
              million — hardly cosmetic, and not to be dismissed. Within that
              total, the Housing Executive’s gross resources will be £528
              million, and £71 million of that will be for housing
              associations, whose funding will be supplemented by an additional
              £49million from private finance. I note the point made in
              relation to the Housing Executive press release. However, I would
              make the point relating to the total Estimates provision for the
              housing programme.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In relation to the issues of young students
              hoping to go into further and higher education, the Member is
              aware that my colleague the Minister of Higher and Further
              Education, Training and Employment has initiated a review of
              student financial support and we await his report.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to raise the issue of European
              funding because there is much concern that money under the
              European programme — Peace I — may be exhausted at the end of
              June. Hundreds of jobs could be lost, particularly in the
              community sectors — valuable sectors — because Peace II, the
              second European peace programme, will not be coming on stream for
              some months. I note that the Department of Finance and Personnel
              has the authority to borrow on the credit of the sums. What does
              the Minister intend to do to ensure that the gap between Peace I
              and Peace II is bridged, possibly by borrowing? Can he ensure that
              jobs will not be lost as a result? <i>[Interruption]</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Member for her question. The
              development of the new structural funds programmes —an important
              development — is a lengthy process and involves negotiation and
              agreement of a community support framework, the operational
              programmes and the programming complements. We are pressing ahead
              with negotiations with the European Commission with all speed,
              partly to ensure that the gap between the old and new programmes
              is minimised. All the funding bodies in the existing programmes
              were fully aware of the need for sustainability and to have
              suitable exit strategies in place. However, I recognise that some
              existing projects, particularly those under the single programme,
              will have difficulty in sustaining their activities and interim
              funding arrangements have been introduced by Departments, in
              particular the Department of Higher and Further Education,
              Training and Employment. There does not appear to be the same need
              under Peace I, particularly when £160 million of the total
              programme allocation remains to be spent before
              31&nbsp;December&nbsp;2001.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Would the Minister agree with me that when
              exercising government, meeting demands for additions to some
              budgets means, because of the block allocation of finance,
              reductions to other budgets? It is easy to make demands, but it is
              not so easy to fill the hole.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I note that the allocation in the Estimates for
              local government services shows an increase that is below the rate
              of inflation. Local government elections will be held next year.
              Can the Minister assure us that sufficient finances have been
              allocated to ensure that local democracy will go ahead unhindered?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Environment Committee has identified a very
              serious lack of education officers for road safety. Will the
              Estimates that the Minister has put before the House today assist
              in the employing of such officers as a matter of urgency?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Member for his very helpful and
              responsible observation about how easy it is to propose spending
              as opposed to resourcing. I am sure that that point will be used
              repeatedly by my Department and me in reply to him and others.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In answer to his second question, I refer him
              to his initial remarks.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most of the matters that Mr&nbsp;McCrea raised
              are the responsibility of the Department of the Environment. On
              some of the issues of local government funding, the Department has
              been working closely on options with a representative group of
              council chief executives and finance officers. They have been
              reviewing the formula for the distribution of the resources
              element of the general exchequer grant to district councils. That
              review is being progressed as a matter of urgency, and I hope a
              new formula can emerge. That would, however, require the amendment
              of primary legislation, and that would entail full consultation
              with district councils and the Assembly. Expenditure on road
              safety is a matter for the Minister and the Department to
              determine.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I think that the Minister will agree that the
              accelerated passage of the Estimates is not the most ideal way in
              which to deal with them, but will he agree with me that this book
              of Estimates is in itself a statement of the enormous advances
              that we have made over the last number of years and months? It is
              a detailed account of a programme of government which we will be
              pursuing for the next 12 months, and it is a tribute to the civil
              servants and officials who have reorganised government in Northern
              Ireland into the new Departments. It is also a tribute to his own
              Department. Will he accept that I will not be so kind to him next
              week?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am surprised that he has been so kind to me
              even today, so I certainly have no expectations for next week.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to take up the point about the
              production of the Estimates themselves. I did say that we issued
              advance copies of the Estimates last week. Clearly things have
              moved quickly. Estimates do not just reflect the allocations as
              outlined in my statement here on 15&nbsp;December; they also
              include the further Estimates that have resulted from the
              Chancellor’s budget allocation, the allocations to health and
              education that were made by the Secretary of State and confirmed
              by the Executive Committee only last Thursday. Estimates are
              absolutely up to date, and it is a tribute to the various civil
              servants involved that we have completed so much. It is certainly
              not their fault that we are caught in circumstances, not of our
              own making, that mean that we cannot subject the Appropriation
              Bill to the length of stages that would ordinarily be available to
              us under Standing Orders.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Once again, I emphasise the importance of
              ensuring that we get as much certainty and clarity about this as
              about all the other matters on which people have said we need
              certainty and clarity. It is not in anyone’s interests to
              conduct Assembly business in ways that lead people to worry that
              the money needed to continue to fund public services could run out
              before the end of the summer recess. That is why we need the
              accelerated passage — to ensure that the money is available and
              that everyone’s efforts and concentration can be directed
              towards managing the money properly, rather than worrying about
              whether it is available.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr S Wilson:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, I wish to thank the Minister for saying
              that he will give us some clarity and certainty in the answers
              that he provides to the House. I hope that will be clearer than
              the clarity given to some members of the Ulster Unionist Party and
              that it will not take the form of secret letters. With regard to
              allocations, I understand that the process is not satisfactory and
              all Members will agree. However, because of the interim
              arrangements, it is probably something we have to live with.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The figures are based on the outcome of the
              comprehensive spending review and, as some Members have indicated,
              there are questions as to how satisfactory that has been in
              ensuring the allocation of moneys to particular issues. After we
              adopt the Appropriation, I am unclear as to whether there will be
              an opportunity during the year for reallocation, not only within
              Departments but between Departments, if it is thought that there
              will be an underspend of budget allocations at some stage. We have
              already seen the problems with the Housing Executive, and with
              other areas, and we will need to look at these. I understand the
              opportunity cost of doing this. However, will there be an
              opportunity to look again at reallocating between Departments?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Member for his question. A series
              of monitoring rounds conducted during the year help to identify
              programmes under particular pressure because of greater demand
              than expected and identify easement in terms of anticipated spend.
              Clearly, one of the reasons for the monitoring round is to ensure
              the identification of available resources in-year and to properly
              and strategically redirect them, at that time, to areas where they
              are needed. Members will recall the exercise that took place after
              the December monitoring round when further moneys were made
              available to various programmes and Departments. In particular,
              extra money was allocated to the Department of Health to deal with
              apparent winter pressures. It is for this type of circumstance
              that the in-year monitoring round exists. I intend to work with
              Departments to try to make the most of those opportunities, and I
              am sure that Departments will work with their Committees in that
              regard. I have had discussion with the Finance and Personnel
              Committee to ensure that they have earlier sight of, and a better
              insight into, some of the issues involved in the monitoring round.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I accept what people have said about this
              process. By and large, it is better if people feel that they are
              not finding out everything about public spending by looking in the
              rear-view mirror, but that they can see these things coming up
              ahead and can get information from the dashboard. That is part of
              what we are trying to do and improve.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr O’Connor:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the Chancellor allocated an extra £3
              billion in his budget statement, only £86 million came to
              Northern Ireland for additional public spending. Proportionately
              Northern Ireland should have received about £140 million. Does
              the Minister agree that we lost out because no Minister or
              Executive was in place at that time?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Can the Minister assure us that when additional
              funding is made available from Westminster we shall not be sold
              short again?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issue raised is much bigger than the
              question implies. That does not mean, however, that I shall give a
              much bigger answer at this point. The question clearly raises
              issues that touch upon the Barnett formula, and precisely how
              Northern Ireland gets its share of the money identified and
              allocated at UK level. Obviously, it is an issue which not just my
              Department and the Committee on Finance and Personnel wish to
              examine and work on. It is being considered by the Executive
              Committee itself, since we are in a further Treasury spending
              review due to end in a matter of weeks. That spending review will
              determine the levels, forms and patterns of public expenditure
              throughout the United Kingdom up to 2003-04. The issues raised by
              the Member are therefore certainly on everyones’ minds.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, I stress that the money from the
              Chancellor’s Budget was very welcome. Last week the Executive
              confirmed the Secretary of State’s allocation of over
              £14&nbsp;million to the schools programme and £53&nbsp;million
              to health. There will be further decisions on the allocation of a
              further £18&nbsp;million soon, along with moneys available from
              last year’s end-of-year flexibility exercise of the spending
              round. We shall shortly allocate that pool of money.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unfortunately I cannot give the Member the
              confirmation he seeks regarding the latter point. I cannot pledge,
              or promise, that money allocated to, or released in, the overall
              programme, whether at the Department of Education or at any other
              Department, will be spent in a particular constituency. I simply
              cannot start to deal with questions about different Departments’
              programmes in that fashion — it would be inappropriate. That may
              be disappointing to the Member, but it is the honest answer.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister has said the role of the Assembly
              is to protect the public interest and ensure that money is spent
              well. Therefore it is incumbent on Members to ensure this is the
              case. Is the Minister convinced that sufficient resources are
              available to combat social security fraud in
              Northern&nbsp;Ireland? There is a strong perception that one area
              of social security fraud — namely, motability fraud — is
              causing great public concern, and it appears not to be beneath
              some people in this Chamber to rip off the most needy in our
              society.</p>

              the particular responsibility of a ministerial colleague—in this
              case, the Minister for Social Development. Clearly, I want all
              programmes operated with total probity, effectiveness and value
              for money. Public expenditure has many areas, and it is
              distributed in a variety of forms. All sorts of questions might be
              raised or impressions given concerning the degree of abuse with
              regard to different public moneys.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We want to see proper and appropriate use of
              all public moneys. Where any Minister or Department comes forward
              with analysis that identifies levels of abuse that they wish to
              tackle, my Department would want to work with them positively on
              that basis.</p>

              tax-varying powers in order to provide the essential services for

              acknowledge that he and his Department have accepted that
              principle by their own proposal to increase the regional rate by
              8% this year, thereby dealing with the potential arguments about
              block grant being reduced because of taxes being added here?
              Perhaps he could also tell us if he is just as keen as the DUP on
              the consequences of his policy leading to, for example, a £13·7

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I accept the point in the Member’s question
              about the consistency of his party Colleague in terms of seeking
              tax-varying powers. I would ask people, before they think that is
              going to be the panacea for everything, to remember, whether we
              have tax-varying powers or not, that we are still going to have
              finite resources to allocate. Even with the additional moneys that
              might result from tax-raising powers, we are going to have to take
              priority-based decisions on their allocation and on their
              management. We need to consider carefully the experience of other
              places with tax-varying powers. I have warned previously about the
              risks of us experiencing a concept of subtractionality in our
              dealings with the Treasury in that regard, as opposed to some of
              the questionable experiences of additionality we have had in the
              past in relation to some moneys.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the housing money, I stress, yet
              again, we should not forget the money that is going in to the
              housing programme. Yes, it is a housing programme which, by its
              nature, has actually been changing. Like all other programmes, it
              will have to be examined and assessed in the context of the
              development of the programme of government. I want to see that all
              these programmes that are of concern and interest to Members —
              because they do perform vital services for people throughout the
              community — are given proper and adequate consideration and, in
              turn receive the proper and adequate funding. As Members of the
              Assembly, we are all here to satisfy ourselves on that matter. I
              will work with the Committee on Finance and Personnel to improve
              the systems which assure us on that. I have no doubt that the
              Ministers in their respective Departments and all the Members of
              the respective Departmental Committees will want to contribute to
              that. When we made the original budget statement in December we
              said we wanted all the departmental Committees to peruse the
              budget proposals in respect of the programmes that came under
              their Departments. We want these things properly proofed on behalf
              of Members of the Assembly.</p>

              what I am facing next week, I am not sure that I entirely agree.
              It is a bit like what Talleyrand is reported to have said of

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Therefore, in this situation, some of the
              devolution decisions do not look too bad, or it looks handy enough
              that somebody else is taking those particular decisions. The
              Member’s point is a good one. This is part of our political
              induction in taking up our new responsibilities as an Assembly and
              an Executive. Unfortunately the procedures do not lend themselves
              to the sort of input and exchange that we would want, but those
              are circumstances in which we are particularly caught.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am certainly encouraged by Members’ very
              positive and well-motivated interest across the range of
              programmes and the range of Departments. I have made it clear all
              along that I see the job of the Department of Finance and
              Personnel as being working with and for all the other Departments.

              money for those projects. If money is going to be allocated to
              them, will the allocation be equality-proofed in terms of the
              employment position, particularly in relation to Harland and
              Wolff?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In respect of the question about additional
              money for Harland and Wolff, I have made the point that the
              Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment and the IDB are
              working on this. If additional assistance were to be made
              available beyond what has been talked about and what has been
              provided for, that would be a matter for future estimates; it is
              not covered in these Estimates.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In respect of the Member’s equality question,
              the Estimates have been drawn up on the basis of expenditure plans
              which meet the requirements of section 75 of the Northern Ireland
              Act 1998 and, indeed, the new targeting social need policy. The
              Member talked about the breakdown of the allocation in the area of
              health and personal social services. He is perhaps a bit like
              Mr&nbsp;Shannon when he asked if money in a particular Department’s
              programme could at this stage be earmarked on a subregional basis.
              It would be inappropriate for me to do this simply because in the
              nature of most programmes, and not least in one such as the health
              and personal social services programme that applies right across
              the region, it is not always easy to specify.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of Health, Social Services and
              Public Safety, like the other Departments, is trying to bring
              forward new targeting social need measures and achievements in
              that regard, and clearly it would be a matter for the Minister of
              Health, Social Services and Public Safety to articulate those
              plans. I would, however, like to point out again the significant
              amount of money that is going into the Department of Health,
              Social Services and Public Safety, particularly towards health and
              social services.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is not just the extra £53&nbsp;million that
              came from the Chancellor’s last Budget announcement&nbsp;— we
              are talking about £169&nbsp;million above the planned amount for
              last year for health and personal social services. That is a cash
              growth of 9%, and obviously we hope that that cash growth will
              manifest itself in a helpful and an attractive way in all areas of
              Northern Ireland.</p>

              Mr&nbsp;Close voiced his concerns, particularly in relation to the
              Housing Executive. In replying to Mr&nbsp;Shannon, the Minister
              said that he could not specify what would happen to any funds that
              would result from the sale of the school in his constituency.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But, going back to the housing issue, many
              Members will have heard from district and regional managers their
              great concern about the shortfall in the Housing Executive budget.
              They are also concerned that they cannot make use of the funds
              from the sales of houses. Will the Minister, in liaison with the
              Minister for Social Development, look into this issue in order to

              talk about the little bit of money that is not going in rather
              than the large sum that is. Housing programme resourcing questions
              for the medium to long term are a matter on which the relevant
              Minister may bring forward views, not least in the context of the
              programme of Government. I wish to ensure that arrangements are in
              place to allow such resources, as can be released, to go to the
              various programmes. We have to look at that in the context of all
              the priorities and experiences in the Northern Ireland block.

              my Mid Ulster hat on. I want to return to the question of
              directing funds to particular areas. It is accepted that ours is a
              society emerging from conflict, and that has social and economic
              consequences. If we are to redress some of the problems emerging
              from that and rebalance the services, it will be necessary to
              target social need in the area west of the Bann, and we will need
              to direct finance to that area. Mr&nbsp;John&nbsp;Kelly asked
              about the hospital service. We need to rebalance the hospital
              service west of the Bann and redress the neglect that has occurred
              over a number of years. Will the Minister consider directing most
              of the 9% increase in the health budget this year to that end,
              specifically to ensure the South Tyrone Hospital is not allowed to
              close for lack of funding?</p>

              for health. Pay and inflation have been particular problems within
              the health budget for some time. The funds now available remedy
              the pay deficit and raise the baselines to 2000-01 price levels. I
              will not pretend that all the extra money is going in to service
              developments. However, approximately £79 million will be
              available for that purpose, and Members will want to address the
              Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety on how that
              should best be used.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the wider questions of equality
              and targeting social need, all Departments and public bodies are
              obliged under section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 to
              conform to clear and proper equality standards in their plans. The
              Executive will be developing its work in that area. It is already
              developing new Targeting Social Need policies, measures and
              standards. My Department wants to see real targets and indicators
              in use, rather than the unsatisfactory, impressionistic and
              anecdotal measures that have been relied on to date. We do not
              want Targeting Social Need to be another &quot;It’s the thought

              targets and indicators used, as far as possible, throughout all
              programmes. My Department has a role in helping all Departments to
              come up with sound indicators and targets.</p>

              Appropriation Bill. Nevertheless, the public expectation of the
              Assembly is that it will do things differently. It should
              seriously consider directing finances to areas of long-term
              disadvantage. Even a cursory glance at this year’s Estimates
              indicates that we are going to have more of the same. This is
              unfortunate. There is a finite amount of resources, but how is the
              Minister going to balance the finite amount and address the areas
              where there has been serious long-term underspend by the
              Government under direct rule? In particular, I would like him to
              explain why £91&nbsp;million of public money has been committed
              to the Odyssey project. How does this address the area of
              targeting social need?</p>
              <b>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am sure the Member was not suggesting that
              the £91&nbsp;million she mentioned towards the end of her
              question would be sufficient to address social need in Northern
              Ireland. The Executive is going to have to develop how we properly
              articulate and manage an effective policy in relation to targeting
              social need, and I have tried to explain that previously. Those
              are responsibilities for the Executive. There are measures that
              Ministers and their Departments will want to develop within their
              own particular programmes. We are also going to have to agree
              priorities and measures across the full gamut of public affairs
              and public management. We are committed to doing so. It is simply
              not within my gift to say that I will direct all the money to
              every social need that everybody in this Assembly can identify
              with.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need to ensure that we design the overall
              allocation system and manage all our spending programmes in ways
              that effectively target and meet social need.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Odyssey Project is costing a total of
              £91&nbsp;million. There is a range of funding partners — the
              Millennium Commission, £45&nbsp;million; the Sports Council for
              Northern&nbsp;Ireland, £2·5&nbsp;million; the Sheridan Group, a
              private sector investor, £16·9&nbsp;million; Laganside
              Corporation, £9·25&nbsp;million; with £16·9&nbsp;million
              coming from the Government. It is important that that detail be
              noted. The total spend is not coming out of our programme; Lottery
              money and private money are also involved.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I remind the Minister of the previous question
              asked by Dr&nbsp;McCrea about the council elections. Is sufficient
              funding being set aside next year for those elections, as the
              amount of money does not seem to take account of inflation?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of the Environment was possibly
              one of the most mean-spirited Ministers during the 72&nbsp;days of
              the Assembly prior to suspension. He did not spend any money. Can
              the Minister assure Members that there is enough money in the
              Environment budget to do something about the major planning
              backlog, in particular in relation to area plans? Has the Minister
              of the Environment enough money to take action to help alleviate
              these problems?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The budget was agreed by the Executive
              Committee. All Ministers and Departments would obviously like more
              money. All Ministers and Departments are able to point in a very
              real and credible way to pressures they are experiencing in the
              management of their budgets. In the Department of the Environment,
              there are future issues in local government, along with current
              and pressing issues, and some long-standing matters like the
              difficulties in the planning area. My Department will continue to
              work with the Department of the Environment and others to ensure
              that they have sufficient resources, and that they make the best
              use of those resources to provide Departmental services
              efficiently and effectively.</p>

              and transparency with which he has handled the many different
              questions. Can he assure us that when the INTERREG&nbsp;III
              programme comes into effect later this year the mechanism agreed
              in line with EU considerations — namely, that the money be
              administered at local level, in our case by the three cross-border
              committees at local authority level — will continue to apply?
              Can he assure us that the Department will not be indulging in any
              kind of additionality or centrality?</p>
              <b>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Member for the question. First, I
              remind Members that the special EU programmes body, established as
              a result of the agreement, will have a direct interest and a real
              management role in relation to a variety of EU funds and
              programmes, including INTERREG.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, we want to see the sort of models —
              that ensure more local delivery and local appraisal of the use of
              key European funds — develop right across all the future
              European funding programmes. We also believe that it is a model
              that could usefully be applied in many of the departmental
              mainstream programmes.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the Minister comment on what seems to be a
              huge percentage increase in the forecast for the superannuation
              budget for health and personal social services? It is more than
              the Housing Executive was looking for, and £15&nbsp;million more
              than was forecast. Has something incredible happened to bring
              about a 54% increase, way above the 1999-2000 forecast of about
              £28 million? The figure has turned out to be about
              £43&nbsp;million.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The New Deal money is ring-fenced and often
              cannot be touched by Northern Ireland. It has been reprofiled and
              some of that money has been spent elsewhere. How did this happen?
              Was that a precedent? Can it be done in future years? I
              congratulate those who succeeded in doing it, but will the
              Minister comment on it?</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In terms of the detail of the reprofiling, I
              would appreciate more details from the Member so that I can
              properly pursue the matter and give a fuller and better answer. I
              am not quite sure about the facts she is raising. I am not
              disputing them; I am simply asking for more details so that I can
              give a fuller reply. I certainly will pursue the matter.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In terms of the increases in superannuation,
              let us remember all that happened in previous years when a
              Department was bidding for its budget allocation and the
              Department of Finance and Personnel was agreeing overall budget
              allocations. We have been informed by previous experiences and by
              the upcoming pressures that we know about. There is nothing
              provided for that is not needed, and for which real demand is not
              clear, visible and apparent. That is why the increase is there.</p>

              áthas mór orm bheith anseo ar madin. With permission, Mr
              Speaker, I will make a statement about the first sectoral meeting
              on education of the North/South Ministerial Council held in Dublin
              Castle on Thursday&nbsp;3&nbsp;February.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Following nomination by the First Minister and
              Deputy First Minister on 1 February, Mr&nbsp;Dermot&nbsp;Nesbitt
              and I attended the sectoral meeting of the Council. The Irish
              Government were represented by Dr Michael Woods TD, Minister for
              Education and Science, who was accompanied by Mr Noel Treacy, a
              Junior Minister in his Department. This statement has been
              approved by Mr Nesbitt and is also made on his behalf.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although the Council’s main focus was on
              education matters, it first noted the resignation of Dr Vincent
              Cavanagh from the Food Safety Promotion Board, and it agreed the
              appointment of a replacement board member, Mr Michael Walker.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The objective of the meeting was to agree areas
              for co-operation on education matters. The Council discussed
              matters for enhanced co-operation in education which were mandated
              by the inaugural plenary of the North/South Ministerial Council in
              Armagh on 13&nbsp;December&nbsp;1999. These were: educational
              underachievement; special educational needs provision; teacher
              qualifications; and school, teacher and youth exchanges. The
              Council also noted other areas of co-operation, some of which may
              have potential for further co-operation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In relation to educational underachievement the
              Council decided to establish joint working groups to focus on
              three issues: developing proposals which would contribute to
              encouraging pupils’ attendance at school, particularly how
              parents may be better equipped to support their children in the
              learning process; improving the literacy and numeracy skills of
              pupils, including the training of support staff, especially in the
              specialised areas of early years and dyslexia; and developing a
              means of establishing a register of child protection so that
              people who may present a risk to the safety and well-being of our
              children are prevented from working with children and young
              people.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The council decided to establish a North/South
              special education co-ordination group, which will undertake a
              range of work to promote co-operation and to share information and
              best practice between those involved in special education.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The council also decided to establish a
              teachers’ working group to examine a range of issues related to
              teacher mobility.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The council agreed to commission an evaluation
              of the range and effectiveness of current programmes involving
              school, teacher and youth exchanges. The research will be
              undertaken by the Centre for Cross-border Studies in Armagh. A
              report will be submitted to the next meeting of the council and
              will include recommendations which will contribute to the
              development of a more coherent approach to exchanges not just on
              this island but with other countries. The council will also give
              further consideration to the administrative mechanisms and support
              required in this field.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The working groups have been charged with
              developing initial proposals for the next meeting of the council
              on the priorities which they have identified, the delivery
              measures they propose to put in place and the projected timescale

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister will recall that I wrote to him in
              my capacity as Chairman of the Assembly Education Committee
              regarding the meeting of the North/South Ministerial council to
              which his statement refers. I remind the Minister that the
              Education Committee, on a cross-party basis, expressed its concern
              that it was not consulted either about the meeting or,
              particularly, its content. How does the Minister intend to keep
              his commitment to work closely with the Education Committee on all
              issues of mutual interest, with particular reference to matters of
              North/South co-operation?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the matters raised by the
              Minister in his statement, may I advise him that the Education
              Committee has identified the issue of educational underachievement
              as a possible subject for inquiry by the Committee later this
              year. Will he and his officials keep my Committee completely
              informed in the light of his previous commitments?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I note from his statement that the Minister
              referred to other areas of co-operation. Will he inform the House
              what these matters are or what these matters are likely to be? In
              relation to the make-up of the Special Education Co-ordinating
              Committee and the teachers’ working group on mobility, may I ask
              who will oversee these groups. What report-back mechanisms will be
              put in place with regard to the Assembly?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, with reference to the research by the
              Centre for Cross-border Studies in Armagh regarding school,
              teacher and youth exchanges, will the Minister refer the detail of
              this to the Education Committee in advance of the next North/South
              Ministerial Council meeting?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr M McGuinness:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I accept that during the course of the previous
              administration of this institution, there were some difficulties
              in relation to the Education Committee’s being informed and
              given due notice about announcements and meetings which were to
              take place. I am very committed to resolving the difficulties
              which resulted from that. It was also very interesting that they
              appear to be the only difficulties between the Education Committee
              and my Department. There will shortly be a meeting between the
              Member and myself. I think that we can put into effect good
              working practice, and I undertake to overcome whatever problems
              and difficulties have arisen. The whole issue of educational
              underachievement is vitally important, and I look forward to
              discussing our approach to that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There has been long-standing co-operation
              between my Department and the Department of Education and Science
              in the South on a wide range of issues. Here are a few examples.
              The European Studies project has been operating since 1986. It
              began as a joint venture between the Departments of Education in
              Belfast, Dublin and London and, for the first couple of years,
              involved a small number of schools. The project has grown in the
              intervening years and has over 400 secondary-level schools in 21
              countries throughout Europe. It engages teachers and young people
              in teaching and learning in the context of multi-national
              partnerships using modern information technologies.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Cross Connect project is a joint venture
              between the Western Education and Library Board, the vocational
              education committees of Cavan and Leitrim, and the University of
              Ulster. It aims to provide a programme of curriculum enrichment in
              small rural schools.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A further project, sponsored by Eircom with the
              support of the Departments of Education North and South, involves
              50 schools linked through the Internet and by school exchanges. We
              will want to explore opportunities for further development of
              these types of activity, which benefit teachers and promote
              inter-cultural learning among our young people, not just on this
              island, but, in some cases, in a wider European setting.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The question about who the working committees
              are ultimately responsible to — whether it be the teachers’
              co-ordinating group or the other working groups we have set up —
              is very important. Ultimately, they have to be responsible to me,
              as the Minister of Education, and, in the Southern context, to
              Dr&nbsp;Michael&nbsp;Woods, the Minister for Education and
              Science. We are content that we have very dedicated and committed
              civil servants in our Departments who will deal meticulously with
              all of these issues. Accountability rests with me, and I must
              report to the Assembly so that people will have the opportunity to
              question us on our contribution. In effect, that is the position.
              The work will be overseen by the North/South Ministerial Council,
              which will meet again in September, although no definite date has
              been agreed.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the Minister take all steps necessary to
              protect the long-term needs of rural schools so that they can
              continue to play a key role in sustaining rural communities?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr M McGuinness:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yes. I am keenly interested in this very
              important issue. Over a number of years, rural communities have
              experienced particular difficulties due to the threat that hung
              over some small rural schools, and which still does.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I appreciate the work that has been done in
              these schools and the efforts of the boards of governors, the
              local community, and the teachers, some of whom are working in
              difficult circumstances. As I have highlighted before, in the
              issue of education, the conditions under which teachers are
              teaching in the rural schools are particularly difficult, because
              some of the schools are old — in some cases, over 100 years old
              — and are in need of replacement.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have been very keen to point out to the
              officials in my Department that all of these matters ultimately
              will come back to me for decisions, and I have said that there
              should be a review of how the Department of Education handles the
              issue of rural schools. I have made it absolutely clear to
              officials that I would be very reluctant to close any rural school
              if a large part of the local community is arguing for its
              retention. It is an important issue and it is one that I take very
              seriously. My officials are conducting a review and I hope to make
              the result public soon.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to reiterate a point that was made by
              the Chairman of the Education Committee. The Committee agreed
              unanimously to send a letter to the Minister about the way in
              which cross-border meetings are handled. We only find out what
              happens at the meetings after they have taken place; we have no
              prior knowledge of the agenda or of how the business links in with
              the work being carried out in the Assembly. The whole Committee
              feels that this degree of secrecy is unacceptable and should stop.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister’s statement made reference to
              educational underachievement. He said that the working group would

              that the purpose of this session was to deal with the Minister’s
              North/South statement. I do not see what this has got to do with
              that whatsoever. In fact, I think that this is the second

              to other Ministers, on the subject of the statement which he has
              made. It is an opportunity for questions, not for speeches, and

              safety and well-being of children — he will on no future

              be no secrecy about what happens at North/South Ministerial
              Council meetings. After every meeting that I attend I report back
              to the Executive, and it would be highly valuable and useful, for
              the Member’s information, if his two Ministers would attend the
              Executive and get the reports at first hand. They would then
              obviously be in a much better position to inform the Democratic
              Unionist Party that no sneaky deals are being done on education. I
              do undertake to report back faithfully to the Executive and to the
              Assembly the content of all of the North/South Ministerial Council
              meetings on education which I attend.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the second matter, this may be an
              opportunity to make it clear that the allegations which the Member
              has made against me in the course of the last few minutes are
              totally and absolutely without foundation. If the Member would
              care to check up on what happened during my first visit to a
              school after becoming Minister of Education, he would find out
              that the discussion which took place was between me and a single
              journalist. I did not boast to any child; I did not mention in any
              public way or in front of children from any school, the fact that
              at one time in my life I was on the run from the British forces.
              What was I on the run from? I was on the run from internment.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was on the run from internment, not from any
              charge or the ability of the RUC, or anybody else, to bring me
              before a court. I was going to be interned because I was a
              Republican. I had not committed any offence, other than being a
              Republican. It is important to get this in perspective.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, it is an appropriate moment to wish Mr
              Wilson well in his capacity as the new Lord Mayor of Belfast and
              to express the desire, which I believe will be shared by the vast
              majority of our people in this changing situation, that he will

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have no doubt that
              Dr&nbsp;Michael&nbsp;Woods, Seán&nbsp;Farren and I will be able
              to work together in a positive fashion on what is obviously a
              hugely important issue for all of the people of this island.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Only last week we attended an important
              education conference at Stranmillis College, accompanied by
              Richard Riley, the United States Education Secretary. We finished
              with a short lunch, over which we had discussions. It is clear
              that the relationships between Dr&nbsp;Woods, Seán&nbsp;Farren,
              Richard Riley and myself are excellent. Offers of assistance from
              the United States in relation to their huge bank of research into
              all sorts of extremely important educational matters can be taken
              up by Seán Farren, Dr Michael Woods and myself.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Under European Union Directives we have already
              gone a long way towards the mutual recognition of teaching
              qualifications. The South already accepts graduates from certain
              teacher training courses here, and it would be useful to see if it
              were practicable to extend that both ways. The key issues will be
              assurance about the quality of the training provided and the
              competence of teachers to teach in our schools. It is very
              important to understand that the issue of salaries is outside the
              working group’s remit, and some consideration should be given as
              to whether it can be included later.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My question arises from the focus, in relation
              to educational underachievement, on increasing standards in
              literacy and numeracy. Clearly there are significant problems
              worthy of attention. I understand that, according to some surveys,
              up to one in five of the adult population here cannot decipher the
              instructions on a medicine bottle; something indicative of basic
              literacy. Given that both Northern Ireland and the Republic do
              badly in basic functional literacy and numeracy — we know this
              from international surveys, so it is no longer a matter of doubt
              — will the joint working group, to which the Minister has
              referred, avoid becoming too insular by simply restricting itself
              to comparison between the two jurisdictions? Will it be able to
              take into account best practice in numeracy and literacy
              improvement in Great Britain, the United States of America,
              Europe, the Far East, and indeed anywhere else in the world which
              is relevant?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr M McGuinness:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Obviously, I accept the huge importance of the
              issue the Member raises. I think that there are three key areas in
              tackling educational underachievement. In most of our schools
              where performance is lowest, attendance rates are also too low. We
              all know that teachers cannot teach pupils who are not there.
              Literacy and numeracy are, of course, the basic skills which open
              the door to the rest of the curriculum. Employers and others
              complain of poor results from many school leavers in these areas.
              Child protection is simply a fundamental duty for all of us.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These issues were identified because they are
              priorities both North and South, and in the case of the measures
              needed to stop unsuitable people finding work with children, east
              and west also. However, there will in due course be opportunities
              for us to look at other areas where joint working could bring
              benefits. The Member is absolutely right when he says we should
              not be insular in dealing with this matter. We must be open about
              it and recognise that there are deficiencies. There is a
              responsibility on the educational authorities, North and South, to
              examine education systems in other parts of the world to see if
              ideas can be harnessed to benefit the children of this island. We
              are very committed to doing so.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I stated earlier, the contacts we now have
              with the Department of Education in the United States will be
              invaluable to us, but we should not restrict or confine ourselves
              to that country. We must examine other education systems
              throughout the world to see if we can put into practice processes
              which will benefit all our children, eventually eradicating the
              many deficiencies in the system.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs E Bell:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister for his statement. This is
              one of the first instances of good communication between the
              Minister, the Education Committee and the Assembly. I did voice my
              concern about the North/South Ministerial Council meeting during
              the Education Committee meeting, and I supported the letter, as
              the Chairman said. My concern was that there should be good
              communication. There was no question of having concerns about
              secrecy because secrecy would not be allowed.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Within the priorities for enhanced co-operation
              the Minister has outlined education underachievement and special
              education. As the Chairman pointed out, quite rightly, we are
              looking at those issues as well. I am concerned about the
              overlapping of research and work, so we need to have some
              co-operation and information. How will this be co-ordinated? Will
              you ask the Council, at its future meetings, to look at the
              question of integrated and Irish-medium education so as to enhance
              the co-operation of the North/South Council?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I remind Members to address their questions
              through the Chair.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr M McGuinness:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To repeat what I said earlier, I am very
              committed to having an open Administration and I would hate to
              think that anybody felt that there was secrecy at work. It is
              vitally important that there is a good relationship between the
              Department of Education and the Minister, in particular, and the
              Education Committee. I am committed to try to bring that about.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Also, it is important that the Assembly be
              aware that the first meeting of the North/South Ministerial
              Council on Education came before the suspension of the
              institutions. It is important that people understand that during
              the period of suspension we had a situation where no work was
              taking place in relation to the sectoral meeting. The officials,
              in fact, had to discontinue the meetings which Michael Woods and I
              had authorised on behalf of the North/South Ministerial Council
              during that period. Obviously that puts us at a tremendous
              disadvantage insofar as it is not possible, even at this time, for
              me to have full information, simply because of the backlog of
              work.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is also important for people to understand
              that many of the areas we are dealing with are high priorities
              North and South, and officials, North and South, are dealing with
              these issues on an ongoing basis. In relation to working in a
              joint fashion, during the course of recent months that has not
              been happening and it has only recommenced when the institutions
              were restored. We are behind schedule in relation to all the
              matters that we are dealing with.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In relation to Irish-medium and integrated
              education, obviously these are issues that we are going to have to
              deal with as we proceed. The Executive Committee, this Assembly
              and the Department of Education in the South will have to consider
              whether or not there are other matters that can be dealt with by
              officials. My statement makes it clear that we are dealing
              basically with the four areas that have been mentioned:
              educational underachievement; special education provision;
              teacher, pupil and school exchanges; and teacher qualifications.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We recognise that the delay has put us all
              behind schedule. There are obviously difficulties that need to be
              dealt with.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Officials have hit the ground running as I hope
              we have done so here, and the Ministers in the Executive. The
              officials have returned to attend to their responsibilities under
              the North/South Ministerial Council, and I am satisfied that they
              are working very hard to get it back on track as quickly as
              possible.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr B Hutchinson:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Minister recognise that the present
              funding arrangement is one cause of the underachievement in many
              schools? Does he also recognise, in terms of development,
              proposals which encourage pupils to attend school and better equip
              their parents? I know from my experience as a councillor in
              Belfast, that there are many schemes throughout the five education
              and library board areas that are doing this, and we should
              recognise their work and achievements. Has the Minister’s
              Department been in contact with the boards to find out about the
              good practice schemes which deal with such issues?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Moving onto numeracy and literacy, I recognise,
              particularly in my constituency, that there are low levels of
              numeracy and literacy, and that there is a cost to all in that.
              The Belfast Education and Library Board does not have the money to
              implement schemes to deal with this problem. Will it be getting
              additional money to deal with this, or will the money come out of
              the Department’s current budget? There have been a number of
              changes to the curriculum, changes, it seems, from one year to the
              next. Does the Minister recognise that a lot of pressure has been
              put on teachers by these changes and that they too can contribute
              to educational underachievement? The Minister also referred to
              school attendance and to the problem of underachieving schools
              which pupils do not attend. Has the Minister looked at the
              differences between schools in disadvantaged areas and schools in
              affluent areas and at why the teachers and pupils seem to perform
              better in the latter?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr M McGuinness:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">School funding arrangements are under review at
              the moment, as I have mentioned previously in other debates. They
              are under review with an eye to achieving a fairer allocation.
              Money has been made available to enable the education and library
              boards to promote good practice, literacy and numeracy. They have,
              I think, each received £900,000 this year for that. The point
              that the Member made about focusing on areas of social
              disadvantages needs to be taken seriously and not just by
              ourselves and the Department of Education. There is a huge
              responsibility on the Government to face the reality that many
              disadvantaged areas have tremendous pressure on them in this. I
              know for a fact that absenteeism from schools in socially
              disadvantaged areas is much greater than in other areas, and that
              needs to be focused upon. My Departmental officials and I are
              committed to focusing on this point in order to find ways of
              improving the situation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Richard&nbsp;Riley made a submission to a
              meeting at Stranmillis College and said that the state of
              Connecticut, which pays the highest salaries to teachers in the
              United States, has the best examination results. Now that was not
              a scientific study and does not prove any case, but we all know
              and understand that teachers are under tremendous pressure. I
              agree with Mr&nbsp;Hutchinson that every time there is a review of
              the curriculum, it is hugely difficult for teachers to make the
              changes that need to be made. I know for a fact that computer
              technology has now effectively dominated all of our lives and not
              least the lives of teachers.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are all kinds of stresses and strains on
              the teaching profession. It is important to recognise the huge
              contribution that teachers have made to the welfare and teaching
              of our children in difficult circumstances.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In disadvantaged areas, there is a schools
              support programme that gives professional support to schools.
              Substantial funding is directed to improving standards in these
              areas. We must recognise the pressures on teachers. From
              discussions with my officials, it has become clear that people are
              focussed on getting these things right. It is going to take some
              time, but it is within our ability.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My final point is one that I developed in the
              ‘Belfast Telegraph’ during my previous period in this job. The
              schools estate is not in a good condition. As I said then, we will
              need hundreds of millions of pounds to resolve the outstanding
              problems. If we are to educate our children properly, it must be
              done in a conducive atmosphere. I was unable to attend the opening
              of the new school in Keady last week, but doubtless Members saw
              the photographs and the television coverage. It looked to be a
              beautiful development. I would like all our children to be
              educated in such conditions. We will not achieve that overnight,
              but we need to work towards that end.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important that the Assembly, the
              Executive and indeed the British Government recognise the dire
              need for extra education funding. All these problems —
              educational underachievement, social disadvantage, dyslexia and
              special needs education — require funding. If the funding is not
              there, we will always be fighting an uphill battle. We know what
              the problems are and my officials are focussed on them. They will
              work hard to eradicate the problems within the education system.</p>
              <b>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Quite a number of Members wish to ask
              questions. We agreed on 45&nbsp;minutes, so I ask Members to be
              concise with their questions and the Minister to be concise with
              his answers so that we can deal with as many as possible.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms McWilliams:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I commend the Minister on his report. I agree
              that children need to be educated in an atmosphere conducive to
              their personal development.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the Minister tell us why the proposed
              child protection register is listed under educational
              underachievement? Some abused children do underachieve, but others
              dedicate themselves to getting an education to show that they have
              survived. These children might be stigmatised if the register were
              associated with underachievement.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, is the Minister aware that the
              Health, Social Services and Public Safety Committee agreed last
              week to inquire into children’s services, and in particular the
              Children (Northern Ireland) Order 1995? The Committee will be
              considering child protection. Does the Minister’s proposal cover
              only those working in education, or will it also cover those
              working outside that sector? If that is the case, then the
              proposal should be referred to the Health, Social Services and
              Public Safety Committee.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.45 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would also like the Minister to note that in
              Northern Ireland we are falling far behind England, Wales and
              Scotland where there is currently in existence the Protection of
              Children Act 1999. That legislation does not exist here, and if it
              is the case that such legislation does exist in the Republic of
              Ireland, it may be something that the next meeting would like to
              look at.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, I share the Minister’s view that we
              should share good practice and information, particularly where
              there are administrations in Northern Ireland and the Republic of
              Ireland. It is most important that in this matter of child
              protection we look at the issue of prevention. In a country as
              small as ours — Northern Ireland has a population of just over
              1·5&nbsp;million, and the Republic a population of just over
              3&nbsp;million — this is a very pertinent issue, and if there is
              anything we can do to prevent the future abuse of children then a
              register may help. However, it is only one piece of the work in
              the whole area of action that is needed. It is not a new problem,
              but it has now been named, and we need to do something about it
              urgently.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr M McGuinness:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I take the point in relation to how we
              categorise these particular issues. I will strive to consider this
              further because the Member makes an important point. It is very
              important to understand that the register is basically for adults
              who are judged unsuitable to work with children, not the children.
              The register is intended to cover all education and health
              workers. It will cover the North in collaboration with everywhere
              else around these islands. There is undoubtedly excellent contact
              between the officials in all areas, and people do understand the
              need to get this right.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The points Ms&nbsp;McWilliams made are
              absolutely valid, and I would not dare to suggest that we have in
              place at the moment the proper structures, programmes or systems
              required to deal with the matter in an adequate fashion. We all
              know that the debate about child abuse has taken off recently.
              Clearly we now have a society prepared to face up to all the
              difficulties that this issue has for children, for families and
              for society in general. We are absolutely committed to dealing
              with these issues. I cannot deal with all of them here today
              because I do not have the details, but my Department will write to
              the Member in detail about the points that she has raised.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr A Maginness:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also welcome the Minister’s statement. This
              meeting shows the practical benefits of North/South co-operation
              in the field of education. My question is also about the register
              of child protection. May I ask the Minister to make that a
              priority. There is a danger that unsuitable persons are slipping
              through the net in both jurisdictions, and I believe that we
              should work with haste to establish the register in order to
              prevent this happening.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, everyone here should deplore the
              frivolous party political manner in which Assemblyman&nbsp;Sammy
              Wilson approached this very serious matter of the protection of
              children.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr M McGuinness:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I appreciate the Member’s comments and his
              support. I will make a register on child abuse a priority with my
              Department. I also think that Dr&nbsp;Michael&nbsp;Woods and
              others throughout this island will have no difficulty whatsoever
              in supporting that.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issues raised at the Ministerial Council
              between Northern Ireland and the Republic — which,
              coincidentally, do not have the consent of our community, but that
              is a side issue — were, according to this statement, approved
              and made on behalf of Mr&nbsp;Dermot&nbsp;Nesbitt. These issues
              apply equally if not more so to other regions of the United
              Kingdom such as Scotland and the North of England. What provision
              has been made to have these and similar issues raised at the
              appropriate ministerial level within the United Kingdom?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr M McGuinness:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To answer the first part of that question, it
              is important that we understand that all the institutions
              established as a result of the Good Friday Agreement were put to
              the people in a referendum in 1998, and over 70% — Unionist,
              Loyalist, Republican and Nationalist — voted for them. Let
              nobody be under any illusion about the support achieved here in
              the North for the new institutions and the huge support that we
              achieved in the South. Overall, there was over 80% support on the
              island for the establishment of the Assembly, the Executive, the
              all-Ireland Ministerial Council and the Implementation Bodies.
              There is democratic support on the island for these institutions,
              and I take my responsibility very seriously, as I believe all the
              pro-agreement parties, which are participating in a very positive
              and constructive way, consistently do.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the second point, we are all open to
              learning as much as we can about all the issues that affect the
              lives of our people and children. I have no difficulty at all in
              talking to people in England, Scotland, Wales or anywhere else
              about how we can improve education for our children. We need an
              open-minded approach, and to recognise that we are living in a
              changing world. Everybody has the duty to move forward positively
              and constructively, with openness, to improve the educational
              standards of our children; I am absolutely committed to that.</p>

              Agriculture and Rural Development that she wishes to make a
              statement on the meeting of the North / South Ministerial Council
              held on 9&nbsp;February&nbsp;2000.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Agriculture and Rural
              Development (Ms Rodgers): </b>With permission, Mr Speaker, I will
              make a statement about the first North/South Ministerial Council
              sectoral meeting for the Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights
              Commission. The first meeting of the North/South Ministerial
              Council for Foyle, Carlingford and<b> </b>Irish Lights Commission
              sector took place on 9&nbsp;February.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Following nomination by the First Minister and
              Deputy First Minister, Mr&nbsp;Dermot&nbsp;Nesbitt and I
              represented Northern Ireland. The Irish Government was represented
              by Mr&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;Fahey&nbsp;TD, Minister for the Marine and
              Natural Resources.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The papers for the Council were cleared in
              draft by the Executive Committee on 1&nbsp;February and were
              circulated in final form on 8&nbsp;February.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The main thrust of the meeting was to give
              impetus to the new Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission.
              Accordingly, the meeting opened with an oral progress report from
              Mr&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;Savage, the chairman of the Commission, and
              Mr&nbsp;Derick&nbsp;Anderson, the chief executive (designate), who
              attended for this item only. They were able to confirm that staff
              had transferred without difficulty from the Foyle Fisheries
              Commission, that the North/South Co-operation (Implementation
              Bodies) Order 1999 had also transferred successfully their
              prosecution and enforcement powers, and that good progress was
              being made in respect of their new headquarters. In addition, they
              described the interim agency arrangements which allowed the
              Commission to exercise its jurisdiction in respect of the
              Carlingford area through the Fisheries Conservancy Board and the
              Eastern Regional Fisheries Board.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council noted that the legislation to give
              the new Commission its powers to develop and license aquaculture
              forms part of the Executive’s legislative programme, and
              Mr&nbsp;Fahey confirmed that he would aim to keep in step with the
              progress of the Northern Ireland legislation in making parallel
              legislation in respect of the Irish jurisdiction.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council also took note of a progress report
              on the transfer of Irish Lights to the new Commission.
              Mr&nbsp;Fahey confirmed that the Irish authorities were content
              with progress.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council discussed the consultation
              arrangements which should apply in respect of the new Commission.
              The Council considered that it was important that the Commission
              should, as a priority, bring forward proposals for a new
              non-statutory advisory body which would draw in a range of those
              affected by its functions.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council approved a list of key duties which
              it wished the Commission to bring forward at an early date. These
              comprised: appointment procedures and terms and conditions for
              chief executive; mission statement; year 2000 corporate plan
              proposals; staffing proposals, structure and terms and conditions;
              proposed revisions to staff contracts; draft code of conduct for
              board members and staff; and finally, proposed programme of work.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council discussed the schedule of sectoral
              meetings likely to take place during 2000. These were
              provisionally set for early May, September and the first week in
              December. The Council agreed to meet again in this format in early
              May 2000.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, the Council considered and approved
              the draft joint communiqué, copies of which have been placed in
              the Assembly Library.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Can the Minister enlighten us a little on the
              new non-statutory advisory body? There is already a substantial
              amount of money being expended on the North/South body itself. How
              much is this non-statutory advisory body going to cost? How many
              members will it have and who will they be? Is it going to be more
              jobs for the boys?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Rodgers:</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are no proposals as yet and, as I
              reported, this is a matter that will be considered. Many people
              from the fishing industry who use the Foyle and Carlingford Loughs
              have expressed concerns to my Department, and I think it would be
              useful to consult with them. I assume that the advisory body will
              be a means of taking on board the views of people who are not
              actually on the Commission, but as yet there are no proposals.</p>

              question is about lighthouses and the Commissioners of Irish
              Lights, and arises from the report which was presented to the
              Assembly by the First Minister and Deputy First Minister on
              18&nbsp;January 1999. Under the section relating to the

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Given that the CIL functions in an

              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I understand that the context is that for over
              a century now lighthouse provision in this island has been funded
              out of a general lighthouse fund to which the current Secretary of
              State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, John
              Prescott, acts as trustee. He subsidises the operation of
              lighthouses in the North and, it has to be said, in the Republic
              of Ireland as well.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Were arrangements relating to the East/West
              aspect of lighthouse operation discussed at the recent meeting

              important issues that come under the jurisdiction of the
              Commission of Irish Lights, in particular, where the British
              Government has a concern. However, the arrangements were not

              the Irish Government now controls but did not control prior to the
              setting-up of this body? There is, take it from me, deep concern
              in the Carlingford Lough region about what is happening there.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will she explain how the body has an estimated
              spend of £431,000 since it was set up? What has that money bought
              for the people of Carlingford or Foyle? I would like to know where
              the money is to be spent or was spent. According to page 25 of the
              Northern Ireland Estimates 2000-01 it will be spent on services
              under the Government of Northern Ireland for the year ending 31

              content with the progress of the transfer of Irish Lights to the
              new Commission. Will the Minister say whether the transfer will

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I noted her comments on the idea of an advisory
              body to work with the cross-border body. Given the wide range of

              see why representatives of anglers or landowners on the Owenkillew
              river would necessarily want to be on the same advisory body as
              those who fish or sail on our saltwater coasts. Will the Minister
              give consideration as to whether more than one body might not be

              the legislation amending the Foyle Fisheries Act 1952 to extend
              the functions of the Loughs Agency, including the development and
              licensing of aquaculture in Lough&nbsp;Foyle, continues to be
              progressed. A number of policy matters between the two Departments
              sponsoring the Loughs Agency — the Department of Agriculture and
              Rural Development and the Department of the Marine and Natural
              Resources in Dublin — proved more difficult to settle than
              anticipated. However, instructions are now being finalised and

              amongst the work of the Department and the council?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Rodgers:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to thank Éamonn for that question. The
              Commission will deal with the need to conserve stock, to develop
              the fisheries and to manage the whole area. The answer to the
              question is &quot;Yes&quot;. I accept the importance of the issue,
              and I look forward to seeing the Commission work very fruitfully
              in that area.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Paisley Jnr:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In her statement the Minister said that good
              progress was being made. Is she concealing the reality of the
              situation? A departmental memo from Mr&nbsp;Derick&nbsp;Anderson
              to a Mr&nbsp;Lavery contains the most disturbing news that
              seizures of illegal nets and boats on the tidal Foyle have fallen
              from over 700&nbsp;nets and 80&nbsp;boats in 1996 to 350 nets and
              40&nbsp;boats in 1999, and that illegal fishing has been taking in
              excess of 10,000 salmon from this area per annum.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is the equivalent of between one half and
              one third of the legal commercial catch. As the Department is
              unable to recruit the temporary staff required to maintain this
              river, should the Minister not have brought this material to our
              urgent attention in her statement today, to make us all aware of
              the current dire and, indeed, most disturbing situation?</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My report was on the central meeting, which
              dealt with the legislative and administrative arrangements that
              must be put in place to deal with the many issues that will come
              under the commission’s management. There is good evidence of
              deterrents: continuous vigilance will be needed, and temporary
              staff are, in fact, being recruited to deal with this. I was
              reporting on the discussions we had on putting the arrangements in
              place. There has, of course, been a three-month gap. We had
              intended to have a meeting in May, but, unfortunately, we were
              unable to. We hope that that meeting will now take place at the

              Commission will avail of every opportunity to promote angling
              tourism on an all-Ireland basis? What proposals are there to
              encompass the activities of The Honourable The Irish Society,
              which controls fishing rights on other rivers in Northern Ireland?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Rodgers:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I can assure Mr&nbsp;Dallat that I want to see
              the Commission developing the tourist potential of angling and
              fishing in particular, on a North/South basis, and I have no doubt
              that it will proceed to do that.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Wells:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister thanked the hon Member for South
              Down, Mr&nbsp;ONeill, for his question — and very helpful it was
              too — but I can assure Members she will not be thanking me for
              my question. Will the Minister take it from me that many of the
              anglers who fish in the waters that flow into Carlingford Lough
              remain totally and implacably opposed to this whole process? They
              see this as artificial interference in the good management of
              Carlingford Lough, as was carried out by the Fisheries Conservancy
              Board, and they also see it as being done for pure political
              expediency.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many of the anglers feel very aggrieved that
              they now have to liaise with a body whose local office will
              probably be based in the Irish Republic and that they will have to
              buy two licences, one from the old Fisheries Conservancy Board,
              and one from this new body. This will do absolutely nothing to
              promote angling and fishing in Carlingford Lough, and there will
              not be one more fish left alive as a result of this vast
              expenditure.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Rodgers:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Member for his question, which is,
              indeed, very welcome. All questions are welcome; that is what I am
              here for. In relation to the licensing situation, the Fisheries
              Conservancy Board in Northern Ireland and the Eastern Fisheries
              Board in the Republic of Ireland operate as agents of the
              Commission in delivering services. Arrangements are in hand for
              the commission to begin delivering services itself as soon as
              possible. The commission has approved staffing and accommodation,
              and there are other proposals which await approval. The Commission
              will be taking over the ongoing work.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The staff of the Foyle, Carlingford and Irish
              Lights Commission have an effective track record in the protection
              of fisheries in the Foyle area as part of their role in the Foyle
              Fisheries Commission. I expect that they will continue to deal
              effectively with poaching in their extended areas of
              responsibility. In relation to licences, it is not true that
              people will have to pay for two. Those who have mistakenly bought
              a licence to fish in one or other area, will, if they write to the
              Commission, be given the right to fish in both areas.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the areas which come under — <i>[Interruption]</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They will be allowed to fish in both areas with
              whichever licence they have bought. There is no problem with that.
              When they want to fish in areas that come under the Fisheries
              Conservancy Board, they will be able to buy, at a very cheap rate,
              an endorsement of the licence they have, not two licences. The
              licence that they already have can also be endorsed at a very
              small fee, which is much less than the sum of the two fees added
              together.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Hay:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister said that there was no real
              difficulty for employees of Foyle Fisheries Commission to transfer
              to the Implementation Bodies. I know, from Foyle Fisheries
              Commission employees, that they have had great difficulty and
              could not understand why they were doing it. Following on from
              that, can the Minister guarantee that those people who have
              transferred their pension rights, employment rights — and every
              other accompanying right — will have those rights safeguarded?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My other question concerns the North/South
              Ministerial Council. My understanding is that Londonderry Port and
              Harbour Commissioners, who control a fair portion of the River
              Foyle and have a reasonable amount of activity on it, have not
              been consulted on any issue concerning the area they control. I
              hope, that when the Minister sets up the advisory committee about
              which she is now talking, the Londonderry Port and Harbour
              Commissioners are brought into the equation. She may rest assured
              they have a great deal to say concerning the whole issue of this
              advisory panel now being set up by the Minister. I wish to make it
              clear to her that Londonderry Port and Harbour Commissioners very
              much wish to be contacted by her concerning the whole issue of the
              area they control.</p>

              Commissioners. As I have already stated in response to an earlier
              question, employees of the Foyle Fisheries Commission will be
              guaranteed that there will be no detrimental impact on their
              employment, and their contractual rights will be transferred.</p>

              Members will recall there was a time limit of 10&nbsp;minutes in

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The purpose of the Memorandum is to set down
              principles which will underlie relations between the United
              Kingdom Government and the devolved institutions. As such, it is
              central to the way in which business will be conducted in each
              part of the United Kingdom. The Northern Ireland Assembly is part
              of the governance of the United Kingdom. It is our task to
              formulate and deliver public policy for which we have the
              responsibility in Northern Ireland, in line with the needs of the
              local electorate. However, we are also part of a bigger picture,
              and we need to take account of what is happening elsewhere in the
              United Kingdom.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr McClelland] in the
              Chair)</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This document is therefore designed to
              reconcile these two roles. It is not legally binding but it is a
              statement of political intent, binding in honour only. It reflects
              the post-devolution politics of co-operation, goodwill and a
              recognition of mutual responsibilities. Some may say that the
              document should be legally enforceable. However, trying to make
              the arrangements enforceable in law would not be in keeping with
              the spirit of co-operation, which is necessary for devolution to
              work. Such an approach would merely serve to indicate a breakdown
              of relations and a distrust in the goodwill of others to implement
              these proposals.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Memorandum was agreed between the United
              Kingdom Government, the Scottish Ministers and the Cabinet of the
              National Assembly of Wales on 1&nbsp;October&nbsp;1999. The
              Executive Committee has now considered the documents and agreed
              them with one addition, which I will come to shortly. It is useful
              to have a document setting out clearly and sensibly the ground
              rules for our relations with the United Kingdom Government and the
              other devolved Administrations in Scotland and Wales. I now
              propose to say a few brief words about each of the five documents
              in the Memorandum that is laid before the House today.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, the overall Memorandum of Understanding
              contains the main principles to be followed, and it deals with
              communication, consultation among Administrations, exchange of
              information and confidentiality, and the monitoring and management
              of the devolution settlements. It establishes a commitment by the
              Administrations to good and timely communication with each other,
              to co-operation on matters of mutual interest, and to the exchange
              of information on scientific, technical and policy issues. It also
              provides for the arrangements set out in the Memorandum to be
              reviewed and updated at least once each year.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, the agreement on the Joint
              Ministerial Committee sets out the terms of reference for that
              committee, and how it will operate. The committee brings together
              Ministers from each of the devolved Administrations and from the
              United Kingdom Government. It considers reserved matters that have
              an impact on the Executive Committee’s responsibilities, and in
              turn, devolved matters that have an impact on reserved matters.
              Plenary sessions, chaired by the Prime Minister, will be held at
              least once each year. The committee will monitor relations
              generally and will be able to address particular problems and
              issues that may arise. Already there is what could be called a
              small family of subject-specific Joint Ministerial Committees.
              They have been established, for example, on health, poverty and
              the knowledge economy. These committees have embarked on a useful
              programme of work. Indeed, it is interesting to note that today
              the First Minister and the Minister of Health, Social Services and
              Public Safety have been in London attending a meeting of the Joint
              Ministerial Committee on health.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thirdly, on the co-ordination of EU policy
              issues, the concordat sets out how EU business is to be handled,
              including the exchange of information, the formulation of a single
              UK policy line, attendance at EU councils and related meetings,
              implementation of EU obligations and infraction proceedings. The
              agreement recognises Northern Ireland’s distinctive position
              within the United Kingdom in terms of its relationship with
              another member state and therefore extends the terms of the
              concordat to cover the North/South Ministerial Council as well as
              the European Union dimension of the cross-border bodies. This is
              the additional aspect to which I referred earlier.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This EU concordat also sets out the United
              Kingdom Government’s intention that Ministers of the devolved
              Administrations should be fully involved in discussions about what
              could be calle the UK policy on issues falling within their areas
              of responsibility.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The status and functions of the UK’s
              permanent representation in Brussels are unchanged, and the
              devolved Administration will be able to take part in less formal
              discussions with EU institutions and interests within other member
              states. Northern Ireland has always had a strong interest in
              European affairs. The agreement will enable us to have our
              devolved status acknowledged and also retain the benefits of
              having the weight of the United&nbsp;Kingdom behind us on agreed
              policy positions.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.30 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fourthly, the arrangements proposed in the
              Financial Assistance to Industry agreement are consistent with the
              provisions in the Northern&nbsp;Ireland Act 1998 and aim to
              balance fairness and value for money with the need to negotiate
              flexibly and effectively. The aim of this concordat is to resolve
              the difficulties that arise from competing UK agencies bidding
              against each other for large mobile investment projects. The
              arrangements give the commitment that Northern&nbsp;Ireland
              Ministers and their officials will be fully involved in
              discussions on United&nbsp;Kingdom policy in this area.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fifthly, the International Relations concordat
              covers the formulation of UK policy on implementation and conduct
              of international relations, co-operation over legal proceedings,
              representation overseas, visits, public diplomacy, trade and
              investment promotion, and finally diplomatic and consular
              relations. It makes clear the Executive Committee’s
              responsibilities for implementing international obligations on the
              UK which relate to its devolved responsibilities, and also the
              arrangements for the Executive to play its part in the conduct of
              international relations. It reflects a mutual determination to
              ensure close co-operation in these areas between the United
              Kingdom Government and the Executive Committee Ministers in
              Northern&nbsp;Ireland, with the objective of promoting the
              overseas interests of the United Kingdom and all its constituent
              parts.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sixth, and finally, for the statistics
              concordat, it is sensible that each Administration has the
              comparative information it needs. The agreement will help ensure
              that such information continues to be available at
              Northern&nbsp;Ireland and UK levels. The concordat sets out an
              agreed framework for co-operation between the United Kingdom
              Government and the devolved Administrations on all matters in
              relation to statistics. I would like to add that the
              Northern&nbsp;Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA) was
              involved from the outset in its preparation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have spoken briefly about what these
              documents are. They are a first attempt to set out a basis for a
              working relationship in this new era of devolution within the
              United Kingdom. More detailed provisions relating to individual
              policy areas will follow in bilateral concordats to be drawn up
              between individual Departments of the United Kingdom Government
              and their devolved counterparts. As a first attempt, therefore, I
              think these documents are both comprehensive and comprehensible.
              Provision has been made for the concordats to evolve and be
              developed in the light of experience. They are merely working
              documents and part of the machinery that potentially will allow
              the Executive Committee to work well with the rest of the United
              Kingdom. As I said at the outset, Scotland and Wales have already
              considered and agreed their respective documents and are already
              putting the principles into practice.</p>

              Understanding and Supplementary Agreements between Her Majesty’s
              Government and the Northern&nbsp;Ireland Executive Committee until

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On Thursday, these documents were delivered to
              our pigeon-holes, and today we are expected to rubber-stamp
              something of deep significance. It is all right for Mr Nesbitt to
              tell us that these are not legally binding. This is a statement of
              political intent, and that is just as binding as a legal document.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The problem is that we have an Executive that
              has run wild taking powers to itself, and whether those powers are
              legal or whether we are just talking about political intent, they
              lay hold of them, as has been seen by the action of two of the
              Ministers, the First and Deputy First Ministers, who threatened
              two of my Colleagues with a grand inquisition chamber today. I am
              glad that my two Friends said no.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is very interesting that they did not summon
              the two IRA/Sinn Féin Ministers who saw to it that no Union flag
              flew, in keeping with the present status of the law, on their
              buildings on Friday. I even understand that no flag could fly over
              the office of the Secretary of State, because that property too is
              under the control of the Minister of Health.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I find it highly reprehensible that the First
              and Deputy First Ministers quoted newspaper reports without naming
              the newspapers and said that, because of those newspaper reports,
              they were summoning my Colleagues to attend a meeting. When
              Members of the Executive think that they have the power to summon
              Members — <i>[Interruption]</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What did he say?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is quite parliamentary, I assure you. The
              Clerk could not show you anything in the book that says that
              calling a man deaf and dumb is either unscriptural or out of
              keeping with the laws of this particular place.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am seeking to illustrate how power has been
              seized by people who are drunk on it — they are not going in
              accordance with legality.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have a new word here, and I congratulate the
              ecumenist who introduced it. He has got into religious language
              for the first time. This is a concordat.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is interesting to know the history of such
              concordats. I went into the Library, and consulted our brilliant
              Librarian friend, Mr George Woodman, who is good to us all and
              treats us all with great respect. I must say that I respect him
              for his wisdom and for his love of books. He found for me the
              meaning of &quot;concordat&quot;.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A concordat is an agreement, a compact, between
              the Vatican and secular government on matters of mutual interest.
              I laughed when I saw that. I wondered why his Leader had been away
              to the Vatican early on in this Assembly to see Papa himself, and
              I wondered why the Deputy Leader on the other side was also away
              visiting the Pope — but things are coming out in the wash. The
              word &quot;Papa&quot; is Italian for &quot;Pope&quot; — in case
              this dear man gets excited.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At least they have this ecclesiastical
              language. A famous concordat was signed in the 1920s between the
              fascist Mussolini and the Vatican. We are in good company. The
              name they have used to describe this particular document is most
              interesting.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are many things I could say today, but I
              am a parliamentarian and there are others who want to take part. I
              could speak for two hours on this subject, and rightly so, and you
              could do nothing about it, Mr Speaker. I am not going to do that.
              I will allow time for capable people to serve their own interests.
              This concordat on co-ordination of European Union policies on
              Northern Ireland is the most one-sided document I ever set eyes
              on. For the information of Mr&nbsp;Nesbitt, there are three parts
              to Europe. Only one part is emphasised in this document: the
              Council, which consists of all the member states’ Ministers on
              the relevant subject. There are also the Commission and the
              Parliament. This document says nothing whatsoever about the
              European Parliament. It ignores the fact that the leader of the
              SDLP is a member of the European Parliament. It ignores the fact
              that Mr Nesbitt’s own party has a representative in that
              Parliament, and it ignores the bitter fact that in the last five
              European elections I have beaten them all, and I am still in
              Europe.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What mighty benefit did this country ever get
              from Europe? Even our enemies would cite the peace and
              reconciliation money. Who got that? The three MEPs got it, but
              they are now to be ignored. There is no place for them in this
              document. Why is that? Love of greed for power. Little birds fly
              through the windows where the Executive meets, and then they fly
              to me and tell me what is happening. They tell me of great
              discussions, held secretly and with laughter. &quot;We can put a
              spoke in Ian Paisley’s wheel in Europe&quot; they say, &quot;We
              will set up our own office, financed by the people of Northern
              Ireland, and use it for party political ends to forward our own
              selfish interests, and we will not need to consult the MEPs. We
              might whisper a few little things in John Hume’s ear to keep him
              sweet and happy, but the others, especially Ian Paisley, will not
              know.&quot; If that is the way they want to play it, let them. It
              is an outrage to the people of Northern Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This House knows that all the vital decisions
              for the agriculture industry are made in Europe. They are not made
              by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food or by the
              Department of Agriculture and Rural Development. If we are going
              to get agriculture out of its present mess and bankruptcy, we need
              a regional policy for Northern Ireland in Europe that is different
              from any policy for Scotland, Wales or England. We have different
              needs, which must be met. Now there is talk of unity, of a single
              common policy.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That happened with the present Minister of
              Agriculture. I regret that she is not in the House today. She went
              to Europe with the Fisheries Minister and came home telling us
              that she had got the best of a bargain, yet 15% of our cod
              industry disappeared. Why? Because she was part of one
              presentation. We need to have the power, and the right, to make a
              presentation on a regional basis.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other European countries that have devolved
              government such as Germany have catered for their areas and the
              needs of those areas, even though they are different from the
              national needs. In fact, when they suffered from swine fever,
              special legislation was passed in Europe to exempt parts of
              Germany, the national territory, from those regulations. We have a
              set-up here in which we are all going to be one, and the Executive
              thinks that this is how it is going to get anything better for
              Northern&nbsp;Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have sat in Parliament and heard fierce
              criticism of the peace and reconciliation money. I have heard
              English Members of the House crying out &quot;Why do we not get
              this? Why is it not for us?&quot; It was given by M Delors of whom
              I was never a fan, but at least he realised, because of the
              pressure that we were putting on him, that people who had suffered
              tragedy in the past should be tended to, and their needs attended
              to, by places that got vast amounts of money from Europe. We won
              that argument, and we got that money.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need time to consider this document. We need
              to get provision into it to enable every representative, whether
              in Europe, in the United Kingdom Parliament or here, to get his
              voice heard on this.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Various Assemblies and Conventions have met in
              this House — I have sat in them all. There were only two that I
              was delighted to sit in, and they were the two that my dear wife
              was a Member of. It was always a delight to come up and be with
              her in this House, because I do not see as much of her as I would
              like. Even when it was only a consultative body with no power, we
              were able to get the Commissioner to our Committee meetings. The
              Commissioners are now asking why. The reason is that the Executive
              does not want them to come to Committee meetings here.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Why should the Commissioner for Fisheries not
              attend the Agriculture Committee of the House? Why should the men
              who are responsible for industry not attend the appropriate
              Committee of the House? The way to get into Europe is to bring
              these men here, let them see the country and get them to our
              Committees where they can hear from the representatives who are on
              those Committees. That has all been swept away; there is not a
              word about that — not even a consideration or a mention.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are told that this is a consideration
              document and that it is easy to understand. I understand what they
              are doing, and the people of Northern&nbsp;Ireland will understand
              it. I have marked certain things in this document, and I could go
              over them. However, it seems that the Executive is intent on
              driving this through today. We got it on Thursday, and we have to
              come here today and make these decisions.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These decisions, although they are not legal,
              are the policy under which the Executive is going to work. They
              are going to have sad effects upon our economy, our fisheries, our
              agriculture, our health and social services and all other matters
              that have now very much become part of Europe. I wonder how all
              these supposed good Europeans that I have heard are in the
              Assembly think that the European dimension can be dismissed. Three
              representatives are needed. In fact, we were done out of the
              number we needed. Compared with the South of Ireland, we should
              have at least five or seven members in Europe. We were done out of
              that. In fact, at the beginning they only wanted us to have two
              members.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Official Unionist Party said that only two
              should go to Europe. It thought that they would both be Official
              Unionists, and was glad there were three, because it discovered
              that its man was always the third to be elected. That is why that
              was changed. However, we should have five representatives in
              Europe, and we should not be diminishing their value. Members in
              this House may not like me. I do not care a fig — I will sleep
              well tonight and wake in the morning and have my porridge as
              usual.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members in this House are saying to their MEPs
              &quot;We are finished with you now. You have had your say; you got
              the money and we have spent it. Now, as there is no more peace and
              reconciliation money coming, we can dispense with you.&quot; I
              must tell the rest of my story. They said &quot;We will set up
              this wonderful office.&quot; I have heard of offices being set up
              before in Europe. They did a mighty lot of good!</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The poor businessmen who went over were highly
              charged for what I, a Ballymena man, could have offered them for
              nothing. I said to a man &quot;What did they charge you?&quot;
              &quot;Well,&quot; he said, &quot;it was a large sum of
              money&quot;. I asked &quot;What for?&quot; &quot;To take us
              round&quot;. Any goat could surely take a person round that place.
              It is desperate what that office did. Then it tried to get all the
              parties to be members of it. It actually put on the names of two
              of my Colleagues. I wrote to tell it that the Democratic Unionist
              Party was not in the office and to take the names off. I had a
              terrible job getting it to take my Colleagues’ names off the
              notepaper. It insisted that it was a broad church, taking in
              everybody. That is a church of which I do not want to be a member.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now another office is going to be set up.
              Perhaps Mr Nesbitt, seeing that he knows all about this, has
              defended it, and is its chief apologist, could tell Members some
              things about this office that is going to be set up. Where will it
              be located? How much money is being set aside for it? There is not
              a word about that. It is just passed over without any detail. How
              many people are going to work in it? Who is going to supervise it?
              Is the hon Gentleman going to have a continual junket to Brussels,
              Strasbourg or Luxembourg?</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He is saying &quot;Good&quot;. I thought that
              he, as a friend of Sir Reg Empey, would not like any perks.
              However, he did not get on as many quangos as Sir Reg, and so he
              was unhappy. Let us talk about this office. Where is it going to
              be? How many members are there going to be? What standing and
              influence is it going to have? Who is it going to sway? Does he
              think that the representatives he sends, civil servants, will be
              able to do for him what public representatives find great
              difficulty in doing — getting through to the heart of Europe and
              getting what we deserve from it? Everyone should remember that,
              per head of population, we have never got out of Europe the tax
              money we have put into it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is not my statement; that is the statement
              of the British Exchequer. Let us get down to what is going to be
              beneficial.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So as far as I can see, these concordats are
              about strengthening the hold of the Executive, and strengthening
              the hold of the First and Deputy First Ministers on the levers of
              government. Well, if people want them to strengthen their hold,
              let them. But what about Northern Ireland’s key industry,
              agriculture? We cannot have the same laws as the rest of the UK.
              Our system of agriculture is different. It grew out of a land war,
              out of people who owned everything and had to let go. Some of the
              great contenders among the leaders of Northern Ireland were men
              eminent in the Presbyterian Church in Ireland who fought the
              tenants’ rights for the Ulster Protestant farmers. There were
              tenant rights fought for the Roman Catholic people as well. Our
              farming system is different. Our people are not tenant farmers.
              Their farms are smaller than those in England. It is a different
              type of farming. What does for the farmers of England does not do
              for our farmers.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us look at what happened in the BSE crisis.
              The Baroness was Minister at the time. Some of the farmers
              worshipped her. They always said &quot;We had a lovely meeting
              with the Baroness&quot;, but I found her absolutely barren as far
              as farmers’ needs were concerned. The farmers decided to hold a
              great rally at the King’s Hall, and I was asked to go along and
              say a few words.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was not highly critical of anybody, but a man
              from the Agricultural Producers’ Association was. However, the
              Baroness thought that it was I. Now, I could have said
              &quot;Amen&quot; to what he had said, but I did not. She got
              furious with me, and when we went in to see the Prime Minister she
              said &quot;How dare you say what you said?&quot; I asked what she
              meant, and she repeated what this spokesman from the Agricultural
              Producers’ Association had said. I told her that I had not said
              it but that I agreed with it. I said &quot;When you were in Tokyo
              you said Ulster farmers will be treated the same as farmers in the
              rest of the United Kingdom.&quot; We did not have a BSE crisis. In
              fact, there is a bigger BSE crisis in the Irish Republic today
              than we have here in Northern&nbsp;Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is because of what happened back then that
              we have a crisis in our industry today. Eventually the British
              Government had to admit that we were different after
              John&nbsp;Hume, Jim&nbsp;Nicholson and Ian&nbsp;Paisley met the
              authorities in Brussels and insisted they would not take no for an
              answer. They agreed that we were different and that they were
              prepared to make some slight move, but we are not out of that yet.
              What would happen if everyone agreed there was no such thing as a
              special place for Ulster’s agriculture, not because we are
              Cinderellas, but simply because it is our right? Would the
              Minister come back and tell us that another 15% of an industry has
              gone simply because we have had this concordat, and they have had
              one vital matter considered and agreed?</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.00 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The British Government also tell us that they
              will know what is happening, that they will start early. I defy
              them to tell me what is happening in Europe — for Europe does
              not know what is happening. There is more business brought to the
              House in speed in Europe than anywhere else. And there is special
              legislation whereby the Commissioners can get a thing through the
              House in a gallop. To say that there is going to be a way whereby
              we will all know what is coming and will have weeks of discussions
              and be able to be in on the bottom floor is an amazing statement.
              For even those in the various Commissions do not know where the
              bottom floor starts in some of those proposals, and they certainly
              do not know where it ends.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Overall, the United Kingdom representative will
              be the Office who will approach the European biggies. It will not
              be public representatives doing the approaching, he will. I always
              thought that the Parliament was a place for lobby, but, evidently,
              now it will be a place where lobbying will be ineffective because
              the Commissioner can say &quot;We have a concordat. We have agreed
              with your representative that this is what you are getting.&quot;
              And if the representatives from the Executive in Ulster say
              &quot;This is the way&quot;, then they can say &quot;We do not
              want to listen to you.&quot;</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So here we have something that we need to take
              care of. I have spoken too long already, but it needed to be said.
              I have no apology for what I have said. I say to the
              representatives &quot;What skin is it off your face to take this
              back for at least a week, or for two weeks, so that the parties in
              the House can all have a look at it and then come back and say
              where they differ and have a proper debate on it?&quot;</p>

              been put to me, we can have a timescale — a reasonable timescale
              — and we must have an opportunity to put down amendments to
              various things that the Executive wants to carry through. That
              would be reasonable. Let it go back to the parties, for there is
              no use in taking it back to the Committees, because they are
              divided. Let them go back to the parties and let the parties then
              come. But I would be happy to go to the various Committees if that

              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Neeson:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are a number of issues that need
              clarified on what is being proposed. I do not necessarily agree
              wholeheartedly with Dr Paisley, because in many ways what is being
              put forward strengthens devolution, but there are concerns. For
              example, does the Pledge of Office undertaken by individual
              Ministers oblige them to fulfil the understandings reached within
              these concordats? On the question of the memorandum of
              understanding, what measures are envisaged for general
              consultation with the Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly —
              rather than the Secretary of State — on non-devolved matters in
              which the people of Northern Ireland have a particular interest?
              One example, from the Scottish Parliament, is that Jack Straw has
              allowed the entry into the United Kingdom of Mike Tyson, a
              convicted rapist.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The event will take place in Scotland, and the
              Scottish Parliament has spoken out against his being allowed into
              the country. I see a serious conflict of interest arising in that
              situation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with what Dr&nbsp;Paisley said in
              relation to the concordat on co-ordination of European Union
              policy issues as they relate to Northern Ireland. I quote directly
              from the document, underlining the case that has already been
              made:</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The role of Ministers and officials from
              the devolved administrations will be to support and advance the
              single UK negotiating line which they have played a part in
              developing.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The case of the BSE crisis is crucial in
              showing the fallacy of going forward with a single UK policy.
              Devolution is there to reflect the interests of the individual
              regions of the United Kingdom.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What plans do the First Minister and Deputy
              First Minister have to bring European legislation to the attention
              of the Assembly, and to ascertain the views of Members?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One other issue that greatly troubles me is in
              the concordat on financial assistance to industry. All the regions
              of the United Kingdom are in competition. A few years ago, the
              textile company Hualon wanted to establish a large factory at
              Mallusk. However, due to the delay resulting from the intervention
              of another UK region that opposed the grant assistance which was
              being proposed for Hualon, Northern Ireland lost the opportunity
              of a major investment.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to financial assistance to
              shipbuilding, the Government are abiding strictly by the European
              legislation — other regions of Europe are not.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are a number of issues that need to be
              clarified in relation to the document, and I ask the First
              Minister and Deputy First Minister to seriously reconsider pushing
              this through the House today. Let us have some further
              consultation on it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I recognise the need for these concordats to
              develop the necessary linkages, and I appreciate Mr&nbsp;Nesbitt’s
              point that they will be reviewed annually. However, I ask for more
              time for the Assembly to consider a meaningful input.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Birnie:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should be grateful for the speech from the
              leader of the Democratic Unionist Party — not so much because it
              was a good example of Unionism, but because it was a good example
              of an exposition for Ulster Nationalism. The memorandum of
              understanding has been in public circulation since October 1999 in
              its Scottish and Welsh form — the Northern Ireland version
              differs slightly. A careful reading suggests that the arrangements
              are not about strengthening the prerogatives of our Executive, but
              are about a series of working arrangements aimed at trying to give
              coherence to the United Kingdom in an era of devolution. I would
              have thought that the Democratic Unionist Party would be in favour
              of maintaining the United Kingdom.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With respect to the amendment proposed by the
              DUP, if it wished to have more consideration of these provisions,
              its two Ministers could have been present at the meeting of the
              Executive last Thursday.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They need not have relied on little birds
              flying in and out to relay messages from the Executive Chamber.
              The amendment would negate the motion entirely if passed, so we do
              have to be somewhat unclear as to whether its intention or indeed
              its consequence suggests that it is truly an amendment indeed.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the leader of the Alliance Party has already
              pointed out, there is currently a dispute between the Scottish
              Parliament and the Home Secretary in London, Jack&nbsp;Straw, over
              his decision. The dispute relates to who should actually control
              immigration policy for Scotland and, more specifically, whether
              Mike&nbsp;Tyson should go to Glasgow to fight. Perhaps he should
              come to Stormont instead. I use that example because it
              illustrates that what we are talking about today is not a piece of
              constitutional arcanery; it is not simply about changing the
              constitutional furniture in a way which will have no impact on the
              lives of ordinary people. The relationship between decisions at
              different layers of government within the United Kingdom affects
              everybody. The intense public interest in Scotland in the Tyson
              decision is indicative of that point.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the publication of these concordats.
              The whole structure of memorandum of understanding plus concordats
              is to serve, as one academic observer, Prof&nbsp;Robert&nbsp;Hazell
              of the Constitution Unit in London, has put it, as a sort of
              gearbox within the rapidly changing post-devolution structure of
              government within the United Kingdom.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The idea of the memorandum of understanding, I
              think, first emerged back in July&nbsp;1998 when Lady&nbsp;Ramsey
              was speaking in the House of Lords on the subject of Scottish
              devolution. But now the memorandum of understanding and the
              associated concordats are out in the open, and I trust that none
              of these mechanisms is designed to smother devolution at birth.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now it has sometimes been feared, particularly
              by the SNP — and in a curious way it would seem that the DUP
              adopts a position somewhat similar to that of the SNP on these
              issues — it was feared, and perhaps still is feared by Scottish
              Nationalists, that the joint Ministerial Committees are some sort
              of device to discipline the devolved Administrations so that they
              toe the London line on policy issues. But I think that they offer
              the potential for those Administrations, including our own, to
              have a greater input into the formation of central United Kingdom
              Government policy. I welcome the Chancellor of the Exchequer’s
              initiative in December of last year when he established JMC
              steering groups, and I understand that one is meeting today to
              bring together the various United Kingdom Administrations on
              topics such as child poverty, pensions and the digital age
              economy.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Chancellor Gordon Brown said that the purpose

              said by other Members who have spoken, because advice which I have
              received from experts in Germany based on their experience. Each
              of the 16 German provinces — or Länder — has on occasions
              attempted to pursue a separate position, be it on agriculture or
              industry, in Brussels. The result has been detrimental to the
              Federal Republic of Germany’s overall bargaining position in the
              Council of Ministers.</p>

              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The implication, I believe, is that in the long
              run we in Northern Ireland are better off with a common single
              United Kingdom position. This should, of course, be drawn up with
              input from the Northern Ireland Executive and, rightly, there is
              provision for that in the concordats. I also welcome the provision
              for and emphasis on monitoring industrial policy. The chief
              benefit here is the avoidance of expensive bidding wars between
              the various regions of the UK which would simply work to the
              benefit of a small number of global multinationals, by enabling
              them to move back and forth between regions where, they claim,
              they might set up a factory and to squeeze more and more
              Government grants out of long-suffering taxpayers. The concordat
              sets up a mechanism which will, hopefully prevent such bidding
              wars and hence achieve better value for money on behalf of the
              taxpayer.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In general these concordats follow the template
              already established last October in Command Paper 4444 relating to
              Scotland and Wales, though it is worth noting there are a few
              details relating to our own particular position — space is
              provided, formally speaking, for the operation of both the
              British-Irish Council and the North/South Ministerial Council.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To conclude, I welcome this take-note motion
              from the First and Deputy First Ministers. These arrangements are,
              as the junior Minister noted, not legally binding, but they are
              part of the evolution of the UK Constitution and, just as that
              Constitution has in previous centuries successfully adapted to
              earlier challenges, I have no doubt that it can do so again in
              this era of devolution.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I too took a great deal of time to go through
              these documents, and I have come to the conclusion that a great
              deal more clarification is needed, certainly on essential issues.
              If I may I would like to go through each of the memoranda and
              point out issues where certain clarification is needed. I will
              begin with the specific Memorandum of Understanding — and this
              is a simple point but one which perhaps lies outside our
              jurisdiction — but there are many references to four
              Administrations. Obviously, there is one in Northern Ireland, one
              in Scotland, one in Wales and one in the UK. I do not understand
              how the role of the UK Ministers, acting on behalf of England as
              well as of the UK, fits in here. A great deal more clarity is
              needed in order to understand England’s position in this
              newly-devolved situation and how UK Ministers, acting on behalf of
              non-devolved issues UK-wide, can also act on behalf of English
              issues.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I go on to what is, perhaps, a less contentious
              but equally important point about the rules on financial
              assistance to industry. The document states</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Separate but comparable arrangements

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are common guidelines for industry. All
              parties to this concordat commit to mutual consultation in
              adequate detail and to a reasonable timescale where any party
              proposes to change its policy and practice. This is vitally
              important and could be very valuable to this devolved Government
              in Northern Ireland. For example, there is a consideration that we
              could, perhaps, change our support to industry and reduce our
              corporate tax rates, similar to the situation in the south of
              Ireland. When this was proposed in the past, the answer from
              London was always &quot;Oh no. We must stick to the UK-wide
              line.&quot; I am assuming that, within this concordat on financial
              assistance to industry, we have the right to change policy as long
              as we consult in time. It would be valuable to clarify that we
              have that right.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Next, I wish to make a general point concerning
              statistics. I do not know whether Members notice this, but often
              Northern Ireland does not appear when UK-wide statistics are
              issued. Perhaps this occurs simply because television news leaves
              Northern Ireland out, but it definitely does not appear on UK-wide
              statistics adequately enough. Perhaps we could make sure we insist
              that Northern Ireland always appears on UK-wide statistics.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My final point, the most detailed of all,
              concerns the European Union. Both Dr&nbsp;Paisley and Mr Neeson
              have mentioned our need always to share the UK line. The point
              that has been made that the BSE crisis exemplifies the problem
              where a solid, standard UK line is not appropriate in Brussels. I
              would also refer to parts of these concordats concerning the
              North/South Ministerial Council and the Special EU Programmes
              Body, and the fact that agreement will be reached at a North/South
              level on certain European issues. I want to know how agreement at
              that North/South level can be transferred into UK-wide agreement
              to adhere to a common line. There is no clarity on this issue. It
              has certainly not been thought through enough, and the UK-line
              argument must take much more account of the specific needs and
              demands of Northern Ireland as a distinct and special region
              within the UK.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On issues such as representation, I tend to
              agree with Dr Paisley when he speaks of the value of the role of
              European Parliament Members, for example. I am surprised that this
              document does not refer to Members of the European Parliament and
              their role in lobbying at European level. The question of
              representation does not in fact simply mean representation in
              Brussels, and I would be very interested in asking the junior
              Minister a question. I noticed a reference to representation
              overseas in the concordat on international relations:</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The devolved administrations may
              establish offices overseas within the framework of their
              responsibility for devolved matters (including for the provision
              of information on devolved matters to the public, regional
              governments and institutions, and promotion of trade and inward
              investment).&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would be fascinated to know what consuls,
              embassies or offices we intend to set up in Africa, Asia, Latin
              America or Eastern Europe. A great deal more information would be
              useful on these issues. I agree that these documents are
              important, and Members of this House would appreciate more time to
              understand their exact implications and the Executive’s exact
              intentions when we sign up to or at least take note of them.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Leslie:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to add three or four observations
              to the comments already made by my Colleagues. In doing so, I want
              to focus on the fact that this memorandum, whilst not binding, is
              a statement of political intent. Political intent can always be
              changed by events, and there is plenty of scope in the wording of
              these memoranda for the devolved territories to probe the
              boundaries that have been set out. It does not say so in the
              document, but it is fairly obvious to me that it should be in the
              interests of the devolved territories to work together to find
              common interests. They may be remarkably effective in doing so.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It remains to be seen how that evolves in
              practice and it is, perhaps, the fear of this that has set the
              whole tone, certainly of the Memorandum of Understanding itself,
              to be quite schoolmasterly in the way that it continually
              reasserts the power and sovereignty of the United Kingdom
              Parliament to, in its own words, retain &quot;the absolute right
              to debate, enquire into or make representations about devolved
              matters&quot;.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is a pity that Assembly Member&nbsp;Roche is
              not here because he always seems to be rather confused about
              sovereignty. He would undoubtedly find it helpful to read these
              documents, as they seem to be very specific on this point.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will not go into the points that have already
              been made on the European Union, but I noted rather fierce wording
              about the differences of approach in implementing EU regulations.
              It is apparent that across Europe there is a very considerable
              difference of approach towards the implementation of regulations.
              Some European countries are very much more expert in this matter
              than others. I was struck by the emphasis, which occurred several
              times in the document, on the importance of having, effectively, a
              common approach and that Whitehall intended to have a close
              scrutiny role in this.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Furthermore, any devolved territory deviating
              from the central path would face any financial consequences that
              might accrue. I suggest that when the time comes, this Assembly
              should, perhaps, be bold in some of these matters, and it would be
              interesting to discuss with the other devolved territories what
              approach they intend to take. This will become particularly
              apparent when we come to matters where there are marked
              differences of emphasis between what is important in England and
              what might be important in Scotland or Northern Ireland. The last
              thing that we should do at this stage is clarify these matters too
              closely. It would be much better if that were left to emerge over
              time.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My final comment relates to the concordat on
              international relations. I was particularly struck by
              paragraph&nbsp;22, which pointed out that &quot;the World Service
              aims to bring benefit to the United Kingdom and all its
              constituent parts by broadcasting authoritative and impartial news
              and information&quot;. I wish that I felt confident that it did. I
              note that the devolved Administrations were invited to maintain
              direct links with the BBC World Service on matters of mutual
              interest. I very much hope that this Administration will attend to
              a matter of mutual interest by ensuring that its broadcasting is
              both authoritative and impartial. I commend this motion to the
              House.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Paisley Jnr:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker, you have had to endure your
              time in the Chair today. You are probably not enjoying it after
              listening to Mr&nbsp;Nesbitt’s death-inspiring speech and some
              of the other contributions. Indeed, I noted some of Mr&nbsp;Birnie’s
              comments were akin to being ravaged by a dead worm. The Assembly
              and my party appreciate the fact that the Alliance Party and the
              Northern Ireland Women’s Coalition have found merit in the
              proposal and the amendment that my party has brought forward. I
              hope that they will join us in the Lobby, if it comes to that,
              during the course of today’s sitting.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.30 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The real purpose of bringing forward this
              amendment is to secure for this Assembly what it deserves: full
              and proper consultation on what are indeed important matters. The
              question before the House is essentially that of whose interests
              come first. Is it the interests of this Assembly, acting for the
              people of Northern Ireland, or, as Mr Leslie said, are we to throw
              our trust in with a joint interest over which we do not have the
              same influence as in this place? Indeed, Mr Leslie has just asked
              the Assembly not to seek clarification, but the purpose of this
              House is to secure clarification so it can act, it is to be hoped,
              in the best interests of the people we represent. It is absolutely
              essential that we have clarification in order to move forward.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I should like to deal with some of the specific
              points raised. One in particular caught my attention: the issue of
              communication and consultation. That is exactly what we seek
              today, proper communication and proper consultation. This document
              outlines that on those two issues a certain set of procedures has
              to be followed. First of all, the Assemblies and the Ministers
              must alert each other as soon as possible to relevant developments
              within their areas of responsibility, preferably prior to
              publication. There is no established code of conduct as to how the
              Assemblies and the Ministers should alert each other. Is it by
              telephone call from Departmental Private Secretary to Departmental
              Private Secretary? Is it by letter or document? Is it by despatch
              between Departments or from the Minister? That point needs to be
              clarified.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It goes on to say that they must give
              appropriate consideration to the views of other administrations.
              We want to know what standard has been set for appropriate
              consideration. It is absolutely essential that we can at least
              assume that it will be higher than the consultation in this
              Assembly. Before Christmas we had the nonsense of the First
              Minister running off to Downing Street without even consulting his
              Agriculture Minister, and informing the Prime&nbsp;Minister about
              policy matters to do with agriculture. That was within the
              framework of this Assembly. Can we at least assume that
              consultation and appropriate consideration of people’s views
              will actually occur, despite the previous standard of this House?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;Nesbitt is asking us to rubber-stamp a
              very unclear document. Indeed, if the issue of confidentiality —
              absolutely critical in some of the policies the memorandum deals
              with and will deal with — were to go through in its current
              form, we are told a code of practice would be established
              regarding access to Government information or that of equivalent
              devolved regimes, and, in due course, the requirements of future
              freedom-of-information regimes. Yet nowhere in these documents
              have we seen an outline code of practice. It is critical that the
              Assembly should at least be shown the code of practice so we can
              make a decision based not on trust — as some people would have
              us do — not on blind faith, but on the actual documents put
              before us. Without seeing that code of practice, this Assembly
              would be extremely foolish to endorse this Memorandum of
              Understanding. The junior Minister, instead of coming to this
              Assembly and asking us to rubber-stamp something incomplete, would
              be far better going back to his desk and completing the job he was
              given to do by his mentor, the First Minister. Perhaps if he came
              back with a better document, the Assembly would be pleased to lend
              it its full support. At the moment it is very difficult for him to
              ask for and, indeed, expect the full support and confidence of the
              House on this matter.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Parliamentary business, which appears on the
              memorandum, again shows some woolly-headed thinking by the junior
              Minister. He says in paragraph 14</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The United Kingdom Parliament retains
              absolute right to debate, enquire into, or make representations
              about devolved matters.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fine and true. That covers the issue of
              sovereignty, and I have no question about that not even later in
              the document. But two sentences later in the same paragraph he
              says that Parliament itself will in future be more restricted. But
              what is it? Does Parliament have an absolute right or does it have
              a restricted right? There seems to be uncertainty, so both points
              are put in. What role Parliament at Westminster will have with
              regard to the activities of the Assembly must be spelt out
              clearly. In the past — and we all know our history — people
              said that the old Parliament fell because certain issues could not
              be raised at Westminster. But what side of the debate is the
              Ulster Unionist Party on? What side of the debate are the First
              Minister and the Deputy First Minister on in this issue? Do they
              want Parliament to retain its absolute right to inquire and to
              debate without restriction, or do they want to see Parliament’s
              right to debate and inquire into events in the Assembly
              restricted?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is essential that the junior Minister
              confirm this matter to the House, because it is not exactly spelt
              out clearly here. Perhaps if it were spelt out in very clear and
              precise terms, Sinn&nbsp;Féin and the SDLP would not support the
              memorandum. But the junior Minister should confirm that, if any
              future Westminster Parliament so determined, it could repeal the
              Northern&nbsp;Ireland Act 1998 without reference to the people of
              Northern&nbsp;Ireland and irrespective of referenda or whatever.
              That point was glossed over very quickly, but it should be spelt
              out and verified to the House.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In moving the amendment, my party leader
              mentioned the role of the MEPs, who are not, as far as I can
              determine, asking for special privileges. However, they are asking
              for one thing, and that is to be consulted about issues upon
              which, and this is clear, the three of them have a particular
              expertise. It ill behoves this Chamber, as it would ill behove the
              Administration, to ignore that expertise which has achieved,
              against the odds, tens of millions of pounds for
              Northern&nbsp;Ireland, for community and infrastructure projects,
              which for years were denied to us. All we are seeking is proper
              consultation, nothing else, just proper consultation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, unfortunately these concordats,
              especially the one on the European Union, actually wipe out that
              consultation altogether. The one on the European Union actually
              establishes that the Republic of Ireland has a greater influence
              on, say in and right to be consulted on Northern&nbsp;Ireland via
              the North/South Council than have Unionists or Nationalists
              directly elected in Northern&nbsp;Ireland itself. That should
              concern everyone in the House, no matter what his political
              baggage. Unionists in particular should be alarmed that if this
              goes through in its current form it will give Nationalists a
              greater say because Unionists are outnumbered on the North/South
              Ministerial Council.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The junior Minister is asking us, in the words
              of James&nbsp;Leslie, to trust and throw our lot in entirely with
              the United Kingdom representative. However, the
              United&nbsp;Kingdom representative does not always have the rights
              and interests of the people of Northern&nbsp;Ireland at heart. One
              would like to think that the United Kingdom representative, when
              he or she establishes the negotiating position for the United
              Kingdom, would be prepared to take on board the interests of
              Northern Ireland. But that is not always possible and it is rarely
              achieved. Usually the greater interests of England, and sometimes
              Wales, are achieved by the United Kingdom representative rather
              than the interests of all the regions. It is foolish for the First
              Minister, the Deputy First Minister and the junior Minister to ask
              us to sign a blank cheque for the United Kingdom representative on
              behalf of the Assembly and to let him expect, at any time, the
              full support of the Assembly on these important matters.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Neeson and Ms Morrice raised the issue of
              investment, and their points were very well made with regard to
              financial assistance to industry. Indeed, if the procedures
              established under these terms and conditions had been followed, an
              industry in my constituency — one of the largest employers —would
              today be closed.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It would have considerably slowed down the
              rights of a company to determine where it should best be situated.
              Unfortunately, I do not believe that good business practice would
              be possible under paragraph 7 of the concordat on financial
              assistance to industry. That is not the way business is done in
              the modern world. It would preclude many businesses from operating
              effectively and from making arrangements in regions of the United
              Kingdom. Why should Northern Ireland have to wait before making
              offers to companies to locate or relocate here? We should not have
              to wait for another region to come up with a better offer, or
              until the prospective jobs go to a different member of the
              European Union. It would be better for Northern Ireland to strike
              while the iron is hot.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is essential that the House, after
              considering the importance of what is before it, votes for my
              party’s amendment. This amendment will allow all parties to have
              greater consultation and consideration on these important matters
              before they are rubber-stamped. The junior Minister should return
              to his desk and put together a more substantial paper that we can
              support.</p>

              However, I reiterate that my party will be opposing the amendment,
              because we believe it to be disingenuous. The DUP did, as has been
              pointed out, have an opportunity to engage in full and meaningful
              discussions with the rest of the Executive. They chose not to. I
              can only describe it as disingenuous if they then call for further
              consultation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, the whole notion that there is not
              enough time to discuss this is also disingenuous. The motion
              clearly asks the Assembly to &quot;take note of&quot; this
              memorandum, not to adopt it or make it a legal requirement. It has
              already been explained that there will be at least one annual
              opportunity to review this. If there are problems in the operation
              of this package that present difficulty for any part of the
              Assembly, there will be an opportunity to review it, because this
              is a modus operandi that will enable the various devolved
              Assemblies to interrelate and to work together.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We heard this morning the Minister of Finance
              and Personnel’s concern about the budget delays caused by
              suspension. We do not want to see any further unnecessary delays.
              It is unnecessary to delay if there are built-in opportunities to
              review, examine and change where required. On those two bases, it
              is disingenuous.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The play that Dr Paisley made on the word
              &quot;concordat&quot; was interesting. Members will remember from
              their history classes that the concordat was the conclusion of a
              row arising from the Franco-Prussian War of 1870. It was
              concluded, as he rightly said, between the Vatican and Italy in
              1929. In line with most of his analyses, Dr Paisley was at least a
              century or two out. If he had pursued his enquiries with that
              eminent librarian, he would know that the word concordat has had
              many uses and interpretations since then, even among peoples who
              have never heard of the Franco-Prussian War or Mussolini, or
              perhaps even the Pope.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is out of date, and it reflects, as I have
              said, some of the other ideas that we are constantly getting from
              the DUP. Mr&nbsp;Paisley Jnr also referred to the good work that
              was being done by MEPs. I am glad he paid tribute to our party
              leader in this regard as well as in respect of the peace and
              reconciliation package. Our party leader had a similar agenda some
              years ago when he ensured the creation of the International Fund
              for Ireland which supplied money to people in need. Those are the
              kind of international pressures we should all be dealing with, and
              we should be working with the Governments involved in our devolved
              situation, in Europe and in an international situation. That would
              be a good benchmark for co-operation — the more co-operation we
              have at different levels, the better.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Savage:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the junior Minister’s paper. Quite
              a number of things have happened in Northern Ireland over the past
              two or three years and I am referring in particular to the
              agriculture industry. There has been crisis after crisis — BSE,
              the pig meat sector and right along the line. Every time proposals
              were put forward in Belfast or elsewhere, they seem to have got
              lost somewhere along the way. If a committee is going to be set up
              in Brussels, or anywhere else, I welcome that. In my experience we
              in Northern Ireland have lost out over the last two or three
              years.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would not want this to be another quango —
              this country is full of quangoes — but it should be a place
              where people representing their industry can go to do a bit of
              straight talking. I am speaking primarily about the agriculture
              industry, but there are many smaller industries that also need an
              injection of funds. It would not take much to make a big
              difference, and I hope that the proposals put forward by the
              junior Minister will carry a lot of weight. Northern Ireland is a
              very small country, and we depend on our exporting industry so
              much.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is going to be looked at every year, and
              we will have the opportunity to pull the rug from under the feet
              of these people if they are not fulfilling their obligations. One
              thing which concerns me very much is in paragraph&nbsp;3 of
              Mr&nbsp;Nesbitt’s paper, and that is that broadly uniform
              arrangements need to apply to the handling of matters with an EU
              dimension, notably financial assistance to industry. Financial
              well-being could have done so much to help the agriculture
              industry over the last two or three years — and could still do
              so. Finance has to come from various sources in order to get the
              industry back on to a level par with all our competitors
              worldwide.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope this proposal goes forward today. It
              will, in some small way, attempt to alleviate the problems facing
              the agriculture industry. Many of the small industries that we
              discussed today would also benefit from a bit of stability, but it
              would be a big bonus to the farming industry in Northern Ireland.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have listened with interest to what has been
              said — especially to what Mr&nbsp;ONeill said. I am glad we have
              such a brilliant man among us, who can revise the Oxford
              dictionary. I trust that he will immediately write to the
              compilers of the Oxford dictionary and give them his definition of
              a concordat, because I read in the dictionary that it is an
              agreement; especially one between the Vatican and a secular
              Government relating to matters of mutual interest. My definition
              is from the dictionary. I did not write the Oxford dictionary. I
              am blamed for writing many things, but Mr&nbsp;ONeill is going to
              rewrite the dictionary. I congratulate him. I hope that he will do
              well, get the right definitions, and change the dictionary. Then,
              the next time I come, I will not need to waste the valuable time
              of this House explaining that the Oxford dictionary is wrong and
              that it cannot be upheld. The argument that he puts is absolute
              nonsense because we have a right to call for the business of this
              House to be conducted in a decent manner.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr&nbsp;Birnie tells us that we should have
              seen the Scottish and Welsh memoranda. Who is he talking to? We
              are dealing with documents for this House. He had to admit that
              the memoranda were not even the same. Then he said that I am a
              Nationalist because of the speech that I made today — and him in
              harness with IRA/Sinn Féin. We know who the Nationalists in this
              House are, and who their fellow travellers are. I will not waste
              time in answering that. The House can roll this through because
              there is a majority — Members can do that. However, that will
              result in sad reaping because there are ways to influence Europe,
              and British Ministers have singularly failed in influencing
              Europe.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I pay tribute to my colleagues in Europe, as I
              always do, but M Delors addressed me, and me alone, at our meeting
              with him. I was the man who pressed him on the issue of giving
              money to those who had felt the cruel bondage of terrorism. At the
              end of the day he said to me &quot;Yes, I believe we should help
              them.&quot;</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That money was invaluable to us. Alas, the
              deadline will expire and, evidently, there will be no renewal.
              However, those who are elected to Europe and know how it works
              cannot be ignored. If the Executive want to go this way they can,
              but all these matters raised by other Members are important and
              they will result in suffering for the people represented.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have been told that I should be in the
              Opposition. I am an Opposition Member of this House, and everybody
              knows that. However, I am then told that my two Ministers are
              responsible for this situation. I have never heard such balderdash
              in all my life. They were not present. They never received a
              letter summoning them to meet the inquisition. I would like to
              tell them that the inquisition days are over and the belts, the
              wheels, and the tortures are past. We are a free people, and we
              are not going to be railroaded by anyone. We will do our own thing
              within the law, and I congratulate my two Members.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I laughed. When it suited people in this House
              to applaud my two Colleagues, they applauded them. Then, when it
              did not suit their political way, they derided them. They cannot
              have it both ways. The two Departments will go on with their work
              no matter who is in the seat. We know what we are going to do —
              and we will do it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Alas, the House has decided not to listen to
              the appeal that has been made today. Upon Members’ heads be it
              — carry on. However, they should not try and make excuses before
              the general public. When the general public questions Members on
              this matter, they should tell the truth.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members must not try to say that they are
              giving a place to the MEPs when they are not. They did not even
              mention them. They did not see any place for them, and they should
              acknowledge that. They think that they can do better, but we will
              see. I wonder how many offices there will be and appointments
              made. They could have offices here, there and everywhere, but
              instead of spending money on offices they should be spending money
              on the people that need it most, and that is the farming
              community. Every extra penny should be going to the farming
              community, rather than on a grandiose scheme for offices round the
              world.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Haughey:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to begin by bringing some superior
              classical knowledge to bear upon the debate about the meaning of
              the word &quot;concordat&quot;. It simply means &quot;it is
              agreed&quot;. Perhaps Dr&nbsp;Paisley should have been looking at
              the old Latin primer and not the Oxford dictionary. It was used
              originally to describe the agreement between the Italian State and
              the papacy, but it has been used many times since to describe
              various levels of understanding between different bodies.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I beg leave to oppose the amendment and to call
              upon the House to support the original motion before it. In
              opposing the amendment I should say, with all respect, that
              Dr&nbsp;Paisley appears to have misunderstood the purpose of the
              memorandum and its supplementary agreements. As has already been
              said, the purpose of the memorandum is to set down principles
              which will underlie relations between the United Kingdom
              Government and the devolved Administrations in Scotland, Wales and
              Northern&nbsp;Ireland. It is a declaration of intent to co-operate
              with each other, an administrative arrangement designed to
              facilitate best practice and good models of communication in
              dealing with business, so that good channels of communication can
              exist and the devolved Administrations and the United Kingdom
              Administration at Westminster and Whitehall are fully informed of
              what each of the others is doing and can communicate and discuss
              matters with them.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The memorandum was considered by the Executive
              Committee on three occasions, and the papers were provided to
              Executive Committee Ministers. Those papers clearly set out the
              purpose of the memorandum. I want to show the House the document
              that we are talking about. It was published in October 1999; it
              has been available since then; and explanatory papers and
              memoranda have been available to Executive Ministers. The DUP
              Ministers would have had a better appreciation of it if they had
              attended Executive meetings. However, they had all the papers and
              these should have been passed to their party colleagues and
              discussed with them.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today’s debate arises out of the Executive’s
              concern to ensure transparency at all times and to keep the
              Assembly fully informed. Hence, the matter is being dealt with by
              way of a &quot;take note&quot; debate, rather than by a
              ministerial statement or a &quot;teed-up&quot; question for
              written answer, which would have deprived Members of the
              opportunity to ventilate and explore fully the issues involved.
              These documents, and all this material, have been in the public
              domain since last October. For many months now parties and Members
              have had the opportunity to read, to digest, to debate among
              themselves, to explore and otherwise to internalise the content.
              The Executive has, in fact, fulfilled the remit which is included
              in Dr&nbsp;Paisley’s amendment: it has enabled parties and
              Members of the House to examine, discuss and analyse the
              documents.</p>

              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given that the Executive has discussed them
              three times, with, as I said, all the papers available to them,
              the purpose and intent of Dr&nbsp;Paisley’s motion had already
              been anticipated and accomplished by the Executive before he
              tabled his amendment.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The further matters that I want to refer to
              arise out of points made by individual Members. I will come to
              them in the order that I noted them, and I will try to be as
              coherent as possible, although different Members did refer to the
              same points, and I may find myself repeating some considerations.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This concordat is between the Executive and the
              Westminster authorities. Dr&nbsp;Paisley raised the question of
              whether the MEPs had any role in this. Without meaning any
              disrespect to any of the three MEPs, the answer is &quot;No&quot;.
              Because the concordat is between the Executive and the Westminster
              Government, it does not concern or involve Members of the European
              Parliament. They are not central to the operations of this
              concordat.</p>
              <b>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the papers that I have — a Memorandum of
              Understanding and an agreement on the Joint Ministerial Committee
              — the word &quot;concordat&quot; has not been used. The word
              &quot;agreement&quot; has been used in the Joint Ministerial
              Committee paper. &quot;Concordat&quot; is only used in the papers
              on the co-ordination of European Union policies, financial
              assistance to industry and international relations.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Haughey:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Memorandum of Understanding sets down the
              general principles. The supplementary agreements refer to
              particular areas of policy and explain how the Memorandum of
              Understanding is to be applied in those areas. The Joint
              Ministerial Council is simply a mechanism by which the members of
              the Executives of the devolved Administrations may consult with
              the Ministers and Secretaries of State at Westminster, and among
              themselves. It is simply a mechanism.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, I will deal with the points made by
              Dr&nbsp;Paisley in relation to the representation of Northern
              Ireland as a region within the European Union. On the one hand
              there was his assertion that Northern Ireland needs a separate
              line, a separate policy and a separate approach to European
              issues. He specifically enlarged on that in relation to
              agriculture, and our need to elaborate a quite distinct and
              separate line about Northern Ireland’s interests.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I find it difficult to reconcile that with the
              assertion that he makes from time to time about the absolute
              supremacy and sovereignty of the Westminster Government. If we are
              to take a separate line in Northern Ireland then we need
              mechanisms, processes and facilities to enable us to pursue a
              different line, or at least a modified line on European policy.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr&nbsp;Paisley took issue with the intention
              of the Administration to set up a facility in Brussels. As he
              rightly says, that is where all major policy decisions are taken
              in very important areas, such as agriculture. If he is opposed to
              the setting up of a facility in Brussels that would enable the
              Administration to pursue its interests directly through having its
              own servants and facilities there, would that not leave us totally
              dependent on UKRep? That brings me to the point made by
              Mr&nbsp;Ian&nbsp;Paisley&nbsp;Jnr, who said we should not be
              totally dependent on UKRep. Father and son need to get their heads
              together on that and decide which exactly we want. Do we want the
              facility to pursue our own line, or do we want to be totally
              dependent on UKRep? The two are not reconcilable. <i>[Interruption</i>]</p>

              diverge from the interests of English farmers we need to be able
              to pursue a different line. That is precisely the point I am
              making. I am glad to say that it would appear that on this issue
              Dr Paisley and I are as one person.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a practical level, the processes and the
              mechanisms that the Executive will develop for pursuing the
              interests of this region in Brussels will; of necessity, and
              rightly, involve a primary role for the MEPs. Without appearing to
              be sycophantic, I pay tribute to them for the work that they have
              done and the many benefits that they have brought to this region
              through their co-operation, interaction and sharing of power in
              their roles as Members of the European Parliament.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Setting up the processes, the practices and the
              mechanisms by which we will represent our interests as a region in
              the European community will involve a primary role for the MEPs,
              but will also, I hope, involve a role for Members of the Economic
              and Social Committee of the European Union, Members of the
              Committee of the Regions and their alternates, and many other
              people from a wide range of sectors in Northern Ireland society.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Paisley said that we should have five
              representatives in Europe, rather than three. That confused me
              because in having three we have slightly more than our
              proportionate share of the 81 Members for the UK. If we were to
              have five that would indeed call into question the entire British
              link. And if that is what he wants to do he has an ally in me.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Paisley said that we have never received
              from Europe what we have put into it. That may be true of the
              United Kingdom Government as a whole, but it is not true of
              Northern Ireland as a region. The United Kingdom Government has
              been a net contributor to the EU budget but Northern Ireland has
              been, enormously, a net benefactor of both the EU budget and UK
              internal budget. There is no real relevance in Dr Paisley’s
              point.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The concordat and the memorandum mentioned the
              Council of Ministers because it is the primary authority in the
              European Union. It is comprised of Ministers from the Member
              States and the memorandum includes the right for Members of the
              Executive in the House to take their place in the Council when
              appropriate.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some questions were asked about the office in
              Brussels. Work is ongoing by way of providing this information to
              the House. The office will be located close to the European
              Parliament building. Its staffing will be a matter for the Office
              of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister and the numbers
              and levels have not yet been determined.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The role of the office will be to liaise with
              the European Union institutions in order to ensure that
              Northern&nbsp;Ireland’s interests are taken fully into account
              where relevant, to alert Government Departments here to issues
              arising in Brussels, to provide a base and support for visiting
              Ministers and to raise the profile of Northern Ireland in Europe.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Not all aspects of the shaping of the facility
              in Brussels have been agreed yet, but it will involve a formal
              level of representation where official business is carried out,
              and an informal level of representation where interests are
              pursued, information is gathered, lobbying is done and a facility
              is provided to representatives of the various sectors of industry
              and society in Northern Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Paisley spoke about agriculture, which, in
              common with other major areas of policy, will be the subject of
              bilateral concordats agreed between the relevant departments in
              Whitehall and Northern Ireland. Consequently, the Department of
              Agriculture and Rural Development will have its own separate
              concordat with the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF),
              which will set out a framework for relations within the
              overarching principles set out in the Memorandum of Understanding.
              These bilateral concordats between our Departments and those in
              Westminster will be published as and when they are finalised and
              agreed.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Neeson referred to the Pledge of Office. The
              Memorandum of Understanding is not legally binding either on
              Departments or on Ministers. Rather, it represents models of best
              practice which, I hope, all Ministers and Members will support.
              Communication is a two-way street, and the Memorandum of
              Understanding also applies to the United Kingdom Administration
              and their obligation to inform and consult us.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to matters such as the visa for
              Mike&nbsp;Tyson, I should say that the Memorandum of Understanding
              and the concordats do not affect the constitutional position.
              There are still issues, such as immigration, which remain within
              the remit of the Westminster Government. The Memorandum of
              Understanding provides a framework within which consultation can
              take place on these issues, but at the moment it does not replace
              the United Kingdom Government’s authority under the legislation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Neeson also raised the Mallusk case. I
              cannot comment on specific cases. Clearly competition will
              continue amongst United Kingdom regions, and the IDB will continue
              to make every possible effort to secure success for
              Northern&nbsp;Ireland. However, the concordat will ensure — as
              Dr&nbsp;Birnie pointed out — that competition does not lead to
              regions paying a higher price than they might otherwise do in
              order to secure inward investment. The current situation lends
              itself to competitive bidding between the regions. This can be to
              everybody’s disadvantage. In certain circumstances one might be
              able to sneak an advantage from it, but in the main it is to
              everybody’s disadvantage. The concordat and the memorandum of
              understanding provide us with a framework within which we can
              prevent that and, by creating jobs, reduce the subsidy burden on
              the taxpayer.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Morrice made reference to the role of United
              Kingdom Ministers in relation to the supposed duality of their
              position in representing, first of all, the whole of the United
              Kingdom, but specifically the English interest in circumstances
              where there are three other devolved Administrations.
              Constitutionally that does not arise. United Kingdom Ministers do
              not represent England as a region. They represent all of the
              United Kingdom, while the Ministers from the devolved
              Administrations represent only the regions.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Morrice also asked about
              Northern&nbsp;Ireland not being adequately represented in
              United&nbsp;Kingdom statistics. I should say in reply that this is
              exactly the sort of thing that the concordat is designed to deal
              with.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Ian Paisley made reference to communication
              and consultation, and he set out principles and procedures for the
              Assembly. He mentioned telephone, fax, meeting, letter, and so on.
              All methods will be employed. In order to make sure that the
              public record is adequately maintained, in the main it will be
              done by writing, but in circumstances where urgency arises it may
              well first be done by telephone call or by other means.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Paisley Jnr or Snr asked about the code of
              practice on access to Government information. This has been in the
              public domain since 1993 or 1994 and, therefore, is not a matter
              that has been kept from either himself or anyone else.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.15 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was Mr&nbsp;Paisley&nbsp;Jnr who raised the
              matter of whether the United Kingdom Parliament’s authority was
              to be absolute or restricted. In the modern world no Parliament or
              Government’s authority is absolute anymore. The UK Parliament,
              under the legislation that stands at the moment, retains overall
              authority but, essentially as a courtesy to devolved
              Administrations, it commits itself through these concordats, this
              memorandum of understanding, and indeed other conventions that
              have been drawn up through the years, to consult with devolved
              Administrations and not to legislate on devolved matters without
              such consultation. That is the situation that existed in the past,
              and the same convention will, I think, be applied to all of the
              devolved institutions that exist at the moment.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;Neeson asked about timescales. As I
              said before, these papers have all been available since October,
              and parties and Members should have consulted, or at least read
              and digested their contents.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Paisley Jnr:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given that the junior Minister has accepted
              that a number of points raised by my party, the Alliance party and
              the Women’s Coalition have identified, in the last two hours, a
              number of flaws that are apparent in this document, will the
              Member not reconsider his position? Will he agree to the amendment
              and give us time to rectify these flaws, so that this memorandum
              can go forward with the full confidence of the House?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Haughey:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No. The various points that have been raised
              can be reconciled with the position that the Executive has taken.
              Many of the points are not contrary to the provisions of the
              memorandum of understanding, and the agreements that were made
              under it, but are entirely consistent with them. The memorandum of
              understanding, and the supplementary agreements, provide us with
              mechanisms for dealing with the points and objections that have
              been raised by Members.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;Neeson raised the question of
              consultation on the part of the Secretary of State with the
              Executive and the Assembly on non-devolved matters. Under the
              legislation, at the moment, these matters remain in his charge. We
              may agree or disagree on whether that should be the case, but in
              law it is. We may agree about what he should do, but what he does
              under the law is a matter for himself. I hope that he will consult
              closely with the Assembly and the Executive on those matters that
              remain in his charge.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;Neeson also asked about European
              legislation. Whether by directive or by regulation, consultation
              is with the European Parliament, but member state legislatures are
              notified at a very early stage of proposals from the Commission
              and the Council. The concordat and the memorandum of understanding
              will provide for an input from the three regional Executives who
              will make provision for debate in their own Assemblies or
              Parliaments and, where appropriate, in the Committees of those
              Assemblies or Parliaments.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr&nbsp;Birnie raised the matter of
              Dr&nbsp;Paisley’s speech which he said was a speech rather more
              in favour of Ulster Nationalism than Ulster Unionism. I think it
              would stand a good chance of being adopted by people in my party
              as a statement in favour of Irish Nationalism, but that is another
              matter. On the joint ministerial Committees, Dr&nbsp;Birnie asked
              whether they would be &quot;courts of Star Chamber&quot; to bring
              devolved Administrations to heel. It may well turn out to be the
              reverse, where highly aggressive, deeply motivated Ministers, who
              have to get themselves re-elected here and in the other devolved
              Administrations, will seek very hard to bring the UK Secretary of
              State to heel on matters that vitally affect them.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I think that covers all the points raised in
              the course of the debate. I ask Members to note the memorandum of
              understanding and the supplementary agreements, and to reject the
              amendment.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Question put </i>That the amendment be made.</p>
              <b>

              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order. The position is clear. I call for the
              Ayes and the Noes. If it seems to me that the Ayes or the Noes
              have it, I declare that that is the case. If either side disputes
              my declaration, Members repeat their call, at which point the
              Lobbies are cleared, and the Question put. It seems to me that
              there is extraordinary confusion about a procedure which we have
              gone through on a number of occasions.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This motion comes at a very appropriate time.
              Because I and others in this House have taken a stand, we have
              been held up to all sorts of attack and vilification by Members of
              the House who oppose us in an attempt to justify their own
              positions. One of the arguments they have been using is that we
              are out to hinder ordinary people while continuing to get our
              money. On radio programmes I have heard people say that we do not
              want people to get their hospital beds or their social services
              and that we are doing this because we have nothing else to say.
              That is a colossal lie. I am glad this motion has come before us
              tonight, and in the circumstances, the fact that my party approves
              of this gives the lie to all that. As a party we welcome that, as
              do others in these Benches.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dodds:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr Speaker. May I refer
              the House to Standing Order 39(2), which sets out the requirements
              laid on a Minister who wishes to introduce a Bill and to ask leave
              of the House for accelerated procedure. There are three
              requirements: first, that the Minister give account to the
              Assembly of the reason or reasons for it; secondly, that he give
              the consequences of not so proceeding; and thirdly, that he inform
              the House of any steps that he has taken to minimise or avoid the
              future use of the accelerated passage procedure. Only then may he
              seek leave of the House. Are you satisfied, Mr Speaker, that the
              requirements of this Standing Order have been satisfied? There may
              have been a reference, perhaps in the Minister’s earlier speech,
              but that speech was about the introduction of the Appropriation
              Bill. Nevertheless, at this stage, in terms of setting a
              precedent, I would have thought that it would have been more
              appropriate for whoever was responsible for the Bill, whoever was
              actually moving the motion for the accelerated procedure, to have
              set out the reasons for doing so, rather than simply begging that
              it be moved. I defer to your guidance on this matter, Mr Speaker.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There was, as Members can imagine, a
              substantial amount of discussion about this with the Speaker’s
              Office in advance. Given that the matters were on the same day,
              the requirements that we made of the Minister were that the
              reasons be set out in the statement, and that the Bill be
              published and available for Members on the day. This was so that
              Members, before having to vote on the motion before them now,
              would have had sight of the Bill for which they were being
              requested to provide a fast-track passage. The Minister is, of
              course, in a position to respond and may wish to do so at the end
              of this short debate. However, in terms of the requirements of the
              Standing Orders, I have no doubt that today, and in writing, the
              Minister has satisfied those requirements. I am making that
              judgement because there were substantial discussions in advance to
              ensure that all of these things within the sitting were before the
              House. The Minister may now wish to make his winding-up speech.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I said earlier, the approval of the
              Estimates and the passing of an Appropriation Act are among the
              most important responsibilities of the Assembly. I agree with
              points made by several Members that this is an unsatisfactory
              process. I explained the need for the accelerated passage, and how
              we aim to avoid the need for it in the future. However, the
              reality is that suspension has meant that it is not now feasible
              for the Assembly to undertake all the detailed stages that would
              normally be appropriate and essential.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also acknowledged that we are, at this stage,
              implementing plans that were set before devolution, mainly in the
              1998 comprehensive spending review. I agree strongly with the view
              expressed by many Members that we need to get down to the serious
              business of setting our own priorities through the Programme of
              Government. The question is of how best to do that, and my view is
              that it would be better to focus on the forward-looking aspects of
              this, even if that means proceeding with essentially inherited or
              hand-me-down plans for the immediate period.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members will realise, and it was clear in Dr
              Paisley’s comments, that schools, hospitals, and all other
              budget managers, are already working on the basis of the plans set
              out in the Main Estimates. I believe that the best way ahead is to
              approve these Estimates, and focus our attention and time on
              planning for the future through the Programme of Government.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Before moving to the decision, I draw
              attention, as Mr&nbsp;Dodds did, to the Standing Orders,
              particularly the one in question, because accelerated passage is
              granted by leave of the Assembly. That means that there must be no
              voices against. Any single voice against would negative the
              motion.</p>
