	        <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The Assembly met at 12.00 noon (Mr Speaker in the  Chair).</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Members observed two minutes&rsquo; silence.</p>
	        <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="1"></a>Assembly Business</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  During the sitting on Monday 14 January 2008, Mr Spratt raised a point of  order, suggesting that there was something wrong with the microphones in the  Chamber and that they should be checked. Mr Spratt is not in the Chamber, but I  thank him for that point of order. Another Member had approached the Table  earlier that day, also suggesting that there had been a problem with the sound.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Checks have now been conducted, and I am advised that the  interference about which Members have complained is being caused by mobile  phones being in active mode. If Members persist in leaving their mobile phones  on &mdash; even in silent mode &mdash; while they are in the Chamber, those problems will  continue.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Without looking at any specific Members, I understand why  some are very attached to their mobile phones. However, I urge Members to  manage without them when they are in the Chamber. The Whips have consistently  raised this issue. We should try to reach a point where Members leave their  mobile phones outside the Chamber, but, if that cannot be achieved, the  Business Committee needs to consider the issue further to try to resolve it.</p>
	        <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="2"></a>Committee Business</p>
	        <p class="H4StageHeading">Statutory Committee Membership</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The next item of business is the motion on Statutory Committee membership,  which has been brought forward by the Business Committee. As with similar  motions, this will be treated as a business motion. Therefore, there will be no  debate.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P J Bradley</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
	        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That Mr Pat Doherty replace Mr Gerry McHugh as a  member of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development; that Mr Gerry  McHugh replace Mr Francie Molloy as a member of the Committee for Enterprise,  Trade and Investment; and that Mr Alastair Ross replace Mr Alex Maskey as a  member of the Committee for the Environment.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Some Members may be wondering why I am proposing this  motion. For those who are not familiar with the workings of the Business  Committee, I should explain that if a Member from a particular party is named  in such a motion, it is preferred that that party does not lend its name to the  motion. That is why the motion stands in my name.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I am not involved in the internal politics of Sinn F&eacute;in &mdash;  that is for sure. However, I wish to pay tribute to Gerry McHugh, who has been  an active member of the Agriculture Committee since 1998. I have sat alongside  him, and he was a well-informed member who kept a good attendance record.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
	        <p class="Q3Motion">That Mr Pat Doherty replace Mr Gerry McHugh as a member of  the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development; that Mr Gerry McHugh  replace Mr Francie Molloy as a member of the Committee for Enterprise, Trade  and Investment; and that Mr Alastair Ross replace Mr Alex Maskey as a member of  the Committee for the Environment.</p>
	        <p class="H5StageHeading"><a name="3"></a>Standing Committee Membership</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The next item of business concerns the membership of a Standing Committee. The  motion has been proposed by the Business Committee &mdash; it is <span style="letter-spacing:-.2pt; ">a business motion, and, therefore, there will be  no debate.</span></p>
	        <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
	        <p class="Q3Motion">That Mr Ian McCrea replace Mr Mickey Brady as a member of the  Public Accounts Committee. &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Mr P J Bradley.]</span></p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. I refer to today&rsquo;s first business motion. Is  it in order for a long-standing member of a Committee to be forced off that  Committee because of his leaving a party, rather than to consent to his  removal? Is it in order for a Member to be pushed off a Committee in a rather  brutal fashion?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Business Committee was unanimously agreed on how to deal with that matter.  Standing Orders state that all Members must be offered membership of one  Statutory Committee.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I do not wish to prolong proceedings, but a Member has an opportunity and a  right to be a member of a Statutory Committee. If that person expresses the  view that he or she is quite happy <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt; ">to stay  on that Committee, can he or she not do so? Why</span> <span style="letter-spacing:-.25pt; ">must such a Member be forced off a Statutory Committee</span>? Surely  it should be a matter of consent to removal.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  That is not a point of order for the House. I am satisfied that the Business  Committee has dealt with the issue.</p>
	        <p class="H5StageHeading"><a name="4"></a>Smoke Alarms in Homes</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to one hour and 30 minutes for  the debate. The proposer of the motion will have 10 minutes to propose, and 10  minutes for a winding-up speech. All other Members who are called to speak will  have five minutes.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mrs I Robinson)</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
	        <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly recognises the positive work of voluntary  and statutory organisations in installing smoke alarms in homes; expresses  concern that many dwellings in both the private- and social-housing sectors  still do not have adequate working smoke alarms; and calls on the Department of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety, the Department for Social  Development and the Department of Finance and Personnel, to undertake a  coordinated programme to ensure the provision of working smoke detectors in  every home.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">As Chairperson of the Committee for Health, Social Services  and Public Safety, I am pleased to propose the motion on this important  public-safety issue. Concerns about this issue were raised by the Committee  after the horrific deaths of seven members of the McElhill and McGovern family  in a recent house fire in Omagh.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I appreciate fully that the circumstances of those tragic  deaths are still under investigation and are the subject of an independent  review that was announced by the Minister last week. I welcome that review.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Whatever the particular circumstances of that tragic case,  it is a sad fact that, according to figures from the Northern Ireland Fire and  Rescue Service, there were 833 accidental house fires in Northern Ireland  last year, in which eight people lost their lives and more than 250 were  injured.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The motion is about smoke alarms, and, without question,  smoke alarms save lives. In a house fire, the real killer is often not the fire  itself but smoke. It is well known that fires happen when people least expect  them, often during the night. It is a shocking fact that if people are asleep  when a fire starts and there is no smoke alarm to wake them, they are unlikely  to survive. Smoke suffocates quickly, and people can die before the flames  reach them. A smoke alarm gives vital minutes of warning that help people to  get out safely. Surveys suggest that Northern   Ireland has the highest number of smoke alarms in homes  of any part of the United    Kingdom. That is very good news and is due  in no small measure to the ongoing work of our statutory and voluntary  organisations. I pay tribute to the work that they do.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Three main factors have contributed to the high level of  smoke alarms. First, the Fire and Rescue Service, in conjunction with a range  of voluntary organisations, undertook a campaign a few years ago entitled  Elderly at Risk, during which approximately 65,000 free smoke alarms were  fitted in the homes of elderly and vulnerable people. That made a significant  impact. I cannot praise too highly the valuable work of the Northern Ireland  Fire and Rescue Service, which continues to undertake comprehensive  fire-prevention work, including the provision of fire-safety advice. Members  will be familiar with the hard-hitting advertisements that appear on our  screens and remind us regularly of the terrible consequences of not having a  working smoke alarm.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The second factor that has contributed to the high level of  smoke alarms is changes in recent years to the <span style="letter-spacing:-.05pt; ">building regulations, which mean that all new dwellings</span> must now  have a smoke alarm that is connected to the electricity supply. That removes  the concern about batteries not working, being removed or not being replaced  when they run out. The same requirement to fit a hard-wired smoke alarm applies  where major renovations are carried out to existing buildings.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The third contributing factor is the Northern Ireland  Housing Executive&rsquo;s programme, which has been in place for quite a number of  years, of fitting smoke alarms to its properties. As a result, the level of  death and injury in fires in private dwellings is lower in Northern Ireland than in the rest of the United Kingdom.  However, there is no room for complacency, and a number of factors has caused  the Committee to be concerned about the issue and to bring forward this motion  for debate.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">In relation to the number of homes with a smoke alarm, a Northern Ireland  omnibus survey, carried out in 2004, found that 96% of respondents stated that  they had an alarm. Of those, 72% reported  that they checked their smoke alarms at least weekly or monthly. As a  result, the Fire and Rescue Service estimated at that time that 19% of homes  may not have a reliable, working smoke alarm. It is clear that a headline  figure of 96% of homes having a smoke alarm can mask the true picture. A more  recent study, based on interviews carried out in 1,000 homes, found that 94%  reported having a smoke alarm.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The level of ownership of smoke alarms may be quite high,  but the crucial factor is whether those have been maintained and whether they  have a working battery. The Fire and Rescue Service has found many cases of the  alarm being fitted but not maintained, or the batteries removed. The focus of  the Fire and Rescue Service&rsquo;s media campaigns has, quite rightly, been on  reminding people to check their smoke alarms regularly  and warning of the consequences of removing batteries for other use.</p>
	        <p class="TimePeriod">12.15 pm</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">However, general  statistics about the number of homes with smoke alarms can give a  misleading impression and, perhaps, lead to a false sense of security. In  addition to the number of smoke alarms that have not been maintained, there are  still many homes that do not have alarms. That is particularly worrying, and  the Committee is calling for a co-ordinated programme to tackle the issue. For example, figures from the  Northern Ireland Housing Executive show that just fewer than  three-quarters of all social housing stock have smoke alarms fitted, which  leaves nearly 23,000 homes in the social-housing sector with no smoke alarms.  The situation must be addressed urgently, and I am sure that we will hear  further views on that point from Members during the debate.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I will turn briefly to an analysis that was carried out by  the Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service on house fires in Northern Ireland  over the past four years, which shows that there has been a gradual reduction  in the overall number of fires during that period. The number has fallen from  just over 1,000 in 2005 to 830 last year. When the type of dwelling is  examined, over the same period, one finds that nearly 40% of all house fires  were in terraced houses. That was followed by 16%, which were in flats, and  14%, which occurred in semi-detached houses. As well as over 1,000 casualties,  there were 33 accidental deaths in fires during the past four years. When the  smoke alarm status of the 33 dwellings in which those deaths took place is  examined, one finds that 14 of them had no smoke alarms, and in eight other  cases, the alarms were not working.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Ensuring that every home in Northern Ireland has a working  smoke alarm is first and foremost down to individuals to take responsibility  for their own safety. At departmental level, it is an issue that requires  action by a number of Departments. Although the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety has  primary responsibility for public safety, the Department for Social  Development (DSD) has a role in relation to social housing in the public- or  private-rental sectors and the Department of Finance and Personnel has a role  in relation to building regulations. The Committee is, therefore, calling for  concerted action from all three Departments to tackle the issue.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, I will leave Members with a positive and  encouraging statistic from the Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service. In 333  homes in which fires occurred last year, the occupants were alerted by a smoke  alarm. That shows that smoke alarms can, and do,  save lives, and I urge Members to support the motion.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat. As a member of the  Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety, I am happy to add my name and give my support and that of  Sinn F&eacute;in to the motion. As the Chairperson has just said, I hope that we  receive the support of the House today because the motion is proactive.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I commend the Minister of Health, Social Services and  Public Safety, and although part of the motion calls on him to do specific  things, it is recognised that other Departments must play their parts, too. I  look forward to hearing from the Minister the time frame in which the programme  will be achieved.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I also take this opportunity to commend both the Fire and  Rescue Service for its ongoing work and those groups in the community and  voluntary sector that have been working over past years to ensure that homes  that are occupied by the most vulnerable in  our society are fitted with smoke detectors. Without that work, the  figures highlighted by the Chairperson would be greater.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText"><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt; ">The Committee for  Health, Social Services and Public</span> Safety received a briefing paper on  smoke alarms from Dr Janice Thompson, and I thank her for her report. She gave  the Committee statistics and compared what is happening here with the work that  is taking place in some local authority areas in England. The report informed us  that a survey carried out by the Fire and Rescue Service shows that 96% of  respondents said that they had smoke alarms in their homes. Of those, 72% said  that they check their smoke alarms either weekly  or monthly. The Fire and Rescue Service, based on those responses,  estimated that 19% of homes may not have a reliable, working smoke alarm.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">With that figure in mind, and in light of recent deaths, I  support the motion.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Chairperson of the  Committee for Health, Social Services  and Public Safety gave statistics, and, for some years, it has been  Housing Executive policy to install smoke  alarms in all its flats, maisonettes and bunga&shy;lows. That is to be commended;  however, the figures show that smoke alarms are not fitted in just over 23,000 properties. If that figure applies only to  the public sector, how many private-sector homes are without reliable  smoke detectors? That must be changed.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">There were 830 house fires in 2007, resulting in the loss  of eight lives. Many others were injured. I have no doubt that more would have  died, had residents not been given early warning by smoke detectors.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I stress again that fitting a smoke detector is all well  and good; however, it must be checked regularly. It is good that today is  Monday: I close with the Fire and Rescue Service campaign slogan &ldquo;Thumbs Up On  Monday&rdquo;. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr Robert  Coulter</strong>: I thank the Chairperson of the Committee for Health, Social Services  and Public Safety for bringing the motion to the Assembly. Should it achieve  nothing else, it will heighten public awareness of the smoke-alarm issue.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I congratulate the two  Members who spoke previously on their presentation of the statistics. An  increase of 98% in ownership of smoke alarms is welcome; however, only 72% of  those are checked regularly. Therefore, the question is not the problem of finance to supply smoke alarms, but the finance  necessary to educate people to check their alarms regularly.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">It seems that the real problem with inefficient smoke  alarms is that, in many cases, the batteries have run down, and the  householders have not renewed them. Would it not, therefore, be better if all  smoke alarms were hard wired?</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">A further statistic that has, rightly, been quoted is the  number of privately owned homes with either no smoke alarm, or whose alarm is  inefficient. Should this Assembly not recommend that all private homes be  statutorily bound to have smoke alarms fitted and hard wired? Furthermore,  should it not be the case that smoke alarms are fitted all public-sector  houses?</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The statistics for deaths in house fires are alarming.  Although we may congratulate ourselves that the number of deaths has gone down,  even one fatality from a fire in a house with no working smoke alarm is one too  many.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Rather than bore Members by going over the statistics  again, suffice it to say that, in the draft Budget, the Fire and Rescue Service  is almost at a standstill. If we are to ask that service to go a bit further,  we must look again at supporting resources for its educational programme for  householders with smoke alarms.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I support the motion, both personally and as a member of  the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety, and, again, I  thank the Chairperson for bringing it to the  Floor of the Assembly.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>: On behalf of the United Community group of the Assembly, I  support this important motion. Ninety-six per cent of our population have smoke  alarms, and congratulations are due to those services who worked to achieve  that figure. Compared to where we were not that long ago, that statistic is  excellent.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">One fire in a property is one too many, as is one fatality as a result of a fire. We must avoid  those outcomes at all costs. It is to be hoped that by debating the  matter in the Assembly, everyone will be encouraged to ensure that working  smoke alarms are fitted in their properties. As representatives of our  communities, the onus is on us to tell people as often as possible that they  must ensure that their smoke alarms work. Even if we say as much to those who  come into our offices, we will contribute to a further reduction of  fire-related fatalities and fires in the home.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Rev Dr Robert Coulter said that if we want to ensure the  adoption of a co-ordinated approach to the provision of working smoke alarms,  we must make sure that the Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service has  sufficient funding to encourage everyone in the community to fit their homes  with smoke-detection devices.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">It has been a pleasure for me to speak to the motion, which  I support fully.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Social Development (Mr Campbell)</strong>: The Committee for  Social Development welcomes the motion tabled by the Committee for Health,  Social Services and Public Safety, asking the Assembly to recognise the  positive work of the voluntary and statutory organisations in installing smoke  alarms in homes. The motion also calls on relevant Departments to implement a  co-ordinated programme to ensure the provision of working smoke detectors in  every home in Northern    Ireland.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Smoke alarms save lives: there is no doubt about that. Fire  strikes when it is least expected, and it can spread  rapidly, damaging property, personal possessions and, of course, lives,  for ever. The real killer, however, is smoke. Smoke suffocates people quickly,  and lives are often lost before flames can even take hold.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Smoke alarms act as early warning systems and give some  extra escape time, which can be precious. Many lives have been saved by smoke  alarms that have wakened families before they were overcome by the smoke that  was created by a fire. Sadly, some people have not been so fortunate. Smoke  alarms save lives, but that is true only if the devices are working.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Apart from houses in multiple occupation (HMO), there is no  requirement for smoke detectors to be fitted in private-rented dwellings. In  this day and age, especially given our knowledge about the important role that  smoke detectors play in saving lives, it is almost incomprehensible that there  is no requirement to fit them in such dwellings. It would be interesting and, I  must say, heartbreaking, to find out how many lives could have been saved had  there been such a requirement.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The current fitness standard for homes as provided in The  Housing (Northern Ireland)  Order 1992 does not refer to smoke detection. However, the Committee  understands that that will be considered in the context of an imminent review  of the private-rented sector strategy. The  Committee members and, I am sure, other Members will expect the  installation of smoke alarms in private-rented dwellings to become a  requirement in the near future. Under the &lsquo;Housing Association Guide&rsquo; and  relevant building regulations, mains-powered smoke detectors must be installed  in all new social housing or housing that is being altered significantly. An  estimated 95% of housing association properties have had mains-powered smoke  alarms installed. It is disturbing that no target to reach an installation rate  of 100% has been set; the &lsquo;Housing Association Guide&rsquo; simply states that  associations:</p>
	        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;should take the first opportunity to have  mains-powered smoke alarms fitted&rdquo;.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">That is simply not good enough. A target of no fewer than  100% ought to be set.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Since the 1990s, the Housing Executive&rsquo;s policy has been to  install mains-powered smoke alarms in all its flats, maisonettes and bungalows.  If the electrics of a house are being upgraded, mains-powered smoke alarms are  installed as standard.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Speaker, considerable progress has been made, but let me  dig a little deeper and provide you with some figures that the Chairperson of  the Health Committee has already mentioned. She said that approximately 65,000  Housing Executive dwellings have had mains-powered smoke alarms fitted. That is  significant progress, and it must be welcomed.</p>
	        <p class="TimePeriod">12.30 pm</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">However, given that the Housing Executive&rsquo;s total net tenanted stock stands at 87,500 properties,  that means that almost 23,000 properties do not have such smoke alarms. How  many people are at serious risk as a result? There may be over 50,000 people at  risk in Housing Executive properties. These figures are absolutely shocking and  extremely serious. The issue needs immediate and urgent attention.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, I want to pay tribute to the statutory sector,  particularly the Fire and Rescue Service, as well as all the voluntary agencies  involved, for the sterling work that has been done over recent years to install  smoke alarms in homes. As Mrs Robinson  said, surveys suggest that Northern   Ireland has the highest level of smoke alarms in homes of  any part of the UK.  I have no doubt that that can be attributed to the dedication and hard work of  the Fire and Rescue Service and the voluntary agencies. There is much more hard  work to be done.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, the  Committee for Social Development fully supports the motion and  congratulates the Health Committee on its proposing of it.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I also commend the Member for bringing  such an important motion to the Floor of the House. The matter of fire  prevention and the necessity of smoke alarms in homes has been an issue for  many years, yet we still hear of the terrible tragedies that occur as the  result of house fires &mdash; loss of life, horrific injuries, and damage to the  lives of entire families.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">How many times have we heard the Fire and Rescue Service,  the police and others on television appealing to people to install smoke alarms  in their homes? However, in many instances, the appeals fall on deaf ears. How  many people are living in homes with no smoke alarms? According to statistics,  the answer is thousands. The motion asks the Departments with shared  responsibility for fire prevention resources and expertise to undertake a  co-ordinated approach and develop a programme that will result in working smoke  alarms being fitted in every home.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The motion also  recognises the excellent work carried out by the voluntary and statutory  sectors to educate people about fire  prevention and to install smoke alarms in  thousands of homes across the North of Ireland. There is no doubt that  many people owe their lives to the fact that some people care enough to have  highlighted the importance of having a smoke alarm in every dwelling and have  taken the appropriate action to ensure that smoke alarms were installed.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I also commend the many community groups who work in  partnership with the voluntary and statutory sectors.  Often, the work that they do goes unrecognised, but we should remember  the hours of work that such people carry out on a voluntary basis. They are the  people who plod the streets, carrying out the surveys and providing the  information to ensure that an effective programme is completed. The partnership  between statutory agencies and the voluntary and community sector has proven  invaluable in the battle to have smoke alarms installed. When one considers the  cost of not accepting this motion in the sense of loss of life or injuries,  full support is essential. If one considers the damage to property, then,  again, we need to rally behind the motion.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The statistics paint a bleak picture. Over the past four  years, an estimated 3,600 fires have taken place in various dwelling types,  while in the past three years, the number of house fires has fallen by 175, from  1,005 in 2004 to 830 in 2007. In that period, we have seen a casualty list of  1,052 people. We must do all in our power to drive those figures down.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">In my lifetime, I have  seen the devastating and heart&shy;breaking consequences of house fires and  I have seen the impact that they leave on communities. I am sure that everyone  in the House can tell similar stories. We have it in our power to ensure that  at least one effective smoke alarm is  installed in every home. In many countries, it is recommended that smoke  alarms should be fitted in every room, while other countries ask that smoke  alarms be strategically placed in several rooms.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">In the June 2004 Northern Ireland omnibus survey,  96% of respondents stated that they had a smoke alarm in their home, and 72%  stated that they checked their alarm on a  weekly or monthly basis. In a leaflet published in 2006, the Fire and  Rescue Service stated that 98% of people said that they had a smoke alarm in  their house &mdash; that is a very high figure that needs some research. I would be  interested in finding out how many people responded to each of those surveys,  as well as how widely and in which areas of Northern Ireland they were carried  out.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">That type of information is essential if an effective  campaign is to be carried out. The figures provided by the Fire and Rescue  Service do not correspond to other statistics that are available.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Take the private-rented  sector: I have seen it reported that, although houses in multiple  occupation are covered by the Housing (Management of Houses in Multiple  Occupation) Regulations 1993, there is no requirement for smoke alarms to be fitted in private-rented dwellings. That  has already been touched on. An increasing number of dwellings fall into that category.  Also, many HMOs are older than the legislation that now guides them. How many  of those are without smoke alarms?</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that, on the  passing of this motion, Departments will  start to tackle the serious problems that these figures show up in  relation to the private-rented sector. This House supported a motion several  months ago calling for mandatory registration in the private-rented sector. In  light of crucial issues, such as the one that this motion highlights, it is all  the more urgent that the motion passed all those months ago be implemented as  soon as possible. Tenants in Housing Executive and housing association  dwellings &mdash;</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member&rsquo;s time is almost up.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  Thank you very much.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>: As  a member of the Social Development Committee, I agree that this motion is very  relevant. No one should underestimate the danger of fire. We have heard some statistics already; in the UK each year,  60,000 fires occur in homes, killing almost 700 people and injuring over 7,000  more. Many of those deaths and injuries could be prevented if only those  involved were alerted sooner. This is where smoke alarms can help. They do not  stop fires, nor can they put fires out, but, if properly installed and looked  after, they can give early warning of a fire and provide time to escape.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the good work that has been done by all the  various stakeholders, such as housing associations, the Housing Executive and  the Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service. However, there are still far too  many homes in both the private- and public-housing sectors that do not have  smoke alarms.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">My colleague Mr Campbell has already mentioned the good  work that has been done by the Housing Executive.  However, it is alarming that 23,000 Housing Executive homes still do not have smoke alarms. Almost 74% of  Housing Executive properties are covered, which is good, but a lot more work  still needs to be done. The Housing Executive must take note of the need to put  much more effort in there.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The housing associations are in a better position. When  they started to build new homes, the Housing (Management of Houses in Multiple  Occupation) Regulations (Northern    Ireland) 1993 were already in place, so they  were forced to put hard-wired smoke alarms in every home. A study that was published  only last week estimated that 95% of all housing association properties are  covered by such alarms. Housing associations look after 28,000 homes in Northern Ireland.  A lot of good work has been done, but a lot more is required.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Chairman of the  Social Development Committee also mentioned the private sector, which  has what might be the biggest problem of all. There is no real requirement for  a smoke alarm to be put in any private-rented house. That is a major issue. It  is good to see that there is going to be a review of the regulations around the  rental of private properties. Perhaps at that stage, the House will be able to  change the fact that there are no requirements for smoke alarms.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">There have been frequent advertising campaigns, some of which  have taken place in recent years, and DSD has contributed to them.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">In fact, funding from the Department for Social Development  enabled the Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service to install smoke alarms in  people&rsquo;s homes. That was almost 10 years ago, and many of those alarms are  still in place today. The Fire and Rescue Service still runs a home fire-safety  check scheme, where the public can request a safety check to be carried out. It  can be booked either via the Internet or by calling the Fire and Rescue Service  directly. Not only is a check carried out, the householder is given a free  smoke alarm.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Fire and Rescue Service actively seeks out and targets  high-risk areas, and officers will carry out leaflet drops that detail the  fire-safety scheme. Lessons have been learned from giving out smoke alarms in  the past. The free smoke alarm has a 10-year life and &mdash; much more importantly &mdash;  its battery will not fit any other device, so there is no risk of its being  used for anything else.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">A great deal of work has been carried out by many of the  stakeholders, but much more needs to be done. I, therefore, commend the motion.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Hanna</strong>: I  support the motion, as a member of the  Health, Social Services and Public Safety Committee. Figures for fire  deaths and injuries in Northern    Ireland have fallen in recent years, but  they are still too high. Many domestic fires could have been prevented, had  working smoke alarms been fitted in those homes. Every life lost in a fire is a  tragedy, and, in some cases, the tragedy could have been prevented. It is important that the Northern Ireland Fire and  Rescue Service works in partnership with all Departments, statutory and local, which have a part to play,  especially council departments such as environmental health, and with  voluntary organisations on a programme aimed at fire prevention in both private  and social housing.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">It is widely advertised  by the Fire and Rescue Service that one is twice as likely to die in a  fire at home if a smoke alarm has not been fitted. It is the simplest way of  warning someone of a fire, giving precious time to escape. I am sure that we  have all seen the &ldquo;Thumbs Up On Monday&rdquo; advertisement from the Fire and Rescue  Service. It is a very good way of reminding people to test their alarms.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Fire and Rescue Service has various multimedia  campaigns that encourage people to take positive steps to protect themselves  and their families; its constant aim being to reduce the number of deaths and injuries caused by house fires. Various messages  include, for example, the need to check smoke alarm batteries; the need  to ensure that candles are well extinguished; the need for householders to have  an escape plan in case of fire; and the dangers of using a chip pan. That type  of education must continue: people must be reminded of the dangers of fire, and  warned that complacency and carelessness  will increase the risk of fire in the home.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Regulation and  inspection is important, and nowhere more so than in private-rented accommodation,  and in houses in multiple occupation. Landlords have a legal responsibility to provide fire escapes and, depending on  the size of the property, smoke alarms and fire extinguishers may also  provided. Furthermore, they must ensure that gas and electricity supplies are  safe. However, it can be a mistake to leave all these matters to landlords.  Equipment must be regulated and regularly examined.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">In the previous  Assembly, the Minister of Finance and <span style="letter-spacing:-.4pt; ">Personnel,  when he was Minister for Regional Development</span>, introduced a regulation  that made hard-wired smoke alarms mandatory in new houses and in houses  where the electric supply was being updated. That should be the case for all  newly installed smoke alarms, because research tells us that hard-wired smoke  alarms save more lives.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">People must take responsibility for their own safety, and  it is important to be prepared, whether one lives in shared accommodation or a family house, to be respon&shy;sible for fire safety at home. Voluntary and statutory organisations  carry out very positive work in installing smoke alarms, and that can be built  upon.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>:  I, too, support the motion as a member of  the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety. From time to time, we are shocked and  disturbed to hear of tragedies involving fire in the home.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The loss of innocent lives is always regrettable and  depressing. It has a lasting impact on families and communities and gives  dreadful pain long after the reporting of the events has ceased to be in the  news. Part of that impact comes from the  realisation that death from fire or smoke inhalation is often the  outcome of a momentary act of carelessness and might have been easily  prevented. In that context, we must congratulate the voluntary and statutory  agencies &mdash; particularly the Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service &mdash; for the  enormous work that they have done in developing and implementing fire prevention programmes and strategies across Northern Ireland.</p>
	        <p class="TimePeriod">12.45 pm</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">In the North Down constituency, many people have approached  me and asked me to thank the local fire and  rescue personnel for their proactive work in visiting homes to make fire-risk assessments, install or  reposition alarms, or give invaluable advice on advance action to  minimise the risk of a house fire. We must also be thankful that, since 2000,  building regulations have required that buildings be designed and built with  automatic fire detection, not only to give warning of fires but to facilitate  evacuation in an emergency.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Much has been achieved  through television in making the public aware of the dangers and causes  of fire, the need to have working alarms and how to train and plan for  emergencies. Everyone is aware of the dangers posed by chip pans, candles,  matches, smoking and &mdash; in particular &mdash; alcohol, which is a major factor in more  than one third of fires in which there is a fatality.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Many schools do good work in providing pupils with health  and safety programmes that develop their experience  and awareness. The schools that incorporate work on such issues into the curriculum must be rewarded. As a result of the good work that is being done,  approx&shy;imately 96% of homes have smoke alarms. Much remains to be done  to ensure that alarms are properly fitted,  located and functioning. The statistics are a credit to those who have  engaged in a joined-up effort and worked hard in co-operation with various  Government agencies, but there is still much to be done. We cannot be  complacent. One death by fire or smoke inhalation &mdash; often the real killer &mdash; is  a death too many.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">As we applaud and recognise the positive efforts of voluntary and statutory agencies, we must be  concerned that some dwellings in the private- and social-housing sectors  do not have properly fitted or functioning smoke alarms. The Assembly must  ensure that appropriate equipment is provided for those whose physical or  sensory disability necessitates special measures and consideration.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">It is imperative that  the various Departments continue to encourage and support the actions  already being taken and co-operate in ensuring that a cost-effective and  co-ordinated programme is in place to ensure the provision of working smoke  detectors in every home in Northern    Ireland.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Health, Social Services and Public  Safety (Mr McGimpsey)</strong>: This important motion calls on my Department, as  sponsor of the Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service, to join the Department  for Social Development and the Department of Finance and Personnel (DFP) in a  co-ordinated programme to ensure the  provision of working smoke detectors in every home.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Health Committee has  rightly recognised the positive work of voluntary and statutory  organisations in promoting the installation  of smoke alarms in homes. I also appreciate the efforts of everyone  involved in promoting fire safety. Everyone knows that the causes of fires &mdash;  both accidental and deliberate &mdash; are many and varied, and they all have  potentially devastating consequences. It is, therefore, important that we do everything necessary to prevent accidental fires  in homes.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Fire and Rescue Service has a statutory duty to provide  information and encourage steps that might be taken to prevent fires and death  or injury by fire. It carries out that duty  in a range of ways, such as providing information on the prevention of  chip-pan fires and the importance of smoke alarms, and visiting homes and  schools to advise on fire safety and prevention.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Most people who die in fires succumb to smoke inhalation  long before the fire reaches them. Smoke alarms are the simple answer to  alerting people when a fire starts, giving them valuable time to escape. An  independent face-to-face fire-safety survey carried out last year showed that 94% of houses in Northern Ireland are fitted  with smoke alarms, but we cannot be complacent.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">It is not enough to have  a smoke alarm fitted in every house; occupants must ensure that the  devices are working and that they remain working. It is worth noting that as  today is Monday, we should remember the &ldquo;Thumbs Up On Monday&rdquo; campaign. Indeed,  I hope that everyone tests their smoke  alarms every week.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Northern Ireland  can pride itself on having among the fewest fire-related deaths in the UK. Building  regulations already require the installation of mains-powered smoke alarms in  all newly built dwellings. In dwellings for  which significant alterations are required, such as the upgrading of  electrical systems, mains-powered smoke alarms are also installed as standard.  An estimated 97% of housing association properties now have such alarms.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Since the 1990s, the Housing Executive&rsquo;s policy has been to  install mains-powered smoke alarms in all its flats, maisonettes and bungalows.  That work continues, and, to date, 74% of Housing Executive dwellings have had  mains-powered smoke alarms fitted.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Fire and Rescue  Service has also adopted several  approaches that are aimed at reducing the number of deaths that occur as  a result of fire. Included in those approaches is the free fitting of smoke alarms in domestic premises; indeed,  around 6,000 were fitted in 2006-07. In the same year, over 7,500 free home  fire-safety checks were carried out.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The efforts of the Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service  have resulted in the number of accidental fires in dwellings decreasing from  1,005 in 2004 to 830 in 2007. Accidental fire-related deaths decreased from 30  in 1999 to 14 in 2006-07.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I am sad to say that it is still the case that some  firefighters who have been called to incidents find that older smoke alarms may  not have working batteries fitted or that the battery has been removed for use  in another appliance. New smoke alarms have integral batteries that are either  unsuitable for other appliances or are  hard-wired to the mains electricity supply.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">We must persevere with the public awareness campaigns. The  &ldquo;Thumbs Up On Monday&rdquo; campaign highlights the need to acquire and fit a smoke  alarm; the No Battery, No Chance strategy urges us to check the battery in our  smoke alarms; the &ldquo;Writing on the Wall&rdquo; campaign highlights fire risks in the  home; and the approach behind the &ldquo;Smoke Kills&rdquo; slogan brings home dramatically  the consequences of not having a working smoke alarm. When public services act  for the public good, some people will always fail to recognise the risk that is  involved in not complying with either legislation or common sense.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Part of the Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service&rsquo;s  remit is a duty to educate the public on fire safety. I am sure that all Members agree that prevention is  better than cure.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, to address the point that was made about  collaboration between DSD and DFP, I have already outlined the areas of  departmental responsibility that have an impact on fire safety. The Northern  Ireland Fire and Rescue Service is the  expert body in firefighting and prevention. In accordance with national  guidance, the service evaluates the risk  that fire and other dangers have for life, property and the environment,  and it seeks to deploy resources that will address those risks.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">In the spirit of the motion, I am content to order officials to examine more closely the work on the  matter that DSD and DFP are doing. That work should be advanced, because  we can never be too complacent. A recent survey on smoke detectors in homes  showed that, sadly, 23% of people who did not have a smoke alarm said that they  would be unlikely to purchase one. That  shows that some resistance remains. It is, therefore, right that the Committee highlights one  of the hurdles that prevents us from reaching the point where we can, as far as  possible, eliminate accidental fires and deaths that are related to such fires.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs O&rsquo;Neill</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I commend my colleagues in the Health  Committee for tabling the motion. I thank everyone who contributed to the  debate, including members of the Health Committee and the Committee for Social  Development.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Minister for attending the debate. The motion calls for concerted action by three  Departments, and I am pleased that the Minister has been able to  respond. Perhaps he also responded on behalf of the other two Departments.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">In opening the debate, the Chairperson of the Committee for  Health, Social Services and Public Safety, Mrs Robinson, rightly paid tribute  to the work of the statutory and voluntary organisations, which have helped to  put us at the top of the league table for ownership of smoke alarms. The work  of the Fire and Rescue Service, the Housing Executive and others &mdash; and the  recent changes in building regulations &mdash; have contributed to that. However, as  Mrs Robinson and other Members pointed out, it is not just a matter of owning  or fitting a smoke alarm; it is also crucial to maintain it and keep it in  working order.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">As well as the number of fitted smoke alarms that are not  maintained, we must consider the many homes that still do not have a working  smoke alarm. The Chairperson set out some very stark statistics about the  consequences of not having a working smoke alarm. She told us that there were  830 accidental house fires last year &mdash; eight people lost their lives and more  than 250 were injured. A total of 33 people have lost their lives in house  fires during the past four years. The most  shocking statistic is that 14 of those homes did not have a smoke alarm,  and in eight other cases, although smoke alarms were fitted, they were not  working.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Mrs Robinson mentioned an issue that was taken up by other  Members, including Sue Ramsey and Gregory Campbell. Since 1990, the Housing  Executive has had a policy of fitting mains-powered smoke alarms in its  properties. Despite that, so far, only three quarters of all Housing Executive  properties have smoke alarms. That means that almost 23,000 homes in the  social-housing sector are without a smoke  alarm. That situation places a large number of people at serious and  unnecessary risk, and it must be tackled urgently.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Housing Executive figures show that although 95% of  bungalows, 92% of flats, and 90% of maisonettes have smoke alarms, the figure  for houses is just 60% &mdash; a stark variation.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Sue Ramsey commended the Housing Executive for its policy  of fitting smoke alarms over a number of years, but expressed concern about the  number of houses still without a working smoke alarm. She also raised the issue  of the number of private-sector houses that still do not have a working smoke alarm.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Bob Coulter and several other Members expressed concern about the number of people who do not  regularly check the batteries of their smoke alarms. He said that it  would be better if smoke alarms were wired to the electricity supply, rather than powered by battery. He also supported the good work of the Fire and Rescue  Service.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Kieran McCarthy also referred to the good work of the Fire  and Rescue Service, and said that one fatality was one too many. He called for  the resourcing for smoke alarms to be adequate for the job, and he expressed  concern about funding for the Fire and Rescue Service &mdash; a concern that is  shared by the Committee. The Committee is not only calling for the Department  of Health, Social Services and Public Safety to take action, but the Department  of Finance and Personnel and the Department for Social Develop&shy;ment. The  Committee firmly commends the good work of the Fire and Rescue Service.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Gregory Campbell highlighted the shocking fact that, apart  from houses in multiple occupation, there is no requirement to fit smoke  detectors in privately rented dwellings. That is particularly worrying, since  research has shown that those most at risk of fire are those who live in rented accommodation, and pensioners who live  alone. That situation is unacceptable and it must be addressed urgently.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Fra McCann highlighted the thousands of homes without a  working smoke alarm and called for more detailed information. He referred to  the practice in other countries, whereby a fire alarm in every room is a standard requirement. He also referred to the  problems in the private-rented sector and in houses in multiple  occupation, and how they are regulated.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Carmel Hanna said that someone is twice as likely to die in  a house fire if a smoke alarm is not fitted. She highly commended the Fire and  Rescue Service for its good work on media  campaigns &mdash; and several Members referred  to the &ldquo;Thumbs Up On Monday&rdquo; campaign. She also said that privately rented properties required regulation.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Alex Easton praised the good work of the Fire and Rescue  Service and welcomed changes in building regulations. He said that much has  been achieved, but more needs to be done. He also praised the ongoing good work in schools to educate children on this  matter.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Jonathan Craig spoke about the important and welcome fact  that a new type of smoke alarm has become available. It has a 10-year lifespan  and uses batteries that cannot be used for any other purpose.</p>
	        <p class="TimePeriod">1.00 pm</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister set out the Fire and Rescue Service&rsquo;s role, praised its good work, and referred to the  &ldquo;Thumbs Up On Monday&rdquo; campaign. He  also spoke about changes to building control regulations, and he made a  commit&shy;ment to liaise with DFP and DSD in order to advance the work that has  been done on the matter.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, many Members have reminded us that in most  house fires, it is not fire, but smoke, that kills. A working smoke alarm can  provide vital time to allow people to escape, and it can save lives. The  Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety calls for concerted  action to be taken in order to ensure that every family is protected by a smoke  alarm. I, therefore, ask Members to support the motion. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
	        <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly recognises the positive work of voluntary  and statutory organisations in installing smoke alarms in homes; expresses  concern that many dwellings in both the private- and social-housing sectors  still do not have adequate working smoke alarms; and calls on the Department of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety, the Department for Social  Development and the Department of Finance and Personnel, to undertake a  coordinated programme to ensure the provision of working smoke detectors in  every home.</p>
	        <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="5"></a>Private Members&rsquo; Business</p>
	        <p class="H4StageHeading">Compensation for Farmers</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to one hour and 30 minutes for  the debate. The proposer of the motion will have 10 minutes to propose and 10  minutes to make the winding-up speech. All other Members who wish to speak will  have five minutes.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P J Bradley</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
	        <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly supports the case for compensation to be  provided to farmers and livestock owners who were subjected to their homes  being raided, and who endured financial loss, due to the misunderstanding by  the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, which has now been  confirmed, in relation to the source of alpha-nortestosterone discovered in  injured male cattle presented for slaughter.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Although I may not have many kind words to say to her  later, I welcome the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development to the  Chamber.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">It is regrettable that  I have had to table such a motion in order to obtain justice for the  farming families that were wrongly  victimised during the alpha-nortestosterone debacle in 2006. If the  Minister and the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (DARD) had the  courage to say that it was wrong for them to  assume that people were guilty until  proven innocent at that time, we would  not find ourselves seeking justice for the farmers and livestock owners  who were caught up in the consequences of  the Department&rsquo;s wrongful conclusions.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">In the aftermath of those events, DARD engaged the services of Professor Patrick Wall of University  College Dublin to investigate the  sampling and testing procedures that were used to detect illegal hormone  residues in cattle. In his October 2006 report, Professor Wall found those  procedures to be in order and compliant with all EU directives. He also  highlighted the Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute (AFBI) excellent work in that report, and I share the  conclusions that he arrived at in both those findings.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Department commissioned a second report, and, in November 2007, Joan Ruddock, a  non-executive member of the DARD board, published her review into the  events of spring 2006. Mrs Ruddock&rsquo;s findings confirmed what many of us said in  the immediate aftermath of the raids on the  homes of innocent families, and she commented on how DARD might improve  its approach to enforcement in the future.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">It is regrettable that an official report was required in  order to confirm that such defamatory intrusions had occurred, but at least Mrs Ruddock&rsquo;s report vindicated the  wrongly accused livestock owners. Those of us on the political front who  supported the farmers remain satisfied that that was the correct thing to do.  However, the sampling and testing procedures and the analytical work carried  out by the Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute were never the main issues. The  main &mdash; and, it could be said, the only &mdash;  issue was DARD&rsquo;s over-the-top reaction to the discovery of  alpha-nortestosterone in male-casualty animals that were presented for  slaughter. DARD simply got it wrong, and it is disappointing that, to date, the  Minister and the Department have failed to admit that.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">It was the opinion of DARD inspectors that, given that the  subject animals were hurriedly presented for slaughter  and that alpha-nortestosterone was discovered in the carcasses, the only  conclusion was that all the owners were introducing illegal growth promoters  into their cattle. Indeed, some farmers were blatantly told that it was obvious  that they had been using growth promoters and had simply been caught in the  act.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I have one owner&rsquo;s permission to describe his case. That  beef producer is a constituent of mine, and he is a highly respected family man  and a popular figure in the neighbourhood. On the morning of Friday 31 March  2006, he had just finished attending to stock on an out farm and was making his  way back to his home farm. As he neared his residence, he was alerted by the  flashing lights on the many police cars that were in the immediate vicinity of his home. That was an  introduction to the nightmare that was to follow; indeed, some might say  that that nightmare remains.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">On arriving at the bottom of his lane, he saw several people  in white protective clothing and masks going to and from the buildings in his  farmyard. If that was not frightening enough, he next saw uniformed police  officers looking out of his upstairs bedroom windows. He described the scene as  one that we would normally associate with  the preliminary investigation of a murder or major criminal incident,  not one that is commonly identified with  the day-to-day activities of a family farm.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Other farming families had similar traumatic experiences,  and the Department should not attempt to conveniently overlook the way in which  many of them were stigmatised in their  respective localities. Therefore, I ask the Assembly to agree that the  victims should be compensated in accordance with their individual experiences  and in keeping with their individual financial losses. By financial losses, I  refer to those farmers whose holdings were closed due to the incorrect  assumption of drug use, as a result of which they incurred additional cost  against the animals that they were unable to sell. Some animals crossed the  30-month deadline in the period of enforced closure, which also led to  substantial financial losses.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I will repeat the  comments that I made when I received a written answer from the Minister  of Agriculture and Rural Development on 14  December 2007. The Minister said that she had arranged for goodwill  payments to be made to those affected, and that that was beyond her statutory  obligation. The Minister has stated on several occasions that she had no  obligation to make any payments to the victims. That comment would have been  correct, and quite acceptable, had drug use been detected at slaughter.  However, this is a completely different situation, because the slaughtered  animals were thrown into skips on the erroneous assumption that they had all  been subjected to growth-promoting drugs. The payment was an obligation, not a  goodwill gesture. It served to stall the  legal action that some of the wrongly accused livestock owners had  planned to take.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I remain committed to seeking justice and compen&shy;sation,  where appropriate, for the victims. It is not that I take any delight in doing  so, but I feel obliged, on behalf of the  farming community, to remind the Minister that, on the hustings in  Cookstown last March, on behalf of Sinn F&eacute;in she promised the farmers who were  caught up in the issue that, if she were returned to the Assembly, she would  leave no stone unturned until they got justice. Other candidates represented  the DUP, the Ulster Unionist Party and the Alliance Party; I represented the  SDLP. All five of us assured the victims of the testosterone case that we were  fully behind them in their quest for  justice. All the candidates who were on that platform in Cookstown were  re-elected, but we find ourselves at different levels in the Assembly  structure. The Minister is the only one who can make the conscientious decision  to compensate, and that would demonstrate, albeit late in the day, the  sincerity of the pre-election promise that she made last March in Cookstown.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, as a mere  Member, I ask my Assembly colleagues to support the motion, and I make  one more appeal to the Minister simply to do what is right in the matter.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy  Chairperson of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development (Mr Elliott)</strong>:  I apologise for arriving late. I have just been told that I must speak on  behalf of the Committee because the Chairperson  is absent, for which he sends his apologies.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I thank Mr Bradley for proposing the motion. I welcome and  support it, and I endorse the call for compensation for those involved in what  can only be called a witch-hunt against perfectly innocent people. The  Department of Agriculture must strike a balance &mdash; as the Minister realises &mdash;  between ensuring that nothing untoward goes on in the Department, or in the  actions of farmers, and ensuring that the security of premises and animals,  which leads to the security of the people  who eat the produce, is protected at all times.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee for  Agriculture and Rural Development has been interested in the compensation  issue for some time, and, like Mr Bradley, I have taken a personal interest in  the matter. On 13 November 2007, the Committee received Joan Ruddock&rsquo;s report  in private session, and it listened to a  presentation on the outcome of her review. Mrs Ruddock&rsquo;s review  concerned the Department&rsquo;s handling of the matter in response to the findings  of the hormone in cattle presented at meat plants after on-farm emergency  slaughter.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">As Members may know, legislation banning the use of  anabolic steroids has been in place since 1988. On 10 March 2006, a sample from  an emergency on-farm slaughter tested positive for that hormone. Further tests  and samples from similar animals were also positive. However, the Department&rsquo;s  reaction was over the top and was, in many cases, unnecessary.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I reiterate that I  support the Department taking signif&shy;icant action against those who are  guilty of offences. However, in this instance, those people were not found  guilty of any offence, and that is where the difficulty arises.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I have had a blow-by-blow account from the people who were  affected by what happened. They told me that enforcement officials from the  Department of Agriculture and Rural Development arrived on-farm with a huge  security presence. They almost sealed off the farm; they searched the farm  buildings, and, in some cases, the farmhouses. Such actions were totally  unnecessary, especially in situations in which a farmer happened to be an  elderly person who was running the farm on their own. The opportunity for such  a person to deliberately administer alpha-nortestosterone was practically  impossible. Therefore, a common-sense approach is required in such situations.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I am also aware, because people in my constituency had this  problem, that farmers were prevented from moving stock off farms, and that that  included moving stock directly to  abattoirs. As some of the cattle involved were approaching 30 months  old, and as farmers were unable to sell them directly to the factories or  abattoirs, it meant that as soon as they became 30 months old, their prices  were cut automatically when they went to the factory.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, there are two immediate issues: the extra cost  of keeping those cattle on-farm for up to four months, and the additional cost  of losing money, because once cattle are over 30 months old there is an  automatic penalty from the factories regarding the price they give to the  farmer. Therefore, farmers lost twice on such occasions.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I am not asking the Department to take any major action in  this instance; I am asking it to consider the small number of cases involved on  an individual basis and to compensate those farmers who have been hard done by.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  I thank P J Bradley for tabling the motion. On 7 June 2007, the Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development met with farmers to explain why such an  aggressive course of action had been adopted as regards the slaughter of cattle  that had tested positive for what I will simply call alpha-N &mdash; I cannot get  that big word out.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">During the meeting, the  Minister informed represent&shy;atives that because there was no evidence to  support illegal administration of the substance, and, indeed, because it was highly likely that alpha-N is a  naturally occurring chemical, a goodwill payment would be made to any farmer where no criminality was  suspected. That would apply to the vast majority, if not all, the cases  in question.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Although I acknowledge fully that consumer protection in  the agri-food industry is essential, and that on-farm enforcement is vital to  remove animals from the food chain, I have to question the heavy-handed  approach to enforcement that was taken by the Department of Agriculture and  Rural Development. However, I do welcome the review that the Minister undertook  &mdash; as a result of farmers&rsquo; deep-seated disquiet at the implementation of on-farm  testing &mdash; to try and learn lessons from the debacle of last year.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Although compensation  for loss of animals is essential where no illegality was evident, the  Minister must also recognise that some farmers suffered further financial loss  because of the stringency of her Department&rsquo;s approach, legal though it may  have been. The simple point is that farmers lost out financially due to the  disruption of selling animals, having to keep them fed and because of the  shadow of suspicion hanging over them as supposed wrongdoers. The Minister must  realise that farmers cannot take those financial losses and that it was her  Department&rsquo;s rigorous, if not over-zealous, approach that caused financial  hardship.</p>
	        <p class="TimePeriod">1.15 pm</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I urge the Minister to rethink her approach and to ensure,  as a matter of urgency and priority, that farmers suffer no financial loss  whatsoever as a result of her Department&rsquo;s actions. I support the motion.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Doherty</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. It is a pity that Mr P J Bradley did  not deal with all the facts when he proposed the motion. The incidents happened  in the year before the Assembly was  re-established &mdash; the year before Michelle Gildernew was appointed  Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">When Professor Patrick Wall produced scientific evidence  that alpha-N &mdash; I could try to improve on Mr Clarke&rsquo;s pronunciation, but I am  almost as bad &mdash; could be produced naturally, particularly in male cattle, one  of Ms Gildernew&rsquo;s first actions as Minister was to initiate a review. She did not have to do that. She brought the  farmers together at Cookstown. She brought all of her senior officials,  including her new permanent secretary, to the meeting, and gave a very clear  explanation to the farmers. An official apology was offered, and a goodwill  payment was made, although the Department was not legally bound to do so. A  review into the whole incident was initiated so that lessons could be learned.  The results of that review were made known to the affected farmers, and were published  on the DARD website.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Some of the raids, particularly those in Newry, in which  not only the PSNI but the British Army were involved, with helicopters flying  overhead, were entirely over the top. That was entirely unnecessary. However,  the question of compensation must be directed at the NIO and the Police  Ombudsman. That is where responsibility for the heavy-handedness lies.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister took a good and solid initiative to deal with  the issue. To have a go at her and her party is to play politics, rather than  to deal with the facts of the matter. The events in question happened a year  before the Minister came into office. She did not have to initiate a review,  but did so because it was the right thing to do, and she offered goodwill  payments. The Department has been told that, legally, it cannot go beyond that.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">There is an issue in respect of compensation, but the  proposer is taking aim at the wrong Department. The demand for compensation  should be aimed at the NIO and the Police Ombudsman, since it is with those  agencies that responsibility for heavy-handedness, rough treatment and sullying  &mdash; if not destruction &mdash; of reputations, lies.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Members who propose  motions should deal with and stick  to the facts, and stop trying to score political points.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  join other Members in congratulating P J Bradley on securing this debate. I  welcome the fact that the House has a chance to discuss this matter, although  we may comprise rather a thin gathering at this stage of the afternoon.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">A small number of people suffered significantly because of the problems created by  alpha-nortestosterone &mdash; I will try that pronunciation, and see whether I  can beat Mr Clarke to it.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The first issue that was highlighted by a number of Members is the alleged criminalisation of honest  farmers. We have heard about some of the heavy-handedness, and the way  in which police raids were conducted. That created enormous difficulties for  people who were decent law-abiding citizens.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">However, the reputations of those honest citizens are  undamaged. They have been entirely vindicated by the work that has been done.  Today, we are dealing with the secondary issue &mdash; the financial loss that those  individuals suffered because they had been wrongly suspected. They lost the  value of cattle, their herds were closed, and, as Mr Elliott said, in some  cases, they lost the value of other cattle. He referred to indirect losses,  whereby cattle were retained for longer than 30 months.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">That is the only proper issue that can be debated by the  Assembly. Over the years, we have seen that, with regard to other animal disease issues &mdash; brucellosis, TB and foot-and-mouth disease &mdash; appropriate  compensation has been paid. However, when it comes to this issue, which  involves a remarkably small number of people, the Minister appears reluctant to  offer realistic compensation for losses suffered.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Trevor Clarke and other Members mentioned public health.  There is no doubt that when action was taken by DARD, it was taken in  accordance with the best understanding of the existing science. However, now  that science has moved on, it is clear that a small number of people suffered  grievous unnecessary loss.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">In his introductory remarks, P J Bradley rightly  highlighted the Cookstown hustings meeting that was organised by the Ulster  Farmers&rsquo; Union in February 2007.  Representatives from five parties supported the case of those who had suffered wrongs, and they agreed that  action must be taken. Two of those representatives are now Ministers. Mr Poots  is no longer the DUP&rsquo;s agriculture spokesperson. However, the DUP view has been  adequately represented by Trevor Clarke. I am almost in complete agreement with  everything that has been said by P J  Bradley, Tom Elliott and Trevor Clarke.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">At that meeting, it was agreed that something must be done.  The meeting was held in order to discuss agricultural issues &mdash; not police  presence, harassment or criminalisation &mdash; and appropriate compensation. Account  must be taken of the type of costs that were highlighted by Tom Elliott &mdash;  direct costs that were lost when particular animals were taken, which were  compounded by, in some cases, the significant lost value for individuals who may have lost several animals that had  passed the 30-month deadline.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister has offered a goodwill payment. However, in  some senses, that has blunted the issue. The concern is appropriate  compensation for the losses that have been  suffered, not that of a goodwill payment, which suggests that there is  some slight doubt about what happened, but the Minister is still prepared to  express her goodwill. Real loss was suffered; therefore, real action must be  taken, not a goodwill effort that will simply fudge the issue.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I find Pat Doherty&rsquo;s remarks somewhat surprising. He  certainly outlined the actions that have been taken by the Minister. There is  probably a case to say that, so far, the new Minister has been more forthcoming  than a direct rule Minister might have been. However, that is not to say that  her actions have been satisfactory. I cannot understand how Mr Doherty can talk  about getting compensation from the NIO:  many other people have been subjected to police raids when they were  suspected of criminal activity. If the police act in accordance with the facts  as they understand them, there is no  question of compensation. The compensation that is being sought is for agricultural loss. The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development, who reports to the Assembly, is the person  who is responsible now. In that context, the  Assembly&rsquo;s call for proper compensation and not a fudged goodwill scheme is entirely reasonable and  should be supported by the House.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bresland</strong>:  I support the motion that has been proposed by Mr P J Bradley. The action that  has been taken by Department of Agriculture  and Rural Develop&shy;ment officials has clearly caused considerable  distress to the farmers and their families whose properties were raided. To  date, the Minister has implemented a review of her Department&rsquo;s handling of the  issue and has set aside &pound;80,000 to compensate the farmers involved. That is not  acceptable. The economic loss far outstrips the value of individual animals  that tested positive. The excessive  movement restrictions that were imposed by the Department have had a  considerable effect on those farmers&rsquo; incomes.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Livestock farmers in Northern Ireland continue to face  economic difficulties. The farmers who have been involved in the  alpha-nortestosterone debacle have had to face further economic hardship  because of herd restrictions. The good name of those farmers and their families  has also been defaced by DARD. It is simply unacceptable that the Minister can  prejudge the findings of the investigation and set aside a small amount of  money in the hope that the farmers and the issue will go away.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The farmers and their  families need an acknowledge&shy;ment from the Minister that their loss has  gone beyond the actual value of the animals involved and that any compensation should include the loss of earnings  because of herd restrictions that were imposed by DARD, and recognition  of the costs that farmers incurred because of those herd restrictions, such as  the feed costs that are associated with keeping cattle in sheds.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">DARD officials adopted a heavy-handed approach, blackened the names of farmers, destroyed their  standing in the community, and  inflicted stress on them and their families. It is time that the  Minister acknowledged that and acted accordingly. I support the motion.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr W Clarke</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat. In 2006, following the discovery of the hormone alpha-N in  a number of cattle, DARD conducted an investigation, based on the scientific  evidence of the day, which stated that the hormone could be present only if it  were administered illegally. That led to a number of heavy-handed searches of  farms, two of which occurred in Newry, one in Banbridge and one in Tandragee.  All of those raids involved DARD officials who were accompanied by the PSNI  and, in the case of the Newry raids, by British troops in helicopters. The  families who were involved were left shocked and traumatised by those events.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Following the initial raids, there were a further 156 discoveries &mdash; across the Six Counties &mdash; of the  hormone, and the cattle that were  identified as having the hormone were seized and destroyed. Later that  year, all of the farmers were vindicated when Professor Patrick Wall produced a report that proved that the hormone  occurred naturally in injured  animals. There was justifiable anger at the way in which the Department  of Agriculture and Rural Development had handled the affair. Even more damning  was the attitude that the Department had done nothing wrong, despite the fact  that the raids had been carried out on farms that belonged to people who were  innocent of any wrongdoing.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">As time passed, there was little focus on the issue, except  for the work of one journalist. As far as I can establish, the SDLP was silent  throughout the affair. On coming into office, the Minister, Ms Gildernew,  stated that it was an issue that she would address retrospectively &mdash; much to the  dismay and annoyance of DARD officials. The Minister wrote to all of the  farmers who were affected by the matter and invited them to a meeting in  Cookstown where senior officials and the new  permanent secretary listened to the farmers&rsquo; stories and their expressions  of anger about the way in which the Department had handled the issue.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">At the end of that meeting, the Minister and the permanent  secretary apologised to the farmers whose homes had been raided. The Minister  announced that DARD would issue an apology. The Department undertook a review,  which was head by Joan Ruddock. Its findings will be made public. Moreover, all  of the review&rsquo;s recommendations are currently being implemented.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister explored  the possibility of compensating farmers. However, the legal position was  clear: DARD has a statutory duty to investigate and pursue any potential  administration of illegal substances. Although the raids were legitimate, the  heavy-handed manner in which they were conducted, and the trauma that was caused  to the families who were involved, is a matter for the Police Ombudsman and the  NIO.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister has gone as  far as she is legally permitted to go. In many respects, she has gone  much further than that. The vast majority of farmers who were the victims of  the raids welcomed the initiative to address the issue. Some have approached  the Minister and thanked her for her assistance. They are more than satisfied by the initiative that was created by  the Minister. However, some of the families who were subjected to the  raids are still, rightly, angry about what happened. Their hurt will never go  away. The reputations of some of those people were tarnished. That grievance  requires a real willingness on behalf of the Department and the Minister to  understand the feelings of those people.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">P J Bradley has turned what was a positive initiative full  circle. He knows full well that the legal argument on compensation means that  the Minister&rsquo;s hands are tied. Of course, that does not mean that we are in any  way defending the actions of the Department on the matter. The nature of the  raids is a major cause for concern, which is something that we made clear when  we criticised the PSNI and the British Army at the time. However, the Minister  &mdash;</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr W Clarke</strong>:  I have only a short time left in which to speak.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I believe that the Minister should be congratulated on her  initiative. We should continue to examine ways of addressing the matter and of  alleviating the hurt. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	        <p class="TimePeriod">1.30 pm</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Irwin</strong>: I  thank Mr P J Bradley for bringing this motion to the House. As a dairy farmer,  I declare an interest in this matter.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I was contacted by a farmer from my constituency who was  extremely distressed, frustrated and incensed by the actions of the Department  of Agriculture when his premises were searched by departmental officials, in  conjunction with the police. The searches followed tests carried out in early  April 2006 on an on-farm emergency slaughter animal registered to him, which  were positive for alpha-nortestosterone.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">However, as we are all now well aware, the animal that  tested positive had not been subject to any form of hormone abuse. In fact, it  has since been proven that alpha-nortestosterone is produced when an animal is injured, hence its presence in injured on-farm  emergency slaughter animals. As that research concluded that not all cases of positive testing were the result of  malpractice by farmers, an additional test has been introduced to  distinguish between normal presence and abnormal presence. That, of course, is  a welcome procedure and should spare conscientious, hardworking farm families from any further instances of hurt and distress.  However, it remains the case that the Department, accompanied by the  PSNI, searched four farm premises in the belief that illegal activity had taken  place.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">On 17 November 2007, the Minister said:</p>
	        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The Review states that the actions taken by DARD in  respect of the surprise on-farm searches were in compliance with legislation.&rdquo;</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">However, the account of the search given to me by  my constituent leaves me feeling extremely annoyed by the attitude and actions  of the departmental officials who went to the premises.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Although the Minister said that she believed that the  Department acted in good faith and in line with the legislation, I find it  unacceptable that, even though DARD and ABFI raised the possibility of natural  occurrence a full two weeks before searching my constituent&rsquo;s premises, they  still went in full steam ahead, with a guilty-until-proven-innocent attitude.  That is extremely unfortunate, given the scientific research that was emerging  at the time, to which reference is made in the report.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Indeed, as regards malpractice, paragraph 3 of section 2.1  of the report on the review carried out by Joan Ruddock states:</p>
	        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The Department must have significant evidence to the  contrary, therefore before it can conclude that the farmer has not been guilty  of such administration.&rdquo;</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Given that scientific evidence was beginning to  pile up to show that there was a strong possibility that natural occurrence  through injury was the more likely reason for a positive test, surely the  Department should have taken a much more realistic and rational approach to any  planned searches. I ask the Minister to give a full account of why a more  level-headed approach was not adopted in the circumstances.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The fallout from the search of my constituent&rsquo;s premises  has been dramatic. The family name has been blackened around the country, and  false allegations and accusations have abounded. This was not simply a farm  search; my constituent stated that he could not even watch the staff carry out  their searches and procedures as their attitude towards him was shocking. I  doubt that that is in line with any legislation. I fully understand that the  Department is bound by law to carry out such tests. However, it is the manner  in which the searches were carried out, and  the assumption of wrongdoing, that is most untenable.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Doherty talked about political point-scoring. I am  certainly not trying to score political points, but the police raided those  farms in conjunction with, and at the  behest of, the Department of Agriculture. That must be taken into  account. The Department had the lead role in this affair.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The ex-gratia payments offered for the condemned cattle were welcomed by the farmers as a small  gesture. However, many farmers are considerably out of pocket due to  herd closure and the associated expenses. Great hurt still exists among those  farming families, and I support the case for compensation for the loss of those  animals, where it has been proven that no malpractice had taken place.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Can the Minister confirm what steps the Department is  taking in examining its approach to searches? How many more cases of positive testing have been discovered that  have been proven, through the new test, to be in no way related to hormone  abuse?</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Farmers remain out of pocket as a direct result of the  actions of the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development. I fully support  the need for a fair payout to those farmers  who had herds closed and who incurred significant expense, not to  mention the distress and the hurt caused by the decision to search their  premises.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member&rsquo;s time is almost up.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Irwin</strong>:  The Department must act now to rectify this  matter and to restore the trust of the farmers involved. I support the  motion.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Savage</strong>: I  declare an interest as a farmer, and commend the Member for South Down Mr  Bradley for securing the debate on such an important issue.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The use of hormonal substances for animal growth production  was prohibited by the EU in 1988, and legislation was introduced to prescribe  measures for monitoring residues and for the actions to be taken on the  discovery of positive results. The use of anabolic agents is prohibited for a  variety of reasons, including possible adverse human health effects, consumer  resistance, the negative effects on animal welfare and the impact of residues  on the environment.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Nortestosterone is a well-known anabolic steroid. It was  first synthesised in the 1950s and was believed initially to have no natural  source. Subsequently, it was shown to occur naturally in boars, stallions,  pregnant cows and veal calves. Its presence  in adult male bovines is currently deemed illegal under EU law.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">In light of the events that have taken place regarding the  use of nortestosterone in cattle, I wish to put on record my recognition of the  Minister&rsquo;s swift action in meeting the farmers associated with those cases just  one month after she took office. I welcome the fact that she has recognised the  plight of the farmers who lost animals without any evidence of wrongdoing on  their part, and that goodwill payments will be made to those who were affected.  It must also be recognised and put on the  record that the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development is  making those goodwill payments on a moral basis. That is because, under the  law, it has no statutory obligation to do so.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Ulster Farmers&rsquo; Union  has welcomed those goodwill payments along with the review that was ordered by  the Minister. It is pleasing that in the wake of Joan Ruddock&rsquo;s report on the  issue, the Department has developed an  action plan including mechanisms that will be built into the management  process to facilitate earlier and speedier responses to findings arising from  emerging science. In that regard, the Department will also adopt a project  management approach.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I commend the Minister for her endeavours, and I trust that all sides of the House will unite  around farmers who have been hard done by in this instance. I support  the motion.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  Ther isnae ocht that a can sae farther than whut his&rsquo; a&rsquo;ready bin saed, wi&rsquo;  ither memmers o&rsquo; tha semmilie. I wud jist laek tae agree wi&rsquo; whut tha  depertment saes aboot tha tratemunt o&rsquo; fermers.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">There is not much to add to that which has already been  said by other Members of the Assembly. I simply wish to endorse what the  Department has said in its report about the treatment of farmers.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister received a great deal of kudos for her  responses to the BSE and bluetongue crises. However, she is only as good as her  last win, and, with respect, the Department must continue to address the  issues.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The review of the Department&rsquo;s handling of the  alpha-nortestosterone issue recommended:</p>
	        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;That DARD examines  the manner in which it approaches on-farm searches with particular emphasis on  communication, taking into account that not all farmers subject to surprise  searches will have engaged in illegal activity&rdquo;.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Department&rsquo;s statement and Members&rsquo; descrip&shy;tions of some cases have highlighted the fact  that, sadly, something went wrong. However, the Department&rsquo;s statement  is at odds with the reality of the cases concerned.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">For many hard-working farmers, the most disturbing aspect  of that dreadful and costly mistake was that they had done nothing wrong, yet  they were treated with the utmost disrespect and with more suspicion than most criminals are subjected to during an interview.  Those men and women had their homes and livelihoods subjected to the  most rigorous scrutiny, and they were presumed guilty until they were proven  innocent. I do not profess to have a law degree, but I know that in this  country, in law, one is presumed to be  innocent until proven guilty. Why was that not presumed of the farmers?</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The farmers do not want ex-gratia payments; they want  realistic compensation. Compensation has been requested,  it is morally needed, and paying it is the least that the Department can  do. They do not want goodwill payments but real, honest-to-goodness  compensation. As well as paying the farmers the compensation that they are  rightly due, the Minister must carry out a review in order that a real and  practical change can be made to the way in which her Department treats people  and handles issues. In my constituency, I am aware of many instances of departmental officials calling at farms and  showing a certain disregard for the farmers and other farm workers. That  behaviour has been a bone of contention for some time, and I have made that  known to the Department.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that the farming community has a  relationship with the Minister; indeed, I encourage that relationship, as, I am  sure, does the Minister. However, in this instance, not only was the Department  proved wrong, but its actions have made the  farming community lose even more faith in it. DARD is supposedly there  to help farmers, not to harm their future prospects and make life difficult for  them. The Department is not doing its job correctly, and, as a matter of  urgency, it is up to the Minister to recognise and change that fact. I support  the motion.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I thank and congratulate P J Bradley for bringing the issue to the attention of  the House.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that we debate the matter because it raises  major questions about how Department of Agriculture and Rural Development  officials handled the episode. In the view of the majority of Members who have spoken so far, it is clear that important  lessons must be learnt as a consequence of the actions that departmental  officials took in April 2007. The episode has caused considerable distress to  several of my constituents, and my constituency colleague William Irwin rightly  highlighted that point. Reputations have been severely damaged, and farmers who  are well respected in the areas in which they have lived and operated their  farm business for many years have found themselves to be the subject of  speculation, ridicule and criticism. All that negativity is unfounded and is the responsibility of the Department of  Agriculture and Rural Development. The episode is a case in point that  proves that science does not always get it right, and Members have given examples of that in the evidence that they  have produced today.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I will briefly outline  some of the deep-seated criticisms that were made by farmers who were  caught up in the episode.</p>
	        <p class="TimePeriod">1.45 pm</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The constituent who raised the subject with me had his  bullock killed on 3 April 2006. Approximately three weeks later, on 27 April  2006, departmental officials and the PSNI raided his farm. Some Members find it  hugely ironic that, had the raids taken place pre-devolution, there would have been a major political row over  the actions of the PSNI and departmental officials. Happily, there is no such  row today, and the Minister presumably supports  the PSNI on those matters.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">However, the approach of the departmental officials in the  first instance raises serious issues. Some 11 staff, accompanied by 11 PSNI  officers, took part in the raid on my constituent&rsquo;s home, and back-up was  available in the form of additional PSNI officers who waited in minibuses on  the road. One questions the logic of that and, given the outcome, whether it  was effective use of police time.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">To the distress of the farmer and his family, the farmhouse  was ransacked and all manner of personal material was searched. He told me that  even the attic was searched. My constituent took advice to contact his  solicitor and to avail himself of independent tests on his cattle, for which he  had to pay. He also incurred additional feeding costs, because he was not  allowed to move other livestock.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Any rogue operators must be dealt with, but the Department  should learn hard lessons from those incidents, be prepared to own up to its  failings and at least compensate those  farmers who suffered considerable distress and whose reputations were  damaged.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Armstrong</strong>: I declare an interest in today&rsquo;s debate because I was one of  the last farmers to have a young male animal taken to the abattoir and found to  have an excess of that hormone in his blood. I assume that the Department did  not feel it necessary to visit my farm on the suspicion that I was keeping  hormones there.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The events that Members  are debating today illustrate what happens when an inflexible  bureaucracy gets things wrong. In this instance, things went horribly wrong,  with terrible consequences for innocent people. No doubt Members will hear that  lessons have been learned, and systems have been modified to ensure that it will not happen again. However, that is of  little comfort to the affected farmers and their families.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">A fundamental legal  principle of law is that someone is innocent until proven guilty. In  this sorry tale, raids were carried out on the homes of law-abiding farmers as  though the DARD officials were looking for drugs or illegal weapons. The officials should have appreciated that  they were dealing with hard-working, honest farmers, not terrorist godfathers  or criminals &mdash; there appears to be a marked reluctance to carry out searches on  the homes of those individuals, but farmers are a nice, soft target. The only  problem was that the farmers in Northern    Ireland were innocent.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I am not naive enough to believe that all farmers are  angels and free from any taint of wrongdoing. Farmers are the same as any  professionals, be they doctors, lawyers, teachers and perhaps even politicians,  and there are some bad apples among us. However, I am confident that the  majority of farmers are law-abiding individuals seeking to do an honest day&rsquo;s work and to provide for their families.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Ruddock  review concluded that surprise on-site searches are a necessary tool to ensure  enforcement of regulations, but greater emphasis must be placed on the need for  sensitivity in conducting such searches. That will allow a spirit of partnership to develop between the  Department and the farmers and a good working relationship to develop  for the benefit of all sides. It goes without saying that fair compensation  must be paid to the farmers affected.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The second key point is that science was not correct in  this case. That is a lesson for all those who operate in a bureaucracy. Box  ticking is the order of the day for many bureaucrats. There is no room for  common sense, or for questioning whether their actions are right &mdash; just as long  as the information fits the form that they are checking.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">This case shows starkly that the so-called experts &mdash;  whether they be in Dundonald House or in Brussels  &mdash; are not infallible. Not only do they get  things wrong, but the fundamentals on  which they base their directions can  also be wrong. When the experts accepted that they were wrong, I was  left wondering what other central tenets of  science on which they base decisions affecting farmers are also wrong.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development  (Ms Gildernew)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I have  listened with interest to the points raised by Members, and I wish to put a few  facts straight.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">On becoming Minister, there was no requirement for me to  reopen the issue as the Department was in the process of implementing the Wall  report, which concluded that the Department had acted on the best scientific  advice available at the time and that it had acted within the legislation. However,  I was acutely aware of the anger and frustration in the farming community;  therefore, I made it an early priority to deal with the issue on taking up  office.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I took immediate action on the alpha-nortestosterone issue.  I met with affected farmers to explain my Department&rsquo;s position and to hear  their views face to face. I apologised for  the disruption and distress caused by the on-farm searches. I took the  additional step of going beyond our statutory obligation and authorising a  goodwill payment to cover the cost of condemned animals. I also commissioned  Joan Ruddock to carry out an independent  review of the Department&rsquo;s handling of  the issue. All the recommendations have been accepted, and work is under  way to implement each of them as they apply to the Department to ensure better  handling arrangements in future.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The events happened the year before I took up office, but  when I came into office I acted immediately to rectify the matter to ensure  that it would not happen again. I am well aware of the issues raised. I intend  to summarise the main points of the alpha-nortestosterone issue, to clarify the  details of the goodwill payment made to farmers, and to explain the rationale  behind my decision not to pay compensation.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The  alpha-nortestosterone issue began in March 2006 when a male on-farm  emergency slaughter (OFES) animal that presented at a meat plant tested  positive for the illegal growth-promoting hormone alpha-nortestosterone. The  opinion of the highest scientific authority in Europe  at that time stated that a finding of alpha-nortestosterone in a male bovine  indicated illegal administration. EU legislation requires that where the  substance is found, the animal must be excluded from the food chain and an  investigation into the herd of origin carried out.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">As a result of two previous cases of illegal use of  alpha-nortestosterone where legal hormones were found in farm dwelling houses,  the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development&rsquo;s Veterinary Service  carried out a search of a dwelling house and farm under the authorisation of a  warrant signed by a resident magistrate.  Three further cases were investigated in a similar manner.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">P J Bradley has made numerous comments in the press about  my support for the police raids. This is not the forum to discuss my views on  policing, but rather an opportunity for me to explain how I dealt with the  unique situation. Subsequent investigations did not involve unannounced visits  or searches under warrant. Some of the comments by Members today have  capitalised on people&rsquo;s distress. I have also been struck by the absolute  hypocrisy of some Members who would not have been too annoyed about  nationalists or republicans being raided by police in the past.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">In order to protect public health and to fulfil EU  statutory obligations, 100% testing of male on-farm emergency slaughter cattle  was initiated in April 2006.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">That resulted in herd restrictions, and although I  appreciate that such restrictions can cause management difficulties on farms,  they are a necessary component of the Department&rsquo;s enforcement action.  Restrictions are not intended to penalise farmers, and our aim is to  de-restrict herds at the earliest opportunity. However, restrictions are  essential in ensuring that potential problems are contained on individual farms  and that the interests of the wider agrifood  industry are protected.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The matter was not restricted to south Down, it occurred throughout the North: there were a high  number of positives identified in all of the Six Counties, but no  evidence of illegal administration was detected during follow-up, on-farm  investigations. All of the animals that  tested positive were condemned and were removed from the food chain,  with the herd owner incurring the financial loss.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Following criticism from industry and public representatives,  who suggested that the Department&rsquo;s sampling and testing procedures may not  have been sufficiently robust, the Department commissioned Professor Patrick  Wall of University College Dublin to carry  out a full assessment of its procedures for hormone testing. Professor Wall&rsquo;s report was published in  October 2006 and confirmed the integrity and legitimacy of the  Department&rsquo;s sampling and testing procedures. He also concluded that the  accepted scientific opinion, which states  that alpha-nortestosterone does not occur naturally in male cattle, should be reviewed in light of  increasing evidence that the hormone may occur naturally as a result of  stress or injury.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">In March 2007, and as a result of Professor Wall&rsquo;s findings  and following detailed discussions with the relevant regulatory authorities,  the Department reduced testing of male OFES cattle from 100% to a risk-related  approach based on the opinion of the official vet at the meat plant. Legal  advice was sought from the departmental  solicitor&rsquo;s office on a number of occasions as the issue developed. That  advice confirmed that, under EU law, the  Department must remove male cattle that test positive for  alpha-nortestosterone from the food chain regardless of whether evidence of  illegal administration has been found. It also confirmed that the Department  must carry out appropriate follow-up investigations into the herd of origin.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Legal advice was clear that the Department can discharge  that responsibility without incurring legal liability to pay any compensation,  which is a vital point in the context of the  debate. Departmental lawyers also confirmed that the enforcement action  taken by the Department was reasonable and proportionate, was based on the best  scientific knowledge available at the time,  and was in line with the Department&rsquo;s community obligations.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>:  No, I will not.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">In June 2007, I met farmers who had been affected and  announced that, although the Department had no legal obligation to pay compensation,  I would make a goodwill payment to those whose animals had been condemned. That payment was recognition that  farmers had suffered financial loss through no fault of their own &mdash; it  was a gesture of goodwill towards the farming community and was not an  acceptance of liability by the Department to pay compensation. The payments  were equivalent to the market value of the animals at the time of slaughter,  and over &pound;87,000 was paid to 139 herd owners in July 2007. I became the  Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development in May 2007, and the payments  were made in June and July. Therefore, I dealt with the issue immediately after  coming into post.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">At the meeting in Cookstown, which a number of Members  alluded to, I apologised wholeheartedly for the disturbance and stress caused  by the on-farm searches. I am acutely aware of the trauma that was caused &mdash;  particularly the experience recounted by Bridget Morris &mdash; and undertook to  initiate a review of the Department&rsquo;s handling of the alpha-nortestosterone issue  to see what lessons could be learned. I appointed Joan Ruddock, a non-executive  member of the depart&shy;mental board, to carry out the review. Her task was to examine all aspects of the issue, including the  scientific basis for the initiation of action and the follow-up on-farm  investigations.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Ruddock Review was published in November 2007 and  concluded that the actions taken by the Department regarding on-farm searches  were in compliance with the legislation and were reasonable in the context of  the scientific knowledge available at the time,  and of previous experience of illegal administration of growth-promoting  hormones. The review confirmed that the Department is permitted to enforce its  statutory obligations without incurring liability to pay compens&shy;ation, and  that there is no statutory provision for the authorisation of compensation in  those circumstances.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Joan Ruddock also made a number of recommend&shy;ations on how  the Department could improve the handling of similar situations in the future.</p>
	        <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr McClarty] in the Chair)</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Those recommendations present a constructive way forward and will improve future handling  arrangements. I have accepted the recommendations, and they are  currently being implemented. I want to reiterate that point to ensure that this  situation does not arise again.</p>
	        <p class="TimePeriod">2.00 pm</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">There is now emerging EU recognition that  alpha-nortestosterone is likely to occur naturally in injured or stressed male  bovines. We expect that the European Community  Reference Laboratory will draft a guidance paper to reflect that  position. Further scientific work to inform the evidence base in this area is  expected to be completed by the end of February 2008. Officials are reviewing and updating the standard operating  procedures, which detail how DARD approaches on-farm searches, in order  to ensure that best practice is being followed. It is envisaged that that will be finalised by March 2008.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">As the review highlights, meat processors are an important  link between retailers and consumers. My Department is committed to involving  them more fully via their representative bodies in developing future  contingency plans.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">DARD&rsquo;s procedures and actions have been the subject of two  independent investigations: Professor Wall confirmed the legitimacy and  integrity of our sampling and testing procedures; and Joan Ruddock concluded  that enforcement actions were reasonable, given the circumstances that  prevailed at the time. Legal advice further confirmed that the legislation was implemented in a fair and proportionate manner and  that DARD is not liable to pay compensation. Furthermore, I took the  additional step of authorising a goodwill payment to farmers to cover the cost  of condemned animals. There was absolutely no statutory obligation to do so,  and, in my view, that decision fully satisfied the moral obligation under a  unique and unusual set of circumstances that had not been seen elsewhere.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">As the issue unfolded, I had to balance two main  priorities. First, there is DARD&rsquo;s statutory obligation to protect public  health and to maintain the reputation of the local livestock industry; my  Department must be permitted to enforce robustly the law for the greater good.  Secondly, I had to ensure that, when DARD enforces the law, no one is  unreasonably or unfairly treated. My  Department handled the alpha-nortestosterone issue in the most  reasonable manner possible, given the unique circumstances that prevailed at  that time.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">As the Minister, I am content that I dealt with the issue  proactively when I came into office: I met the farmers involved, apologised for  the trauma caused and went beyond DARD&rsquo;s statutory obligations by making a  goodwill payment to those farmers to cover the cost of condemned animals and to  help to alleviate any hardship that they were facing. I contend that that was  an honourable, balanced and correct response that recognised the financial  implications to the livestock owner.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Ruddock Report gives us a positive way forward, and the  Department will implement its recommendations in order to ensure better  handling arrangements in the future. For that reason, and because DARD&rsquo;s  actions were proportionate and in line with legal requirements, I cannot  support the motion. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P J Bradley</strong>:  Almost every Member who contributed to the debate to support the motion was  singing from the same hymn sheet, so I will not repeat all their comments.  However, I want to thank Mr Elliott, Mr Trevor Clarke, Mr Ford, Mr Bresland, Mr  Irwin, Mr Savage, Mr Shannon, Mr Kennedy and Mr Armstrong; I will deal with the  contributions from two other Members later. Every Member in the former category  referred to DARD&rsquo;s over-the-top reaction to the situation and related the  experiences of their own constituents, which are more important than anything  that Members have to say. It is those experiences on the ground that really  count, and some farmers are still suffering from the ordeals that they endured  on those terrible mornings.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I ask the Minister and DARD officials to read Hansard,  where they will find the words of responsible Members who are trying to do what  is right for their constituents. Those Members are simply seeking justice for  victims, a phrase that has been bandied about for the past 40 years. The  Department can do something for those victims, and I urge it to do so.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The contributions from  Mr Doherty and my colleague the Member for South Down Mr Willie Clarke  clearly indicate that they have no knowledge or understanding of the farming  community. I do not know whether they spoke to any farmers who had been raided  or heard any experiences at first hand. Pat  Doherty was certainly not aware of the thrust of the motion, which does  not concern which Minister was in situ or when the raids took place. The motion  simply concerns farmers who were wrongly accused by DARD, not any subsequent  reports. We could debate the issue until Tib&rsquo;s Eve, and the message would still  not get across: this debate was about farmers.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I remind Mr Pat Doherty  that it was not the Northern Ireland Office that told farmers that they  had been caught red-handed, nor was it police officers. In my constituency, it  was DARD vets who told people that they had been caught red-handed. Therefore,  there is no reason to direct blame at the  Northern Ireland Office.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Earlier today, Mr Doherty was appointed to the Committee  for Agriculture and Rural Development. I am already asking myself why he has  been slotted into that Committee if it is not to help farmers.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. Earlier today, P J Bradley proposed a  motion on behalf of the Business Committee.  He should refrain from making political points; he was happy enough to  move that motion. I would like a ruling on that matter.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: That is not a point of order.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P J Bradley</strong>:  My DARD Committee colleague Willie Clarke made a comment about the  heavy-handedness of the raids, but it took Mr Irwin to remind him that it was  DARD that called in the helicopters and the Police Service. He also criticised  a journalist for keeping the issue alive. That was very unfair to the  journalist, who cannot defend himself. I would like to think that I &mdash; and many  colleagues from neighbouring areas that were affected &mdash; also kept the issue  alive. I intend to continue to keep the issue alive. I do not know how much  further the issue can be taken by the House, but if there is reconsideration on  the part of the Minister and her Department, it might not be necessary to take it any further. The issue is not going to  go away.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to thank everyone who supported the motion. Before Members vote, I ask them to consider the  position of the farmers who had their homes raided and the way in which  they and their families have been stigmatised in their local communities. They  deserve better.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  Does the Member accept that, although the Minister indicated that the raids and  incidents took place before she took office, she is in office now, and the  opportunity exists for her to do something about it?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P J Bradley</strong>:  That is exactly the point. There is no question that the Minister is the person  with the power. She mentioned goodwill payments. I ask her to use her goodwill chequebook to offer the  compensation that this House demands on behalf of the farmers.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  Does the Member accept that the Minister said earlier that she was making a  political point, from her own point of view, about her support for the police? Does the Member accept that the  Minister might perhaps be a dab hand at getting compensation from the  security forces for the farmers, because she and her party have been a dab hand  at that?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P J Bradley</strong>:  I do not wish to relate this issue to any politics other than the politics of  the reason that we are here: on behalf of the farmers who have been victimised.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
	        <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly supports the case for compensation to be  provided to farmers and livestock owners who were subjected to their homes  being raided, and who endured financial loss, due to the misunderstanding by  the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, which has now been  confirmed, in relation to the source of alpha-nortestosterone discovered in  injured male cattle presented for slaughter.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Question Time is at 2.30 pm, so I propose to suspend this sitting  until that time. After Question Time, the next item of business will be the  Adjournment debate.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The sitting was suspended at 2.08 pm.</p>

	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Speaker has received notification from the First Minister  that, owing to business at Westminster,  he will not be present in the Chamber today for questions to the <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt; ">Office of the First Minister and deputy First  Minister (OFMDFM)</span>. As scheduled, the deputy First Minister will respond  to questions.</p>
	        <p class="H5StageHeading">Shared Future</p>
	        <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">1. <strong>Mrs Long </strong>asked the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister what its  assessment is of <span style="letter-spacing:-.05pt; ">the Executive&rsquo;s plans to  promote a shared future in light </span>of the draft Programme for Government.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO1444/08>(AQO 1444/08)</a></p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister (Mr M McGuinness)</strong>: A shared future policy and strategic framework  for good relations for here is an inherited policy from the previous Administration. However, as stated  previously, we are fully committed to promoting the interests of the  whole community towards the goal of a shared and better future and a  prosperous, peaceful and settled society.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">It is, therefore, a key priority of the Executive to  increase budgets dramatically in order to resource work to achieve those objectives.  Having considered the progress, we are working on detailed proposals for a  programme of cohesion and integration, which we will bring to the Committee for  the Office of the First Minister and deputy  First Minister for consideration. Key objectives, actions and targets  will be developed in the context of those proposals.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>:  Will the deputy First Minister give any indication of the timescale for the  publication of that programme? In the draft Programme for Government, it was  referred to as a programme to promote societal relations. Previous answers  indicated that there would be some detail in the new year. Can a more definite  timescale be provided?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: There is work to be undertaken on that matter. When that work has  been completed, we will be able to outline for the Assembly the time frame for  moving forward. There has been <span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt; ">significant  progress in the past three years with improved </span>relationships and  historically low levels of violence and tension. We want to ensure that relationships  in the community continue to improve. We also wish to address the challenges  that face new and host communities.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The objective of improving societal relations is <span style="letter-spacing:-.25pt; ">specifically addressed within the public service  agreement </span>framework. By contributing to the Executive&rsquo;s aim of building  a peaceful, fair and prosperous society, with respect for the rule of law, all  the key goals outlined in the draft Programme for Government can be seen to set  the context for the promotion of good relations.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">As I said, we have witnessed low levels of violence and  tension, and we must ensure that those gains are sustained. We must ensure that  our communities, our economic and business sectors, and our public services are  equipped and resourced at local level to face the challenge of increased numbers of newcomers, because newcomers  will enrich our cultural diversity and our <span style="letter-spacing:-.2pt; ">prosperity.  We must ensure that newcomers are integrated</span> into communities that are  not divided, separate or unequal. We are committed to building and shaping a  society that is free of sectarianism, racism and any form of intolerance.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  Is the deputy First Minister saying that an absence of violence is the only  standard by which to judge whether relationships have improved? In my constituency last week, anti-Catholic and  anti-Pope leaflets were distributed.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Given that he has said that there are dramatically increased budgets in the draft Programme for  Government for building community relations, will the deputy First Minister comment on the &pound;0&middot;6 million that his  Department proposes to take away from the Community Relations Council? Has he made an assessment of the impact  that that will have and of the implications of such a move?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: I, along with every Member of the Assembly, condemn any form of  sectarianism, whether it is the kind that took place in the Member&rsquo;s  constituency or the kind that occurred in  the Serpentine Road  area of Belfast  over the weekend. The draft Budget recognises that, over the past three  years, there has been significant progress in improved relationships, with  historically low levels of violence and  tension. We want to ensure that relationships continue to improve in the  whole community and to address the challenges that face new and host communities.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">In the past three  years, expenditure on good community and  good race relations was approximately &pound;21 million. In the draft Budget, we propose to increase that  invest&shy;ment to ensure continued  improvement in relationships and to address  the challenges facing new and host communities to almost &pound;28 million  over the next three years.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Investment during  2008-09 and 2010-11 will, therefore, be in the region of &pound;26 million,  taking into account efficiency savings during that period, to meet the public  service agreement target of improving societal relations. That money will be in  addition to EU Peace III funding. A key element of the investment proposals  includes a significant increase over that period to promote inclusion and  integration at a local level.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burnside</strong>:  I am sure that the deputy First Minister will agree that the best way of  ensuring a successful shared future for the community is for it to be based on  the right institutional framework for government. The mandatory coalition that  exists here, whereby all main parties are in Government, with no official  Opposition, has only one similar equivalent elsewhere in the world, and that is  the Lebanon.  That is hardly an example of a stable constitutional position.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">When will the deputy First Minister, and indeed the House,  examine constructive evolution from the post-conflict all-party mandatory  coalition to weighted majorities whereby we can voluntarily co-operate with one another in an Executive that is based on a  voluntary coalition, perhaps with weighted majorities that would reflect  the unionist and nationalist communities?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: We are where we are. We are here as a result of many months and  years of intensive negotiations, and we have eventually reached a situation  that appears to command the overwhelming support of our constituents.  Regardless of their dislike of mandatory coalitions, all parties recognised the  unique challenges that we faced: first, in reaching agreement, and secondly, in trying to achieve a situation in  which we could move forward together in a spirit of co-operation to provide  proper governance for the people whom we represent.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">We have reached that point against the backdrop of many  people telling us that it was not possible, that it would never happen, and  that, even if it did happen, it would be only a matter of weeks before things  fell apart. Quite clearly, that has not happened. We have confounded the  critics, and we are moving forward decisively to provide the type of governance  that people voted for in the Assembly elections. We are charged with the responsibility to deal with the political  structures that are before us at the moment.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I have just come from an  Executive meeting at which the four parties were very positive and  constructive about how we should move forward. We were dealing with vital  issues in the Budget, the Programme for Government, and the investment  strategy, looking to the next 10 years.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">People are entitled to dislike the present form of  government, but it is working in the interests of the people. They voted for it, and it is our duty and respons&shy;ibility  to take forward those structures in a way that helps them to reach their full  potential.</p>
	        <p class="H5StageHeading">Children&rsquo;s Fund</p>
	        <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">2. <strong>Mrs  Hanna </strong>asked the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister what  action it is taking to improve the Budget allocation for the children&rsquo;s fund.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=AQO1444/08> (AQO 1444/08)</a></p>
	        <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">5. <strong>Mrs M  Bradley </strong>asked the Office of the First Minister  and deputy First Minister what is its assessment of the implications of  any reduction in the current children&rsquo;s fund budget, particularly in relation  to child poverty and protection.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO1449/08>(AQO  1449/08)</a></p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: With your permission, a LeasCheann Comhairle, I will answer  questions 2 and 5 together.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The First Minister and  I, and our Executive colleagues, are committed to tackling child poverty  here. That was outlined in our draft Programme for Government and draft Budget  documents, which include a commitment to  achieve a reduction of 67,000 by 2010 in the number of children living  in poverty, compared with the 1998 level of 135,000. The junior Ministers made  the case strongly for significant funding for children&rsquo;s services in pre-Budget  discussions and succeeded in securing an allocation of &pound;26 million for the  Department of Education, the Department of Health, Social Services and Public  Safety, and the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure to facilitate the  continuation of projects that were previously funded by the children and young  people&rsquo;s funding package, in addition to a range of mainstream programmes.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Funding has also been allocated to take forward the  development of the play policy. In addition, funding has been secured for exemplar, area-based interventions, which  will help to demonstrate the effectiveness of early interventions locally and  highlight the benefits to children, young people, families and communities.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">As for the children&rsquo;s fund, all allocations in relation to  the priority funding packages that were initiated by direct rule Ministers, and  other ring-fenced items, have been removed from departmental baselines. That  was done on the basis that if the individual supported projects are considered  to be of significant value, the funding  streams should be in departmental programmes, rather than managed  through central funds.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">It is too soon to detail whether there has been an overall  reduction of funding for work with children. Ministers  have yet to finalise their priorities, and the final picture will become clear only when that has been  done.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Hanna</strong>:  Do the deputy First Minister and the junior Ministers believe that the  resources required to tackle child poverty and to provide good practical  parenting and early-years programmes, and resources for the needs of autistic  children, are available?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: We are facing a challenge, but we have the strategies and the  funding that are required to face the difficult issues regarding the  unacceptable levels of child poverty. The children and young people&rsquo;s action  plan that was published on 20 March 2007 detailed time-bound actions to be  taken by Departments, the NIO and the Courts Service, and it was designed to  deliver on the aims of the strategy. Future action plans will follow a  three-year cycle in line with Government finance policy. Work has begun on a review of the first action plan and the  development of the next three-year action plan to deliver on the six  high-level outcomes of the strategy. I am convinced, therefore, that if the Executive move forward decisively and  together &mdash; particularly with all Departments playing their part &mdash; we will have  the ability to make a big impact on the unacceptable levels of child poverty in  our society.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  We are not on target to eliminate severe child poverty by 2012. How does the Office  of the First Minister and deputy First Minister intend to achieve that aim when  there is a definite lack of resources and actions to tackle the issue as it  stands, never mind after 2008?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: The targets that we have set ourselves are ambitious, but with  goodwill on all sides &mdash; particularly with individual departmental involvement &mdash;  we can make a serious impact on the unacceptable levels of child poverty in  society. It is a tall order, but in the draft Programme for Government, we  committed ourselves to making an impact, and only time will tell whether that  is achievable.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  Will the deputy First Minister concede that the failure to mention childcare in  the draft Programme for Government is a sad reflection of the Executive&rsquo;s draft  priorities? Does he agree that we must invest in people &mdash; particularly children  and young families &mdash; and that failure to do so will have implications for child  poverty?</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The deputy First  Minister stated that &pound;26 million was being spent on children&rsquo;s funding. Will he  acknowledge that that is a significant reduction from the direct rule expenditure of &pound;51&middot;7 million guaranteed over two  years?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: We are supporting all sorts of programmes that can make a big  impact as we move forward. For instance, Sure Start is a targeted programme  designed to ensure that all children get a good start in life. It arose out of  the recognition that child poverty leads to unacceptable differences in life  chances, but it is available to all children under four in designated areas. It  aims to work with parents and children to promote the physical, intellectual  and social development of preschool children &mdash; particularly the disadvantaged &mdash;  to ensure that they are well prepared for school and later life.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">In areas in which Sure Start has been implemented, all families with children under the age of four,  including pregnant women, have access to a range of services, including early education and play, childcare,  healthcare and family support. Better co-ordination between the services  is being provided for children and families in the Sure Start areas, and that  is important. Sure Start represents an investment of &pound;9&middot;5 million for 2007-08.  Approximately 22,000 children under the age of four, and their families, have  access to the services provided under the programme in 25 projects.</p>
	        <p class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Seven new Sure Start projects will be operational by the  end of 2007-08. Nineteen existing projects have been extended, and that will  provide services for an additional 12,000 children and will ensure that 20% of  the most disadvantaged wards here are served by Sure Start. That is an example  of an intelligent direction of resources towards the right programmes. We  believe that if we can do that, it will have a big impact.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  I thank the deputy First Minister for his answers to the previous two  questions. Will he outline to the House the role of the junior Ministers in  promoting issues that are important in relation to children and young people?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: The junior Ministers have  been given special responsibility for co-ordinating policy and promoting  the rights and needs of children and young people. They are driving children&rsquo;s  issues forward and are taking the lead in reviewing, and revising as necessary,  the 10-year strategy for children and young people.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">All Departments will be involved in setting special targets over the next three years, which will be  published in a revised action plan for children and young people and  will be approved by the junior Ministers. The junior Ministers have had a  series of engagements with a number of individual voluntary-sector  organisations that advocate for children and  young people. In addition, they met  with a large group of non-governmental organi&shy;sations at the office of  the Commissioner for Children and Young People to listen to what they  considered were priority issues for children and young people.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">That is vital work, and  the junior Ministers recognise the importance of bringing a paper to the  Executive Committee meeting on 31 January that will seek an agreement to  re-establish a ministerial subcommittee as soon as possible with the intention  of improving the integration of policy and service delivery on cross-cutting  issues. They also intend to discuss those issues with the Committee of the  Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister, and it is intended that  all Ministers will be invited to the first meeting of the subcommittee to  decide their priorities.</p>
	        <p class="H5StageHeading">Civil Contingencies Policy Branch</p>
	        <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">3. <strong>Mr  Kennedy </strong>asked the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister  what plans it has to carry out a review of  the work of the civil contingencies policy branch.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO1292/08>(AQO 1292/08)</a></p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: The civil contingencies policy branch (CCPB) promotes civil  contingencies policy development and implementation across the public sector  and facilitates the co-ordination of responses to emergencies in an NI-wide  impact area.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The branch reviewed its operational structures and systems  in 2006-07, and a number of new cross-public-sector groups were established as  a result. Its work is kept under continual review in the light of ongoing risk  assessments and consultations with key stakeholders, including Departments,  emergency services and district councils.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I thank the deputy First Minister for his reply. Will he, along with his  Executive colleagues, consider recreating the civil contingencies fund, which  could compensate the owners of Orange Halls, for example, that have been  systematically burned down in what amounts  to a Province-wide, extremist, political campaign. It would help them when applying for speedy rebuilding  and reinstatement costs?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: Naturally, I express my sympathy to the Orange Order,  particularly in those areas where it has had its halls burnt as a clear result  of sectarian attacks. Those attacks are disgraceful, and the people involved  should be ashamed of themselves, along with those who attempt to burn GAA clubs  and foment division and conflict in our  society. They cannot be allowed to succeed.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">There is a duty on all of us to do everything in our power  to ensure that people who participate in those despicable attacks are brought before the courts. People in all  communities should co-operate with the PSNI to bring a halt to this ridiculous activity as soon as possible.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Orange Halls have had a particular financial burden, and  the First Minister and I have been involved in discussions with the British Government,  and between ourselves, regarding the real difficulty in which the Orange Order  finds itself.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The civil contingencies  policy branch is not responsible for the delivery of all civil  contingency activity. Each of the  Departments, their agencies and non-departmental public bodies are  responsible for civil contingencies in their sectors. Other responders, such as  the emergency services and district councils, have roles to play in planning  for and delivering a local response.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">CCPB&rsquo;s role is to promote effective civil contingencies policy and implement it across the  public sector &mdash; not to write plans for operational responses. OFMDFM has  offered a lead and has come out strongly against the attacks. It recognises the  financial burden that has been imposed on the Orange Order, and further  discussion will show whether that situation can be resolved.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I have a serous question in relation to emergency planning. Will the Minister confirm whether a bunker has been constructed,  allegedly in or around Ballymena, so  that, in the event of a grave or catastrophic event, there would be a  place of refuge?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>A Member</strong>:  For Junior? <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I suspect that more people than Junior might go to that place of refuge. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span><span class="B3BodyTextItalicChar"><span style="font-size:11.0pt; "> </span></span></p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">In the event of a grave or catastrophic event, there would  be a place of refuge for up to 300 people. Is the Minister aware that a bunker  has been constructed? Did it cost between &pound;300 million and &pound;400 million? Is he  prepared to lodge in the Assembly Library a list of the titles of the 300  people who may avail of that place of refuge? If that is true, does the  Minister agree that it is preposterous, and that there are far better projects  in the North on which public money could be spent?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First Minister</strong>: That sounds preposterous to me, and I  hope that I am not one of those 300 people. I know absolutely nothing about a  bunker in Ballymena or a list of 300 names. However, if it is a serious  question &mdash; and I presume that it is &mdash; we will all be interested in hearing the  answer from whoever constructed the bunker.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: If there is a bunker, places in it  will be allocated purely on a points system.<span class="Italic"> [Laughter.]</span></p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. T&aacute; ceist dh&aacute;ir&iacute;re agam.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister outline the role played by the civil  contingencies policy branch in the  aftermath of the recent fire tragedy in the Lammy area of Omagh? Go  raibh maith agat.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: The civil contingencies policy branch represented the First  Minister and deputy First Minister at multi-agency meetings on the recent fire  tragedy in Omagh. It liaised with colleagues in central and local government  and co-ordinated the response of the First Minister and deputy First Minister  to correspondence received in relation to that sad and tragic event.</p>
	        <p class="H5StageHeading">Good Relations</p>
	        <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">4. <strong>Mr  Neeson </strong>asked the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister to  confirm whether the fostering of good relations remains a key priority; and to  identify five key actions planned to deliver good relations in the context of  the draft Programme for Government 2008-11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=AQO1440/08> (AQO  1440/08)</a></p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: As OFMDFM said previously, it  is fully committed to tackling sectarianism, racism and intolerance. The  draft Programme for Government contains high-level commitments that support its  public statements. The example set by the House and the Executive demonstrates  our collective commitment to provide leadership in building the shared and  better future that our people deserve.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Our priority must be to build on the peaceful summers that  we have enjoyed recently. That has been the product of much hard work by many  people at interfaces and other areas who have successfully built and maintained  relationships, even at times of great tension. Our future strategy will be to  sustain that success and support measures such as the use of mobile phone  networks in campaigns to influence young people away from recreational rioting.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">As I have already said today, a key priority of the Executive is to dramatically increase budgets to  resource work to achieve those objectives. Much has been achieved, but  much remains to be done. That message is at the heart of the draft Programme  for Government and informs our relationships in Government.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Neeson</strong>:  Is the Minister aware of the statement that was made recently by five clergymen  in north Belfast, expressing their concerns about how the draft Programme for  Government deals with &mdash; or fails to deal with &mdash; divisions in our society?</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, is he aware that the latest edition of the  Community Relations Council&rsquo;s publication criticises how the Executive, through  the Programme for Government, have dealt with sectarianism? What is the deputy  First Minister&rsquo;s reaction to that criticism, and what does he plan to do about  it?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: The &lsquo;Shared Future&rsquo; framework document and the racial equality  strategy were debated on 4 June and 3 July 2007 respectively, and in line with  the resolutions to those motions, the Office of the First Minister and deputy  First Minister will introduce detailed plans, which are consistent with the Pledge of Office, to promote the whole  community&rsquo;s interests and to achieve  a shared future and a prosperous, peaceful and settled society. The  Department will also introduce plans for 2008-11 that will detail how racial  equality and an inclusive society for our increasingly diverse community can be  achieved. At the core of those proposals is the idea that action must be taken  to tackle racism, sectarianism and intolerance. We intend to discuss those  proposals shortly with the Committee for the Office of the First Minister and  deputy First Minister.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">People must recognise that the institutions have been in  place for only a few months. A great deal of hard work has been going on,  particularly on the development of the Programme for Government, the Budget,  and the 10-year investment strategy. It is, therefore, far too soon for people  to judge the quality of that work. Only when  proposals have been introduced and it is clear how they will be  implemented should people judge whether the Executive are making a real impact.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">However, I know that the sight of the First Minister, me  and the SDLP and Ulster Unionist Party Ministers has sent a positive message to  the entire community. Over the past eight months, tremendous work has been  done, and that will continue. Those who harboured the notion that all this  would fall apart have had to sit up and take notice that the parties are  dedicated to ensuring the fulfilment of the dreams and views of their  constituents.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, it is too soon to make judgements. People can  judge us properly only over time, so it is unfair to do so over a matter of  months. We have made rapid progress that I  believe will continue. However, people will be in a position to judge us  only when we have introduced and  implemented our proposals.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>:  Does the deputy First Minister agree that good relations should apply not only  to religious and political breakdown in Northern Ireland, but to ethnic  relations in the general population? That is a matter of increasing importance  in my constituency and in those of others. Should that aspect of good relations  not be given a much higher priority?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: I could not agree more. How we treat the newcomers who come to  our shores is one of the great challenges that we face in the North and,  indeed, on the island   of Ireland. There is no  doubt whatsoever that those newcomers have made important contributions to our  economic successes, our hospitals, schools and many of our other services. Such  good relations are a high priority for the Executive, and the First Minister  and I are dedicated to eradicating racism and sectarianism of whatever  description. That is reflected in our programmes and policies and in those that  Departments have adopted. It is clear that every Minister is as dedicated and  committed as us to the success of that work.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">In the past three years, around &pound;21 million has been spent  on good relations and good race relations, and, in the draft Budget, we have  proposed increasing that investment to approximately &pound;28 million over the next  three years in order to ensure continued improvement in relationships and to  address the challenges that face new and host communities. That is a substantial  financial commitment.</p>

	        <p class="H4StageHeading">Rural Planning Legislation</p>
	        <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">1. <strong>Mr  McElduff </strong>asked the Minister of the Environ&shy;ment what plans she has to make  an announcement on new rural planning legislation; and to detail the range and number of stakeholders with which her  Department is consulting on this matter.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO1366/08>(AQO  1366/08)</a></p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment (Mrs Foster)</strong>: When I reissued draft planning policy  statement (PPS) 14 on 25 October 2007, I stated my clear view that the review  of draft PPS 14 would have a short and focused timescale. I said that I would  publish a new draft PPS 14 within six months and that that would be followed by  a period of public consultation. I am holding to that commitment. The Executive  subcommittee has determined that, as part of the process, there should be  engagement with key stakeholders on the findings emerging from the review.  Therefore, meetings will be held in February at various locations across Northern Ireland;  the outcome of those meeting will also help to inform the revision of draft PPS  14.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  Is the Minister aware that the fall in planning applications, which has been  caused by the presumption against new single  homes in the countryside, is having a disastrous knock-on effect on the  rural economy, particularly in the building trade in counties such as Tyrone and Fermanagh, as has been  highlighted in the past week by University of Ulster economist Michael  Smyth? Have there been any Executive-level discussions about measures that  might be taken to support the building trade at present?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>: I continue to engage with all stakeholders, and I will be having a meeting soon with the  Construction Employers Federation about its concerns, not only in  relation to draft PPS 14, but across the spectrum. I also understand from my  officials in the Planning Service that five years&rsquo; worth of planning  applications have not yet been built. That being the case, I am somewhat  bemused by the allegation that builders all around the country are going to be  out of work when so many applications have not been taken up. Bearing that in  mind, as I said in answer to the initial question, I was determined that the  review would be focused and time constrained.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Member is fully aware that there will be stakeholder  engagement across Northern    Ireland, including &mdash; most notably for him &mdash;  in Omagh. We will discuss with the various stakeholders the emerging findings  from the review. I trust that he will also take the opportunity to speak to his  ministerial colleagues about progress on draft PPS 14.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burnside</strong>:  I am sure that the Minister will agree that  draft PPS 14 established a much too rigid framework, although that is  understandable, given what people call &ldquo;bungalow blight&rdquo;. There is a tremendous  trend among farmers for replacing many fine old stone-built houses in the  countryside with bungalows. They get planning permission for a replacement  house, they build a bungalow, and they let the old stone house fall apart. With  luck, it will be used to house a few cattle. During the review, will the  Minister consider giving an incentive, perhaps by means of a grant, to farmers  to improve fine old buildings rather than replace them with bungalows?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  I am happy to confirm that my Depart&shy;ment is carefully considering one issue to  which the Member referred &mdash; the fact that old buildings are being allowed to go to rack and ruin while new  buildings are being built close by.  We want to maintain vernacular buildings in the countryside, and we are  considering pertinent design issues. Many architects have made submissions to  me stating that design should form a large element of the policy outlined in  draft PPS 14. Therefore, I am very happy to confirm that we are examining that  area closely.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  With regard to the emergency bunker in Ballymena, the problem at the moment is  that, if Junior were to go into it, none of his party colleagues would want to  go in with him.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister  confirm whether the junior Minister Ian Paisley Jnr has attended  meetings of the working group on rural  planning? Will she also confirm whether he is a member of that group? In  view of his particular interest in planning, which not everyone would regard as  dispassionate, does she regard his participation as appropriate?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>: No planning permission has been granted for a bunker in  Ballymena; therefore, if one exists, my enforcement  team will be interested in having a look at it.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Regarding the actual question as opposed to the preamble,  the Ministers on the subcommittee are Nigel Dodds, Michelle Gildernew, the  junior Ministers Gerry Kelly and Ian Paisley Jnr, Conor Murphy, Margaret Ritchie and myself. We have had a good debate  regarding PPS 14. Three meetings have taken place: the first on 12  November 2007, the second on 10 December 2007 and the third on 14 January 2008.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The subcommittee is considering a range of policy options and is developing new policies that will  attempt to balance the needs of the environment and the rural  communities. We are also concerned &mdash; and this is an important point &mdash; with the  practical implementation of the policy, because, shortly after I took office,  it became clear to me when engaging with officials from the Planning Service that one of the most difficult issues regarding PPS 14 was with planners and the  difficulties that they had in implementing the policy. Therefore, we  must also consider that.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Regarding the  suitability of the two junior Ministers&rsquo; attendance at the subcommittee,  they are reporting back to the Office of the First Minister and deputy First  Minister, and I have no difficulty with that.</p>
	        <p class="H5StageHeading">Environmental Crime Team</p>
	        <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">2. <strong>Mr Hamilton </strong>asked the Minister of the  Environment to make a statement on  the success of the environmental crime team that exists within the  Environment and Heritage Service.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO1320/08>(AQO  1302/08)</a></p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  I have been greatly encouraged by the success that the Environment and Heritage  Service&rsquo;s (EHS) environmental crime team has achieved. Since 2005, it has  overseen 244 successful prosecutions against those convicted of illegal-waste  offences. Those cases have generated fines of &pound;568,415. In addition, six  custodial sentences have been imposed, ranging from two to 12 months.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Courts view environmental crime with increasing  seriousness, as is evidenced by the high fines that are often imposed and the  jail terms that have been handed down to some of the most serious offenders. In  my view, that is mainly due to the work of this highly professional and  committed team, which has made great progress in tackling illegal-waste crime,  while operating in often difficult circumstances.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The team makes use of its increased legal powers, and has  developed strong working relationships with other law enforcement agencies,  including those in the Republic   of Ireland. Its work has  helped to increase public awareness of the impact and seriousness of illegal  dumping.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I was particularly pleased by the recent success in  achieving a confiscation order against environmental criminals, which was the  first in the United Kingdom.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I thank the Minister for outlining the environmental crime team&rsquo;s successes in  securing prosecutions, fines and custodial sentences. Will the Minister tell  the House what structures are in place to allow EHS to build upon its successes  in respect of illegal dumpers?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  The environmental crime team was formally set up in 2005-06. It had worked as a  team before that, but that is when it was designated an environmental crime  team. The team forms a dedicated intelligence unit to target not just the  complicit land owners, but those who drive the crime of illegal-waste dumping.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">EHS will train further staff as financial intelligence officers in partnership with the Police Service of  Northern Ireland and the Assets Recovery Agency. While the team has been  developing its financial investigation and financial intelligence skills, it  has formed a partnership with the Assets Recovery Agency and the Police Service  of Northern Ireland to refer cases for confiscation under the Proceeds of Crime  Act 2002.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Environmental crime team investigators commenced a  programme of retraining in October 2006 on issues such as the Police and Criminal Evidence (Amendment) (Northern    Ireland) Order 2007, investigative  interviewing, human rights, the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 and court skills. All of those skills are  required to enable the team to bring people to justice when they commit  environmental crime.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I am pleased with the progress made by the environmental  crime team, and I trust that it will go from  strength to strength now that it has that skills base.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Adams</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I  am sure that the Minister shares my concern about the scale of illegal  dumping in the Belfast  hills. It is estimated by the Belfast Hills Partnership that one million tonnes  of waste are dumped there every year.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister agree that a recent report by Criminal  Justice Inspection made it clear that EHS is failing to tackle persistent  environmental offenders? Furthermore, will she update the Assembly with respect  to costings for the establishment of an independent environmental protection  agency?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  I received a report from the Criminal Justice Inspection in 2007, in which  mention was made of the environmental crime team. That team has since developed,  and the Member will acknowledge that. Since that date, I have also looked at  having a single environmental team to deal not only with illegal waste dumping  but also water pollution &mdash; currently dealt with by the water unit in EHS &mdash; and  other elements of environmental crime such as wildlife crime.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I am working towards,  and want to see implemented, the recommendations of Criminal Justice  Inspection: a single environmental crime unit in EHS to deal with the range of  environmental crimes that we encounter.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">As to the question  about the costings, I have received a question for oral answer from the  Alliance Party Member for North Down. I will not steal his thunder. I am sure  the Member will get a copy of the answer, if that is not reached today.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gardiner</strong>: Will the Minister agree that the removal of a rath, dating from the era of St Patrick, in  the village of Waringstown in my constituency of Upper   Bann, was an environmental crime? What punishment does she propose  for the officials who failed to adequately protect that site?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  The Member had been in protracted correspondence with the Department in  relation to this issue long before I became a Minister. Correspondence  continues, and I hope that we will at some stage come to a resolution and  closure of the matter.</p>
	        <p class="H5StageHeading">Planning Service</p>
	        <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">3. <strong>Mr Attwood </strong>asked the Minister of the  Environment whether the Planning Service is fit for purpose.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=AQO1475/08> (AQO 1475/08)</a></p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>: The Planning Service has been confronted with a number of  challenges in recent years, such as a 62% increase in the number of planning  applications between 2000 and 2006, and  greatly increased regulation and public scrutiny.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Against that background, and within the constraints of the  current planning system, I am happy to say that performance against business  targets is improving. It is pleasing to note that half-yearly results at the  end of September 2007 confirmed that the Planning Service was meeting three out  of the four business targets for those parts of the process that lie within its  control. That is in spite an increase in the  number of applications received so far this year, compared to the same  period last year. Planning Service has also been successful in dealing  efficiently with a number of key infrastructural proposals, such as the Titanic  Quarter. However, there is always room for  improvement, and I assure the Member that  the Planning Service is committed to improvement.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">We should distinguish,  however, between the Planning Service and the planning system. The  question refers to the Planning Service: I believe that our focus should be on  the entire planning system, but I am the first to acknowledge that we must  improve our part &mdash; the Planning Service.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">My officials are making progress with a number of improvements to the planning process, including:  piloting streamlined council consultation arrangements with the city  council in Londonderry; making greater use of pre-application discussions;  revising the procedures for dealing with reserved matters applications;  reforming the development control group structure to speed up the decision-making process; streamlining the  processes involved in preparing for an appeal; and looking at ways to  enhance accessibility to the planning system through better use of technology.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I recognise that a  modern up-to-date planning system is  integral to delivering the Executive&rsquo;s goals for Northern<span style="letter-spacing:0pt; "> </span>Ireland, as indicated in the draft Programme for Govern&shy;ment,  and we will be working towards that goal.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Members will know that the Speaker made an announcement this  morning about the use of mobile phones in the Chamber. A mobile phone has just  caused interference. Members have been made aware of the effect that that has  on the recording equipment in the Chamber.  I ask all Members to switch off their mobile phones.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her extensive answer. I am sure, however, that she  concurs, on the basis of her constituency experience, that frustrations with  the Planning Service and the planning system are common among constituents in  the North.</p>
	        <p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">However, with regard to the Minister&rsquo;s last point, is she  satisfied that the Planning Service and the wider planning system will be fit  for purpose, for example, to accelerate potential inward-investment  opportunities should they arise during the next three years? In particular, is  she satisfied that in the event that hotel-development opportunities arise,  especially outside Belfast or wherever they might be, the Planning Service and  system will be able to give potential hotel developers certainty that if they  invest here, they will get approvals in good time in order to service any  increased tourist demand as identified in the Programme for Government?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  I could just get up and say yes; however, I am not known for brevity of that nature.  The Member is aware that my Department is  committed in the Programme for  Government to process applications for  strategic projects in six months. That is a challenging prospect for the  Planning Service. However, it has already been achieved in respect of some  major applications. I believe that it can continue to do so. I stress that this  is not just a matter for the Planning Service, but for the entire planning  system. Therefore, applicants and agents  must play their part with Planning Service in order to develop a better  system. That includes having pre-application discussions with the Planning  Service in order that quicker and more efficient decisions can be made, whether  they are consents or non-starters, so that, if necessary, people can go back to  the drawing board immediately and without having to wait.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I recognise that there is frustration at constituency  level. Indeed, constituents, not just from Belfast  but from across Northern Ireland, have raised  several specific issues with regard to apartments, garden grabbing, and so on. I am listening closely on all of those  issues. Indeed, I met a delegation of residents from south Belfast and several others who have come to see me. The  Department is in listening mode. The Member is aware that I am committed  to a planning reform agenda, which I hope to bring forward before summer 2008.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  Will the Minister tell the House what she and her Department are doing to  restore public confidence and faith in the Planning Service?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  I hope that people in Northern    Ireland realise that the Administration is a  listening one &mdash; certainly, I have done my best to get out and listen to  people&rsquo;s various concerns about the Planning Service.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">There is no doubt that the Planning Service does a  difficult job. It must reach decisions on developments, and if there are  objectors to a particular development, they may be disappointed and may say,  therefore, that they have had a bad experience with the Planning Service. If an  applicant is turned down, he or she will have had a bad experience with the  Planning Service. It must be recognised that that will always be the case, and it is important to distinguish between  dissatisfaction with a particular  decision and a general lack of confidence in the process through which  that decision is reached.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Department and the Planning Service, in particular, are  committed to ensuring that the planning system delivers a first-class service  to all of the people of Northern    Ireland. That is why the Department is  undertaking wide-ranging planning reform and why I am delighted that Greg Lloyd, a well respected professor of  planning law at the University of Liverpool, has agreed to lead that reform  process. In February, I will be taking the  opportunity to visit colleagues in Scotland, during which time  I will take a close look at their planning system. I also hope to learn from  their recent reform process.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs O&rsquo;Neill</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Will the Minister explain why  there has been significant drift of senior and  middle-level planning officers to the private sector?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  The simple answer to that question, which has already been said, is money.  Planners are much better paid in the private sector. However, that can be  looked at in two ways: one can get depressed about the fact that the Planning  Service is losing out on senior planners above a certain level. However, on the  other hand, it is recruiting good graduates.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Through the development of incentive schemes, I hope to  encourage them to remain in the Planning Service. Additionally, I hope that  senior planners who have gone to work in the private sector will ensure that planning applications that are submitted to the  Planning Service will be of a certain standard. If that is the case, I  hope that it will be of benefit to the planning system in general.</p>
	        <p class="H5StageHeading">National Park in the Mournes</p>
	        <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">4. <strong>Mr  McCarthy </strong>asked the Minister of the Environ&shy;ment what action she is taking  to implement proposals for the  establishment of a national park in the Mournes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO1457/08>(AQO 1457/08)</a></p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  I consulted the Council for Nature Conservation and the Countryside (CNCC), the  Committee for the Environment, and the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development about the Mourne national  park working party&rsquo;s report in September 2007. Recently, I received a response  from CNCC, and I look forward to the Committees&rsquo; responses soon. Last week, I  met a small group of Ulster Farmers&rsquo; Union (UFU) representatives and others in  the Mournes to hear their views. The proposal to designate a national park in  the Mournes has created a significant response from the local community and  beyond. In view of that, it is only right that I give proper consideration  without the constraints of a deadline to the working party&rsquo;s report and to the  views of those whom I have met.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her detailed response. Will she agree with me that the  matter has been rumbling on for some considerable time and that it would be in  the interests of her Department, farmers and  landowners to get something done as soon as possible so that tourism can  be encouraged? Tourism is one of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s big assets; in  some areas it is the only asset. It is important that the matter be brought to  a successful conclusion as soon as possible, with agreement from as many people  as possible.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  The Member says that tourism is the only industry in some areas. Last week, I  met a group in the Mournes that would firmly reject that point of view. I was  impressed by the farming representatives that I met in Ballinran last week when  I was in the kingdom   of Mourne. I was  impressed by their breadth of knowledge about national parks and, in  particular, by their confidence in their future in agriculture. They certainly  do not see themselves as part of a dying industry. We should encourage that  attitude, given the bad spell through which agriculture has come.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">As Members know, the working party reported last year. It reported the desire of many people for a  national park and also the concerns  of farmers. I want to consider farmers&rsquo;  views as well as the other issues in the working party&rsquo;s report; I also want to consider the responses that I  await from the Committee for the Environment and the Committee for Agriculture  and Rural Development.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P J Bradley</strong>:  I thank the Minister for visiting the Mournes and hearing, at first hand, the  concerns of the farmers about the proposal for a national park. My question is  about the three reports that are now with the Minister: the report from the  working party; the report from the Mournes area of outstanding natural beauty  residents&rsquo; action group; and the independent report of the nominees for the  Mourne trustees. Will the Minister attach equal importance to the contents of  all three reports?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  The Member is correct that I have received those three reports. I understand  that some clarification is needed with regard to the trustees&rsquo; report, which  was communicated to me at the UFU meeting last week. I hope to have a focused  meeting with the trustees of the Mournes only. I will do that in the near  future.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Mourne working party identified many issues, and I  commend its work. The issue of access was raised, regardless of whether there  would be a national park or not. I know that Mr Bradley will be aware of that.  Because access does not depend on whether there is a national park, I have  asked the Environment and Heritage Service to commit a further &pound;500,000 over a  three-year period to address the issues connected to it.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">When I was in the Mournes I assured the people to whom I  was speaking that there were no strings attached to that money, regardless of  whether there would be a national park or not. In other words, landowners who  are not in favour of a national park could make use of that money to upgrade  their access in the Mournes. That message was well received.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">A national park for the Mournes is a matter that we will  have to consider carefully. I will take the farmers&rsquo; views on board, as well as those who want the Mournes to be a  national park that can be developed for tourism.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>:  The working party has identified the need for positive management for the  Mournes. How will the Minister support that?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  The Mourne Heritage Trust, which is a well-respected body in the Mournes, has  been tasked with co-ordinating the management of the Mourne area of outstanding  natural beauty. I recognise that quite a few designated areas already exist in  the Mourne area, and that has brought the environmental product there very much  to the fore.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Department already provides grant aid to the Mourne  Heritage Trust through its natural heritage grant  programme, and it will consider further initiatives for which the trust,  or others, may seek funding. As I have already said, access is an issue. That  is not connected to any decision on whether or not there should be a national  park, but it was identified in the working party report. We hope that the  &pound;500,000 that I mentioned earlier will benefit the area and provide additional  resources for developing and improving access, providing better information for  walkers and helping landowners to deal with many of the access problems that  they face.</p>
	        <p class="H5StageHeading">Review of Public Administration</p>
	        <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">5. <strong>Mrs Long </strong>asked the Minister of the Environment to provide an update on proposed  powers for district councils under the review of public administration.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=AQO1459/08> (AQO 1459/08)</a></p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  Following the publication of the emerging findings of the review of local  government aspects of the review of public administration (RPA), a major stakeholder event was held in Cookstown on 25 October,  attended by over 120 delegates. Four  subregional events were subsequently held in Armagh,  Limavady, Omagh and Lisburn. Stakeholders were also invited to submit written  comments on the emerging findings and initial proposals, if they felt that that  was appropriate. Some 58 organisations and individuals submitted comments.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The views expressed at the stakeholder events, in the  written responses, during the take-note debate in the House on 13 November and  by the Committee for the Environment have informed further discussions in the  Executive subcommittee &mdash; which I chair &mdash; and at a number of bilateral meetings  that I have held with ministerial colleagues, particularly in relation to the  functions that might transfer to local government to strengthen its role. Those  discussions are continuing and are reaching a critical stage. I want to ensure  that all the views that I have received are  fully and carefully considered as the  thinking on the three strands, of which the Member will be aware, is  drawn together before final recommendations are made to the Executive.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>:  One of the key powers that most local government organisations would like to  see devolved to them is community planning. However, for that power to be  effective, other powers would have to be devolved that would allow local  government bodies to produce, not simply a wish list for their borough, but  also a to-do list. Does the Minister agree that other significant powers will  have to be devolved to local councils if they are to have a substantive role in  community planning?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  As far as I am concerned, community planning is the linchpin of what we are  trying to do with the review of public administration. The Member is right to  say that the matter does not only affect my Department as regards planning; it  affects a range of Departments. It is that suite of functions that the Northern  Ireland Local Government Association (NILGA) has been pressing for and that we  have sought in the bilateral meetings that I and ministerial colleagues have  had over the past days.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I want to take this opportunity to commend NILGA on its  work and its very realistic approach to all those issues. It has looked at the  issues, been involved in stakeholder engagement, looked at what was on the  table as a result of the emerging findings, and pushed all along for more to  come on the table. I have found NILGA to be a very helpful tool in my kit, and  I hope that when the end of the process is reached, that will be reflected in  the range of functions that is devolved.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Deeny</strong>:  Health professionals also have concerns about the delay in finalising the  number of councils &mdash; particularly those of us who have been appointed to the  new local commissioning groups. As the Minister will know, the local commissioning groups, in terms of both their number and their make-up, are very much  dependent on the number of councils in Northern Ireland &mdash;</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. Can the Member get to his question?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Deeny</strong>: It  is coming.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">My question is: can the Minister tell us when she will announce  the future number of councils in Northern Ireland and their  respective geographical make-ups? Can she give us some idea of how many  councils there are likely to be in future?</p>
	        <p class="TimePeriod">3.30 pm</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  The Executive subcommittee is due to meet soon to discuss and agree final  recommendations to the Executive, which will include its views on the number  and functions of those bodies, and the vision to which all Members are signed  up. The Member made a point about health professionals. In an early engagement with  me, the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety made it clear  that, no matter the number of councils that is settled on, the local  commissioning groups would be able to engage with that number of councils, and  that there was no need for me to be concerned about that matter. That was a  very helpful early intervention.</p>
	        <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="8"></a>Finance and Personnel</p>
	        <p class="H4StageHeading">Departmental Solicitor&rsquo;s Office</p>
	        <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">1. <strong>Mrs D  Kelly </strong>asked the Minister of Finance and Personnel  what consideration he has given to transferring responsibility for the  Departmental Solicitor&rsquo;s Office out of his Department.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=AQO1494/08> (AQO 1494/08)</a></p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel (Mr P Robinson)</strong>: Consideration was given by direct  rule Ministers in 2006 to the transfer of the Departmental Solicitor&rsquo;s Office,  as the core component of the new Government legal service for Northern Ireland,  to the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister in April 2007. In  early 2007, preparations for that transfer were halted, pending the anticipated  progress on devolution.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Departmental Solicitor&rsquo;s Office has operated  successfully for many years as part of the Department of Finance and Personnel,  while providing professional legal services to all Northern Ireland  Departments. I am satisfied with that arrangement, and I have no plans to seek the transfer of responsibility for the  Departmental Solicitor&rsquo;s  Office to another Department. However, as you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, any  significant transfer of responsibilities among Departments would, in the first  instance, be a matter for the Office of the First Minister and deputy First  Minister.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>: In view of that answer, will the Minister outline any  functions that he hopes to transfer under the review of public administration?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>: That is the subject of a later question, but it is sufficient to say that the Department  of Finance and Personnel deals with central Government. I am sure that  the Member is not suggesting that we hand over  control of central Government to local government.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  Will the Minister tell the House whether  Ministers and Departments are obliged to follow legal advice that they  receive from the Departmental Solicitor&rsquo;s Office, and, if not, what the  implications are of failing to do so?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  All Ministers are obliged to act within the law, and will take legal advice  from time to time. Whether or not their actions are consistent with the law, it  is, in the final analysis, a matter for the Minister whether he or she accepts  that advice or not, and takes the consequences. I am sure that if the Member  were to trawl through history, he would find some instances in which a Minister  did not take such advice and ended up in court.</p>
	        <p class="H5StageHeading">Departmental Spending</p>
	        <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">2. <strong>Mr Irwin </strong>asked the Minister of Finance and Personnel to detail the discretion that  Departments have in relation to how money allocated through the Budget process  is spent.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO1340/08>(AQO 1340/08)</a></p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  Although the strict legal response to the Member&rsquo;s question is that all  Government expenditure is subject to the  approval of the Department of Finance and Personnel, Departments, in  practice, spend on the basis of delegated authority, which can be amended or  withdrawn at any time. However, I take it that the burden of the Member&rsquo;s  question was to determine the level of discretion that is available to  Departments to reprioritise the allocations that are given to them.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The proposed allocations  in the draft Budget were developed in conjunction with Departments, and,  therefore, reflect their initial view of how allocations should be used. The  Departments had a further oppor&shy;tunity to amend those views before the  finalisation of the Budget position. That  meant that Executive Ministers had  broad discretion in distributing the additional funds that are available  for specific services within their Departments.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The final Budget position will show allocations to Departments at the level of spending areas. The  number of spending areas in each Department ranges from two for the  Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister to 13 for the Department  of Finance and Personnel. Departments will have complete flexibility to  transfer allocations within spending areas, but any proposed reallocation among  spending areas must be approved by the Executive. It also remains open to the  Executive to ring-fence any funding allocation for a specific purpose.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Irwin</strong>: In  light of the Minister&rsquo;s answer, should each  Minister reflect on the outcome of the consultation process when  determining his or her priorities?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  I am pleased to say that almost 10,000 people took the trouble to make  submissions not only on the draft Budget but  on the draft Programme for Government and the draft investment strategy.  That indicates a much higher level of involvement in consultation than we have  ever had previously in Northern    Ireland. Ministers will want to benefit from  that level of public consultation. The Budget, which will come before the House  tomorrow, will reflect the outcome of that  consultation. When Ministers distribute their allocations, they will want to take the consultation into  account. They will also take the consultation into account in any in-year  monitoring rounds.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: What  plans does the Minister have to put in place a strategic approach to ensuring  that underspends are allocated against agreed priorities rather than dealing  with them in an ad hoc manner through each of the quarterly monitoring rounds?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>: The nature and purpose of monitoring rounds is to deal with  ministerial pressures. It is not possible, strategically, to ensure that every  programme in a Minister&rsquo;s Department will run in accordance with the timescale  that he or she had hoped to meet at the time of the Budget. Programmes will  experience new issues and pressures, and  there will always be slippages. When there have been slippages, the  purpose of monitoring rounds is to take the  funds that are available and use them to deal with pressures. However,  if it is possible to allocate beyond any pressures that have to be met, the  strategy in the Programme for Government allows for that. As the monitoring  rounds progress, we will consider shortfalls in any Programme for Govern&shy;ment targets. Strategically, we would use in-year  spending rounds to assist Ministers to meet those targets.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr McDonnell</strong>:  In the interests of openness and transparency, should individual Ministers be  allowed to make frank statements to the House on the details of their  departmental budgets? At times, we spend a lot of time discussing fairly small  amounts of money, such as that spent on the North/South Ministerial Council. It  would be useful for the House to have the chance to debate the way in which  large budgets are spent inside Departments.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  Mr Deputy Speaker, you have had to sit on that Chair on several occasions when  the House debated those issues. I am sure that you have not seen any reluctance  on the part of Ministers, or Members, to make their views known on allocations  and pressures. The purpose of the consultation process has been to allow  everyone in Northern Ireland  who wishes to express a view to do so. At some stage, Ministers must take a  collective Executive decision. The Executive have done that, and we will bring  forward a Budget statement tomorrow based on the agreement of the Executive. I  am not in a position to restrict Ministers from making statements on behalf of  their Departments. I hope that any such statements would recognise the  considerable steps that have been taken by all Executive colleagues to ensure  that the Programme for Government can be supported by all Ministers and is  worthy of the support of the people of Northern Ireland.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Question 3 has been withdrawn.</p>
	        <p class="H5StageHeading">Economic Vision for Northern Ireland</p>
	        <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">4. <strong>Dr Farry </strong>asked the Minister of Finance and Personnel  what is his assessment of the economic vision for Northern Ireland  within the draft Budget 2008-11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=AQO1485/08> (AQO  1485/08)</a></p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  The draft Budget aims to create a dynamic,  outward-looking, competitive and innovative regional economy. Spending proposals focus on ensuring that resources are made available to secure  productivity improvements in Northern Ireland through investment  in the four main drivers of productivity:  skills, enterprise, innovation and infrastructure. Such investment is  necessary to achieve the public service agreement target of halving the private sector&rsquo;s productivity gap with the  UK average &mdash; excluding the  south-east of England  &mdash; by 2015.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his response. In light of the Varney Review, and its  statement that Northern Ireland should be satisfied with taking its share of  the proceeds from a booming UK economy through  the Barnett formula &mdash; and thereby perpetuating the financial penalty on  the rest of the UK &mdash; how can such a vision can be achieved, particularly given  that Sir David Varney did not foresee any meaningful change to the gap in the  levels of gross value added (GVA) between Northern Ireland and the UK?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  Everyone in the House was disappointed at the outcome of the Varney Review, but  I hope that the Assembly&rsquo;s greater involvement in Varney II will bring us a better outcome. Northern Ireland&rsquo;s GVA is about 81% of the UK average, and  the Programme for Government is intent on addressing that disparity. The only  way that that can be done is by the Assembly increasing economic growth through allocating resources  to the key Departments involved, and by those Departments introducing proposals  to upskill the workforce. The Departments must be innovative in generating new  jobs and they must ensure that the new jobs are created in occupations that  will attract higher wages than many existing jobs in Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland is among the areas of the United Kingdom  that are experiencing the largest increases in economic growth.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  To follow on from the Minister&rsquo;s comments,  will he state how his draft Budget allocations seek to encourage  economic growth?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  I have outlined what I consider to be the drivers of productivity. The  Departments that have responsibility for  those drivers are the Department for Employment and Learning, the  Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment, the Department of Education and  the Department for Regional Develop&shy;ment, which has responsibility for  improving infrastructure.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Without specifying any possible changes in the final Budget, it is worth pointing out that in the  draft Budget, we allocated an  increase in resources to those Departments over the CSR period that was  well above the block average of 3&middot;6%. The Department for Regional Development  will receive an average increase of 6&middot;5%; the Department of Enterprise, Trade  and Investment will receive a 4&middot;8%  increase; the Department of Education will receive a 4&middot;3% increase, and  the Department for Employment and Learning will receive 3&middot;9%. In my Budget  statement, some of those figures will change, which, I hope, will be helpful.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>: The  Varney Review of taxation policy failed to deliver anything significant to the  economy and contributed nothing to the economic vision. The Minister has  touched on the new review: will he share with the Assembly his expectations of  the Varney II review and state when the report will be published.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  The only positive to come from the Varney Report was the provision of an  economic analysis, some of which is useful, but the report provided no concrete  benefit to Northern Ireland.  All that can be said is that Varney II can do no worse than the first version.</p>
	        <p class="TimePeriod">3.45 pm</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">As Minister, there are things that I can control and there  are things that I cannot control. I cannot control the Treasury; no one has  managed to learn how to do that. As a devolved institution, all we can do is  argue our case, attempt to convince people, and state to them that there is a  very real need here for new instruments to  help us to grow our economy. The difference between the first Varney  Review and Varney II is that having greeted  Sir David when he started his first review, I had no further meetings  with him &mdash; nor, having sought a further meeting with him, did I get one &mdash;  whereas, this time, Northern Ireland officials will be involved throughout the  process, which I think means that the views  of the Assembly will be heard throughout and, I hope, will have an impact.</p>
	        <p class="H5StageHeading">Civil Service Modernisation Projects</p>
	        <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">5. <strong>Mr P  Ramsey </strong>asked the Minister of Finance and Personnel  to detail the progress on the main Civil Service modernisation projects,  including Workplace 2010.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=AQO1495/08> (AQO  1495/08)</a></p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>: Significant progress has been made across the Civil Service  reform and modernisation programme. The centre for applied learning has been  fully operational since October 2006, the Records NI project will be completed  by March 2008, and the other key corporate services projects, providing  shared-service centres for human resources, accounts and ICT, are being rolled  out across the Northern Ireland Civil Service, and will be complete by April  2009. The procurement for NI Direct will get under way this month, with a view  to introducing the single telephone point of contact for public services in Northern Ireland  on a phased basis from December 2008 onwards.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">On Workplace 2010, I am pleased to say that the two  remaining bidders &mdash; Land Securities Trillium and Telereal &mdash; have been invited to  submit their best and final offers for the contract, and those should be  received by the end of April. I can also confirm that the independent review of  policy on the location of public-sector jobs is under way, and I expect a  report from the team by the summer. The Member will be aware that although the  placement of jobs was not part of the initial reform project, it is my  intention to draw that issue in as part of the reform project and to align it  closely with Workplace 2010.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Ramsey</strong>:  Will the Minister outline the views of his Department in respect of  decentralisation of public-sector and Civil Service jobs to regions of high  unemployment, and the environmental impact of the subsequent reduction in  commuting requirements? Finally, can he define what is considered a reasonable  travel to work area?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  Having set up a review, I think it is wrong for me to state what I believe the  outcome should be. I met Sir George Bain as  he started the review, and I believe that the review team have already  had some initial meetings. I have  previously expressed views in the Assembly on the issue, so I do not  approach it reluctantly.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">There are real advantages for Northern Ireland if we can have a fair distribution of jobs around the  Province, with reduced pressure on our infrastructure if jobs are close  to people rather than bringing people along our roads to jobs. If we can grow  the economy, particularly in the areas that we are pressing for &mdash; financial  services, business services, and computer technology &mdash; those jobs are more  likely to come to the greater Belfast  area. Therefore, it becomes all the more important that we look at the jobs  where we have a greater control of location and consider their displacement to  other areas of the Province.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the  Minster for that last answer in particular, and I have a related question.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">If female civil servants are given an advancement  opportunity, they may have to relocate or commute to avail themselves of it.  That can cause difficulties for those who have child-rearing responsibilities.  Will the review take that important issue, which relates to equality of  opportunity, into consideration?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  I am sure that consideration of that issue was in the review panel&rsquo;s remit. We  have been inclined to examine how the public sector works on the basis of what  has been its historical modus operandi. The  truth is, however, that things will change considerably in the future. I  visited Clare House and spoke to some of the staff there. One lady who was from  the greater Belfast area told me that she worked mostly from home and came to  the office perhaps only once a week to deal with some issues.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">There will be greater flexibility in the future, and it is  likely that computers and the advancement of technology will play their part in  that flexibility. More people will stay in their own area rather than work in  town centres.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his response. Given that some reform projects have  recommended the centralisation of information, will the Minister set out the  latest position on the important, and topical, review of data security?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>: Members will know that, following the most recent high-profile  data loss by Her Majesty&rsquo;s Revenue and Customs in the third week of November 2007, I initiated a review of the way in which  Departments and agencies handled data. That review has been led by Bill  McCluggage, and the process has been that people from each of the relevant  areas of activity have been contacted and allowed to conduct self-analysis on  the basis of a series of questions. The outcome of the review indicates that  improvements can be made, and we will report shortly to the Committee when we  have more detail. The report will deal with a series of issues about the  transfer and handling of data. Clearly, improvements can be made. Considering  the frequency of those types of occurrences in GB, it is incumbent on us to  ensure that Departments that hold personal details in many areas of activity  have the highest level of security. It is important that we do not find  ourselves in the same position as those in  GB have found themselves.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Question 6 has been withdrawn.</p>
	        <p class="H5StageHeading">Review of Public Administration</p>
	        <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">7. <strong>Mr  Gallagher </strong>asked the Minister of Finance and Personnel to list the functions  that he has offered up for transfer to local government under the review of  public administration.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO1496/08>(AQO  1496/08)</a></p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  The Department of Finance and Personnel is responsible primarily for the  finance and personnel policies of central Government Departments. Discussions  were held on the matter under the review of public administration (RPA), and  the previous Administration decided that no DFP functions should be recommended  for transfer to local government.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  That is a disappointing response that is  shared by those in local government. It gives strength to the growing  view that the Minister and his officials are using the RPA as an  empire-building exercise. Given that there  will be fewer councils after the creation of the new authorities, some  council assets will be surplus to requirement.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">As for the disposal of those assets &mdash;</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: <span style="font-size:11.0pt; ">Order.  Mr Gallagher, it is Question Time. Please  put a question to the Minister</span>.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  Will the Minister tell the House whether, when those assets are disposed of,  the money will remain in local government or be taken back to the centre?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  I am somewhat confused by the Member&rsquo;s comments. The Member said that he was  disappointed by the response, but he did not identify one function of the  Department of Finance and Personnel that he believes would be appropriate to  delegate to local government. The reason, of course, that he did not do that is  because there are no functions of the Department of Finance and Personnel that  could appropriately be handed to local government.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">By its nature, the  Department of Finance and Personnel deals with central Government; it is  responsible for civil servants. I assume  that the Member is not suggesting that we hand over the control of those  who are looking after Northern Ireland  Departments to local government. The Department of Finance and Personnel deals with the finances of the 11 Departments;  I assume that he is not suggesting that we  hand the control of the finance of central Government to local  government. There is no function of the Department of Finance and Personnel  that should, or could, be devolved to local government.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I happen to be one of the strongest supporters of delegating  more powers to local government. Any of the  Member&rsquo;s colleagues should know &mdash; perhaps more than most &mdash; that in the  Executive subcommittee, I am the one who has been pushing all Ministers to  ascertain what additional powers they could  hand to local govern&shy;ment. The only area of the work of the Department  of Finance and Personnel where there is a relationship with local government  concerns some EU funding. That can be transferred, or a greater role given to  local government in that respect, only if the function that the European  funding is related to is also devolved to local government. Unless any Member  can tell me of one function of my Department that could be devolved, we will  have to regard the issue as closed.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>:  Bearing in mind the fact that there are very few &mdash; if any &mdash; functions of the  Minister&rsquo;s Department that could be transferred to councils, could he explain  to the House what actions he or his office has taken to encourage other  Departments to transfer powers to local councils?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  Representatives of local govern&shy;ment have met me, officially, as Minister of  Finance and Personnel, on this issue, and they have encouraged me to encourage  others to involve them&shy;selves fully. I was first elected to local government in  1977, and I believe that there is no better delivery unit than local  government. We found that out when there was flooding; we turned to local  government for help.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I am a massive supporter of local government. I believe  that it could manage and handle additional functions, but only functions that  do not have an overarching responsibility for central Government areas of  activity. That is the difficulty, so all that I can do is encourage colleagues.  I have done that in the subcommittee that has been set up, and I will continue  to do that in the Executive. I must say that, in recent meetings of the  subcommittee, I have found that there has been a greater degree of unity among  the Ministers about how we can move forward on this issue, and I believe that  we are making progress.</p>
	        <p class="H5StageHeading">Stormont Estate: Events in 2008</p>
	        <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">8. <strong>Mr  Burnside </strong>asked the Minister of Finance and Personnel to detail the major  (i) sporting events; (ii) cultural events; and (iii) other events, planned for  the Stormont Estate in 2008.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO1267/08>(AQO  1267/08)</a></p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  The events calendar for the Stormont Estate changes regularly, with events  being added throughout the year. At this early stage, there are four major  sporting events in the 2008 calendar: the Thirty-first Belfast International  Cross-Country Race, which was held in early January; the Tour of the North &mdash;  the cycle race, not the Orange parade &mdash; on the evening of Good Friday in March; the Red Bull Soapbox Race in  late May; and the Tesco Race for Life, in support of breast cancer awareness,  in early June. To date, no other major  events have been planned for 2008. However, I expect further approaches  to be made.</p>
	        <p class="TimePeriod">4.00 pm</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burnside</strong>:  There seems to be a total lack of co-ordination and promotion of the Stormont  Estate as a venue for events. I used to enjoy attending the odd Vanguard rally  here; they were great events in the early 1970s. However, events are held here  only because of the initiative of those behind them. I submitted this question  to the Business Office to be addressed to the Assembly Commission, and it was transferred  to the Finance Department. Regardless of the Department, there should be a  centrally co-ordinated campaign. I ask the Finance Minister to initiate that.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">If someone wants to hold a rally, marathon or even a funeral &mdash; like George Best&rsquo;s &mdash; in the Stormont  Estate, the initiative comes from bodies such as Castlereagh Borough  Council or sporting organisations. It would be much better if there were a  central Department that dealt with getting sporting or cultural events and rock  concerts held at this great venue and which promoted the grounds in  co-ordination with other Departments. Will  the Minister ensure a more positive and co-ordinated use of the Stormont  estate?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>: Everyone recognises that Parliament  Buildings and its grounds are ideally  situated, and we want to encourage as many people as possible from Northern Ireland  to visit the site. We encourage people to  use the facilities and to have a very good relationship with people involved in promotion, which will  continue. I encourage anyone who wants to use Parliament Buildings  and its grounds for an event to contact my Departmental officials, who are  happy to be proactive in looking for those who could hold their events here.</p>

	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The next item on the Order Paper is questions to the Assembly  Commission. Several Members of the Commission will answer questions. Question 1  has been withdrawn.</p>
	        <p class="H5StageHeading">Assembly Education Programme</p>
	        <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">2. <strong>Mr  Storey </strong>asked the Assembly Commission to detail the number of schools that  have participated in the Assembly education  programme since the restoration of devolution in May 2007.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO1439/08>(AQO 1439/08)</a></p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr Robert  Coulter</strong>: From the restoration of devolution in May 2007 until today, 125  schools have participated in the Assembly education programme. Several youth groups, further and higher  education groups and adult learning groups have also participated in the  programme, raising the number of participating groups to 218. The education  programme of the Assembly has been one of  the success stories since we started operation in May 2007.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>: I  concur with the Member&rsquo;s comments about the success of the programme. Schools  in my constituency are encouraged to participate and to become more aware of  what happens in this Building. Can the Member expand on the geographical spread  of schools participating in the education programme across the constituencies?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr Robert  Coulter</strong>: Of the 125 schools that participated  in the education programme, the vast majority &mdash; 112 &mdash; were from Northern Ireland; schools from England, the Republic  of Ireland and Europe  also visited.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The breakdown of the 125 schools from Northern Ireland was  as follows: there were six schools from Belfast East, which is 5&middot;36% of the  total; three schools from Belfast North, 2&middot;68%; seven schools from Belfast  South, 6&middot;25%; six schools from Belfast West, 5&middot;36%; nine schools from East  Antrim, 8&middot;04%; five schools from East Londonderry, 4&middot;46%; seven schools from  Fermanagh and South Tyrone, 6&middot;25%; three schools from Foyle, 2&middot;68%; four  schools from Lagan Valley, 3&middot;57%; five schools from Mid Ulster, 4&middot;46%; 20  schools from Newry and Armagh, 17&middot;86%; nine schools from South Down, 8&middot;04%;  eight schools from the Member&rsquo;s North Antrim constituency, 7&middot;14%; seven schools  from North Down, 6&middot;25%; one school from  South Antrim, 0&middot;89%; one school from Strangford, 0&middot;89%; nine schools  from Upper Bann, 8&middot;04%; and two schools from West Tyrone, 1&middot;78%.</p>
	        <p class="H5StageHeading">Procurement of Goods and Services</p>
	        <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">3. <strong>Ms N&iacute;  Chuil&iacute;n </strong>asked the Assembly Commission to  outline what consideration it gives, when contracting and procuring  services and goods, to the arrangements that  will be made for trades union and staff representation; and to detail  the processes that are put in place for monitoring and reviewing these  conditions, to ensure that agreed terms and conditions for staff are adhered to  by the provider of the services or goods.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO1438/08>(AQO  1438/08)</a></p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Moutray</strong>:  The Assembly Commission does not specify that an organisation selected as a  provider of goods or services must have either trade union or staff  representation. When selecting a service provider, the Commission considers the  relevant competencies required to meet service provision. It cannot exclude a  contractor who does not have a trade union. Each company has the ability and  flexibility to decide how to achieve desired industrial relations. However, the  Commission recognises that a high standard  of industrial relations is necessary, so it includes a clause in the  terms of all contracts to ensure that staff are not treated in a discriminatory  or unfair way. The Commission also considers  staff turnover rates during the procurement process, as that is a robust  and effective method of measuring employee satisfaction.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The staff relations of a  contractor can also be measured by how well the contract is performing.  It is unlikely that a supplier with inadequate staff relations will be able to perform the contract consistently to a  satisfactory level. Furthermore, contractors are formally evaluated in  contract review meetings &mdash; such as the recent support services contract review  &mdash; which are held twice a year.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">If a contract manager becomes aware of a contractor failing  to comply with either statutory or contractual obligations, the matter will be  treated seriously. If the situation is not remedied, the contractor might be  found to be in breach of contract.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  I thank the Member for answering on behalf of the Commission, and I am  delighted to hear the response. I previously raised an issue with the Commission  regarding the cleaning staff in Parliament Buildings, and there was an  understanding that the cleaning staff are  not entitled to trade union representation. I am also delighted that the  conditions and contracts are reviewed.</p>
	        <p class="H5StageHeading">Parliament Buildings: Visitor Numbers</p>
	        <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">4. <strong>Mr  Hamilton </strong>asked the Assembly Commission to detail the estimated number of  visitors to Parliament Buildings since the restoration of devolution on 8 May  2007.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO1303/08>(AQO 1303/08)</a></p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Neeson</strong>:  Following the restoration of devolution on  8 May 2007 until 31 December 2007, 34,345 people visited Parliament  Buildings and 7,528 people came along as part of the Assembly&rsquo;s education  programme. Therefore 41,873 people visited Parliament Buildings in 2007.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>: Those figures underline that Stormont is a tourism asset, and a  record number of people have visited in spite of Stormont&rsquo;s poor visitor  facilities. The Northern Ireland Assembly Secretariat Review Report &mdash; in which  the Commission was involved &mdash; outlined the need for a newbuild near Parliament  Buildings to deal with office, staff, press and education accommodation issues. I ask the Commission to  consider the inclusion of a dedicated visitor centre when it deals with the recommendations of that aspect of the  report, so that we can tap into the  tourism potential and maximise it.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Neeson</strong>:  The existing facilities in Parliament Buildings are restricted by space  constraints, and the Commission is considering what additional accommo&shy;dation  provision is required for the Assembly. There is a proposal to increase visitor  facilities in line with the Commission&rsquo;s new vision to engage the public and  provide outreach services. The Commission expects to have extensive visitor, education, Committee, exhibition and  public space available in any extended Assembly facility.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Work to begin quantifying the requirements is under way,  and any decision to take forward such a project will be informed by an  engagement and outreach strategy, which is currently being developed. The  extended accommodation &mdash; the new building &mdash; has been considered as part of the  recently completed review, and the Commission is clear that it wants any additional accommodation to be located in close  proximity to Parliament Buildings.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Plans for any newbuild are at the preliminary stage, and  construction is not expected to commence until 2010-11 at the earliest. From a  purely constituency point of view it will be of interest to Mr Hamilton that  the number of visitors from Strangford during that period was 755, and a  further 141 pupils participated in the education programme.</p>
	        <p class="H5StageHeading">Parliament Buildings: Outreach Strategy</p>
	        <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">5. <strong>Mr  McElduff </strong>asked the Assembly Commission to detail what initiatives it will  undertake to attract a greater number of visitors to Parliament Buildings; and  what plans it has to develop its outreach strategy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=AQO1369/08> (AQO 1369/08)</a></p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Neeson</strong>:  Initiatives to attract more visitors to Parliament Buildings will form an  integral part of the engagement and  outreach strategy that is being developed. As part of that process the  Commission has already agreed that the education service will recruit a third  education officer, on a temporary basis, to assist with the development of an  outreach education programme.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The education service is hosting an information afternoon  on 29 January 2008 for MLAs and party staff  to encourage them to participate in the development of outreach services  and in the education programme. Leaflets and sample education packs will be  available for Members to take away and distribute to interested constituents  and groups to encourage them to visit Parliament Buildings. Members will have  received copies of those leaflets in the post this morning.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, an engagement and outreach strategy working  group, led by the Director of Research and Information, has been formed. The  group comprises representatives from core  business areas in the Assembly. Members, and other interested parties,  will have the opportunity to engage with the group.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, the Commission has undertaken work to consider  what additional accommodation is required for the Assembly, which includes  exploring options for the provision of visitor and outreach facilities. The  Commission expects to have an extensive visitor, education, Committee,  exhibition and public space available in any extended facility, and that should  attract more visitors.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  I thank Sean through you, a LeasCheann Comhairle, for his extensive answer.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Visitors to this building have a very positive experience.  However, there is greater identification with the building among people in  counties such as Antrim and Down than there is among those in County Tyrone,  and the statistics bear that out. That is why I want to see an outreach  strategy in Tyrone, Fermanagh and in those counties in which people, in the  past, would have been less inclined to visit Stormont.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I would like to hear more detail about a multi-element  strategy aimed at outreach. I am pleased that the education service is going to  have a third officer. However, who is responsible for writing to senior citizens  consortia in the way that the education service writes to schools to inform  them about the availability of the services here? It would not be the education  service. Is anyone filling that gap at the moment, or is it being left to  individual MLAs?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Neeson</strong>:  Mr McElduff has raised a number of points.  Developing outreach services is a major priority of the Commission because it is important that the public take  ownership of the Assembly and identify with it.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I anticipated that the  issue about the west of Northern Ireland would be raised. The education service has sent a mailshot to all schools inviting them to visit  Parliament Buildings, and education  officers have attended meetings with the Western Education and Library  Board to encourage schools in that area to visit Parliament Buildings. Schools  furthest away from Belfast would benefit from an outreach service, though it is  recognised that visiting Parliament   Buildings and seeing the  Assembly in action would be an ideal experience for everyone.</p>
	        <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Dallat] in the Chair)</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly Commission would also like to see all MLAs  play a full role in promoting the work of the Assembly, which brings me to the  final point &mdash; how do we attract more elderly groups? That issue must be looked at as part of our investigation into  extending and improving outreach, and it will be taken on board.</p>
	        <p class="TimePeriod">4.15 pm</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Motion made:</p>
	        <p class="Q3Motion">That the Assembly do now adjourn. &mdash; <em>[Mr Deputy Speaker.]</em></p>
	        <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="10"></a>Adjournment</p>
	        <p class="H4StageHeading">Disabled Parking and Footpath Access for Wheelchair  Users in Dundonald</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: All Members who wish to contribute to the debate will have  approximately 10 minutes in which to speak.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  I bring this issue to the House in a voice of exasperation and frustration as  expressed on behalf of wheelchair users in Dundonald: frustration in that,  despite their representations to the Department for Regional Development and  the police over several years, sympathy is not a substitute for positive  action; exasperation in that, in their predicament, they are angry at  themselves and express disbelief at people who do not stop to consider others &mdash;  people like myself who, until the difficulties were fully explained and  demonstrated, would have parked partly on the footpath, against the law, to  make a quick stop, which inevitably, I admit, took longer than anticipated.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Able-bodied people enjoy freedoms and take for granted  going for a walk and doing spur-of the-moment activities such as casually  walking into a shop for a newspaper, an ice cream on a warm day, or even a  postage stamp. Those are all normal activities to which most people seldom give a thought. In Dundonald,  specifically along the Grahamsbridge    Road, Church    Road, Robbs    Road and Comber    Road, the footpath route for the wheelchair user  can be a nightmare of a dangerous obstacle course.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Parking on the footpath denies access for the wheelchair  user. Their freedom to pass safely and use the footpath properly is taken away  from them. There is no room for the wheelchair to squeeze past vehicles, which  vary from a car, to a van to a lorry, parked partly on the road and partly on  the footpath.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The same applies to a mother with a pram. Try negotiating  the footpath with a pram and then try to configure what manoeuvrability a  wheelchair user would have in contrast. Do you manoeuvre the wheelchair over a  high kerb to get onto the road in order to  go round the offending vehicle? How dangerous an exercise will that be?  Do you go back along the footpath to the point first accessed and travel along  the road in the wheelchair, knowing that usually there will be five or six  cars, vans or lorries parked in groups at intervals? It is Sod&rsquo;s Law that at  least one vehicle will be parked on a bend.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Those dilemmas, which put the lives of wheelchair users at  risk, as well as causing difficulties for road traffic, are typical events not  only in the towns and villages of my Strangford constituency, but others across  Northern Ireland.  In Dundonald, nothing has been done to make life easier for the wheelchair  user, and that cannot continue because it is not acceptable.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I want the Department and the police to co-operate and  mount a spring and summer exercise to help the wheelchair user, which should  include a campaign of information and awareness, posters in shops, visits to  the building development sites and a leaflet drop to local homes. The spring  and summer are great days for wheelchair users to get out and about. Let us try  to make their days more enjoyable. With a bit of will and effort by the  Department, the police and the local community, we can all improve  accessibility for the wheelchair user in Dundonald.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Parking in the village is a lottery for the disabled, and  the inadequate number of disabled-parking spaces in Dundonald makes it even  more a matter of pot luck. A disabled driver cannot benefit from double  parking, parking on a footpath or, indeed, from dropping off a passenger and  returning to collect him later. On several occasions, I went to the village to  check for myself how difficult parking could be for the disabled. I immediately  noticed how difficult it is for anybody to park legally in the village.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">A frustrated, wheelchair-using, disabled driver illustrated  the difficulties of parking by describing to me how he sets about organising &mdash;  can you believe it &mdash; the collection of a  prescription. Incidentally, wheelchair users and disabled drivers are  not moaners but proud, independent-minded people who wish to go about their  business without a fuss and to do normal things as best as they can. For this  person, collecting his prescription involves driving around in search of a  space, giving up, and then phoning the pharmacist to arrange a time for a staff  member to leave the shop in order to hand over the prescription. In order to  collect the medication when it is ready, the same exercise must be repeated.  Come on, colleagues &mdash; it is 2008, and, in Dundonald, people must resort to such  arrangements in order to get their medication. That is not on.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">All that disabled drivers and wheelchair users are asking  for is to be able to maintain their dignity, to be given a fair chance of  acting as normally as possible, and not to be a burden on others. Incidentally,  I say well done to the local pharmacy staff for helping, and understanding the  frustration and predicament of, their customers. However, it would be far  better if the wheelchair user were able to park, get into his or her  wheelchair, and make his or her own, unobstructed way to the chemist&rsquo;s shop,  and to derive immense satisfaction from being able to do so. My plea is that we  should address that situation in Dundonald. Where there is a will, there must  be a way. I ask that we find that way and, in doing so, help those good people.  I have identified an undisputed need; the task is not massive, but the outcome  will be immense. Even two more spaces would make a difference, although, in  reality, at least six more are required.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I appreciate the  Minister for Regional Development&rsquo;s presence. I understand that it has  been a busy day for him and other  Ministers. Here is an issue to get to grips with; to disentangle from  bureaucracy, red tape and the normal  paperchases; on which immediate results can be recognised, acknowledged and supported. If the Minister does  that, many people will be extremely grateful.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">For the sake of  wheelchair users and disabled drivers in Dundonald, I hope that the  Minister appreciates the urgency of this initiative for next spring and summer,  and that that will prompt him to move positively and deliver good news for  people who deserve to have life made easier  for them. Having brought this matter to the House&rsquo;s attention, all that  I ask is for the Minister to please get on  with it and let the public know the outcome.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>: I support my colleague David McNarry. Recently, the lack of  provision for disabled people on the roads  was brought to my attention and, for that reason, I have been asking  questions about disabled-vehicle legislation and the lack of disability  discrimination legislation in the Province. That was brought to my attention  not only by concerned disabled constituents but by a group of carers who have  found that their lives have been made much more difficult by the fact that, in  the Province, we have sadly fallen behind in the provision of facilities for  disabled members of the community.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">There are many examples of that lack of facilities. In  fact, a website is dedicated to helping the parents of disabled children find  out which facilities are equipped to ensure that their day out is fun, rather  than a struggle due to a dearth of essential amenities. I was pleased to  discover that many places in Strangford are listed on the website as areas of  interest. However, it was not so good to see how those attractions were  regarded by many members of the community. I wish to cite a couple of examples.  I thank the Minister for attending the debate.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The following is an extract from the Parents&rsquo; Stories  website concerning Xtreme Bowling:</p>
	        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Located in Dundonald Icebowl, this is bowling with a  twist. Its in the dark with glow in the dark lanes. White clothes and teeth  also glow. Special ramps can be used for those who have difficulty holding or  throwing the ball.&rdquo;</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">However, the review continues:</p>
	        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Dundonald Ice Bowl is not very wheelchair friendly,  the ground outside is uneven and there isn&rsquo;t a proper dropped kerb for  wheelchairs at the entrance. Also the doors in the entrance are the old heavy  kind and hard to open. There is a cafe inside but it has steps up to it. The  ramp up to the cafe is at the left hand side. There is a disabled toilet  (locked) in the skating rink.&rdquo;</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That is by no means a glowing recommendation,  despite the fact that I have heard many glowing reports of bowling there &mdash;  excuse the pun. The fact is that the facilities are not friendly for all who  wish to use them. I do not intend any slight on the Ice Bowl, which is an  excellent facility. However, perhaps a wee bit more care is needed in order to  be disability friendly.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I recently received information from the Baywatch Campaign,  which concerns disabled-parking bays and the blue-badge scheme. It was found  that 21% of people park their cars in a space, regardless of whether there is a  disabled-user restriction. That figure has been reduced by 3%, but it shows,  nonetheless, that some people &mdash; drivers in particular &mdash; have complete disregard  for disabled people.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Some 16% of bays were difficult for disabled users to  access, and the campaign expressed disappointment in the poor parking provision  of public bodies. Some people will even go as far as using a blue badge that  belongs to someone else. It is a disgrace, for example, that a woman with a  disabled child had to park far away from her destination because someone who  was in a rush took the space that was  designated for someone with mobility needs. That is totally  unacceptable.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">It seems that urgent work must be done to halt the slights  on members of our community who have disabilities. It is very clear that there  is a problem in my constituency and in the Province as a whole, never mind  simply Dundonald. However, this debate is concerned with Dundonald.  Nevertheless, it is important that all Members of the Assembly take on board  the fact that there is a very real need for reform and change. It is my hope  that this Adjournment debate will kick-start that critically needed change.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Disabled Drivers&rsquo; Association (Northern Ireland Group)  is a self-help organisation that is run by people with disabilities for people  with disabilities. It has slightly fewer than 1,000 members in Northern Ireland.  The Disabled Drivers&rsquo; Association is concerned with all aspects of mobility that affect drivers and passengers with  disabilities. It has made several suggestions in the consultation on the draft  Accessible Transport Strategy, and I support its recommendations:</p>
	        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The Disabled Drivers&rsquo; Association sees the  involvement and consultation with people with disabilities an essential  strategic objective of the Accessible Transport Strategy.</p>
	        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">The Disabled Drivers&rsquo; Association is concerned that  the commitment of the Government to build-in accessibility for people with  disabilities as a condition of spending public money is spoilt by the statement  &lsquo;where possible, proportionate and cost-effective&rsquo;. We hope this clause will be  removed as it makes the commitment very weak and half-hearted.&rdquo;</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Disabled Driver&rsquo;s Association feels that there is no  specific policy in the draft accessible transport strategy to address the  pedestrian environment in Northern    Ireland, which directly involves its  membership. It is essential that a policy be established to improve access to  the pedestrian environment for disabled people.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">With the encouragement of park-and-ride schemes, the Disabled Drivers&rsquo; Association feels that  accessibility for disabled people to use such facilities should be a  factor in the future design of any new scheme.</p>
	        <p class="TimePeriod">4.30 pm</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Disabled Drivers&rsquo;  Association also recommends:</p>
	        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;action from the ATS to support this campaign, which  will highlight the importance of disabled parking bays to the general public  and awaken an awareness of the implications of abuse.&rdquo;</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The association states that the Department has been  very successful with its belt up campaign, and hopes that that will be expanded  to the abuse of disabled-parking bays. Some  of the association&rsquo;s recommendations could well be the start of a new  time of equal access for disabled people in the Province, which cannot come  soon enough.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I urge the Minister to respond positively to the issues  that have been raised. Start getting it right in Dundonald, and we can start  getting it right elsewhere.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  I find it amazing, to say the least, that in this day and age disabled people  in Dundonald are being discriminated against and cannot park their cars or even  use a wheelchair freely. I listened to a broadcast this morning and I could not  believe that people in Dundonald have allowed that to be the case for so long.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">In defence of the Department for Regional Develop&shy;ment, any  time that I, as a public representative, have approached  the local office for help regarding disabled-parking bays, the officials  were always helpful. It took time to go through the process, but the issues  were addressed. I am surprised to hear that in the case of Dundonald this issue  has been going on for so long. Perhaps the people of Dundonald do not have as  good local council representation as we have in our neck of the woods.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I have a family member who uses a wheelchair, and there is  no doubt that it is frustrating when one goes onto the street and finds the way  blocked by a car. In fact, people can get really angry when a car is parked  partially on a footpath and they have got to find their way off that footpath  and onto the main road where there is traffic, which puts every one in danger.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The general public &mdash; and drivers in particular &mdash; should  take responsibility for their actions. I know that drivers can be  inconsiderate: Mr McNarry mentioned the fact the he occasionally parks on the  footpath when he is going into the post office. We are all human, but that  could be the time when someone in a wheelchair comes along and requires access.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I am sure that the Minister will ask officials in the local  office why this has been allowed to drift for so long. I am glad that the  Minister is present, and I hope that he can get a quick resolution to this  problem for the people who are affected by it in our constituency, and, in  particular, Dundonald.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I congratulate Mr McNarry on securing the debate on what is an important topic.  The acuteness of the problem in Dundonald is accentuated by the fact that it is  such a sizeable settlement and one that is very much growing. Mr McNarry  referred to the &ldquo;village&rdquo; a couple of times  during his opening remarks. That is  how local people, us included, refer to Dundonald. However, it is actually a major town, and we  sometimes forget that because of its closeness to Belfast. It is the second largest settlement in the Strangford constituency and, therefore, is deserving of the attention  that he calls for today. I hope that  the Minister can respond favourably.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I want to take the  Minister further into the constituency, along the A22 Comber Road, but he may not be able  to get down that road today; my understanding is that it was flooded in three  places this morning. Perhaps, as he travels down it, that is another problem  that he can look into. Mr McNarry will know of the situation in Castle Street and Mill Street in  Comber where there have been long-standing problems with access for disabled  people and also with the standard of the pavements and kerbs.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The people of Cookstown pride themselves in having the  widest main street in Northern    Ireland; the people of Comber have to face  the scourge of having the narrowest main street. That brings attendant  problems: to say that Castle Street  and Mill Street  are &ldquo;Victorian looking&rdquo; does a great disservice to the many outstanding  Victorian engineers who helped to build our country. The state of the footpaths  and kerbs is appalling, and that problem is accentuated in the minds of local  people by the constant appearance of yellow spray paint along the streets,  which shows just what a problem there is. That presents hazards for elderly,  infirm and disabled people.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Northern Ireland Water  is due to undertake extensive work in  that area, and the much-anticipated and much-welcomed installation of  Phoenix Natural Gas is also due to begin soon. I am not asking the Minister to  improve the street only to have it dug up again at a later date. As elected  representatives, we have all encountered that frustration.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I support the  sentiments of the debate about Dundonald; I ask the Minister to ensure  that the work of Northern Ireland Water and Roads Service on Castle Street and Mill Street in Comber is dovetailed and  co-ordinated.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Member for securing the debate and for allowing me the opportunity not only to support  him but to raise the issue of Castle    Street and Mill Street in Comber.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: It seems that the boundaries of Dundonald have been pushed out a  bit.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development (Mr Murphy)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.  I thank the Member for securing this  Adjournment debate.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I have noted the comments made by the various Members who contributed to the debate and the  concerns that they have expressed. I welcome the opportunity to discuss  parking and access for people with disabilities in Dundonald and Castlereagh. I  have asked my officials to take a note of the Hansard report, so that if I fail  to pick up on any of the points that Members have raised, I can write to them  later. Specifically, I will ask my officials to write to Mr Hamilton about the  points he raised about streets in Comber. I do not have that information to  hand to answer him now.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">By way of background to this issue, and in case Members are not familiar with the range of  concessions that are available through the disabled persons&rsquo; badge  scheme, I will briefly summarise what is available to blue-badge holders, who  travel either as drivers or passengers.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Badge holders may usually park on single or double yellow  lines for up to three hours, except where there is a ban on loading or  unloading, or within 15 m of a junction. They may also park without a time  limit, irrespective of the parking times imposed on other users, and free of  charge without time limit in on-street pay-and-display bays. Additional parking  facilities can take one of two forms: either the provision of disabled-parking  bays close to town centres and local facilities; or the provision of disabled parking near an individual&rsquo;s home  or place of work. Currently, there are no general disabled-parking bays in  Dundonald village.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">In Mr McNarry&rsquo;s contribution today, and in his interview  this morning, he discussed the general disabled-parking provision in Dundonald village.  Officials from my Department&rsquo;s Roads Service have no record of a specific  request for such provision, but I have asked  them to review current parking arrangements to see if a facility for  disabled drivers can be provided. They are happy to do that. Roads Service is  happy to discuss the specifics with the Member or any of his constituents. If Members want other sites to be  considered, they should let me know, and I will arrange for those to be  examined.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I am aware of the importance of providing parking for  disabled people, to provide access to shopping, healthcare and other essential  services. My Department funds the work of the Inclusive Mobility Transport  Advisory Committee (IMTAC), which is the lead partner in the Baywatch Campaign,  which seeks to end the abuse of parking bays that are provided for the use of  disabled people. It challenges public attitudes and encourages service  providers to do more. We have had some of that commentary in relation to  today&rsquo;s debate.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">In December 2007, I was pleased to reaffirm my support for  the Baywatch Campaign, when I was invited to launch &lsquo;Providing Accessible  Parking: A Good Practice Guide&rsquo;. Recently, the Baywatch Campaign conducted a  survey into the misuse of disabled-parking bays: misuse had fallen from 25% last  year to 21% now. Mr Shannon referred to those figures. Of course, 21% is  unacceptable: nonetheless, the trend is in the right direction. I hope that  that will continue. Today&rsquo;s debate will add to the public&rsquo;s awareness of the  issues.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Enforcement of accessible parking regulations is crucial  for on-street and Roads Service car parks. My Department has the power to  deliver a clear and consistent message that abuse or misuse of the blue-badge  scheme will not be tolerated. I encourage all public- and private-sector  parking suppliers to adopt a similar approach.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">With regard to applications for a disabled-parking bay  outside someone&rsquo;s home or place of work, the Department uses several criteria  to assess that person&rsquo;s specific need because provision of underused bays can  have considerable effect on residents. Although bays are normally provided for drivers who have a disability, they  may, in cases of special hardship, be provided when a passenger is disabled.  Two disabled-parking bays are provided in  residential locations in the Dundonald area. I understand that since  December 2003, my officials have received  14 requests for disabled-parking bays in the Dundonald area. For various  reasons, none of them has met the requirements for the provision of a disabled  bay. My officials will continue to assess any further requests for bays outside  individuals&rsquo; homes or workplaces in the normal manner.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Department takes the needs of disabled people seriously  and aims to provide drop kerbs in all new works and in footway reconstruction  works in all town centres, particularly where a shop mobility scheme operates,  as well as in urban areas in order to link town centres with residential areas,  and in the vicinity of on-street disabled-parking bays. In the Dundonald area,  several recent works have helped disabled people&rsquo;s mobility, including  improvements to the East Link Road, the Old  Dundonald Road, the Upper Newtownards Road, the East Link Road junction at the  Ulster Hospital, the pelican  crossing at the Comber Road near Cumberland Road and the provision of a  new pelican crossing on the Comber Road at Grand Prix Park.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Drop kerbs and tactile paving are being provided in  association with the resurfacing scheme that is on-site on the Comber Road.  Similar works are also planned for several other sites around Dundonald. With  regard to the difficulties that are presented to wheelchair users in Dundonald  from vehicles that park either totally or partially on the footways, I  understand that both the Upper    Newtownards Road and the Comber Road, which run through the two  main commercial areas, are subject to urban clearway restrictions. As such,  vehicles are prohibited from parking on the footways at all times. I have asked  my officials to ensure that appropriate enforcement is carried out at those  locations. In other areas with no marked restrictions, enforcement is a matter  for the PSNI.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, I hope that I have dealt with all Members&rsquo;  concerns. As I said at the start of my speech, I have asked officials to take a  note of the Hansard report of the debate. If I have missed any points that  Members raised, I will write to them with clarification.</p>
