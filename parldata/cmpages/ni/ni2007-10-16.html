		    <p class="B3BodyText"><em>Members observed two minutes&rsquo; silence.</em></p>
		    <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="1"></a>Ministerial Statement</p>
		    <p class="H4StageHeading">Outcome of the Proposed Irish-Language Legislation  Consultation Process</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt; ">Mr Speaker</span></strong>: I have received notice from the Minister of Culture, Arts and  Leisure that he wishes to make a statement regarding the outcome of the  consultation process for the proposed Irish language legislation.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure (Mr <span style="letter-spacing:-.05pt; ">Poots)</span></strong>: I have placed in the Assembly Library copies of  a report summarising the responses received during the consultation of March to  June 2007 on the proposed Irish language legislation. The main focus of that  second <span style="letter-spacing:-.2pt; ">consultation was to ascertain public  opinion on a possible</span> legislative framework for Irish language  legislation.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The draft framework proposed the creation of a duty on  public authorities to prepare a language scheme specifying the measures that  they would take on the use of the Irish  language in the provision of their services. The establishment of a new  oversight body &mdash; an Irish language commissioner &mdash; was also proposed. The  commissioner would have the function of approving and overseeing language  schemes.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, it was proposed that a person would be able to  use Irish in legal proceedings in courts and tribunals sitting in Northern Ireland,  subject to the provision of notice and the interests of justice. Finally, a  draft provision was also included enabling certain statutory forms to be made  available in Irish.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">A total of 11,000 written responses were received, as well  as petitions containing 629 names. Of the total number of respondents, 7,500 &mdash;  65% &mdash; indicated support for some form of legislation.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Over 4,000 &mdash; 35% &mdash; of all respondents were against any form  of legislation. Approximately 80% of responses were submitted in the form of a  pro forma, drafted by individuals or organisations to assist themselves and  others.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank all the individuals and the 168 organisations who  responded to the consultation. The sheer number of responses confirms the  strong and divergent views on this issue in the community. It is my intention  to publish all the responses on the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure  website by the end of the calendar year, in line with departmental  accessibility guidelines.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Among those in favour of the legislation, there was a  divergence of views as to the form that it should take, with the majority  advocating a rights-based approach. Those who opposed the legislation raised  several concerns, including the significant  resource consequences of implementing legislation, its potentially  divisive repercussions and concerns that  the proposed legislation was a political concession in the context of  the discussions at St Andrews.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">With regard to costs, in 2006-07, Northern Ireland Civil  Service (NICS) Departments and the Northern Ireland Office (NIO) incurred  expenditure of &pound;20&middot;62 million on a range of Irish-language projects and  translations. That figure includes &pound;10&middot;3 million from the Department of  Education for Irish-medium education. It does not include expenditure incurred  by the Northern Ireland Court Service or by local councils on Irish  translations and linguistic-diversity projects, nor does it include resources &mdash;  that is, salaries and running costs &mdash; deployed by the various Departments in  arranging the commitments associated with the &pound;20&middot;62 million annual  expenditure.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText"><span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt; ">Members will appreciate  that it is difficult to estimate</span> the cost and resource issues that could  arise from Irish language legislation. For example, a rights-based framework  would likely have greater costs than a language-scheme framework. Equally, it  is difficult to estimate the cost and resource requirements of a  language-scheme framework without clarity on the content and extent of a  typical language scheme.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Officials in my Department undertook a high-level exercise to estimate the cost of implementing a  language-scheme framework, which was the indicative legislative  framework set out in the consultation document of 13 March 2007. For the  purposes of that exercise, the estimates were based on the assumption that the  legislation would be applied across all Departments and the NIO in the  financial year 2008-09, and drew, where possible, upon estimates based on experiences  in Wales and in the Republic of Ireland.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">For example, if Northern   Ireland were to have an Irish-language commissioner&rsquo;s  office similar to that in the Republic of Ireland, the annual running costs would  be approximately &pound;500,000. The translation service for the Houses of the  Oireachtas costs approximately &pound;600,000 per annum, compared to &pound;1&middot;28 million in  the National Assembly for Wales.  It is estimated that almost &pound;200,000 per  annum would be required to provide simultaneous translation in Irish for  the Court Service, and a similar amount for tribunals.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In respect of the 11 Departments  and the NIO, it is estimated that, in 2008-09, if each were to deploy two dedicated staff members, each fluent  in Irish, to develop Irish-language schemes, monitor their implementation, give  advice and arrange translations, the annual cost would be approximately  &pound;927,000. The printing and design of forms  to facilitate Irish-language schemes in the 11 Departments could cost approximately  &pound;309,000, and advertising costs could be in the region of &pound;931,000, based on a  20% uplift to take account of the increased advertising costs for Irish.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important to stress that those broad estimates concern mainly the 11 Departments. Those  Departments employ 22,973 civil servants, as opposed to the wider public  sector, which employs 111,128 in local govern&shy;ment, health trusts, education  and library boards, and various NDPBs.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">If estimates of the cost of implementing a language-scheme  approach in the 11 Departments were to be extrapolated across the wider public  sector, and if, for example, the agreed language schemes required public bodies  to provide bilingual services, the costs  would clearly be significant.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Members will be aware of current pressures on public  expenditure in Northern Ireland.  In light of that, it is highly debatable whether our community is prepared to  contemplate the level of expenditure that would be required to introduce even a  modest form of Irish-language legislation at this time. There will always be  competing priorities for public expenditure; however, can the additional  potential cost be justified in comparison with the investment that is needed  for infrastructure, health, and other vital public services?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, bearing in mind that approximately &pound;20&middot;62 million per annum is currently spent on  Irish-language projects and translations, I doubt whether the  legislative route will be necessarily the most cost-effective way of achieving  the aims of enhancing and protecting the development of the Irish language.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">My purpose in publishing the summary of responses to the 13  March consultation paper by way of this statement is to afford Members an  opportunity to offer some initial views on the matter. I intend to fully engage  with the Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure before bringing the matter to  the Executive.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Having reviewed the responses to both consultation  processes, and having reflected carefully on all the relevant issues, I remain  unpersuaded that there is a compelling case  for introducing Irish-language legislation at this time.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">My first reason for making that decision is that, in view  of the political sensitivities on linguistic and cultural policy issues, it is  clear that the proposal to introduce an Irish language Bill is divisive in our  community. The proposal has given rise to highly politicised claims and  counterclaims. As a community, we are faced with the challenge of finding new  ways of managing our rich cultural diversity. Indeed, that challenge is  enshrined in the duty that was placed on the Executive by the Northern Ireland  (St Andrews Agreement) Act 2006 to:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;adopt a strategy  setting out how it proposes to enhance and protect the development of the Irish  language&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">and to:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;adopt a strategy  setting out how it proposes to enhance and develop the Ulster Scots  language, heritage and culture&rdquo;.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The UK Government signed the European Treaty for Regional  or Minority Languages on 2 March 2000. The resulting charter was ratified on 27  March 2001 and came into force on 1 July 2001. That is an international  convention that was designed to protect and promote regional and minority  languages. In Northern    Ireland, it applies to Irish and to Ulster  Scots. The committee of experts that is  examining the imple&shy;mentation of the charter in the UK has  recommended the development of a comprehensive policy for the Irish language.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is my assessment that the proposal to introduce  Irish-language legislation at this time is unlikely to command the necessary  support in the Assembly on the grounds of being incapable of securing  sufficient consensus.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">If we reflect on the  introduction of language legislation in Wales,  the Republic of Ireland  and Scotland,  experience there clearly shows that giving legislative effect to linguistic  policies needs to occur in a depoliticised manner that is capable of commanding  broadly based community support. The two  consultation processes that have taken place on the proposal to  introduce Irish-language legislation, and the ensuing public commentary,  clearly demonstrate the lack of community consensus on the issue.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">10.45 am</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, given the sensitivities involved, if the  development of the Irish language is to be enhanced and protected, it would be counterproductive to go down the legislative route. The proposed legislation is  unlikely to command sufficient consensus in the community at this time,  so, if it were to be advanced, it could damage good relations, increase  polarisation and entrench suspicions and  patterns of antipathy. That could seriously undermine the efforts of  those in the Irish-speaking community who genuinely want to see the language developed in a depoliticised and wholly inclusive  manner.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Based on a high-level cost estimate, the introduction of  even a modest language-scheme legislative model would have significant resource  implications. Mindful of the constraints on  public expenditure, and, in particular, the pressures in my Department  alone, I cannot reconcile the likely opportunity costs of introducing legislation  and other spending priorities.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">If our aim is to achieve the tangible outcomes of enhancing  and protecting the development of the Irish language and facilitating those who  wish to use Irish in their dealings with the public sector, I consider the  legislative route to be a disproportionately costly method of achieving  positive outcomes. The legislative requirement placed on the Executive to adopt  a strategy to enhance and protect the development of the Irish language offers  a more cost-effective and proportionate alternative.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I have carefully considered the proposal in annex B to the  St Andrews Agreement to &ldquo;introduce an Irish Language Act&rdquo; and the consultation  processes on which the previous Administration embarked. I fully acknowledge  that there are those in the Northern    Ireland community who have a close affinity  with the Irish language and have legitimate aspirations to secure its official  recognition and protection.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The enhancement and protection of the development of the Irish language is an important matter for Northern<span style="letter-spacing:0pt; "> Ireland</span>, as is the enhancement and protection of the Ulster-Scots language,  heritage and culture. However, I remain unpersuaded that a compelling case for  progressing legislation exists at this time. There is insufficient community  consensus, and there are potentially significant costs. Moreover, there is a  real possibility that legislation could undermine good relations. In so doing,  it could prove counterproductive to those who wish to see the language  developed in a non-politicised and inclusive manner.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In publishing the  report that summarises the responses received to the consultation  exercise that ran from March until June  2007, and in outlining in my statement my current assessment of the  proposal to introduce an Irish language  Bill, I trust that I can assist the Assembly&rsquo;s deliberations. I will be most interested to hear Members&rsquo; views.  I am scheduled to discuss the matter with the Committee  for Culture, Arts and Leisure later this month, after which I will  prepare a paper for discussion by the Executive.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Before the Minister takes questions, I remind Members that they are to ask  questions, not make further statements. I shall allow Chairpersons of  Committees some latitude.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure (Mr McElduff)</strong>: Go raibh  maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Ar maidin t&aacute; faill d&eacute;anta sa Ghaeilge sa tion&oacute;l  seo. Drochsc&eacute;al ar fad at&aacute; i gceist agus drochsh&iacute;ni&uacute; &oacute;n Aire. Agus is m&oacute;r an  trua sin, is m&oacute;r an trua sin.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister will know, a Chathaoirligh, that, both on  Friday afternoon and yesterday, in my capacity as Chairperson &mdash; Cathaoirligh &mdash;  of the Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure, I attempted, through my  Committee staff, to contact the Minister by telephone and email on more than 10  occasions. I wanted to secure a meeting with him so that he might respond to  developing speculation in the media about the content of this morning&rsquo;s  statement.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I will not go on at length, but, suffice it to say, the  Minister demonstrated neither confidence nor courtesy, effectively giving the Cathaoirligh of the Committee the  runaround. I was told he might be available to meet me in the afternoon but, of  course, that meeting never came to be. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order, Members.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  Speaking in a personal capacity, I wish to say that this morning&rsquo;s announcement  constitutes a mistake. It is a retrograde step that sends out a negative signal  to the growing Irish-language community in the North of Ireland.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister is missing a major opportunity to prove that  he is capable of being, and willing to be, a Minister for all the people. I am  suspicious of the Minister&rsquo;s view that:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;it is highly  debatable whether our community is prepared to contemplate the level of  expenditure that would be required to introduce even a modest form of  Irish-language legislation at this time.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Is the Minister placing  the Irish-language community in the North of Ireland outside of his  community? Is his definition of &ldquo;community&rdquo; exclusive of the Irish-speaking community  in the North of Ireland? If it is, it strikes me that the term &ldquo;Minister of  Culture&rdquo; is an oxymoron when it is applied to the post&rsquo;s incumbent.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">One consultation was  not enough. When the Minister did not like the outcome of the first one,  he decided to carry out a second. Is it the  case that the total percentage of responses, over the two consultations,  in favour of Acht na Gaeilge &mdash; an Irish language Act &mdash; was 75%?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Does the Minister agree that, as with the Welsh example,  the best way in which to depoliticise the Irish language is to place such rights at the heart of legislation? Is  iad sin mo cheisteanna, a Cheann Comhairle.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  The Member spoke of placing the Irish language at the heart of people&rsquo;s rights.  Individuals have rights in this country. The first such right is the right to  life, and, thereafter, there are a series of other rights. I am not denying  anyone the right to speak in the Irish language. We do not necessarily need  Irish-language legislation to enable the Irish language to flourish. For  example, there is Irish-language legislation in the Republic of Ireland,  yet use of the Irish language is diminishing there. In Northern Ireland,  we do not currently have an Irish language Bill, yet it has been told to me by  a number of sources that use of the Irish language is growing here.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Introducing a Bill will not, of itself, necessarily  encourage or increase the use of the Irish language. Members must reflect on  that and take a considered view of the situation when deciding how they want to  take the issue forward genuinely.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">When I refer to the community, I refer to the entire community. I am referring not to Irish-language  speakers, Ulster-Scots speakers, unionists or nationalists, but to the  whole community. Irish-language speakers are part of that community. There are those in the Irish-speaking community who are very keen to see the issue  progressed in a way that is not politicised.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I have had the privilege of meeting people who are involved  in the Scottish Gaelic-speaking community. The difference between the situation  in Scotland and that in Northern Ireland is that, in Scotland,  language is not a political matter. Language does not necessarily represent a  barrier there. Members opposite, in particular, but also people outside of the  Chamber, must reflect on that fact and determine how they can take the matter  forward in a non-political way.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCausland</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his statement, which clearly demonstrates that an  Irish language Act would be divisive and  extremely expensive. Does the Minister agree that the European Charter  for Regional or Minority Languages, to which the United Kingdom Government are  committed, provides a good framework for advancing both minority languages in  Northern Ireland?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister, in considering the matter further, take  account of the situation in Wales,  where there is growing concern,  particularly in the business community, at the cost of implementing the  provisions that some activists are demanding?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  The European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages is a European  directive, so we must abide by it, even if we do not wish to. Indeed, through  our actions, we are more than abiding by it. We do not need to introduce  legislation to work within its framework.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, the European Charter for Regional or Minority  Languages is the context in which we must work and the means through which we  can identify how to make progress.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McCausland talked about the costs of language schemes in  Wales,  where such legislation has been enacted. The costs that I identified were at  the lower end of the scale and were for a language-based rather than a rights-based scheme, which would be  considerably more expensive than a language-based scheme.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  It is regrettable that the Chairperson of the Committee for Culture, Arts and  Leisure did not consult with the Deputy  Chairperson about his concerns, either last Friday or yesterday.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. The Member has the Floor.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  Clearly, the fact that last week&rsquo;s Ulster Unionist&rsquo;s motion on the Irish  language was defeated has demonstrated that the House was both deeply divided  and reflective of public opinion. Will the Minister confirm the Assembly&rsquo;s  authority on the matter by asserting that  the powers to introduce an Irish language Act will not be transferred to  Westminster, allowing it to be imposed on us? That would be  counter&shy;productive to local democracy and would further undermine the  good relations that he and I know must be made in this matter.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  This is a devolved matter. If Westminster wishes  to take back devolved matters, under the Sewel guidelines, this House would  have to vote in favour of Westminster&rsquo;s  making such a decision.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Members may wish to look to other places, but I say that  they should look to this House to ascertain how we can make progress on this  and other contentious issues. It will be a test of the Assembly &mdash; and of the  willingness of Members &mdash; as to how we can work with one another for the benefit of the wider community in the  months ahead.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Leis an fh&iacute;rinne a dh&eacute;anamh, a  Cheann Comhairle, n&iacute;l m&oacute;r&aacute;n iontas orm ins an mh&eacute;id a chuala m&eacute; anseo ar maidin mar bh&iacute; an f&oacute;gra d&eacute;anta cheana  f&eacute;in an tseachtain seo chaite ag an tUas McNarry anseo ar leathanach tosaigh den Newsletter, s&oacute; ceapaim go  bhfuil poll &aacute;it &eacute;igin i long an Chult&uacute;ir, an Roinn Chult&uacute;ir, Eala&iacute;on  agus F&oacute;ill&iacute;ochta, agus b&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir gur ch&oacute;ir don Aire paiste a chur ar an pholl sin.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. Let us have the question.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  To translate, I was just saying that I was not really surprised by what I have  heard in the Chamber this morning, given that Mr McNarry made the announcement  last week on the front page of the &lsquo;News Letter&rsquo;. It looks very much as though  there is a hole &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  I will give you a copy, and that will keep you abreast of things.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Thank you.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>A Member</strong>:  What is the question?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  There is a hole in the good ship CAL,  and perhaps the Minister should seek to fix the leak in the future. The  Minister seems to understand the cost of everything and the value of nothing.  He uses the financial issue to cover up the fact that he has given in to pressures  &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. I ask the Member to take his seat. I have continually tried to give  Members some latitude. I said repeatedly at the start of the debate that  statements should not be made to the Minister; we should have questions.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  My question is that, given that the Minister has abdicated his duty to  implement the promises made by the two Governments in the St Andrews Agreement:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;to introduce an Irish Language Act reflecting on the  experience of Wales and Ireland&rdquo;,</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">will he now advise the British Government of that  abdication and ask that the matter be dealt with at Westminster? Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat, a  Cheann Comhairle.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: I  have no responsibility over decisions that the Governments of the Republic of Ireland  and the UK  make. I make that completely clear.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">This House is its own master, and this House will make the  decision. For years, some Members on the opposite Benches were shouting &ldquo;Brits  out&rdquo;, but now they want the Brits in to make this decision. I can assure the  House &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. The Minister has the Floor.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">11.00 am</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: I  can assure the House that at no time during any talks was the DUP consulted on  an Irish language Bill or legislation. If the Member cares to read the Northern Ireland  (St Andrews Agreement) Act 2006, he will  find that there is no reference to proposals for Irish language  legislation.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  The Alliance Party saw some potential in an Irish-language scheme as a means of  trying to find common ground, albeit with a very light touch. What efforts did  the Minister make to try to find common ground in the polarised debate between  those, on the one hand, who want a rights-based approach and those, on the other hand, who want no legislation  whatsoever?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">With respect to costs, what consideration was given to  pooling resources in a central Government unit, rather than duplicating  translation services across all 11 Departments and the rest of the Northern  Ireland Civil Service? Given that the Minister is now with&shy;drawing proposals  for an Irish language Act, is he prepared to come back to the Assembly with  plans for a comprehensive language Act that will address not only the cultural  demands of speakers of Irish and Ulster Scots but also the real needs of those  people who speak non-indigenous languages in Northern Ireland and who find it  difficult to access services?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  Consultation has not finished on this issue. If the Member had listened to what  I said, he would know that I am going back to the Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure and the Executive  Committee. The Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure is a microcosm of  the House, and I can think of no better place to find common ground. If that  Committee can identify an agreed way to  proceed, I, as Minister, will be happy  to work with it. I look forward to the Committee&rsquo;s proposals and  discussions, under Mr McElduff&rsquo;s chairmanship, after which we can consider how  to progress the issue in the way that the Member outlined.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s report on the Irish language Act. It is good that we  are discussing the matter, which is one of the biggest issues in my constituency of Strangford, from where the  Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure received 600 responses to its  consultation. The issue gets people&rsquo;s hackles up, and the costs are horrendous.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister mentioned  costs. Can he confirm that the Northern Ireland Office costs are &pound;20  million? He also mentioned &pound;500,000 for the language commissioner&rsquo;s office, and  that it would be &pound;1&middot;2 million if compared to the National Assembly for Wales. For the  11 Departments, he mentioned:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;annual costs &hellip;  &pound;927,000 &hellip; printing and design &hellip; &pound;309,000, and advertising costs &hellip; of  &pound;931,000&rdquo;.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">It sounds a lot like that Abba song:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Money, money, money  &hellip;</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">It&rsquo;s a rich man&rsquo;s  world.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText" style="text-indent:0cm;">In this case, it is Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s  world, but it is not in the mind, or in the world, of ordinary people. How  much, per annum, will it cost the Civil  Service and other public bodies if an Irish language Act is imposed?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: In  2006-07, all Departments and the NIO incurred costs of some &pound;117,000 on Irish  translations; the overall costs for translations were over &pound;1 million. All  Departments and the NIO spent &pound;3,484,000 on linguistic  diversity projects. The Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure spent  over &pound;3 million on the Irish-language broadcasting fund and &pound;3,556,000 on Foras  na Gaeilge. The Department of Education spent &pound;10,303,000 on Irish-medium  education, and the Department for Employment and Learning spent &pound;100,000. If  Members suggest that the Government are not committed to Irish-language  funding, those figures show that that is not the case.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As regards additional  commitments for Irish-language translation, we would be looking for an  anticipated &pound;1 million over the next 10 years. For Foras na Gaeilge, we would  be looking for almost &pound;12 million over the next 10 years. For the  Irish-language commissioner&rsquo;s office, we would be looking for &pound;7,600,000 over  the next 10 years. For the translation service, based on what is happening in Wales, we would  be looking for a further &pound;16,916,000. For the Court Service, we would be  looking for &pound;2,117,000. For tribunals, we would be looking for &pound;2,117,000. For  printing and design, we would be looking for &pound;3,385,000. For advertising and  publicity, we would be looking for &pound;10,193,000, and for an Irish language  branch, we would be looking for &pound;10,150,000.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Totting all that up &mdash; and this is for the language scheme  route, rather than the rights-based route &mdash; we would be looking at costs over  the next 10 years of &pound;291,538,000 for the Northern Ireland Civil Service and  Northern Ireland Office alone. They account for 22,000-odd civil servants. If  it were extrapolated out to local government, NDPBs and other functions of  government, there would be 111,000 people, so the figures could be increased  fivefold if we were to go down that route. That is the extent of what is being  asked of me. When Members ask me to consider doing this, I have to look at the  costs and the value of it. At the same time, there are other pressing and vital  issues being raised by Members on a weekly basis on the Floor of this House.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Adams</strong>: Go  raibh m&iacute;le maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle, agus t&aacute; m&eacute; bu&iacute;och duitse agus t&aacute; m&eacute;  bu&iacute;och don Aire, ach caithfidh m&eacute; a r&aacute; fosta n&iacute;l iontas ar bith ormsa. T&aacute; c&uacute;pla  ceisteanna agamsa. An bhfuil eagla ar an Aire roimh an teanga? Is leis an Aire  an teanga. Is le achan duine an teanga seo agus bealach amh&aacute;in n&oacute; bealach eile  beidh Acht an Gaeilge ann.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I have just a few questions for the Minister, a Cheann  Comhairle. Does he agree that it costs the same to provide English-language  services as it does to provide Irish-language services? Does he agree &mdash; and perhaps he will reflect on this &mdash; that he did a  disservice to two languages this morning? He did a disservice to the  English language, in the perverted way in which he tried to put forward  spurious reasons for his judgement this morning, and to the Irish language. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order, Members. Order.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Adams</strong>:  Does the Minister accept that the way to depoliticise Irish-language rights is  to make them an administrative matter? Will he take the opportunity to spell out to us how he intends to deliver on the  commit&shy;ments that he and his party made in relation to the Irish language in the St Andrews Agreement? Will he  accept, finally, that, one way or another, there will be an Irish  language Act?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: As regards equivalence of costs, translation comes at a price,  and I have identified that price very clearly. I have identified the lower  level of costs that would be accrued, as  opposed to the higher level of costs.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In education, I understand that there are around 4,000  children in the Irish-medium sector. The costs there are clearly higher than  those in the mainstream, and if the educationalists in the Chamber want to look  at that matter, they will see that it costs more money to educate children in  the Irish-medium sector than in the mainstream. That is a choice for another  Minister to make, but she has to make that  choice within the budget that is  applied to her. That should be reflected upon when we come to making  budgetary decisions. I under&shy;stand that the Department of Education needs  substantially more money than it currently has in order to deliver many of its  key priorities.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Certain Members opposite could greatly assist in  depoliticising the use of the Irish language. When they speak in broken Irish  in the House, it does nothing to encourage the wider community. Rather, it  persuades people to resist the Irish language. It does not benefit Irish-language  activists who genuinely want to make progress in a depoliticised way. I have  spoken to people in the Irish-speaking community who have made it clear that  they wish that the language issue were not politicised, because it should be a  purely cultural one.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Members across the Chamber must reflect on that point, because the more that they politicise the  issue and try to ram it down people&rsquo;s throats, the less likely it becomes that individuals will be encouraged to  think that the Irish language should  be developed and preserved on the  basis that it is important culturally. The approach that has been taken  by the leader of the party opposite has been most unhelpful, particularly in  the House.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Browne</strong>:  I congratulate the Minister on the way in  which he has conducted business on the subject. Given the legislative restrictions contained in The Budget  (Northern Ireland) Order 2007 that determine what can be taken from the  Consolidated Fund, as well as our limited  ability to raise further moneys, will the Minister clarify whether the  introduction of an Irish language Bill would have a detrimental effect on  spending on arts and sport?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  Were an Irish language Bill to be introduced, my Department would have to bid  for substantially greater funds. If we did not receive those extra funds, that  would have a detrimental impact on the arts, sport, and everything else for  which the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure has respons&shy;ibility. If we  were successful in bidding for that extra funding, it would have a detrimental  impact on other Departments, as that money would have to come out of their  budgets.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages  identifies terms of value for protecting and enhancing  languages. The suggestion by some Members this morning has been that  Irish-language legislation is the best way in which to achieve that. I am open  to listening to a convincing argument, but one has yet to be made. However, I  look forward to hearing the Committee make  its case, and to agreeing a way forward.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  I am sure that members of the public who are watching and listening to the  debate will have been horrified to learn of the sums of money that are already  being expended on the Irish language. It may have come as a surprise to  Members, too.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Doubtless, patients who are lying on a hospital trolley  would be mightily comforted to look up and see a sign in Irish that told them  that they were lying in a hospital corridor. I am sure that the parent of a  child with literacy problems, who attends a school in one of the working-class  districts about which the Minister of Education tells the House that she is  concerned, would want to see a reading-recovery teacher in that school rather  than an Irish-language sign at the end of the school&rsquo;s street.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">At one stage, on hearing the sums of money that the  Minister cited, I thought that we were to get two stadia.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I ask the Member to come to his question.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  I am coming to the question, Mr Speaker. Does the Minister agree that Sinn F&eacute;in  has succeeded in scoring a spectacular own goal, and that its strident approach  has scuppered what might have been accepted had it been genuinely presented as  one form of cultural diversity in our community?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: I  will allow Members to make their own judgements on what Sinn F&eacute;in has done. I  am prepared to continue to speak with people in the Irish-language community,  and to others, to identify a way in which to ensure progress in Northern Ireland.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">11.15 am</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">What members of other parties do is up to them. However, I  did indicate in my response to Mr Adams that, very often, people do not help  themselves.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Ramsey</strong>:  Will the Minister agree that deep anxiety, concern and frustration will be felt  by Irish-language groups across Northern    Ireland as a result of his statement?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Bearing in mind the  Minister&rsquo;s comment that the two consultation processes to date led him  to believe that an Irish language Act would not command community consensus,  does he agree that there is deep worry and suspicion that the second  consultation process was contrived to enable troops to gather momentum in opposition to the first consultation process? Why  was the second consultation process  necessary, when the first one commanded 93% support for an Irish language  Act?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister gave a  commitment that he would make himself available to the Committee for  Culture, Arts and Leisure on any Thursday.  Why, then, did he not feel that it was appropriate, good manners and  respectful to bring his statement to the Committee for discussion? The Minister  talked about securing consensus from the Committee &mdash; failing to discuss this  issue with the Committee is not a good way of doing that.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Given that legislation exists to support the Welsh language  in Wales and Scottish Gaelic  in Scotland, and given Northern Ireland&rsquo;s current constitutional status  as part of the UK, why does  the Minister not consider that an exception should be made in Northern Ireland  for the Irish language?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  The Irish-language community have lost nothing  today. The money that was on the table is still on the table. I have not taken away the level of  expenditure on the Irish language that currently exists. Let not the  message go out that I have decided, in a sectarian or bigoted way, to move  against the Irish-language community.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I have reflected on a consultation process that indicated  that clear divisions on this issue exist in the community. A previous  contributor indicated that I introduced the second consultation process because  I did not like the results of the first one.  That is absolute rubbish. I inherited a situation in which the second  consultation process was under way. In fact, I was under pressure from people  outside of this House, such as Jim Allister, to stop the second consultation  process. He must have been satisfied by the outcome of the first consultation process because he did not want the  second one to proceed.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is clearly evident that the second consultation process,  in conjunction with the first one, identified clear community division on this  issue. When there is clear community division, it is unlikely that there will  be consensus in this House.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As for working with the  Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure, I am scheduled to attend the  Committee meeting on 25 October 2007 to discuss this matter in detail. The  figures have been drawn together, and the analysis has been completed. The  normal protocol for a Minister is to bring  those matters to the House, which encapsulates  everyone who was elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly. I am happy to  go into this issue in much greater detail with the Committee, and to discuss it with the Committee to ascertain the best way  forward. I look forward to illumination from that body.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brolly</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat. The Minister must be  aware of the message that he is sending out, not only specifically to  Irish-language organisations, but to all organisations in the North who are  involved in cultural matters. Most Gaelic  cultural bodies and sporting bodies are committed by their constitutions  to the promotion of the Irish language. That includes the GAA and Comhaltas  Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; Eireann &mdash; the Dublin-based organisation  that looks after traditional Irish music and other cultural matters, and  which will be appearing in the Long Gallery  tomorrow night or the night after that.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">So there is a huge community outside those specifically  Irish-language organisations that will take great offence at the statement, and  the Minister will certainly hear from them. If I could make another point before  I ask the question &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I ask the Member to put his question.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brolly</strong>: I will. The Minister is being a bit disin&shy;genuous regarding  costs, particularly with respect to Irish-medium  education. As Mr Adams said, youngsters will be educated in any event.  The Minister should have given figures for the difference in costs between  Irish-medium and English-medium education. Is the Minister fully aware of the  impact that his decision will have beyond Irish-language groups?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: I  am not sure that I am fully aware of the impact that my decision will have.  However, I am fully aware that any decision I make will have a tremendous  impact on the wider community. For example, while more than &pound;20 million is  being spent on the Irish language, when I took office, my Department was  spending zero &mdash; no pounds &mdash; on sign language, which benefits people who cannot  speak, who have only that language, and can choose to speak no other language.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">On 6 October, I was in Dungiven, which is in the Member&rsquo;s  constituency, and I had a tremendous evening  with the Hands That Talk group. My sympathies are clearly with those who  have to communicate in a language that is exclusive to them and who are unable  to communicate in any other language. Taking &pound;20 million from the Budget and  pouring it into Irish- language schemes would have an impact across the  community. Whatever my decision, there will be an impact, and I must consider  these issues in the round.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The matter is still open for discussion in Committee. I have identified the costs, the results of the  consultation process and the  difficulties. If Members can demonstrate to me that those difficulties  are surmountable; I am open to hear what they say.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  I congratulate the Minister on his positive  statement, which will send out a clear message. No-one would understand  why he should commit to expenditure of &pound;291 million over the next 10 years on  the Irish language. That language is its current position because of the  attitude of the folk opposite who have sought at every turn to politicise it.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister assure Members that he will not bend to  political pressure such as that which comes from  the other side of the House? The Members opposite may have got an  assurance at St Andrews, but they must go and talk to those who gave them that  assurance. They got no assurance from this side of the House, and they  had better face up to the fact that their dream is falling apart at their feet.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister assure the House that the money saved  will be spent effectively and in a way in which the whole community can  benefit? I am thinking of soccer, rugby and activities in which both sections  of the community already participate.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: I  find pressure readily absorbable. People can apply pressure if they wish.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As regards spending, I  cannot spend this money in any other way because I do not have it in the  first place. I do not think that the Government has that money because during  the comprehensive spending review, and at the Executive Committee meeting last  Monday, every Minister was outlining how more money is needed for his or her  Department.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Perhaps the Ministers of the parties opposite would  identify which part of their Budgets they would like to see cut so that this  scheme could be implemented. If they could demonstrate that, Members on this  side of the House might be able to take some of their cries more seriously.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  The Minister quoted many figures in his statement. Does he accept and  acknowledge that the &pound;10&middot;3 million of Department of Education money that he  mentioned is, in fact, ordinary education costs and not additional costs, and  that that money would be spent on children&rsquo;s education anyway, regardless of  the language in which those children are taught?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: I  accept that an element of those costs represents ordinary education costs, but  certainly not all of it. If I wanted to open a school for 12 children in my  area, I would be told to go away. However, if someone wants to open an  Irish-language school for 12 children, it seems that that can be achieved. The  reason that that situation is most aggravating lies in examples such as the one  in my constituency, where four schools that were to amalgamate, with more than  100 pupils among them, were all closed, yet  a few weeks or months later, new schools are being opened with as few as  12 pupils on the enrolment list. Obviously,  double standards are being applied.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">If a child happens to be taught in the controlled sector, that child will be discriminated against.  Children in that sector have less funding per child than children who  are taught in the Irish-language sector or, indeed, in the integrated sector.  It is clear that preferential treatment is being given to those who are taught  in Irish-medium schools, over and above those who are taught in other education  sectors.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>: I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement. Does he agree that any Irish-language group or  Irish-speaking person would not want cuts to front-line services, such  as education and health, in order to pay for an Irish language Act? Does he  further agree that the fact that only 75,000 people out of a population of 1&middot;7  million can speak the Irish language means that that would have been a waste of  taxpayers&rsquo; money?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: I  have laid down a challenge. I look forward to other Ministers stepping up to  the table to indicate the reductions that they can make in their departmental  spending in order to enable me to go ahead and produce the finance for that  measure. I do not believe that people want a reduction in health services,  infrastructure not being developed and promoted, or the economy taking second  or third place. They want the country to progress. The Celtic tiger was not based on the Gaeltacht, but on the  economy. Northern    Ireland must identify with that by moving  the economy forward and, therefore, by releasing more funding to develop  education, health and the other areas that most require it.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. De r&eacute;ir gach dealraimh is &eacute; an rud at&aacute;  againne inniu n&aacute; leithsc&eacute;al i ndiaidh leithsc&eacute;il agus fathanna n&aacute;r ch&oacute;ir rud ar  bith a dh&eacute;anamh mar mhaithe leis an teanga Gaeilge. The Assembly has been given  excuse after excuse as reasons not to advance the Irish language. However, I seek some clarity from the Minister. In his  speech, he referred to the European Charter that applies to Irish and Ulster  Scots, and to the report of the Council of Europe committee of experts. Can he  confirm whether he has now rejected that report?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: I  can confirm that the answer is no.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Anderson</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Bearing in mind that the Welsh  language has been protected by the Welsh Language Act since 1967, Scottish  Gaelic is now protected by legislation, and Irish is protected constitutionally  in the rest of Ireland,  does the Minister agree with Eamon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v&rsquo;s assessment that the North is the  missing piece of the jigsaw? Does the Minister care about the reaction or feelings of the Irish-speaking community? Does he  care about the effect of his  statement on the wider community?</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">11.30 am</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: I  have taken the wider community into consideration  in looking at this situation. It is important that we consider the views  of the wider community. As I have said, the Irish-language community has not  lost anything today. There are those who have suggested that legislation was  the best way forward on the matter. I have outlined the issues that surround  that &mdash;<span class="Italic"> [Interruption.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. The Minister has the Floor.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: I  have outlined the financial issues that surround  the proposal. I have also outlined issues relating to community support  and the communities that are opposed to any legislation, and the difficulties  therein. Looking at the issue for the wider community shows that there are very  clear difficulties. If Members cannot see those difficulties, it is they who  have a problem, not me.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As I said earlier, the  Irish-speaking community appears to  be growing in Northern Ireland,  where we do not have an Irish language Act, and declining in the Republic of Ireland, where there is legislation.  Therefore, there are people in the  Irish-language community who will not be particularly dissatisfied if Irish-language legislation is not introduced. An Irish language Act would not  necessarily help the language.</p>

		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. Is it not the convention in this House that,  while you are on your feet, everyone else should be in their places? I see that  some Members have not yet learned that rule.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I thank Lord Morrow for raising that point of order. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Order. I ask Members to take their places.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to two hours for  this debate. The proposer of the motion will have 10 minutes to propose and 10  minutes for the winding-up speech. All other Members who wish to speak will  have five minutes. Two amendments to the motion have been received and are  published on the Marshalled List. The proposer of each amendment will have 10  minutes to propose and five minutes for the winding-up speech.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
		    <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly expresses its concern at the dearth of training  and employment places for disabled children and young people; and calls on the  Minister for Employment and Learning to undertake an immediate review and  produce an action plan to address this issue as a matter of urgency.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Go raibh maith agat, I welcome the opportunity to bring  this issue before the Assembly and to put the focus on young people with  special educational needs, disabilities or learning difficulties. I also  welcome the Minister to the debate, and I welcome his personal commitment to  dealing with the issue.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Young people with special educational needs are a group about which it is difficult to get accurate  statistics. In 2005-06, there were  53,000 children and young people with special educational needs  attending school. That number has more than doubled in the past 10 years. All  indications are that that figure will continue to rise. The issue is  particularly important because disabilities affect so many young people, who  will face many hurdles in their lives and who need and deserve our support. I have a number of questions to ask the  Minister during the debate. I would be grateful if he could ask his  officials to respond in writing, if it is not possible for him to provide  answers in the time that has been allocated to the debate.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In 2006, the Minister&rsquo;s Department, in conjunction with a number of other Departments, published a  report on this issue. It recognised  that there are real difficulties in ensuring that children and young  people with statements of special  educational needs can realise their full  potential in school and achieve their goals, whether in training,  education or work. Too many disabled young people still find themselves, having  left school, without access to the kind of employment and training that can  allow them to have fulfilling lives. For some disabled young people, the lack  of appropriate training and places at day care centres means that they spend  the majority of their time at home with nothing to do. Some develop associated  mental-health problems.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Too many parents remain  concerned that their children will not be able to access further  education or training, or that the opportunities that are on offer will not  allow them to develop their independence.  On leaving school, many young people with learning difficulties or disabilities find that there is no clear path of  transition to employment ahead of  them. In fact, they often experience multiple  layers of discrimination and disadvantage. That means that they have  many barriers to overcome to achieve their potential and find suitable  employment &mdash; barriers that those without  disabilities or special needs would struggle to overcome.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Those young people find that there is a lack of full-time  vocational training and employment options that lead to meaningful paid  employment. In a recent Barnardo&rsquo;s survey of young disabled people, the  following barriers were identified: lack of choice in post-school options; lack  of accessible colleges; low expectations for young people with disabilities;  fewer opportunities to gain recognised qualifications; lack of co-ordination  among agencies that work with young people; lack of suitable equipment or  adaptations to meet their needs; and a view that there was a policy of cost  above need.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Many young people said that they felt that they were pushed  into courses in which they had no interest. Administration courses were often  cited as those that they were most likely to  be offered, even if such courses did  not suit their needs. Many young people then dropped out and some failed  to find an alternative option. Some young  people said that they were not permitted to select the college or course of their choice because the  building was inaccessible or the necessary support was not available.  Some who had a day care place rather than a training  or employment place said that they felt neglected and ignored, with  little sense of a hopeful future.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Research by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation shows that the  scope and level of aspirations among disabled 16-year-olds are similar to the  scope and level of aspirations among other 16-year-olds. However, by adulthood,  a sharp change is evident, with only half of disabled young people reporting  that they received the education, training place or job that they wanted.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The failure to provide access to the type of training,  education and employment places that young disabled people need is also linked  to poverty. At the age of 26, disabled people are more than four times as  likely to be unemployed or involuntarily out of work than non-disabled people.  They are likely to have lower levels of educational qualifications and are more  likely to have not fulfilled the employment aspirations that they had set for themselves 10 years previously.  However, the research clearly demonstrates that poverty of aspiration is  not the main barrier for disabled young people,  but the need for additional support, information and opportunities.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Many disabled young people have identified as a major problem the failure of training courses to  provide industry-recognised qualifications, which means that they will  have spent time on qualifications that have no currency in the real world. A  number of reports commissioned by the Department for Employment and Learning  have confirmed that that is a problem.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">A report on educational provision for students with learning difficulties and disabilities found that  improve&shy;ments have been made since 2001, but that a number of problem  areas still need to be addressed. Those areas include the need for colleges to  review learning-support structures; the need to ensure that provision exists  across curriculum areas; the need to provide broader access to accredited  courses; and the need to initiate a process of effective whole-college staff  development in special needs. Can the Minister advise the House how each of  those recommendations has been taken forward, and what progress has been made?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">That report further suggests that, although current further  education links are satisfactory in the majority of cases, provision would  benefit from a review of the value and outcomes of existing courses developed  for that pupil population. Can the Minister advise the House on how that matter  is being taken forward?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As well as further education colleges, a number of  voluntary organisations, such as Mencap, the Cedar Foundation and Barnardo&rsquo;s,  to name but a few, provide training and support for disabled young people. Such  organisations provide training, employment  and ongoing personal support.  However, most of them are dependent on short-term &mdash; usually European &mdash;  funding, and it is difficult to develop  services when funding is constantly at risk. Those types of services can  provide young people with the additional support and resources that make a real  difference.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I ask the Minister to undertake a full review of all provision available in training and employment,  further education and the voluntary  sector, to assess its effective&shy;ness and determine any other  requirements, and to put in place an appropriately funded action plan that will  provide young disabled people with the kind of quality choices and training support that will improve their lives.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Two amendments have been tabled, and I accept the Ulster  Unionist amendment, for which I thank David McClarty  and John McCallister. The SDLP amendment merely restates the Sinn F&eacute;in motion; it is an amendment for an  amendment&rsquo;s sake. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McClarty</strong>:  I beg to move amendment No 1: Leave out all after &ldquo;Assembly&rdquo; and insert</p>
		    <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;expresses its commitment to  securing training and employment opportunities where appropriate for young  people with disabilities; and calls on the Minister for Employment and Learning  to review the provision of such training.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It has been well said that the true test of the value of a  society is how much care it takes of its weakest and most vulnerable members.  All of us in the Assembly have a responsibility to see that that duty is  carried out. I congratulate the Chairperson of the Committee for Employment and  Learning for tabling the motion, and I thank her for accepting my party&rsquo;s  amendment. However, we are concerned that the motion has the potential to be  too narrow in its focus.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important to  remember that training and learning courses and further education  college places may not always be the most appropriate choices for children and  young people with disabilities. In dealing with the transition of young people  with disabilities beyond school, it is  necessary for other Departments and agencies to fulfil their responsibilities. Although I make that point, I  also acknowledge that there is a significant need for governing bodies of  further education institutions to provide sufficiently for the needs of  students with a learning disability, where  appropriate. That is important.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The results of the Northern Ireland survey of people  with activity limitations and disabilities, which was conducted throughout 2006  and 2007, showed that among children, 6% were noted as being affected by a  disability, there being a greater prevalence among boys in comparison with  girls. Eight per cent of boys aged 15 years and under had a disability,  compared with 4% of girls of the same age.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The latest Disability Rights Commission briefing, based on  the UK-wide labour force survey of April to June 2007, shows that half of  people with disabilities are in work, compared with four fifths of non-disabled  people. As 9% of those aged between 16 and 24 years of age have a disability,  such a figure can be seen to imply that a significant number of disabled young  people are out of work. The chances of getting a job are also significantly  reduced, as 25% of people with disabilities have achieved no qualifications,  compared with 10% of non-disabled people.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">A review of the  provision of employment and training places  by the Department for Employment and Learning would go a long way in  addressing those facts and statistics that are of such concern. Since the  motion refers to that Department, it is worthwhile pointing out some of the commendable measures that that  Department is undertaking on those  issues. In 2006-07, an additional &pound;4&middot;7  million has been made available in further education for the provision  of extra auxiliary aids and services and special staff training. Almost &pound;1  million has been allocated to special needs projects in further education in  2006-07. Furthermore, an inclusive learning project has been established throughout further education. Young people  can now access mainstream further education with additional support; special  provision is available if mainstream education is not suitable.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Personal development programmes such as Training for Success and Skills for Work are tailored for  trainees with disabilities. The Department for Employment and Learning  is in the process of establishing an expert group to ensure that the programmes  meet, specifically, the needs of disabled young people<strong></strong></p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Those programmes  take forward work, which 26 training organisations  have been involved in for the past few years, to ensure that the  provision meets the needs of disabled young people.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">11.45 am</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, the Disablement Advisory Service (DAS) has a  programme called Workable NI, which supports people with disabilities to work  in a wide variety of jobs. There is a clear liaison and referral service  between the Department&rsquo;s careers service and DAS. That is of great benefit to  children and young people with disabilities and their families, and I commend  the Department for that.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion calls on the  Minister to produce an action plan to address the dearth of training and  employment places for children and young people. I conclude by referring to an  important document that has been published  by the Department: &lsquo;Department for Employ&shy;ment and Learning: Disability  Action Plan: 1 April 2007 - 31 March 2008&rsquo;. The action plan outlines measures  to:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;&#9679; Promote positive attitudes towards disabled people;  and</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&#9679; Encourage participation by disabled people in public  life&rdquo;.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Much of that is related to the realm of employment  and learning. Therefore, it can be seen from the document that the Department is working hard to address the  issue.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I accept that we have much more work to do on the matter,  and I have every confidence that the Minister and his Department will deliver  for those children and young people with disabilities who depend on, and can greatly benefit from, training and employment  provision.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I beg to move amendment No 2: Leave out all after &lsquo;concern&rsquo; and insert</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&lsquo;at the inconsistency of transition support and  the limited choices available to disabled young people moving towards  training and employment; and at the lack of  mainstream training and employment opportunities that meet the  individual needs of all disabled young people leaving school; and calls on the  Minister for Employment and Learning to  develop a strategic plan, in consultation with disabled young people and  their parents, for the commissioning of services jointly with other relevant  Departments and for the delivery of effective support.&rsquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the debate, and I acknowledge the assistance  provided to us by the organisations in the disability sector. I ask Sue Ramsey  to reconsider the SDLP&rsquo;s amendment because the people who assisted me to draft  the amendment did not do so for the sake of it. I take what they said as the  best advice and I urge the House to do likewise. They would like to offer some  further direction to the Minister in those matters. Therefore, in addition to  developing a strategic plan, which is common to the motion and the amendments,  the plan should be developed in consultation with &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  The Member will appreciate that Sinn F&eacute;in proposed the motion because of its  concerns at the lack of training places for disabled children and young people.  This morning, I was faced with two amendments and, in my view, the SDLP&rsquo;s  amendment is no different from the motion. I take on board the arguments that  have been made by the Ulster Unionist Party. If the organisations that Mr  Attwood referred to had concerns about the Sinn F&eacute;in motion, he could have come  to me to work out an arrangement. Sinn F&eacute;in does not want to split the House on  the issue.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I concur with Sue Ramsey that the issue is not one of division or contention.  The House should not, and from our point of view will not, divide as the substance of the motion is not in dispute.  However, people with knowledge of the  disability sector, genuinely, and in good faith, looked to build on the  substance of the motion to say that there should be consultation with disabled  young people and their parents, and that services should be commissioned  jointly with other relevant Departments. The Government need joined-up thinking  and strategies when the disability sector in the North is being considered.  Therefore, although the SDLP will not split the House on the matter, I urge all  parties to consider that those directions to the Minister would be useful  additions to the motion.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am mindful that the  disability community is diverse. There are different views on how to  address the needs of children and young people with disabilities, particularly  on whether they should be integrated into the workplace or develop  opportunities in a separate environment. Each view has value and merit, but I  will not start a debate on that. Rather, based on the advice that the SDLP has received, I wish to map out the  issues of concern that my party believes exist in the disability sector.  I shall address, therefore, the transition from school for young people with disabilities. I will highlight five  areas of concern, to which the Minister, in due course, may respond, in writing  if necessary.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">First, in comparison to non-disabled young people, disabled  young people face limited choices when making the transition from school. Based  on SDLP Members&rsquo; experiences in their constituencies, that is self-evident.  Therefore, it is necessary to test the accessibility and relevance to young  people with disabilities of the opportunities that are available in vocational  training, further education and higher education. As has been outlined, the  Department has developed some good and  sensible initiatives. However, those opportunities must be tested to  determine their appropriateness for young people with disabilities.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, although the transition-planning process is set  out in a code of practice, accessible information is needed on that process and  on the choices available to young people. The delivery of a transition-planning  process remains, in part, inconsistent.  Such inconsistency is perpetuated by the lack of monitoring of the  process across Northern    Ireland. Ambiguity remains on the role of  transition officers in the education and library boards. Therefore, the  availability of information is critical in allowing disabled young people input  into the process and in making them fully aware of the opportunities that are  available to them.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Thirdly, the SDLP has been advised that there is no  strategic plan on how to fund the specialist transition-support services for young people with disabilities, who require significant preparation and support in  moving to adult life. Currently,  support services are tied by funding to particular geographic regions or  impairment-specific groups. Transition  support should be universally available to all young people with disabilities, including those with  complex and multiple disabilities.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The fourth area of  concern relates to the report of the transitions interdepartmental  working group, which was published in 2006. That was a welcome initiative but,  in the view of some in the disability sector, it has not resulted in  significant progress. They maintain that there appears to be little active  cross-departmental collaboration or joint working. It is hoped that the ongoing  review of special educational needs and inclusion may provide a vehicle for  progress when its proposals are announced in 2008. However, at the moment,  responsibility remains with the Department of Education, the Department for  Employment and Learning, and the Department of Health, Social Services and  Public Safety. They should review their roles in the transition process to  ensure that disabled school leavers receive an effective service.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, the Department  for Employment and Learning has an ongoing responsibility to deliver a  range of provision, including vocational  training and employment programmes that support the economic  independence of people with disabilities. The principal programmes, as has been  mentioned, are Workable (NI) and Training for Success, which are in the early  stages of delivery. Their success in meeting the needs of people with  significant disabilities will be tested in the coming year. I suggest to the  Minister and to the Committee for Employment and Learning that they monitor the  new programmes as they evolve and develop over the next 12 months.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I will try to address other matters, particularly  vocational training, during the course of the debate. However, for now, the  SDLP will not divide the House on this  matter. That would be an inappropriate mechanism to employ on a matter  that will attract cross-party support. I suggest that, in the course of the  remaining one and a half hours of the  debate, each party considers that the motion could be enhanced by  offering the Minister some direction on whom to consult, in and outside  Government.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In that way, enhanced support for disabled children and  young people could be better achieved.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Spratt</strong>: I  welcome the Minister&rsquo;s commitment on this important issue. I also thank the  Chairperson of the Committee for Employment and Learning for proposing the motion. It is the responsibility of  Members to ensure that we provide an education, training and employment  framework within which everyone can achieve  more independence and fulfilment in their lives.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Many disabled people in Northern Ireland believe that they do not have the same opportunities as  able-bodied people. The Department for Employment and Learning must make the provision of such  opportunities a priority in order to meet the needs of everyone in our  society. The Department has set out the criteria that govern special  educational provision in the further education sector in the Further Education  (Northern Ireland)  Order 1997. We are told that further education institutions must have regard to  the needs of students with learning disabilities who are over compulsory school  age. Furthermore, the Department states that provision for students with learning difficulties is a key element of the  Government&rsquo;s drive to increase participation  and widen access. On paper, the Department has the right mindset, but it  is necessary to call for an immediate review to ensure that there is delivery  on those words and that the necessary provision is in place for the community.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">If we are to move forward with improved access, it is  necessary that those colleges that are examples of best practice be used as  models for others in the sector. There must be an increase in the provision of  courses, with appropriate and nationally  recognised accreditation. There is no doubt that the training is of the  highest quality, and the commitment of staff in the further education sector is  unquestionable. That is reflected in the general positive participation of students who have disabilities.  However, we will push forward with staff training to ensure that there is an even higher standard of delivery in  the future.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The provision of places is below the level required, and it is, therefore, important that an immediate  review, such as this motion calls for, should be undertaken. The  necessity and priority is to increase the employability, confidence and  independence of those who have learning difficulties and disabilities. That can  only benefit everyone involved.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Members on this side of  the House support the motion and amendment No 1, as proposed by Mr  McClarty. We look forward to the Minister&rsquo;s  undertaking a review and producing an action plan to tackle these  problems at the earliest opportunity. I hope that there will be no Division on  the amendments. I hope that all Members will unite and send out a message to  those folks who are less fortunate than  ourselves that we intend to better their position in future Committee  deliberations. I know that the Minister will do everything in his power to  address the issue, and we look forward to that. I support the motion and  amendment No 1.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  No one disagrees with the idea that there should be more opportunities for  training for disabled children and young people.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">This is not only a matter of equality &mdash; which is a vital  issue &mdash; but of economic necessity. Despite the Northern Ireland economy facing  a shortage of skilled workers, too many people of working age are either on the unemployment register or are economically  inactive. Disability Action Northern Ireland states that there are some  300,000 people with disabilities in Northern Ireland. Many economically  inactive people want to work, but they need support to close the skills gap  between what they can offer and the needs of business. The challenge in  narrowing that gap is magnified for people with disabilities.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">12.00 noon</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Although I broadly support the motion, I am not sure that I  can support all its provisions. For example, there  is a risk that a review might last ages, cost millions of pounds and  produce more recommendations that may &mdash; or may not &mdash; be implemented in the long  term. For similar reasons, if an action plan is produced, it must be done  within a tight timescale and remit. Although  a short, focused project that leads to an action plan might have some benefits, this is not an area where there is any  great mystery about what needs to be done. Action is needed rather than  more glossy documents.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Moreover, this is not an issue that the Minister for  Employment and Learning can tackle on his own. The Minister of Education has a  key role, because of the importance of schools in providing training  opportunities for children with disabilities and other young people. I hope  that Sinn F&eacute;in is not phrasing the motion in order to provide political cover  for one of its Ministers, who must play a vital part in advancing this agenda.  The Department of Enterprise,  Trade and Investment also has a key role to play in ensuring that training  links not only with aptitudes and interests of young people but &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  I was going to let the Member&rsquo;s comment about Sinn F&eacute;in pass, but the more I  thought about it, the more I needed to respond. If the Member reads the motion,  he will understand that it is the Minister for Employment and Learning who must  take the lead on this issue. There are other Ministers who have responsibility,  such as the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety and, as the  Member stated, the Minister of Education. However, it is the Minister for  Employment and Learning who provides training places for young people with  disabilities. The Member must not focus on the Minister of Education.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  I thank the Member for bringing that to my attention. She acknowledges that I  am saying that more than one Department has a vital interest in advancing the  issue. The Department of Enterprise,  Trade and Investment also has a key role to play in ensuring that training  links with the needs of business as well as the aptitudes and interests of  young people. It is wrong to raise the hopes of young people with disabilities  &mdash; or anyone&rsquo;s hopes &mdash; by training them for jobs that do not exist. Instead of a  lengthy review, there should be a highly focused strategy led by the Minister  for Employment and Learning that also involves the relevant Ministers and their  Departments.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Although the Alliance Party agrees with the substance of  the motion &mdash; and I thank my colleagues from Sinn F&eacute;in for tabling it &mdash; it feels  that a different approach is more likely to deliver improvements for children  and young people with disabilities. We all want to see improvements. I support  the motion and both amendments.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Newton</strong>:  It is appropriate that the motion is debated. My colleague Jimmy Spratt has  indicated how DUP Members will vote &mdash; if that becomes necessary. People who  suffer from disabilities in Northern Ireland need socially inclusive and sustainable  alternatives to traditional, separate day services. Such people should be given  full access to a wide range of community-based educational, vocational and  social opportunities. That is not to detract from the valuable work that is  being done, which I will mention.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Those who suffer from disabilities should not be  disenfranchised and segregated. I support initiatives that promote  person-centred planning methods; approaches that facilitate access to  mainstream further education; and vocational opportunities that provide young  people with real qualifications that have equal status to those acquired by  their more able-bodied fellow students. It is the responsibility of the  Minister for Employment and Learning to smooth progress and facilitate access  to increased college-based learning support, and, therefore, the delivery of  education and training for disabled children and young people.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I commend two organisations in the Province: the Cedar  Foundation, and Ulster Supported Employment Ltd (USEL). The Cedar Foundation is  an award-winning organisation that works in partnership with community-based  organisations, local institutes of further and higher education, training  organisations, a range of statutory and voluntary organisations and, importantly, the private sector, to deliver the  community inclusion programme. I urge the Minister to look carefully at  the programmes that are in place due to the work of the Cedar Foundation &mdash;  however limited they might be &mdash; and to increase the awareness of the needs of  disabled people in the wider community and in further education.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee for Employment and Learning was concerned about training and employment  opportunities for disabled young  people, and it invited representatives from USEL to give evidence at one  of its meetings. I believe that Jimmy Spratt was in the Chair for that meeting,  but I might be wrong. USEL has grown from what were originally workshops for  the blind, and it has a long tradition in Belfast  and throughout the Province. The organisation was invited to provide evidence  on the work that it carries out. It has an excellent ethos and can-do attitude,  and it provides manufacturing training and development opportunities to those  with disabilities. The skills training provided by USEL offers those who gain  expertise and knowledge to move outside of that organisation and into full-time  private-sector employment. That gives the people dignity and responsibility,  and enables them to prove their full worth in a competitive business  environment, making them fully independent and appreciated members of society.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">USEL is a charity, so although it provides manufacturing  training, it is restricted in that it cannot apply for support from Invest  Northern Ireland for its manufacturing training and development places, and it  is, therefore, restricted in what it can offer. That obstacle was mentioned by  USEL representatives in their evidence to the Committee.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The core focus of USEL is to assist its employees, and that  is the ethos that Members have talked about. Examples that have been quoted by  Members require us to think positively  about how to address these issues. There  will be different opinions on how that can be done, or how to provide  the best service and opportunities, but  Members&rsquo; thinking must always be towards ensuring that the potential of  the individual is maximised.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: The  motion highlights an important issue: equal opportunities for those who have a  disability. It is important to state that improvements have been made and that  it is not all bad news, but that does not mean that further improvements are  not necessary.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that disabled people have the opportunity  to further themselves and achieve greater independence  and fulfilment in life. Good education and training opportunities are  important for all children and young  people, particularly those who are disadvantaged by a disability. A  sound educational start provides the best building block in life, and an  incomplete or substandard education or training means that young people will  have fewer qualifications and fewer job opportunities. Statistics show that  disabled people are twice as likely as non-disabled people to have no  qualifications, and there are fewer disabled people of working age in  employment than able-bodied people.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We must also improve the retention in training of those  disabled young people, and overall, there should be better skills training  through the various Pathways to Work programmes, for example. Not all courses  are available to people with a disability or learning difficulty although,  through the learning support funds, students with a learning difficulty can  participate in a number of mainstream courses. A sound learning support service  should be attached to all those courses for students who require it, and staff  need to be given specific training on special-education issues. Many teachers,  lecturers and other staff have little or no training in special needs, which  makes things difficult for them.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Efforts must be made to root out employment discrimination  and reduce disability disadvantage in employment by ensuring that young  disabled people are given the same opportunities as their able-bodied  counterparts. As my party colleague Robin Newton said, the Committee for  Employment and Learning recently had the privilege of meeting with USEL. That  company has been around for over 40 years and is the largest employer of  disabled people in Northern    Ireland. It employs a disabled workforce  that earns a proper wage and produces commercially competitive produce. As well  as running its own factory, USEL supports more than 1,000 people with  disabilities and mental-health conditions in hundreds of mainstream jobs  throughout Northern Ireland.  It is through that kind of practical support that disabled people can improve  their employment prospects and live more fulfilling lives.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department&rsquo;s role must be to enable disabled people to  get into employment, but more of them need to be in high-profile jobs. It is  also important that when disabled people get jobs, they stay in them. Just as teachers and lecturers need more training in  special needs, the same applies to employers. A key message from the  Committee meeting with USEL was that employers need training and advice on how  to deal with disabled employees and the different challenges and situations  that may arise.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Today&rsquo;s motion is important because it highlights the  issue, and I give my support to the amendment tabled by the Ulster Unionist  Party in the hope that the whole House can unite behind it.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  Members will agree that there are concerns for families from the day and hour  that their young people are diagnosed with a disability and that frustrations  are abundant throughout the education of those children. The decision to fight  for the education of a son or daughter in a suitable establishment is not an  easy one to take. Nonetheless, there is often a sense of relief for many  parents when their children are finally accepted into the system even though,  due to underfunding and ever-increasing demand, it is constantly in financial  dire straits.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">For many years prior to my participation in politics, I  worked with young people and adults with learning difficulties and various  disabilities. I worked as a carer in a purpose-built hospital, which was one of  the first of its kind in the Western Health and Social Services Board area. I  witnessed, at first-hand, the desperation and determination of individuals to  lead a normal life in a society that was very difficult and not accepting. Help  was needed then to promote acceptance; and, unfortunately, in today&rsquo;s  financially restrictive health and education services it is even more important  to provide a vehicle for the personal development of each disabled person.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">At the weekend, I had a  phone call from a very proud mother telling me how her daughter had won  two gold medals and two bronze medals at the Special Olympics in Shanghai. That parent&rsquo;s  pride was palpable, and I have no doubt that that was one of the proudest  moments of her life.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Unfortunately, if the general rule of natural law is played  out, parents will predecease their children, which is the next worry for a  parent after having secured education for the child or young person. The  question: &ldquo;How will they cope after I am gone?&rdquo; has been asked by many of the  parents I have spoken to and worked with over the years.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In order to ease that burden, young people must become as  independent as possible, particularly those without siblings &mdash; they should be  able to cope with day-to-day tasks without  the active supervision of a carer.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In today&rsquo;s society, it is even more important that the  threefold spectrum of requirements and expectations is acknowledged by all  Departments, and each should participate in achieving the aims and objectives  of each interested party. So, who are the interested parties?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">According to research carried out in my area by one of the  north-west&rsquo;s most proficient special-needs establishments, the interested  parties are the parents, the service providers and, most importantly, the young  people themselves. There can be no more powerful vehicle for achieving  fulfilment than that which lies &mdash; sometimes dormant until provoked &mdash; within all  disabled young people.</p>

		    <p class="B3BodyText">Those young people have  told us, in a paper presented to the Special Olympics international symposium  on disability, that they want to be allowed  to stand on their own two feet, but they want support to try different  things until they get the right job or the home that is best for them. We can  see that happening in many of our bigger  retail establishments, where it is obvious that there are members of  staff with disabilities. However, those disabilities are lost in their sense of  achievement and acceptance by their fellow workers as contributing individuals.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Where do we go, and what must be done, to help young  special-needs individuals to achieve and exist as independent members of  society? They say that they want partnerships between agencies, and that  parents should work together to assist them in achieving their goals. They also want the creation of more  opportunities to allow them to enter the workforce at an acceptable  level, if that is applicable and beneficial for them. There is a need for  greater encouragement and funding of transitional projects and an increase in  the support networks that already exist.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">All Departments should  acknowledge that the right to say yes or no is a fundamental right of  any individual. The right to control their future and to become a full  participating party in any transitional planning process is a big issue for any  young disabled individual. They also need support and assistance, not to be  controlled and cared for in departmental terms.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I could list many more requirements that those young people  have. However, they cannot get the help that they need without the assistance  of their families, teachers, classroom assistants and interdepartmental  workers, who strive to provide for them, even when funding is consistently cut  and school places limited.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that the motion has prompted a great deal of thought  among us all. I hope that, when we leave here, this will not be just another  debate, but that we will see some action, and not just promises from the teeth  out.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I support the motion and  both amendments. I welcome the Minister for Employment and Learning to  the Chamber, and I hope that the other Ministers who hold the budgets for our children will be generous in  looking after them.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I thank the Members who tabled the motion and the amendments. I hope that  Members can unite behind the thrust of the proposal. I will be supporting the  amendment from the Ulster Unionist Party.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In 2003, DEL  (Department for Employment and Learning) produced statistics that showed that  over 20% of working-age people in the Province had a disability, whether  physical or learning. Ten and a half per cent of the 18 to 30 age group have  disabilities, and yet they come nowhere near that number in higher and further  education. That is a startling statistic. There are those with moderate  learning difficulties who can seek employment and fulfilment in skills that are  more practically focused, rather than literary subjects. That is one field that  DEL must  begin to put time, effort and money into developing.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">A major skills pool is lacking, and apprenticeship  applications are down, meaning that there are fewer young people to fill that  gap than there were a few years ago. The situation is getting worse. A young  man in my constituency consistently misbehaved in class and was thrown out of more lessons than he sat through. After  much pressure from his parents, it was found that this was happening because  the boy had a learning disability. That frustrated the boy, and his frustration  was acted out through bad behaviour, resulting in him being placed in many schools  &mdash; and he was moved from a brave few. His parents pushed and persisted, and  their son was taken out of mainstream education and enrolled on a vocational  course. He began his training as a joiner, and in his first year he was named  joiner of the year in his class. That is a success story, and there are many  similar success stories that could be repeated many times if DEL would give  young men and women who do not excel with words and numbers the chance to excel  with their hands.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Vocational skills are just as important to any nation as learning skills, and the lack of young people  applying for those apprenticeships  to foster skills is very worrying. After being approached by parents who  felt that their children would do better in vocational education than academically,  I asked the Minister about the number of apprenticeships  in the manufacturing industry available in Northern Ireland for the past three years. The answer may not  have been what I was looking for.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Statistics for Ards Borough Council or for the Strangford  constituency were not available. However, the answer showed that the number of  apprenticeships fell from 1,027 in 2004-05 to 988 in 2006-07. Given the need  for skills in the Province and the amazing difference that a successful  apprenticeship or a new skill can make to the life of a young person who may  have consistently failed in the three Rs, I do not understand why those figures  fell.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Recently, I met David Hatton of the Engineering Training  Council who told me that, 10 years ago, there were 1,000 applicants a year for  apprenticeships. That figure has dropped dramatically to between 250 and 300 a  year. I have digressed slightly, but that is a worrying drop in the number of  young people applying for apprenticeships, and an aggressive approach must be  adopted before a point of no return is reached. I could say much more on the  subject of apprenticeships, but I will leave that for another day.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to draw Members&rsquo; attention to the success that has  been achieved in my constituency by those with learning difficulties and  disabilities. There are many charity shops in Ards town that not only donate  their profits for the help and betterment of others, but play an active role in  encouraging people with mental disabilities to take jobs, such as looking after  a book section or sweeping the floor. Those jobs may not be big, but they are  jobs and, importantly, they give those people a start. Jobs enable those  employees to gain confidence around other people. Often, confidence is what  they lack. Employment offers those people a chance, and the employer gains a  willing helper. DEL should be working to enable more young people to undertake  those types of activities &mdash; that is its remit, and it is not doing enough to  accomplish it.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister and many Members are aware of the example of  Daisies Caf&eacute; at Ards Hospital, in which disabled young people have been given  the jobs of baking, and serving tea and coffee. That is a caf&eacute; that,  regrettably, my waistline knows well. My colleague Iris Robinson takes a  special interest and visits that caf&eacute; regularly. Obviously, she does not eat  the food that I do.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  It does not show.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  It just shows on me. That caf&eacute; has had success after success in training young  people and enabling them to go on to further jobs.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">My colleagues will present statistics that outline how the  Department has not been keeping up to date. However, I urge the Department to  recognise that current standards are insufficient and to step up its efforts &mdash;  sort out an apprenticeship scheme, become more involved in organising placement  schemes and assist young people with activities to better themselves and the  community in which they live. Members have seen the results of such efforts &mdash;  it can be done, and, therefore, I urge the Department to act now. I support the  thrust of the motion and the UUP amendment.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Members will be aware that the Business Committee has arranged to meet as soon  as the Assembly suspends for lunch. I propose, therefore, by leave of the  Assembly, to suspend the sitting until 2.00 pm, and to return to the debate  after lunch.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The sitting was suspended 12.23 pm.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">On resuming (Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Dallat] in the  Chair) &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">2.00 pm</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>: The subject of the motion overlaps with some of the  responsibilities of the Department of Health, Social Services and Public  Safety, and that is what I want to highlight. Objective 3 of the report &lsquo;Equal  Lives: Review of Policy and Services for People with a Learning Disability in  Northern Ireland&rsquo;, which is part of the Bamford Review, is:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;To ensure that the move into adulthood for young  people with a learning disability supports their access to equal opportunities  for continuing education, employment and  training and that they and their families receive continuity of support  during the transition period.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Sections 5.7 and 5.9 of the report detail the need  for better provision in further education and employment for those who have  learning disabilities.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">My colleague Alderman Jim Shannon has already mentioned a  success story in my constituency that is worth highlighting as having a  particularly thriving outcome. Daisies Caf&eacute;, which is situated on the Ards  Hospital site, provides an alternative form of day care for people with learning disabilities and mental illnesses  through training and employment opportunities in a commercial environment.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The staff of Daisies Caf&eacute; take pride in providing its many  regular customers with freshly cooked food using only the finest and freshest  ingredients. That description may sound like an advertisement, but I hope that  Members will bear with me. A different menu, developed to meet the needs and  preferences of customers, is available daily. A wide range of food is available  to corporate customers for business meetings and events, as well as for  meetings of clubs and other organisations. Daisies Caf&eacute; has extended its  programme of work to include outside catering for parties and occasions.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Behind the enterprise was a vision of providing alternative  day care, training and employment to help those  who otherwise may not have had the opportunities to gain the skills,  self-belief and confidence that they need to take their place in the community  as equals.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In 1999, the statutory and voluntary sectors worked  together under a peace-initiative project to identify an alternative to day  care in Northern Ireland. The aim was to provide opportunities for day care as  well as training and employment in the community for people with a learning  disability or mental illness. Social firms already in operation in Europe  provided several useful examples. A social firm is an ordinary business that provides goods and services under normal  business terms and conditions. The fundamental difference is that a  proportion of its trainees require a carefully planned, supportive working  environment because of mental ill health or other disabilities.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Extensive research that included visits to Finland, Holland  and Germany was undertaken to develop a model  that was suitable for Northern Ireland. Discussions were held with  service providers, staff and trainees on trading, recruitment, and training as  well on as the roles of directors and staff. A proposal was drawn up and shared  with the local health and social services trusts as a new concept in day care  for adults who require support to access the labour market.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The development of the proposal coincided with a greater public awareness of equality issues and a  growing demand for acceptance and social inclusion of people with  learning disabilities or mental illnesses. A suitable location was found on the  Ards Hospital site, and extensive renovations were carried out to satisfy the  rigorous building and environmental health regulations that must be met by all  catering facilities.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Action Mental Health and the Ulster Community and Hospitals  Trust led the partnership that developed Daisies Caf&eacute;. Other organisations have  provided ongoing and critical support to ensure its continuing success. In particular,  the Ards and North Down peace partnership boards have enabled Daisies to become  a successful social firm that contributes to the local economy and provides day  care, training and employment for residents of both boroughs.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Daisies Caf&eacute; has won awards for its service and business  achievements, and it was showcased at the Tate Modern in London as part of The  National Lottery&rsquo;s tenth birthday celebrations. Over the seven years that  Daisies Caf&eacute; has been in existence, the number of permanent staff has risen  from two to five and the average number of trainees to 15.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Its success shows what can be achieved when the needs of  those with learning disabilities are taken seriously and they are assisted to  live fuller lives.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I expect Daisies Caf&eacute; to have an influx of new customers after  that, and, indeed, I hope that it does.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning (Sir Reg Empey)</strong>: I thank the Members who have taken  the trouble to take part in this debate and to make their points. The tone of the  debate has, so far, been very constructive, and as Mrs Robinson mentioned,  there are cross-cutting issues. This is not a stand-alone issue for one  Department; a number of Departments are involved, and it is important,  therefore, that, as far as possible, a joined-up approach is adopted. I wish to  set out some points, and then deal with the issues that have been raised by  Members.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">My Department is committed to the provision of appropriate  training and employment opportunities for disabled young people and adults. The  aim of the Department for Employment and  Learning is to promote learning and skills, to prepare people for work,  and to support the economy. Its remit includes the provision of training to  prepare young people and adults for employment and to help people, including  young disabled people, to overcome barriers to work.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department is also responsible for the provision of  impartial careers information, advice and guidance for young people and adults, with a particular emphasis on 14-  to 19-year-olds and those vulnerable to social exclusion.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department makes, through its Disablement Advisory  Service (DAS), a substantial list of provisions. It currently funds a range of  training and employment provision. Those include the job introduction scheme;  New Deal for disabled people; Access to Work &mdash; that is, Workable (NI); Ulster  Supported Employment Ltd; residential training at Parkanaur College; the  condition management programme; and the work preparation programme under  Pathways to Work.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The careers service also works with young people in  schools. In particular, the career advisers attend transition-plan meetings for  year-10 pupils with special educational needs and provide subsequent annual  reviews. They work with a range of professionals and contribute to the transition plan by providing impartial  information, advice and guidance on  the range of educational, training and employment opportunities that are  available.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Training for Success, a professional and technical training  provision for Northern Ireland, commenced on 3 September 2007. The focus of  that new provision is firmly on the individual young person and his or her  needs and aspirations. Training will be flexible in duration to meet the needs  and abilities of the young people.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department is  committed to endorsing flexibility in respect of the training time  permitted to enable young people with disabilities or additional needs to  realise their full potential and to achieve targeted qualifications.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The new provision includes a job-ready strand, which is  designed to enable participants to progress to higher-level training, further  education or employment, by providing training to address personal and  social-development needs, where necessary, including essential skills training.  Additional specialist support services are available to any participant with an  auditory, visual or other physical disability.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I have decided, because of my commitment to those young people, that a group with expertise in  dealing with young people with disabilities and additional support needs  will be established. That group will keep the Training for Success provision  under review, and highlight any areas to be addressed &mdash; I know that a number of  Members called for that. I have some other measures  to announce during the course of my remarks.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department is also committed to improving access to  further and higher education by students with learning difficulties and/or  disabilities. It provides funding for further education colleges to support the  enrolment of students with learning difficulties and/or disabilities on  mainstream courses. Funding for such students is incorporated in the further  education funding stream mechanism. That ensures that colleges are able to meet  the cost of students with disabilities who may require an extra level of  support.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As part of the Further  Education Means Business review of funding, the Department, following  consultation with the further education sector,  agreed to ring-fence funds to ensure the sustained provision of  education to students with learning disabilities  who require a discrete learning environment. The funding of &pound;1&middot;5 million  in the current academic year is an increase on the previous year&rsquo;s &pound;1&middot;2  million. That increase is to allow the  colleges to address specific issues  that were raised during the consultation, such as the need for additional classroom support in discrete  classes.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">An additional support fund has been increased from &pound;1&middot;1  million to &pound;1&middot;5 million in the current academic year, and that is available to  provide further technical and/or human support, such as braillers, specialist  software and signers.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Further education colleges collaborate with adult day  centres to provide discrete training and  development opportunities for young  people aged 19 and over who have left special schools and who might benefit from further educational provision.  However, further education colleges cannot provide the close supervision,  nursing or other personal care that some young people with disabilities require.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In 2005-06, the number of students aged between 19 and 25 with learning difficulties and/or  disabilities who were enrolled in further education increased by 751, compared to the 2001-02 academic year. There are  now 1,549 such students and, of those, 693 &mdash; 45% &mdash; are taking discrete  courses, and 125 &mdash; 8% &mdash; are on  courses that are delivered in such places as day centres. The remainder  are in mainstream further education classes.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department, in  co-operation with the Association of Northern Ireland Colleges (ANIC),  is currently undertaking a review of the nature and extent of special-needs  provision throughout the further education network to determine how provision  might best be improved in the context of the further education remit. That  matter was raised by some Members during the course of the debate. That review,  with the co-operation of ANIC, will enable us to continuously assess how things  are going, because the cohort with which we  are dealing will have different needs as we progress. The same provision  will not be required at all stages &mdash; those needs will change, depending on the  students who are coming forward.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As for higher education, the Department makes funding  available for the disabled students&rsquo; allowance, which is administered by the  education and library boards. The disabled student&rsquo;s allowance helps to pay for  extra costs that students may incur while studying, as a direct result of their  disability, mental-health condition or specific learning difficulty. Those  allowances can help with the cost of a non-medical personal helper, items of  specialist equipment, travel and other course-related costs.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Through the disabled student&rsquo;s allowance, the Department  funds the register of support providers, which is a register of professional and non-professional support workers who are  recruited and trained to assist students with disabilities. The  register, which is administered by the University of Ulster, is available to  all disabled students in the universities, university colleges and further  education colleges with higher education provision.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department also funds the Let&rsquo;s Work project at Queen&rsquo;s  University, Belfast, which is aimed at students and graduates with a  disability. A specialist careers adviser offers individual careers guidance and  inform&shy;ation sessions, supports access to work placements and part-time work,  and provides workshops on job skills and options after graduation.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Moreover, the Department pays the universities a widening-access premium for students with  disabilities. That is based on the number of full-time undergraduate  students in receipt of the disabled students&rsquo; allowance.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Capital funding must be mentioned. Since April 2000, the  Department has allocated over &pound;14&middot;5 million to colleges to improve access for  young people with disabilities. In 2006-07, that amounted to &pound;943,000 and, in  the current year, &pound;1 million has been set aside with that specific aim. In  addition, over the past three years, the  Department has made available an extra &pound;12&middot;1 million for further education colleges, and some  of that funding is being used to provide additional auxiliary aids and  services, as well as extra staff training.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">2.15 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Special support services are available to young people who have an auditory, visual, or other,  disability. Financial support of up to &pound;1,000 is available to suppliers,  enabling them to buy specialist support. The Department refunds the cost of  taxis to and from a supplier&rsquo;s premises in those situations where it has been  decided that public transport is unsuitable for a young person who has a  disability or additional needs.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Twelve projects receive a total of &pound;8&middot;9 million of European  social fund assistance. That funding will last for two years and will end in  March 2008. It was awarded through open  competition to projects that have limited funds. Three of those projects  &mdash; Barnardo&rsquo;s, Disability Action Northern  Ireland and Triangle Housing Association Ltd &mdash; are aimed specifically at  young people who have significant learning disabilities. Assistance to those  projects totals &pound;830,000.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I will deal, in no particular order, with specific matters  that Members raised. Although he is not in the Chamber, Jim Shannon mentioned  apprenticeships. The Department does not limit the number of apprenticeships  that are on offer: numbers depend on employers&rsquo; uptake of training for their  own employees. The uptake for Training for Success is about 90% of that for  Jobskills at the same time last year. We expect that uptake to pick up in the  next three months, and we are initiating  additional marketing campaigns to promote professional and tactical  training and apprenticeships.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Newton, who, I also regret to say, is not in the  Chamber, mentioned Ulster Supported Employment Ltd (USCL) and The Cedar  Foundation. I intend to meet representatives of the foundation in the next week  or two, and I visited USEL&rsquo;s workshops in Belfast a couple of weeks ago. I was  immensely impressed, and even moved, by the work that goes on there. Excellent  products were being made. People had worked there for a long time, it was the  centre of their lives, and they were doing an excellent job. I do not know  whether the Committee has visited USEL&rsquo;s shops yet, but I urge it &mdash; and other  Committees &mdash; to do so. Members would be very impressed were they to see USEL&rsquo;s  work in action. Indeed, that organisation has some excellent plans.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Given that USEL is a non-departmental public body, my  Department is its core funder. That is the reason that it has no access to  Invest NI funding. However, perhaps the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment  and I can discuss that.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Several Members referred to the transition into employment  from school. The Department had 14 actions on which it was supposed to follow  up. I received a report on those on 3 September, and, after reading it, it  seemed that two of those actions had not been provided for fully. Action has,  therefore, been taken to ensure that we meet all our targets and that we follow  up on all the actions on which we are required to move. I am optimistic that  within a short time we will be in a position to describe fully how we will  implement that report.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">When moving his amendment, David McClarty spoke about how  we treat people in our society. The relative  unanimity of the debate indicates that Members believe that a society is  marked out by how it treats those who are  less fortunate and those who are disabled. Listening to Mary Bradley&rsquo;s  contribution, it is clear that she has had hands-on experience of the matters  that are being debated. One could not help but feel the strength of passion in  what she was saying.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In moving the motion, the Chairperson of the Committee for  Employment and Learning referred to several  matters, including European funding and the review of training in the  voluntary and further education sectors. That review will take place, and I  have authorised it already.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Alex Attwood referred to the appropriateness of some of the  provision and to what he regarded as inconsistencies in it. Those comments are  of concern to me, because my Department prides itself on ensuring that, no  matter where people live in Northern Ireland, they have as much access as  possible to services. We could all have been in different places or been born  into the world with disabilities, so where one lives should not be a barrier.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As I have said, we are looking at the transport issue. I  take on board what the Member says. I shall look at it and decide whether the  Department is satisfied that there is consistency. There is certainly supposed  to be, because, when we provide funding to colleges and other bodies, we expect  that to be the case.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Jimmy Spratt talked about the provision of opportunities  being a priority, and that is the rationale behind what we are trying to do.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McCarthy said that a review could take ages and cost  millions, but I can assure him that neither will be the case. Reviews are  ongoing. There will always be reviews, because, as I have said, the cohort that  is coming through at any point in time changes. What we fix today in order to  achieve a balance will not necessarily survive a change in the make-up of the  cohort that requires help. I will inform the House of the outcome of the  reviews, and the Committee for Employment and Learning may wish to include the  matter in its work programme in due course.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Robin Newton mentioned access to mainstream further  education for disabled children and young people. In so far as we can encourage  that, we shall. However, we must take account of the fact that, sadly, some of  the folk who are coming forward require such extensive help that qualified  medical help must be made available. That is why we take places in Parkanaur  College; there are 15 residential places there, which ensures that people have  their physical needs properly catered for.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is not always possible to incorporate disabled students  into mainstream further education, but one would wish to do so if it were possible. I think that the word  &ldquo;segregation&rdquo; was used during the debate, and that is a word that we  want to try to avoid. However, there are cases in which specific, qualified  people are required to look after those young people.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I shall give Members one final piece of information in  which they will be interested. In providing training and employment support,  the Department is making every effort to give young people the best chance. I  am pleased, therefore, to report that the Department is currently offering extensive support in this area. I dispute the  suggestion that there is a &ldquo;dearth&rdquo; of provision, because, as far as the  Jobskills programme and other initiatives  are concerned, there is no limit on the number of places.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, I agree that it is vital to ensure that provision  meets the needs of particular client groups. For that reason, an expert group  has been set up to keep the Training for Success initiative under review.  Moreover, the Department has already begun work on commissioning a scoping  study to ascertain the full extent of the Department&rsquo;s current provision for  disabled young people and adults. When that study is completed, any gaps in  provision of training and employment opportunities for disabled young people  and adults will be identified. Consideration will then be given to how those  gaps can be plugged.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I will endeavour to keep the Assembly involved, and I hope  that the announcements that I have made about reviewing provision will satisfy  Members that my Department is taking the matter seriously.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I thank the Members who contributed to the  debate. There were 10 contributions, and I cannot do justice to the range and quality of those  contributions in five minutes. I particularly welcome the Minister&rsquo;s  announcement on three issues: the scoping study; the review involving ANIC; and  the expert group that will consider, among other things, how the Training For  Success programme is working for those who are the subject of the debate.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I say to the Minister, and this point was touched on by Alastair Ross, that there are a number of  requirements needed to ensure that the Training For Success programme for young people with disabilities  measures up. Those requirements include the need for in-service  training; achievable goals; communication support; extended training time; and  the need to ensure that training providers are providing quality of opportunity  and access. We trust that the expert group, which will monitor how those issues  develop, will consider some of those requirements.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">A number of broad  themes emerged during the debate. Jimmy  Spratt, Robin Newton and Iris Robinson invoked best practice in the  further education and commercial sectors; for example, in a place such as  Daisies Caf&eacute;. USEL, more than others,  certainly to the knowledge of the Committee for Employment and Learning,  has achieved a lot in rolling out best  practice. The Minister said that he visited USEL last week, and I  understand that the Committee also intends to make a visit. USEL&rsquo;s presentation  to the Committee, concerning its contribution in rolling out best practice to  the further education and broader sector, was compelling and uplifting. I trust  that that aspect can be worked on and developed over time.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mary Bradley and Jim Shannon relied on providing examples  of young people with disabilities having excelled and achieved great things. I  trust that in one way or another the Assembly, or OFMDFM, will take appropriate  steps to acknowledge the achievements of the Special Olympians from across this  island, who have been in the press so much over recent days. Those who excel in  business, sport or enterprise are role models to whom all of us should aspire.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText" style="margin-top:4.25pt;">Kieran McCarthy was right to put  down a firm marker as regards a tight timescale, and I note the Minister&rsquo;s  reassurance on that issue. As Kieran said, there is no mystery about what needs  to be done. I do not know how true that is; nonetheless, tight timescales and  firm deadlines are appropriate in order to try to maximise opportunities for  people with disabilities.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText" style="margin-top:4.25pt;">In opening the debate, David  McClarty said that one third of people with a disability are not in work. That  is something that should always be to the forefront of Members&rsquo; minds. That  hard cold fact should be the impetus for the Minister, the Assembly and the  Committee for Employment and Learning to take forward all the matters that have  been discussed today.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText" style="margin-top:4.25pt;">There was one discordant note  during this debate, when it was stated that the SDLP&rsquo;s amendment was:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;an amendment for an  amendment&rsquo;s sake&rdquo;.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">For the record, our amendment was informed by  people from the disability sector. They certainly were not thinking that the  amendment was being tabled simply for the sake of it. However, when judged in  comparison with the UUP&rsquo;s amendment, I suggest that our amendment adds to the  motion, whereas the UUP&rsquo;s amendment, arguably, takes away from it. That in  itself demonstrates the quality of our amendment.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, as I said earlier, it is not our intention to  divide the House on an issue of this nature and given the range and quality of  Members&rsquo; contributions. I look forward to the Minister updating the Committee  and the Assembly on a rolling basis regarding the matters that he has announced  this morning.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">2.30 pm</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  In this debate, we are dealing with a vulnerable group, along with their carers  and parents, who deserve our support and regard.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Much has been done by  further education colleges and their  staff. It is important that we pay tribute to their work.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I reject what Mr Attwood said. The UUP&rsquo;s main focus in  tabling the amendment was to broaden the debate and not lay all of this on the  Department for Education and Learning. I will go into that later.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As has been mentioned by most of the Members who have  spoken, there are many groups and community and voluntary agencies that should  be involved in addressing this very important issue. All those involved in  working for and caring for these groups deserve our thanks, and we give them  credit.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to place on record my thanks to Ms Ramsey, the  Chairperson of the Committee for Employment and Learning. This is a vital issue. The Assembly has faced  criticism over some of the issues that it has debated  in recent weeks. However, one had only to listen to the debate: with a  couple of exceptions, there has been unanimity on the way forward. Ms Ramsey  spoke about real difficulties, such as limited opportunities, lack of choice,  low rates of participation, and lack of co-ordination between Departments and  agencies. Disabled people are four times more likely to be unemployed than  able-bodied people. Those are all important facts that must be addressed.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McClarty had to attend another meeting and made his  apologies to the House. He opened his remarks by saying:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The true test of the value of a society is how much  care it takes of its weakest and most vulnerable members.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">He went on to outline some of the work that,  thankfully, is being done.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">With respect to Mr Attwood, my party feels that its own  amendment has struck the right note with the Members present. However, I agree  with Mr Attwood that the House should not divide; this issue is far too  important to be pushed to a Division. Mr Attwood was concerned about the  delivery of training, and rightly so. He went on to mention the role of the  Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Spratt used some phrases about having to get to a stage  of having more fulfilled lives. That is a key point. He also supported the  review.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McCarthy said that there are 300,000 people with  disabilities, so it is an economic necessity to get this right. They must be  supported, and the skills gap must be closed. I agree with him on that. There  was a note of discord, however, when Mr  McCarthy questioned why the motion and the amendments had been tabled. It was unfortunate and unhelpful that he brought  that up. On the whole, his remarks were much more positive.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Both Mr Newton and Mr Ross mentioned USEL and the creation  of partnerships involving not just Departments  and agencies, but the community, voluntary and private sectors. It is important to create employment in  commercially competitive companies.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mrs Bradley mentioned concerns about personal development.  Mrs Robinson referred to the Bamford Review. It is worth reiterating two points  about the review.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. The Member must draw his remarks to a close.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I want to thank Members for their support of my party&rsquo;s amendment and the  proposers of the motion for their acceptance of it.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs McGill</strong>: Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. At the  outset, I want to mention that I am closely related to two young people who  have physical disabilities &mdash; two young people who have achieved and of whom I  am proud. I thank Minister Empey for his presence throughout the entire debate.  I was heartened by his comments.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There are two amendments to the Sinn F&eacute;in motion. I want to  turn to the SDLP&rsquo;s amendment. My party colleague, Chairperson of the Committee  for Employment and Learning, Sue Ramsey, and I listened to Mr Attwood&rsquo;s remarks  during the earlier part of the debate. I reassure him and Mary Bradley that all  the points that are included in their amendment will be given due cognisance by  the Committee if the Minister agrees to the review. If the Minister brings forward  terms of reference, they must be examined by the Committee. In view of the  debate and wider participation, which is important at all levels, I do not want  Mr Attwood to feel that the points that have been raised in his amendment have  been ignored. That would not be the case. Both he and Mary Bradley can be  assured of that.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in accepts the UUP amendment. When Mr McClarty moved  the amendment, he referred to Pathways to Work and the positive contribution  that that programme has made towards getting disabled people back to work, or,  perhaps, into work for the first time. Coincidentally, I attended a  departmental seminar on Pathways to Work in Omagh yesterday. Officials from the  Department for Employment and Learning and, indeed, some of their colleagues  from the Department for Social Development were present. I found it extremely  valuable. It is clear that a lot of good work is being done. There is no  suggestion in the motion or either of the amendments that that is not the case.  The Minister referred to that in his remarks.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Newton, Mr Ross and the Minister referred to USEL. I  happen to know the chairman of that organisation, with whom I spoke yesterday  evening. He made several valuable points, which, interestingly, were raised by  my party colleague Sue Ramsey and other Members in the Chamber. He referred to  the lack of choice that is available to disabled people. They must have the  same options as able-bodied people. I was  glad that the Minister said that the review would be ongoing and that it is important that through the  Training for Success programme, disabled people have the same  opportunities and choices that are afforded to others.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I was interested in Mr McCarthy&rsquo;s comments about the cost  of a review.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">None of us wants to spend money foolishly. I am completely  confident that Minister Empey &mdash; with his background &mdash; will not be foolish with  the funds. If we have this review, the terms of reference will be scrutinised  by the Committee for Employment and Learning. I do not expect that any Member would sit there and not challenge the  spending of money foolishly by any Department.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Shannon and Mrs  Robinson referred to a particular caf&eacute;, and the points that they made about  it are valid and valuable. They reminded me of something that the chairman of USEL said to me last night, which was  that the social benefits of work are sometimes overlooked. It is  extremely important that people with disabilities, and people who do not have  the same opportunities as everyone else, engage and interact with others in the  workplace. It is a positive act. Yesterday,  at the Pathways to Work seminar, that point was made by people from DEL.  Therefore, there is a bit of joined-up thinking here. Of course, that is all  very welcome.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister has made reference to an ongoing review of  ANIC. That is valuable, because ANIC and the  further education colleges have a very important role in the matter. I  expect that, if that review is ongoing, its results will be put before the  Committee for further scrutiny. The Minister also referred to capital funding  for the improvement of access to the colleges. That is also important. I know  that there have been improvements in all of this in recent times. Again, that  is welcome. The fact that there will be an ongoing review, and that everybody will be keeping an eye on it, is very  valuable.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In concluding, I want to say that the debate has been very  valuable. When I think of two of my relatives, I want to reassure anybody who  thinks that some of us do not engage with disability groups that that is not  the case. We do engage with them. We have close experience of it. Again, for  those who feel that that might be the case, I reassure them that it will not  be. Sinn F&eacute;in accepts the amendment from the UUP. However, all that has been  raised by the SDLP will be taken on board. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Before I put the question on amendment No 1, I advise Members that  if amendment No 1 is made, amendment No 2 will fall.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText"><em>Question</em>, That amendment No 1 be made<em>, put and  agreed to.</em></p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText"><em>Main Question, as amended, put and agreed to.</em></p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText"><em>Resolved:</em></p>
		    <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly expresses  its commitment to securing training and employment opportunities where  appropriate for young people with disabilities; and calls on the Minister for  Employment and Learning to review the provision of such training.</p>
		    <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Speaker in the Chair)</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
		    <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="3"></a>Ministerial Statement</p>
		    <p class="H5StageHeading">The Future of the &nbsp;Conflict Transformation Initiative</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: I have received notice from the Minister for Social  Development that she wishes to make a statement on the conflict transformation  initiative.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development (Ms Ritchie)</strong>: As Minister for Social Development, I have  been reviewing the programme funded by my Department known as the conflict  transformation initiative (CTI). As Members can appreciate, there has been  considerable public interest in that initiative and in my Department&rsquo;s position in relation to the continuing  funding of the programme.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">On taking office, I made a pledge in the Assembly to the  people whom we represent. That pledge requires me to promote the interests of  the whole community. It is not only the guiding premise of my contract with the  people who put me here, but it is the benchmark and standard of what is  expected of me and of all Ministers in the Executive.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As Members will know,  this initiative was established under  the previous Secretary of State, Peter Hain, during the tenure of my direct rule predecessor, David  Hanson. From the outset, considerable concern was expressed across the  entire spectrum of political opinion about the rationale behind this project,  its proximity to an illegal terrorist organisation, as well as its monitoring,  evaluation and fairness. Indeed, with the benefit of hindsight, it appeared to  many to have been very hastily introduced before devolution returned.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Before returning to the context of the programme, I want to  point out that any initiative that targets socially and economically deprived  hard-to-reach communities will have worthwhile aspects. The legacy of our  violent past has left many of the most disadvantaged people in the grip of  paramilitary activity. Therefore, I recognise the need for creativity and  flexibility in the provision of such programmes. I am therefore putting on  record my confidence in the Farset organisation as a managing agent for a  programme funded by the Department for Social Development.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important, at this stage, for Members to understand  the distinction between the role of Farset Community Enterprises as a managing  agent and the return expected from those at whom the initiative was  specifically targeted through the actual programme. That distinction is  important because there has been much misinformation circulating in relation to  my view on the role of Farset Community Enterprises. There has also been the  deliberately misleading suggestion that CTI was simply about targeting social  need and not connected to a reduction in criminality, paramilitary activity and  violence by the UDA. Those who initiated this programme, and those who were to  benefit from the programme&rsquo;s outreach, knew full well from the start what was  expected from them.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Notwithstanding the  problems arising from the hurried nature  of the introduction of CTI by direct rule Ministers, it is a matter of  record that, at the time, both Secretary of State Hain and Minister Hanson  expected that that funding would lead to, in Minister Hanson&rsquo;s words:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;a quickening in the  pace of&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">decommissioning.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">They also pointed out that that funding would be  stringently monitored and reviewed for evidence of progress and breaches. It  was very clear that progress was contingent on good faith throughout.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In my view, this initiative was risk-prone from the very  start, as it appears that the political will never existed in the direct rule  Administration to see through the implementation of penalties, even if the UDA  defaulted through continued involvement with criminality, violence and  paramilitarism.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Every Member of this House is aware of the circumstances  that led to my announcement on 10 August 2007, and, in particular, the  assessment of the Chief Constable, following the violent incidents in  Carrickfergus and Bangor, who said that he would not give the UDA 50p if the  violence that we witnessed was an example of the return on our investment.  Indeed, at this stage, I would like to put on record my personal appreciation  for the efforts of the PSNI in trying to manage an escalating and difficult  situation, which has been brought about by the continued involvement of various  UDA factions and their internecine violent feuding.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I would also like to convey the best wishes of the House to  the constable who was shot in the back during the incidents in Carrickfergus,  while trying to uphold law and order. I would further like to express my  admiration for the people of Carrickfergus who spoke so powerfully about their  experiences on the radio this morning.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  It has been my hope that our new Administration would adopt a significantly  different approach to that of the direct rule Administration by ensuring that  the integrity of our institutions was safeguarded,  and that it would recognise the supremacy of law and order. That is  still my hope. By setting a deadline for the UDA to begin meaningful engagement  with the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning (IICD), and make a start to decom&shy;missioning, I  wanted to support not only the Chief Constable in his attempts to make our  streets safer, but to remind everyone of the background to this project.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I had hoped that the UDA would use that as an opportunity  to draw a line under its unlawful activities, and its use of violence, which  has ensnared entire communities in its grip. The UDA could have grasped that  opportunity by responding to the will of the vast majority of people in Northern Ireland and demonstrably starting  the decommissioning process.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In the past few weeks, the UDA has met again with the IICD.  We are told that there are those in the UDA who have tried to engage more  meaningfully with General de Chastelain than  they have over the past two years since commencing talks with the  commission, or over the past 13 years since the UDA first called its ceasefire  in 1994. I welcome those moves, but the  context of Northern Ireland &mdash; politically, economically and socially &mdash;  has shifted so positively over the past 12 months that the onus is now on the  UDA leadership to deliver fully on its responsibilities to the entire Northern  Ireland community.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Those who live in communities in which the rod of paramilitary rule still reigns are often among the  most disadvantaged and poorest  in society, whose dreams are being trodden on by an organisation that has not  recognised that the world has moved on.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Over the past number of months, I have considered carefully  what the Chief Constable and his senior officers have said. Following each of  the outbreaks of violence, I have listened to the comments of the First  Minister and other elected representatives of the affected areas, and I have  consulted widely.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I offered a CTI options paper to my Executive colleagues in  early July. They indicated that they were content for me to decide the way  forward on this challenging issue. I have studied intensely the recent reports  of the Independent Monitoring Commission, and I have met and spoken with a  broad range of interested parties, including highly-respected and well-meaning  intermediaries, locally elected repre&shy;sentatives, British and Irish Government  Ministers, community organisations, General de Chastelain, and, indeed, the  UPRG (Ulster Political Research Group) and the UDA. I would like to emphasise  to the House that, on each occasion, I listened very carefully to what was  said, and factored that into my overall thinking.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">More importantly, perhaps, I have been out and about,  visiting people in some of the areas that have been targeted. Although I can  appreciate the difficulties of programmes aimed at conflict transformation, it  is not surprising that the people who live in the estates at the receiving end  of paramilitary violence and dominance were united in their view.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">They felt that, no matter how well intentioned, the CTI initiative was being undermined by the  continuation of violence and paramilitary attacks and was not delivering  what was expected of it. I should add that I was delighted personally by the  warm welcome that I received from the people in those disadvantaged loyalist  areas. Whatever can be said about CTI, I will not abandon those neighbourhoods.  The views of people who live there are shared by citizens the length and  breadth of Northern Ireland, who are subjected to media reports of violence,  pipe bombings, shootings, and beatings. I do not believe that any law-abiding  or right-thinking citizen in Northern Ireland considers that the continued use  of illegally held weapons for illegal purposes by members of an illegal  organisation does not constitute a breach of the good faith or risk taken by  the Government&rsquo;s initiative.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am aware that there are people who think that that type  of initiative should never have been embarked upon. I know that there are  people who say that the funding should have been cut the day that the police  officer was shot, or when the Chief Constable made his scathing remarks. I am  aware that there are people who think that Ministers should treat deadlines as  though they were elastic bands. I am also aware that there are people who think  that I should carry on regardless. I understand  the diversity of opinions and the frustrations on all sides. Of course, there is also the argument that any  initiative that hastens the dismantling of a paramilitary group should be given  the chance to do just that. It would have been wrong for me to completely close  my door on any such opportunity. However, it would also be wrong if I were to  fail now to show determination and resolve.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I cannot stand over programmes that are aimed at quickening  the pace of decommissioning and reducing paramilitary activity when those same  paramilitaries are prepared to flaunt their  criminality in the face of the police and the rest of our community. The  UDA seems intent on doing that by its continued use of violence. Its fractious  nature suggests that the organisation is presently unable to meet the  objectives of CTI.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I have obligations to people who are working on the ground, to the managing agent, and also to the  continued problem of extending outreach to hard-to-reach communities and  devising the most appropriate vehicle to get there. CTI has produced some  outcomes, but its primary aim, for its primary target audience, does not seem  achievable at this time. I am sympathetic to the people who are involved in  CTI; they are totally unconnected to the UDA, and the failure of others is no  reflection on them. However, now is the time for me to exercise political  judgement and leadership.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Such is the ill-thought nature of the initiative, I am aware that there are people who would seek to  judicially review any decision to withhold the funding. There are  others, who are planning to judicially review, under equality legislation, any  continuation of the funding. Therefore, I have had to consider the options  available to me. I have considered the legal opinion of senior counsel, both in-house  and externally, on the aims of the CTI programme and the Department&rsquo;s  obligations to the various parties.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Although others may view recent events differently, or may  decide that law and order is not a priority, I beg to differ. My political  compass is fixed, and it does not involve prioritising the illegal over the  legal, or the lawbreaking over the law-abiding. The cycle of community  involvement equating to paramilitary involvement will have to be broken, once  and for all.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">3.00 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I do not believe that the CTI project can be justified any  longer, and I propose to end it immediately. Furthermore,  at a time when budgets are keenly contested and numerous groups are  having their applications for relatively minor sums turned down, I cannot  continue to justify the funding of a programme that is unable to deliver. I  pledge that no community will be left behind or  disadvantaged, and I will talk to elected representatives and others in the target areas to consider how to  achieve that objective together. I will also come to the Committee for  Social Development to have dicussions.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Above all, I will make every effort to ensure that  additional funds are allocated to deprived loyalist communities. I have  instructed my officials to ensure that any employees who are affected by my  decision are given due consideration, but the CTI initiative now ceases to  exist as a DSD-funded project.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Contrary to some comments, I have not simply been waiting  for 60 days to elapse before axing the CTI project: I do so with regret and  after long and arduous consideration. However, I have heard contradictory  comments from some UPRG spokespersons. They argue that the project has nothing  to do with the UDA, but that any interference with it could derail the peace  process. I entirely reject that argument. The UDA must not use today&rsquo;s  announcement as an excuse to go backwards. There is only one way to go, and  that is forward. The UDA should proceed with its good plans for November and,  if there is tangible evidence of a positive move on decommissioning and a  decrease in criminality, I am confident that my Executive colleagues will not  be found wanting in their support.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It has been a difficult and pressurised time for me. There has been a sustained campaign of briefing  against me and attempts to destabilise those around me. Ultimately,  however, over and above the complexities of assessing CTI, I know in my heart  and in all conscience that my decision is correct.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Under the new political dispensation, the Executive seek to  make a real difference for our people. The first step is to set higher standards for justice and democracy. Staying true to the position that I announced over  60 days ago and terminating CTI is my modest contribution to that  process.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. Today, Members are observing one of the most  absurd, if not bizarre, parliamentary experiences for many generations, and I  seek your advice on how to handle the next hour.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText"><span style="letter-spacing:-.05pt; ">Members have heard the  statement from the Minister </span>for Social Development, and the whole House  will share her sense of outrage at the activities of the UDA. Moreover, I have  no doubt that Members will agree entirely with her on the need for that  organisation to catch up with the rest of the community and move <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt; ">forward in a peaceful and democratic fashion.  However</span>, her announcement is contrary to a process set out by the  Executive &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCann</strong>:  That is not a point of order &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  I am on a point of order.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The announcement she has made is contrary to a process set  out by the Executive, and the decision is not consistent with the advice  offered by the Departmental Solicitor&rsquo;s Office and senior Crown counsel. I  believe her decision is also a breach of the ministerial code and the Pledge of  Office. In such circumstances, I wonder whether it is sensible for Members to  ask questions based on such a statement.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I thank the Member for his point of order. Some of the issues that Mr Robinson  has raised in his point of order are extremely serious to the House. Due to the  point of order, and the manner in which it was raised, I intend to suspend the  sitting.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>:  Mr Speaker, not one of those &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. There are some very serious issues &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>:  The point of order is not based on any Standing Order.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order until I am finished. Some very serious issues have been raised on that point  of order. I want to be absolutely &mdash;<em> [Interruption.]</em> Let me finish. <span style="letter-spacing:-.2pt; ">I want to be absolutely sure that the House is  safeguarded</span> legally and in every other way. I intend to suspend the  sitting for 20 minutes in order that I can get some clarity through legal  advice on the issue. If all sides of the House can wait for 20 minutes, we can  possibly bring clarity to the matter. Under Standing Order 60, I intend to  suspend the sitting for 20 minutes.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The sitting was suspended at 3.06 pm.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">On resuming (Mr Speaker in the Chair) &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.41 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I apologise to the House. I said that we would suspend for 20 minutes, but we  ran slightly over that. Meetings have been held with a number of people and  groups in order to try to bring some clarity to the issue. I have spoken to  Nigel Hamilton, the head of the Civil Service, who has some concerns. In fact,  he expressed some serious concerns on the issue&rsquo;s legality. I have also spoken  to other members of the Executive, who also expressed some serious concerns  about the matter and about the Minister&rsquo;s statement.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, I have considered Mr Robinson&rsquo;s point of order,  and I am satisfied at this time there has been no breach of Standing Orders. I  will take no further points of order until after questions to the Minister. I  call the Chairperson of the Committee for Social Development, Mr Gregory  Campbell.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText"><strong>The Chairperson of the Committee for Social Development  (Mr Campbell): </strong>I have no questions, Mr Speaker.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I have heard what the Minister said.  Does she agree that, as someone who is in the public eye, she, as Minister for  Social Development, and her Department  funded the UDA? Moreover, does she agree that, had the UDA behaved  itself and decommissioned, she would have  continued to fund the UDA and provide it with resources? UDA  decommissioning should have happened because it was the right thing to do. If  the UDA decommissions, will the Minister continue to provide it with funds?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>: The statement that I have made today  still stands, and its content is quite clear.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  After the proceedings earlier, it is important for the Minister to confirm to  the House that all previous contractual arrangements entered into will be  honoured. Will she tell the House whether she had any communication with her  Executive colleagues on her final decision on the matter in advance of making  her statement?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>: As agreed, I furnished the First Minister, <span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt; ">the deputy First Minister and the Minister of  Finance and</span> Personnel with two sets of legal advice on the matter.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In response to the other  point that the Member raised, my officials will today be exploring all  issues with the managing agent, Farset Youth and Community Development Ltd.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire as  an r&aacute;iteas a rinne s&iacute; agus go deimhin d&eacute;anaim comhghairdeas l&eacute;i as an r&aacute;iteas.  T&aacute; ceist amh&aacute;in agam uirthi. An dtiocfadh liom a fhiafraidh di cad &eacute; a  tharl&oacute;idh anois do Airgead Chiste Chlaochlaithe na Coimhlinte?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Minister for her statement and congratulate her  on the stance that she has taken. I am sure that she, like me, is taken aback  by the willingness of some Members to jump to the defence of the UDA. What will  happen with the CTI money now?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  From the financial and accounting perspective, the money will stay in the  Department&rsquo;s budget for community development. The bulk of the money pays  development officers&rsquo; wages.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I hope to direct funds to some of the most hard-to-reach  and disadvantaged areas, and I will consider the best way to do that by holding  discussions with MLAs and councillors from those target areas. I am aware of  the needs of those communities and the fact that they differ from one another.  I will talk as soon as possible to Assembly colleagues who represent  disadvantaged loyalist communities about those communities&rsquo; needs, and I will  then consider how to meet those needs within the criteria of existing DSD  programmes.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Before making today&rsquo;s announcement, I spoke to the  Chairperson and the Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for Social Development,  and I have attempted to reflect their concerns and wishes.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: On behalf of the United Community Group and many other people  in the community, I thank and congratulate the Minister for her statement and  for her willingness to stand up for integrity in the political process, despite  all the pressure to which she has been subjected, inside and outside the House.  I also wish to thank the Chief Constable and other police officers for the  roles that they have played in combating terrorism.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister said that she will ensure that areas that were  previously part of the CTI scheme will not be neglected and that she is willing  to engage with elected representatives from those areas to determine how to  move matters forward. On behalf of the Alliance Party, and Naomi Long in  particular, I assure the Minister that we will engage with her in those  discussions. In that context, how does the Minister intend to target the needs  of disadvantaged unionist areas without creating different gatekeepers in the  future?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  I thank Mr Ford and his party for their support. First, I wish to talk to all  representatives from the various target areas about their perceived issues of  need. Funding equates with need, and I want to meet those needs. I want to hear  what Members have to say about this matter, and I want to correct past problems  in order to ensure that money is directed  towards building communities, targeting disadvantage, deprivation and  poverty and reaching those most in need.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the months since being appointed as Minister, I have had  various opportunities to visit Protestant, loyalist communities &mdash; the Village,  Ballyclare, Coleraine, north Belfast  and Kilcooley. People in those communities told me that they want the yoke of  paramilitarism lifted from them. They want to be liberated, to have funding directed at projects that address  needs such as poverty, disadvantage and deprivation, and help to rebuild their  communities. I am passionate about helping them to do that, because I want to  help all people. As a Minister in the Executive and the Assembly, my Pledge of  Office commits me to strive towards that.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle.  The Chamber has seen many twists and turns, and we have just seen  another one. Wider society may find the matter difficult, and Members must be conscious of that in their  deliberations.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I must ask again whether the Minister agrees that the UDA  should not be funded by public money. Will she say whether the statement means  that she intends to fund the UDA in the future? The Minister may have stopped  funding what she described in the statement  as a UDA organisation &mdash; and there is no other way to read it. However if  the UDA does the decent thing and puts its guns beyond use, stops intimidating  the loyalist communities and moves into a  peaceful mode, regardless of all that is she prepared to fund such an  organisation?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  I am not at all clear what the Member&rsquo;s question is. However, I will make it  clear that my intention is to target disadvantage, poverty and deprivation, and  the statement that I made to the House still stands.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>: I  assure the Minister that people who are watching today&rsquo;s events will recognise  that, although her critics have some neck, she, at least, is showing backbone  in dealing with an important issue.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  Is she funding the UDA?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>: I  heard some questions that were asked from a sedentary position. Sinn F&eacute;in is  giving clear advice and conclusions. Was  that the sort of advice that the Minister received from the deputy First  Minister, the Minister of Education, the Minister for Regional Development, the  Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development or the junior Minister in the  Office of the First Minister and the deputy First Minister when her Executive  colleagues received the circular about the issues in the summer? Were her  colleagues content? Did the Sinn F&eacute;in Ministers offer the sort of advice that  is coming from the Sinn F&eacute;in Benches today, or did they say something else?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  I thank my colleague and party leader, the Member for Foyle Mr Durkan, for his  question. I will be absolutely clear about that issue. When I circulated a  paper to the Executive way back at the end of  June and early July, notwithstanding my reservations about the project,  I outlined that I was prepared to go ahead with it. The response that I  received from the First Minister and deputy First Minister was that they did  not see a need for a decision to be taken, that it was not a matter for the  Executive, and that they left it solely to the Minister for Social Development.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I clearly remember comments from the Minister for Regional  Development and the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, which  clearly recorded that they had no comment to make. That is all that was ever  said to me.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  When all is said and done, I was alarmed when I found out that the Minister was  considering funding the UDA. I must touch on one policy that has been mentioned  several times &mdash; that of targeting social need. The Minister has been selective  in her targeting &mdash;<span class="B3BodyTextItalicChar"><span style="font-size:11.0pt; ">[Interruption.]<strong></strong></span></span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>A Member</strong>:  Big talk.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><span class="B3BodyTextItalicChar"><strong><span style="font-size:11.0pt; font-style:normal; ">Mr Speaker: </span></strong></span>Order.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  She has been selective in targeting social need. Why did the Minister go  against her Department&rsquo;s policy of targeting social need and abject poverty, by  funding one community over the other, when social need stretches across the  community?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  I thank Mr McCann for his question. There is some confusion in the House. I am  trying to correct problems that were created by the direct rule Administration,  which insisted on using funding from the  Department for Social Development for that project. It is clear to me  that it was a policing and community safety project, which, if it required  funding, should have been funded by the Northern Ireland Office. It was nothing  to do with the Department for Social Development.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have already stated to the House my earnest desire to  target deprivation and poverty, and to build communities right across Northern Ireland,  irrespective of whether the problems lie in  a loyalist, Protestant area or in a  nationalist, republican area. The most compelling issue for me is that  need, disadvantage and deprivation must be  addressed, and that we must build communities; we must make a difference  if the new devolution is to mean anything to the people of Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to build those communities, and I want to be able to  build those communities. I want to ensure that all the people to whom I have  talked over the past months &mdash; from whatever community they come &mdash; are given the  freedom to live.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Anderson</strong>: Go raibh maith agat. The Department for Social Development&rsquo;s  role is to eradicate poverty wherever it exists. Without doubt, Sinn F&eacute;in will support the Minister if she uses that criterion  to allocate funding. However, I remain concerned, as do other Members in  the Chamber, that the Minister&rsquo;s statement clearly  indicates that it has been left open for the UDA to receive funding  should it decommission. The Minister is setting out funding criteria for  decommissioning that is not being done on the basis of objective need. That is  wrong, and the Minister should provide Members with clarification.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  Sinn F&eacute;in never proposed a motion in the Executive, or even in the Assembly, to  suspend or terminate funding for the conflict transformation initiative.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have made it absolutely clear in the House, during  Question Time and various debates, that my earnest desire is to eradicate  poverty through addressing disadvantage and deprivation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I look forward to support from my Sinn F&eacute;in ministerial  colleagues for my bids to address disadvantage and deprivation in social  housing, where an urgent and compelling need exists. I hope that their voices  will not fall silent on those particular issues, because poverty must be  addressed, irrespective of the community in which it is found. That is my  earnest desire.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  Will the Minister share with the Assembly any advice that she received from the  departmental solicitor&rsquo;s office on the matter? Does she accept that every  Minister must act in accordance with the law? Does she accept that no Minister  can act outside their legal competence? Will the Minister share with the  Assembly the advice that she received from the Executive&rsquo;s secretary, the head  of the Northern Ireland Civil Service?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  I am not sure whether Mr Robinson is asking the question as Minister of Finance  and Personnel or as the person who likes to think that he controls the  Executive.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. I understand that the Member is speaking as a private Member.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  I was simply seeking clarification. <em>[Interruption.]</em></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  That is why I am sitting here.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>:  The Member was on the Front Bench. The DUP is good at changing position.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  As I outlined at the beginning of my statement, I fully adhere to the  principles of the Pledge of Office. Of course, the Member was not present when  I said that. I was very careful &mdash;<span class="B3BodyTextItalicChar"><span style="font-size:11.0pt; ">[Interruption.]</span></span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. The Minister has the Floor.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  I stated clearly that I had sought internal and external legal advice on the  matter. I am perfectly satisfied that I have legal support for the decision  that I have taken. <em>[Interruption.]</em></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>: I heard comments earlier about advice from Mr Nigel Hamilton.  Certainly, the review into the appointment of the Interim Commissioner for  Victims, and the shenanigans surrounding that appointment did not stand up well  to scrutiny.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">4.00 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It may come as a surprise to some, but people in the  nationalist community &mdash; if not the wider community &mdash; are aware that the UDA was  not a proscribed organisation until 1993, much to the shame of the British  Government at that time.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister has clearly given her commitment that funds to  address social need will target deprived communities across the North. Will the  Minister again confirm, for slow learners and Sinn F&eacute;in, that that is the case  and that there will be a level playing field for all community groups to apply  for funding under the criteria as set out by her Department?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  I thank Mrs Kelly for her question. I agree with her. It is my intention to  address the issues of social deprivation and poverty. I will ensure that  funding is directed where the need lies.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Will the Minister agree that the  kernel of this debacle is the initiative, taken by the direct rule Ministers,  to direct funding towards the UDA, and which  she has continued? Will she also agree that lessons should be drawn from  this unfortunate experience? If the policy of targeting social need on an  objective basis were the only criterion, the UDA would never have been granted  money, either in the past, the present or the future.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>: I thank Mr McLaughlin for his question.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I do not disagree with the issues that he raised about the  direct rule Administration. It is unfortunate that many Ministers inherited  policies that were not rightly placed or  correctly implemented by that Administration. Many Members in this  House, including members of his own party,  and members of his party in the Executive, have been silent on these  issues over the last number of months. I hope that there will be support for  proper standards in Government and for tackling deprivation, disadvantage and poverty. The purpose of the  Department for Social Development is  to build communities through tackling deprivation, disadvantage and  poverty, irrespective of where they lie.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  add my congratulations to the Minister for her courageous stand and for showing  integrity, despite the challenges coming from outside and especially from some  quarters of the Chamber.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister join  me in recognising that the vast majority of people, especially in the  unionist section of the community, want the  UDA off their backs? Will she also recognise that, in allocating  resources to address need, that is distorted by self-appointed middlemen? Will  she recognise that the Pledge of Office requires Ministers to act to uphold the  rule of law and that this decision is  consistent with the rule of law in our society? Will she ask the Northern Ireland Office, which referred this  matter to the Department for Social Development, to respect the decision that  she has taken?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  I thank Dr Farry for his question and for  his support. I fully agree with what he has said. I am anxious that  resources are targeted where the need lies.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">All Members should uphold the rule of law. When I found out  that a policeman had been shot &mdash; and I am sure, and hope, that nobody would  disagree with this &mdash; that a community was being held to ransom in Kilcooley and  that similar acts were taking place, and are still taking place, in  Carrickfergus, I had to take action to ensure that the best possible principles  of democracy &mdash; the very principles that this House holds dear &mdash; are upheld, and  that money is directed to those who need it and used to tackle disadvantage and  deprivation. Once again, I thank the Member for his support.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Donaldson</strong>:  On this side of the House, it has been our long-held objective to see  paramilitarism removed from everywhere in Northern Ireland, regardless of its  manifestation. That remains our objective. Nevertheless, we cannot fight  unlawfulness by taking unlawful decisions. We need to be absolutely clear that the decision taken today is legally  competent.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the interests of  transparency, the Assembly must be clear about the advice that the  Minister has been given by the Departmental Solicitor&rsquo;s Office. However, the  Minister has not told the Assembly what advice she was given. The Assembly is  entitled to know what that advice was, because that is essential if Members are  to be able to defend the decision that has been taken. Therefore, can the  Minister clarify what advice she was given by the Departmental Solicitor&rsquo;s  Office?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  I thank Mr Donaldson for his support. Everyone in the House agrees that the  yoke of paramilitarism must be removed. I do not believe that anyone disagrees  with that. The information that was provided  to me internally by the Departmental Solicitor&rsquo;s Office and by senior  Crown counsel, and that which I received  from an independent legal person, is privileged information. Therefore,  I shall leave it at that.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  Does the Minister agree that people who have long been silent on this issue  have suddenly found their voices in the Chamber? Those people gave advice, the  height of which was, &ldquo;no comment&rdquo;, when the Minister sought guidance from her  Executive colleagues. The people whose advice amounted to &ldquo;no comment&rdquo; now have  all sorts of advice for the Minister on how she has handled this matter. Does  she not find that contradictory and  somewhat insulting to the people of Northern Ireland, who have a clear  view about how this matter should be handled, unlike members of Sinn F&eacute;in and  its Ministers in the Executive? Has the Minister consulted General de  Chastelain to seek his assessment of the  situation in respect of decommissioning by loyalist paramilitaries?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  I thank my colleague Mr Attwood for his comments and questions. First, I wish  to point out that I am happy to share the legal advice that I have been given with the Committee for Social  Development.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have had a meeting and a telephone conversation with  General de Chastelain. I can assure the House that I fully and carefully  considered the information that he provided. I am sure that the House will  understand that I cannot share what I have been told. However, I can tell the  House that no one to whom I have spoken during the past weeks and months has  told me that the requirement for decommissioning would be fulfilled as I had  requested, and which is so evidently required by the people of Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Everywhere that I have visited throughout Northern Ireland  during the past several months, people have told me that they want the yoke of  paramilitarism removed from their backs; they want deprivation and disadvantage  addressed, and they want illegal weapons removed from society and  decommissioned &mdash; they were very clear about that and they were also clear that  they want criminality, violence and terrorism to be removed from society. There  is a new political dispensation. In view of  the fact that the dial on the political compass has changed, the public  must see UDA decommissioning and the yoke  of paramilitarism and criminality removed from our society.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>: I  thank the Minister for Social Development for her statement. I am pleased that  she has shown a degree of integrity that was lacking in that area under direct  rule. Given that the programme was brought in under direct rule, has the  Minister received any assurance from the  Northern Ireland Office that those who have, for so long, lectured local  representatives to get on with the job for which they were elected, will now  respect the Minister&rsquo;s decision, having made the choice for which she was  elected, and will desist from further interfering in the matter?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  I thank Mrs Long, a Member for East Belfast,  for her support and for her question. However, I very much regret that I am not in a position to provide her  with a clear answer. I hope that the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland  and Minister Goggins will support me in my decision &mdash; and support me publicly &mdash;  and ensure that any side briefing is stopped.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to clear up two things. First, for the benefit of  ministerial colleagues and Sinn F&eacute;in Assembly Members, I will not be funding the UDA now or in the future.  Secondly, for the benefit of my DUP Assembly colleagues, my decision has  an entirely robust legal basis. The Departmental Solicitor&rsquo;s Office has  observed that I am behaving entirely legally.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCartney</strong>:  Thank you, and go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Given that some of the Minister&rsquo;s party colleagues cannot  distinguish the difference between criticism and clarification, she has cleared  the matter up. We sought clarification of  one issue and one issue only. <em>[Laughter.]</em></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCartney</strong>:  We sought clarification of one issue and one  issue only. Will the Minister guarantee the House that she will never in  the future fund the UDA?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  I thank Mr McCartney for his clarification. For the benefit of ministerial  colleagues in Sinn F&eacute;in, for Sinn F&eacute;in Members and for other Members, I will  not fund the UDA either now or in the future.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>: I thank the Minister for her statement, at least. I assure  Members and place on the record that the Ulster Unionist Party has neither  sanctioned nor supported the actions of any illegal paramilitary organisation,  loyalist or otherwise.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In her statement the Minister drew attention to the work of  the managing agents, the Farset organisation. I ask her to clarify beyond any  doubt that, as a result of her decision, its integrity is in no way affected,  nor will it be affected or impeded in the future as it continues to carry out important community work in that entire  area.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  I thank Mr Kennedy. I fully agree with him about paramilitarism. Neither I nor  my party have ever supported paramilitarism, irrespective of where it may have  come from. I want to put that on public record. My statement also expressed my  support for the Farset organisation. I have never, at any time, said anything different. On the day that I made the original  statement, I said that I supported the good work that was under&shy;taken by Farset and what they have done for <span style="letter-spacing:-.3pt; ">community</span> development in Belfast  over the past 35 years.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. That concludes questions on the ministerial statement.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Campbell</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. In circumstances where a Minister gives a  briefing to the Chairperson and Deputy Chairperson of a scrutiny Committee of  the House immediately before an important decision that that Minister is about  to announce, what redress do the Chairperson and Deputy Chairperson of that  Committee have in ensuring that they get satisfaction in the future? That  occurred today, 30 minutes before the Minister for Social Development made a  statement on the important decision on which she has just been taking  questions. That briefing included a specific reference to legal advice that she  obtained that supported her decision. However, it has transpired that that was  not the case.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>A Member</strong>:  That is not a point of order.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Campbell</strong>:  It is a point of order.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>A Member</strong>:  What are you worried about?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. I have listened to the Member, and that is not a point of order in which  the House should become involved.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We will now move on to the next item of business.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">4.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: On a point of order, Mr Speaker. The issue of legal advice to  Ministers was raised on a previous occasion, and it concerned the appointment  of an interim victims&rsquo; commissioner by OFMDFM. Surely that must be taken into  account now, because, on that occasion, the House conducted its affairs very  differently and there was a very different ruling.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Again, I hear what the Member is saying. However, it is not an appropriate  point of order for the House. It is certainly a matter for the Executive, but  not for this House.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. At the end of the Minister&rsquo;s statement, Mr  Peter Robinson raised a point of order. I have checked the blue book, the &lsquo;Northern Ireland Assembly  Companion&rsquo;, which contains a ruling by Speaker Alderdice on such  matters. That ruling was that no point of order would be taken during the  course of a statement, or during the course of questions following a statement.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Speaker, I am in no way criticising the Chair. However,  in view of the precedent established by Speaker Alderdice, can you consider  whether the point of order made by Mr Peter  Robinson, was, on reflection, out of order and should not have been  taken at that point. Mr Speaker, I ask that you reflect on that matter and  report back to the Assembly on what I believe was an improper point or order &mdash;  and Mr Peter Robinson should, of course, have known that.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  Further to that point of order, Mr Speaker. Based on the terms used by the  Member himself, is it not true that I did not make a point of order during the  statement or questions?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I will clarify the issues raised in those two  points of order. Mr Robinson is correct in saying that he did not make a  point of order during the ministerial statement.  He waited until the end of the statement before he made his point of  order, which is appropriate. I have continually  reminded Members that I will not take points of order during a  statement, but that I am happy to do so after a ministerial statement is made  and before questions to the Minister are taken.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr Ian Paisley</strong>: On a point of order, Mr Speaker. Will you  give some consideration as to how long the rulings of previous Speakers abide?  Are those rulings eternal? Do we hold forever to the rulings of a person who sat  in the Speaker&rsquo;s Chair but was never elected to it by this House? Does there  come a time to say &ldquo;Amen&rdquo; to those rulings and bury them?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I am very happy to report back to the House on that point of order. I must  remind Members that, as always, the Speaker&rsquo;s decision is final. It is  important that Members remember that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I ask Members that if they intend to leave the Chamber, to  do so quickly, and if they intend to stay, to please take their seats.</p>
	      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="4"></a>Private Members&rsquo; Business</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Fiscal Reform</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to two hours for this debate. The  proposer of the motion will have 10 minutes to propose and 10 minutes for a  winding-up speech. All other Members who speak will have five minutes. One  amendment has been received and has been published on the Marshalled List. The  proposer of the amendment will have 10 minutes to propose and 10 minutes for a  winding-up speech.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Neeson</strong>: <span style="font-size:11.0pt; ">I beg to move</span></p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly  recognises the complexity of the global economy and calls for fiscal reforms,  and other measures, to ensure that Northern Ireland is competing on a  level playing field.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent"><span style="font-size:11.0pt; ">The events of this afternoon will be a hard act to  follow; I hope that they will not overshadow the content of this debate.</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText"><span style="font-size:11.0pt; ">The real purpose of the motion is to keep the question of the economy  to the fore in the Assembly. Members will recall that before the restoration of  devolution the </span>Subgroup on the Economic Challenges facing Northern Ireland <span style="letter-spacing:-.2pt; font-size:11.0pt; ">reported  back to the Transitional</span><span style="font-size:11.0pt; "> Assembly. The main purpose of the subgroup was the  creation of economic advantage as part of the peace dividend. However, the  Chancellor&rsquo;s pre-Budget statement last week clearly showed that Alistair is not  the Darling of businesses in Northern    Ireland. Despite that, I want this debate to  be a positive one. I am aware that the US  ambassadors have been to Northern Ireland  in recent days, preparing for next year&rsquo;s economic conference in America. That  will provide a major platform for the exploitation of opportunities and the  development of Northern    Ireland&rsquo;s economy.</span></p>
	      <p class="B3SpeakerinChair"><span style="font-size:11.0pt; ">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Molloy] in the Chair)</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText"><span style="font-size:11.0pt; ">The unemployment rate in Northern Ireland currently stands  at 4%. I remember that when I was Chairman of the Economic Development  Committee of the 1982 Assembly,  unemployment was over 20%. It is somewhat ironic that that Assembly was  elected 25 years ago later this month; there are very few survivors from that  time. The days of the culture of economic development grants are gone, which is  to be welcomed. That Committee had to deal with issues such as DeLorean and  Learfan, which, ironically, were not total failures.</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText"><span style="font-size:11.0pt; ">We must realise that we are now living in a global economy, and that  new challenges are coming from new economies  such as India and China. The real  issue that faces us now is competitiveness; we have to recognise that there is a structural imbalance  between the private and public sectors. The challenge is to strengthen  the private sector and reduce our undue dependence on the public sector.</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText"><span style="font-size:11.0pt; ">Although the focus of the motion is on fiscal reforms, there are other issues that must be addressed in order  to assist the growth of the economy here. The reform of corporation tax is an  obvious priority, and the Assembly and  others have made submissions to Sir David Varney on that subject. It is  to be hoped that his report will be presented to the Assembly sooner rather  than later.</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText"><span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt; font-size:11.0pt; ">Last year, the </span>Subgroup on the Economic Challenges facing  Northern Ireland <span style="font-size:11.0pt; ">heard  from a wide range of organisations and individuals  &mdash; as has the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Investment this year &mdash;  who expressed their concerns about the unfair competition coming from the  Republic of Ireland as a result of its lower rate of corporation tax. There is no doubt that that lower rate has attracted a  substantial amount of foreign direct  investment into the Republic<span style="letter-spacing:0pt; "> of Ireland</span>, particularly in high-value industries. Other areas  of the UK  do not share a land border with another country that has such fiscal  advantages.</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText"><span style="font-size:11.0pt; ">I am aware that there are issues in the EU over the Azores  ruling. Those issues could be overcome if the Assembly had tax-varying powers  in line with those devolved to the Scottish Parliament. That would give us  greater fiscal flexibility to grow our economy and expand the private sector.  Research and development tax credits must be closely examined. The evidence  shows that there is a lack of take-up of those incentives, especially by SMEs  (small and medium sized enterprises).</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It must be asked: do those tax credits need to be enhanced?  Could the universities do more to encourage that? I have been greatly impressed  by the work that has been carried out in the science parks and other research  institutions in Northern    Ireland. It would be remiss of me not to  take account of the excellent lobbying work carried out by the Northern Ireland  Manufacturing Focus Group on the question of industrial derating. The Assembly  has already debated the issue, and I know  that it is a matter to be considered in the comprehensive spending review.  I remind Members that industrial derating was first introduced here to compete  with the lower rates of corporation tax in the Republic of Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Last week, the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Investment heard a  submission from the Department on its  regional innovation strategy. In fact, the Committee discussed that  matter at its meeting today. The success of the strategy is dependent on close  co-operation between Northern Ireland Government Departments. It is important  that joined-up government is developed. It is  clear that we live in a changing world and a changing global economy, so  we must develop the skills and expertise to meet the needs of today and the  future. That is why a regional innovation  strategy is so important.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Flexibility and responsiveness are also needed in  regulation and planning. Fiscal reform alone is not the panacea for the future.  However, there are many challenges ahead for the Assembly to make Northern Ireland a competitive country in today&rsquo;s global economy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although I accept the spirit in which the amendment was  made, it does not take into consideration all of the issues that I hope are included in my motion. Therefore, the  Alliance Party will not support the amendment.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I  beg to move the following amendment: Leave out all after &ldquo;Assembly&rdquo; and insert</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;calls upon the  Executive, on receipt of the report of the Varney Review, to work in conjunction with Her Majesty&rsquo;s Treasury to provide  a competitive fiscal framework for business in Northern Ireland.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I am sympathetic to much of what the proposer of  the motion has said, but I have sought to improve what I believe to be the  spirit of the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">First, I like plain  English. The first part of the motion says:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;That this Assembly recognises the complexity of the  global economy&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That is wonderful language, but I am not sure what  it conveys or what its purpose is. The relevant word that I have used is  &ldquo;competitive&rdquo;; we must be competitive, and not simply recognise the complexity  of the global economy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The motion continues:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;calls for Fiscal reforms, and other measures, to  ensure that Northern Ireland  is competing on a level playing field.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">It is unclear what the intention is. What is meant  by &ldquo;a level playing field&rdquo;? I presume that it refers to corporation tax, but  many of our EU neighbours have higher corporation tax levels. We do not  necessarily want a level playing field with those countries; again, the  important word is &ldquo;competitive&rdquo;. I presume that everyone in the Assembly wants  lower levels of corporation tax, not the same levels as other countries.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, in the latter  part of Mr Neeson&rsquo;s speech he called  for tax-varying powers. That was not specifically contained in the  motion, although I feared that it might be mentioned.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Income tax is an important tax in any economy. Income-tax  levels would increase if they were brought in  line with other European countries. There is no doubt that a rise in  income-tax levels would have an adverse affect on the Northern Ireland  economy. It would disincentivise individuals from working, and we need to  encourage more people to move from incapacity benefit  to employment in order to improve the efficiency of our economy. There must be no disincentives that limit what  might occur. The use of the term &ldquo;level playing field&rdquo; is wrong, so I have used  the word &ldquo;competitive&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Varney Review is particularly relevant to the current  fiscal framework in Northern    Ireland and is another glaring omission from  the motion. Members look forward to hearing the outcome of the review, and it  would be helpful for the Minister to indicate whether Sir David Varney has  submitted his report to him and the devolved Administration. If so, when will  that report be made public?</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">4.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My amendment calls on the Executive:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;to work in conjunction with Her Majesty&rsquo;s Treasury to  provide a competitive fiscal framework for business in Northern Ireland.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members must remember  that when business performs well, there are genuine, sustainable jobs,  and everyone prospers and has more opportunities. To achieve that, a reduction  in the level of corporation tax could play an important role, although it is  not yet known whether that will be considered or implemented.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the United Kingdom,  the Northern Ireland  economy is unusual in that it relies heavily on small businesses. To date, the  Chancellor has introduced to the Northern Ireland economy an  increase in the tax on small businesses from 19% to 22%. Rather than giving  advantages to the Northern    Ireland economy, he has penalised it  particularly harshly.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Among the other options that must be considered is  industrial rating, which is in the Assembly&rsquo;s grasp. The industrial rates  escalator in which the direct rule Administration have placed Northern Ireland  would be disastrous for the economy. Given the additional electricity, energy  and transportation costs, many employers have indicated that an increase would  lead to a reduction in R&amp;D, investment and, ultimately, local jobs. It is  important for Northern    Ireland not to be tied to that escalator.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">An increase in tax credits for R&amp;D is important. In a  survey, the Federation of Small Businesses found that 65% of its members were  unaware of them. Progress must be made by improving advertising and ensuring  that employers are better informed of the opportunities that tax credits offer  to their businesses. As with many other systems that Government operate, it  must be made easy for businesses to apply for tax credits. The advantages that  they bring allow local businesses to make improvements. Additional investment  in R&amp;D can improve their competitiveness and increase sustainability and  job opportunities.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Capital allowances also offer opportunities. My amendment  states that the Executive must work in conjunction with Her Majesty&rsquo;s Treasury  on the development of various areas to  create a &ldquo;competitive fiscal  framework&rdquo;. Capital allowances enable businesses to make significant  investments rather than paying tax, and they must be encouraged.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Rates relief for rural post offices and isolated  convenience stores exists in other parts of the United   Kingdom, and its application to Northern Ireland  must be considered. Why should that benefit only be available elsewhere?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My amendment enhances the intention of the motion by  removing the doubt created by Mr Neeson&rsquo;s use of the phrase &ldquo;level playing  field&rdquo;. Rather, the Assembly wants to create a more competitive playing field  in which businesses can operate and thereby create  more job opportunities. Therefore, I ask Members to support my  amendment.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>: I  welcome the opportunity for the Assembly to debate the health and growth  potential of Northern    Ireland&rsquo;s economy, and I support the  amendment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I concur with the Member for East Antrim Mr Beggs that it  is crucial for the Assembly to ensure that competitiveness is at the heart of  fiscal policies.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Every time I speak on this issue, it is in the full  knowledge that some of us lack the relevant expertise, especially following the  loss that our party experienced with the sudden passing of my dear friend and  trusted colleague George Dawson. His maiden speech in the Assembly was on the Northern Ireland  economy, which was dear to his heart. Therefore, we are discussing the subject  today with mixed emotions.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">When we are considering the problems facing the Northern Ireland economy, we must have all the  relevant tools at our disposal to ensure that Northern Ireland is a prosperous  place for everyone. We are developing a model of devolution &mdash; which gives us  some autonomy to make responsible decisions that will have a positive, or,  depending on the decisions that we make, adverse effect on our local economy.  That is the single biggest challenge facing the Administration.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The economy is our key priority, particularly if we accept  the prevailing view among some economists that Northern Ireland does not pay its  way. It is not alone in that respect. When we look across this island, we see a  contributor to our economic difficulties, namely the lack of what has been  described as the cornerstone of industrial development policy &mdash; a competitive  corporation tax.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">At first glance, Northern Ireland&rsquo;s economic  performance has been impressive. We have an unemployment rate of 5% &mdash; lower  than the UK as a whole and well below the rate of unemployment in Europe, which  is at 8&middot;4%. In the past 10 years, the employment rate has grown by around 20%,  which is double the UK  rate.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We have innovative companies that can compete with the best  in the world, and I am always mindful of companies such as Wrightbus Ltd, which  I have mentioned in the past, in my constituency of North   Antrim. That company has been exemplary in how it has faced up to  its challenges. Such companies have proved that they are well able to compete  with the best in the world. However, they and many others who may be encouraged  to set up base and invest here need realistic and competitive incentives. We  are unenviably limited, due, in part, to our inability to competitively entice  substantial inward investment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Our fiscal deficit, which is funded by the Treasury, is  around &pound;7 billion. That is almost double the figure for Scotland, which  has the ability to vary income tax by three pence in the pound but has never  done so &mdash; for sound fiscal reasons. Surely, a one-size-fits-all approach for  the UK is inappropriate for  the Northern Ireland  economy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Westminster Government must recognise the unique  circumstances in Northern    Ireland and acknowledge that now is the time  to permit a measured degree of diversity. A strong one-off case can be made for  corporation tax. However, we should be cautious about departing from UK-wide  policy and we should consider the implications of doing so in such cases. We  would probably be left to meet the financial burdens for a policy that could  backfire economically. After all, there are strong arguments for continuing to  benefit from the protection that comes from being part of the UK-wide tax  system.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The report of the Varney Review, which is due to be made  public soon, has been mentioned. The Executive will carefully consider their  response to that report, as part of a wider directional change to stimulate our  economy.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I listened  carefully to the proposal that my party supports and to the comments of Roy  Beggs in moving the amendment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I acknowledge that both Members attempted to address an  issue that the House must confront at some stage. To some extent, Roy Beggs  allayed my initial concerns about the amendment when he elaborated on his  reasons for tabling it. His contribution was, therefore, constructive and  helpful.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The issues that were raised in the debate were addressed by the economic subgroup that the  Preparation for Government Committee established during the Hain Assembly.  The subgroup carried out its work on the basis of an all-party consensus. That  united front was evident when the parties went to see the then Chancellor of  the Exchequer, Gordon Brown, and his Treasury team. The hostility of the  Treasury to any modification of the one-size-fits-all approach, to which Mervyn Storey referred, was made clear at that  meeting.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, the issue remains a conundrum for the Executive.  This island has an economy that performs competitively in the global economy.  Therefore, a level playing field would compel one to examine the reasons for  that hostility and, perhaps, apply circumstances that were more suitable to an  island-wide approach. What clearly works in London  and the south-east of England  does not necessarily work in the north of England,  Scotland, Wales, and it  definitely does not work in this economic region.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Statistics that cover a long period demonstrate the failure  of the policy of convergence. The draft economic projections that were prepared  under the direct rule Ministers, and that continue to underpin the Department  of Finance and Personnel&rsquo;s economic approach until such times as the Assembly  can impose itself, predicted a 0&middot;5% improvement in the divergence of  performance and productivity for the next six to seven years. That was a policy  of failure, which, in addition to the fact that the advocates of the status quo  are not arguing that the situation will improve, means that the Assembly has an  inescapable responsibility to secure as  much flexibility and as many fiscal instruments as possible to enable the Executive to do their work and deliver  on the Programme for Government. However, the current arrangements do not  facilitate that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We will study the Varney Review, but there is no  expectation that it will challenge the orthodoxy that has governed the  Treasury&rsquo;s approach up to now. Therefore, it appears that the failure of our  efforts to regenerate, broaden, deepen and make the local economy competitive  will continue.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The motion deserves  support. I do not know whether the Alliance Party will respond to Roy  Beggs&rsquo;s amendment. The movers of the motion and the amendment presented  arguments of merit that could be supported. My party supports the motion and  looks forward to the Minister of Finance and Personnel&rsquo;s response. Go raibh  maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: Although it is customary to compliment a Member for moving a  motion, I am reluctant to do so because this debate is artificial, repetitive  and will not add hugely to human wisdom or to the contribution that the  Assembly can make for the betterment of our economy. I support the general  purpose of the motion, as anyone would, but I am not hugely enthusiastic about  its wording.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Neither do I have any great enthusiasm for the amendment.  The views of the SDLP on fiscal measures will  not be limited by the outcome of the Varney Review: the party will  continue to pursue constructive solutions on  fiscal matters that are specific to our situation. There are some good examples of that in relation to  variations that have been achieved on climate change and aggregates  levies. However, I prefer the objective of the motion because of the inclusion  of the phrase &ldquo;and other measures&rdquo;, because it is important to recognise that the betterment of our economy will not be  obtained solely by fiscal means; that  fact has been well recognised. Therefore, the Ulster Unionist Party  should withdraw its amendment, because it does not help the motion. It is  certainly not something on which the SDLP will seek to divide the House; the  addition of a pointless Division to a pointless debate will not contribute  anything. However, the debate will have some significance if the Assembly shows  unity on issues raised in the Varney Review.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">4.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I said previously that I had no great enthusiasm for the  original motion; it is vague on what fiscal reforms and other measures it is  proposing. I am particularly concerned about the phrase &ldquo;a level playing  field&rdquo;, because I do not think that such a concept exists. The business world  here and throughout the world could be better compared to a jungle. The use of  such phrases invokes the idea that there is some sort of deus ex machina that  will solve all our business problems. That view is commonly held, and I detect  some special pleading around the business community and this discussion of our  economy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">All companies &mdash; including what is sometimes referred to as  &ldquo;Northern Ireland plc&rdquo; &mdash; must look for a niches in which they have a  competitive advantage. The ground is always shifting, so companies must be one  step ahead and be ready to move if it seems that their niches might disappear.  The Government have a vital role in creating a favourable environment for  business and in giving direct appropriate assistance, but we cannot expect some magic bullet from the  Government. Success for our businesses will require hard work, initiative and the courage to take risks. The broad  cultural attitude to business is  important, and I am not convinced that  the attitude in our business community is absolutely right; I detect  that from what I hear in the Chamber.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I submitted an  amendment to the motion, the intention of which was to initiate a  discussion on the comments made by the Minister of Finance and Personnel that North/South co-operation is essential for global  success. It also sought to ask the Assembly to consider a recent  proposal by Dr Alan Gillespie, the chairperson of the Ulster Bank, to merge  Invest NI and the Industrial Development Agency Ireland. That proposal appeared  in the &lsquo;The Irish Times&rsquo; on 3 October 2007.  The article not only dealt with that  specific issue but broadly discussed the state of our economy and what  it requires to go in the right direction. It is an important article, and it is  perhaps no harm that my amendment was not selected, because the issue deserves wider debate. In the meantime, I will  circulate the article to all Members, because it is worthy of their study, and  I hope that we will find a methodical way of discussing it.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I support the amendment. I am confused by the text of the original motion, as  were other Members: it is unclear what exactly it is calling for. I share the  concerns of others that it is about the introduction of blanket tax-varying  powers in a somewhat less subtle fashion than the Sinn F&eacute;in motion from a  couple of months ago.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The text of the motion could best be described as na&iuml;ve in  some respects. Anyone who does not appreciate that the global economy is  complex should not be in this Building. Some concentration has been placed on  competing on a level playing field, but one of the complexities of the global  economy is that there is no such thing as a level playing field. One of the problems that comes with globalisation is the  movement of heavy-labour jobs to low-wage economies. I am sure that the  Member who proposed the original motion is not advocating that Northern Ireland should have the same low wages  as China, India or some of the other Far   East economies. The amendment offers more clarity on that  important issue, not least because it puts the debate in context.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A global economy means that Northern Ireland, and other western  economies, cannot now easily compete with low-wage economies for heavy-labour  jobs. Most Members know of towns and villages in their own constituencies &mdash; and  my constituency of Strangford is no different &mdash; where traditional heavy-labour  jobs in textiles and engineering have moved to other parts of the world. That  is a fact of life in the global economy. For a long time, we have been told  that the muscle that we must engage is not in our arms and legs, but between  our ears, and that innovation is the key to competition in a global economy.  However, it is now no longer even as straightforward as that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Low-wage economies such as India  and China  are now investing heavily in education, skills, research and development, and  innovation. India  has around 300 universities and over 15,000 colleges generating 2&middot;5 million  graduates every year, 350,000 of which are in engineering.  That is twice what the USA  produces each year. The OECD recently described China&rsquo;s  investment in research and development as  &ldquo;stunning&rdquo;. The number of researchers in China has increased by 77%, and its  investment in innovation has doubled. China  is now spending more on research and development than countries such as Japan, which  used to be considered to be at the cutting edge.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The DUP has long supported fiscal reforms for Northern Ireland  that can retool our economy and allow us to &mdash; as Roy Beggs said &mdash; compete in  the global economy. There has been an understandable fascination during the  debate with retooling our economy through measures on corporation tax, and the  Varney Report&rsquo;s conclusions are awaited with keen interest. However,  corporation tax itself was never going to be the panacea, or the silver bullet,  for all of our ills. We must not lose sight of the fact that there is much that  the Assembly and the Administration can do to make Northern Ireland competitive, which  does not necessarily require Treasury support or tax incentives &mdash; although both  of those would be helpful. I refer particularly to research and development,  skills, and education in general.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Indeed, whatever the Varney Report states, our economy must have skilled workers in place to  seize the jobs that Northern    Ireland may attract. There is little point  in telling the world that we have a competitive business-tax regime if, when  companies wish to set up here, we do not have the people who are capable of  taking up those high-value jobs.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Our indigenous companies  also need to be supported, and there have been some suggestions that  that could be done by encouraging them to engage in research and development. I  hope that the Programme for Government will  ensure that the economy is at the heart of the Assembly&rsquo;s work. There  are some encouraging signs in our economy,  and it is important that the message that is sent out is upbeat about  our economic prospects. We are seeing growth, not least in financial business  services, tourism and software, in which we are now developing a critical mass  of expertise. The economic future of Northern Ireland is bright,  especially now that we have a locally accountable Administration that can  respond to the needs of our economy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have some sympathy for the comments made by the previous  contributor. However, I welcome this debate and the opportunity that it offers  to once again highlight the important issue of economic development in Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  A LeasCheann Comhairle, go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat. I support the original  motion. The North of Ireland&rsquo;s economic  performance has been &mdash; and continues to be &mdash; poor in comparison to the  rest of Ireland, and  compared to Britain.  The lack of economic development is due to political instability, deep societal  divisions, over 30 years of conflict, and deep patterns of discrimination and  disadvantage.Deeper problems are exacerbated by an artificial border &mdash; the real  cost of division on this island.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The case for fiscal reform in the North of Ireland rests on  the fact that existing policy measures are inadequate. Several economic  challenges have been identified in a report by the Committee on the Preparation  for Government. The local economy has an imbalance when it comes to the  contribution of the public and private sectors to economic activity. Inward  investment is sluggish, the growth of local business is low-key and employment,  with low-paid, low-skilled jobs, is not concentrated around the service sector.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Public spending is responsible for 63% of our gross domestic  product, and although public-sector spending should be maintained,  private-sector growth must be encouraged. Economic output here is about 20%  below the British average and has also been falling steadily behind the  Twenty-six Counties. Low unemployment figures of 4% conceal the fact that the  levels of economic inactivity are far higher. The number of people on  incapacity benefit is 74% higher than the average. There is a clear deficit of  skills, and university graduates continue to leave, exacerbating that deficit.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Something different must be done in order to create a  strong and vibrant economy. Competitive fiscal incentives, alongside other  measures, will encourage investment and growth in foreign direct investment and  SMEs. While there is no doubt that the lowering of corporation tax is important  to the economy, and a level playing field on the island of Ireland would go a  long way towards attracting and sustaining foreign direct investment, we must  do more to deliver investment in people, skills and the infrastructure.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Initiatives such as marketing the island of Ireland to  investors in key areas such as agriculture and tourism, and the opening up of  the debate around the benefits of merging Invest NI with IDA Ireland, would see  a single inward-investment strategy &mdash; a move towards effective marketing.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Other tax reforms, such as targeted tax relief for local  and rural businesses, the manufacturing sector and small and medium-sized  enterprises would be beneficial. A crucial aspect of strengthening enterprise  is the nurturing of new businesses. Part of  that should involve lightening the financial burden on those businesses  during their start-up period, and a system of tax relief for new businesses on  the basis of a compulsory, agreed and accountable action plan, particularly for  those that locate in TSN areas.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Those fiscal freedoms could unlock our potential to set our  own funding priorities. They would also be an essential component in developing  a radical plan of action to tackle deprivation and ensure long-term economic  development.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There are many tough  choices facing us. If there is no move to develop greater fiscal freedom  and strengthen the local economy, there will  be many difficulties ahead. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McQuillan</strong>: The impact of being part of a global economy has been clear to  us all over the past few weeks. Rocketing oil prices and the international  credit crunch arising from loan defaults in the US  housing market are having a knock-on effect across the globe, and we in Northern Ireland  are not immune.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although the &lsquo;Northern Ireland Economic Bulletin&rsquo;,  published at the end of June 2007, highlighted higher-than-ever levels of  employment and a low rate of unemployment, it also pointed to significant areas  of continuing structural weakness in our economy &mdash; lower levels of productivity  than in the UK as a whole, higher levels of economic inactivity and, of course,  the relatively small private sector.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Like all modern,  developed economies, the challenge facing us is to manage the transition  to high-value-added activity and to be competitive locally and, most  importantly, internationally. We need a better-qualified workforce and a re-energised private sector that  embraces innovation and develops a culture of enterprise in our young  people.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Further encouragement in the economic bulletin was in  tourism, where it is recognised that 3&middot;5% gross value added to the economy in  2003 has the potential to grow and improve on the 24,000 jobs already supported  in that sector.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I recognise growing trends in my constituency of East Londonderry, where tourism is such a vital part of  the local economy right across the north coast. Indeed, money invested in  projects to improve the infra&shy;structure for tourism would be a wise investment  and would provide a healthy return in both jobs and economic activity.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, I am not sure that this is the best time to launch a series of fiscal reforms such as those  suggested in the motion. The Executive have been in place only for a  matter of months, and they must concentrate on establishing the scale of the  various economic and policy issues that must be faced, and then prioritise  them. Meanwhile, Members anticipate the publication of Sir David Varney&rsquo;s  report &mdash; particularly its recommendations on corporation tax.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">5.00 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Frequently, during the period of direct rule, business  leaders emphasised the need for political stability. As the business sector  attempts to create new industries and grow existing businesses, the Assembly  must demonstrate a measured and considered approach to the economy that will  inspire confidence. In the coming months, I know that my colleague the Minister  of Enterprise, Trade and Investment will ensure that the economy is at the  forefront of Members&rsquo; minds.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is premature to talk of fiscal reforms before examining  and prioritising the range of issues that we face. I support the amendment.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>: The  motion is well intentioned, but it provides no clear vision of a way forward.  Members are aware of the term &ldquo;global economy&rdquo;, but do we fully understand its  implications? There has never been a global economy before. The closest example  might be the Marshall Plan of 1947, which few Members would remember. Following  the destruction of Europe in the Second World  War, that plan was an attempt to create a more balanced international economy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members have seen what a market economy can do to encourage  growth, particularly over the past two decades, when people witnessed perhaps  the greatest ever increase in living standards. That is the success of globalisation, which amounts to an economic  revolution. With it, however, come significant risks.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Much of the world&rsquo;s manufacturing industry has gone to China and the Far East.  It is estimated that China&rsquo;s  exports account for 70% of the world&rsquo;s GDP. Members have referred to the  wording of the motion. That is an illustration of how Northern Ireland can never compete on a level  playing field with low-wage economies such as China,  India and other Far East countries. We  must accept that reality and fundamentally reappraise our economy and  its future.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members have referred to the large amount of work was  carried out in the past year by the Subgroup on the Economic Challenges facing Northern Ireland.  The reports that that subgroup produced still make good sense and should be implemented.  The Varney Review is about to publish its report, and it may contain good news  about corporation tax. More likely than not, it will be unhelpful. In any event, we must move forward.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Closing the gap in living standards with the rest of the United Kingdom and the Republic  of Ireland is a key challenge for Northern Ireland.  In order to do that, there must be a major increase in productivity,  performance and economic growth, and that growth must be geared towards export  markets.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The United    Kingdom Government have a policy that is  designed to achieve economic convergence in the regions. That has not worked  and must be revisited. In a fiscal union such as the UK, a one-size-fits-all policy  operates, and devolution has made little difference. The Treasury must address  the failure of that policy. It seems to be content to continue to subsidise  regions that are in deficit, such as Northern Ireland, at the rate of &pound;6  billion to &pound;7 billion per annum, instead of allowing additional policy  flexibility or fiscal autonomy. Only three of the 12 UK regions operate at a surplus.  The other nine spend &pound;60 billion more than they pay in taxes.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As part of a competitive fiscal framework, more mundane  issues must also be addressed. Research and development credits must be  enhanced to raise the low level of business R&amp;D in Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Fuel excise duty is a major problem, and the large  disparity between Northern Ireland  and the Republic   of Ireland has encouraged  crime, harmed commerce, deprived the  Exchequer of many millions of pounds and is a source of revenue for  organised crime.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Capping industrial rates would help existing manufacturing  businesses, and a highly-educated and skills-based pool of workers is required  in order to attract foreign direct investment. To create a world-class economy  in Northern Ireland, entrepreneurs, inventors, financial services,  technologies, transfer processes, venture capitalists, higher and further  education, the universities, and the IT and software sectors must be brought  together.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We need the full support of HM Treasury to provide a competitive fiscal framework for business in Northern    Ireland, and that is why I support the amendment.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Robinson</strong>:  All Members must acknowledge that Northern   Ireland is at a major disadvantage in comparison with the  rest of the United Kingdom  and Europe due to its peripheral location. That location  means that businesses here must pay a higher tariff for the electricity  they depend upon to produce goods, because the fuel for the generating stations  must be imported.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Also, our employment base seems to be anchored in the  public sector; and the difference between the rates of corporation tax in Northern Ireland  and in the South does us no favours when  trying to attract investment from global  companies and puts us at a distinct disadvantage.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, Northern Ireland  has some positive features, the main  one being this Assembly. The political stability that was brought about  through the strong leadership of the DUP sees Northern Ireland enjoying a global  good-will factor that we must capitalise on fully.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We have an opportunity to attract employers who will bring  well-paid jobs to Northern Ireland;  reduce our labour market dependence on the public sector, and become a  wealth-creating part of the United    Kingdom. To do that, we must ensure that our  workforce has the skills to fill all  employment opportunities, whether they are in research and development,  tourism or finance.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, some areas of fiscal reform contain policy matters  that the Assembly cannot control. The main issue is the difference in the rate  of corporation tax between Northern    Ireland and the South. Considering the  South, statistics show that the low rate of corporation tax has helped the  Government there to attract high-productivity businesses, for example, in the  chemical, electronics and IT sectors.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We want and need those types of industries to be  established in Northern    Ireland. We want them for the employment and  the opportunities they provide, especially for our young graduates, many of  whom have to leave their home soil.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We must also remember those who do not have the opportunity  to enter third-level education. According to reports, 25% of the adult  population of Northern    Ireland have a literacy or numeracy skills  deficit, which undoubtedly contributes to the 27% figure for economic  inactivity. Therefore, it is essential that fiscal reform must incorporate the  direction of moneys to help people obtain essential skills for a marketplace  increasingly dominated by global, transnational companies that demand the  highest skill levels from their employees. It is also essential that programmes  that aid people to retrain or obtain new qualifications at all stages in life  are maintained.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Northern    Ireland may have an education system that is  the envy of many countries, but with one quarter of our population having  difficulty with the basics, we must remain aware of the need to address  problems with literacy and numeracy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, it is necessary to ensure that our  infrastructure is up to the standard that transnational companies expect. The  road network has some clearly identified weak spots, such as the A26 Belfast to  Coleraine corridor, the A8 from Belfast  to Larne and the A4 from the M1 to Enniskillen, all of which allow access to  those areas of the Province and provide cross-border links.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Upgrades to the rail network are required, and the lines  from Belfast to Londonderry, Dublin and Larne all require investment.  There should be stops at Aldergrove and Eglinton airports to facilitate  business and tourist traffic. Those are just  some items that a fiscal reform project must examine for the development  of Northern Ireland plc.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">For Northern    Ireland to benefit fully from fiscal reform,  we must work with the Westminster Govern&shy;ment to seek funding levels that will  allow us to take advantage of the present  global good will. I mentioned a few  areas in which we can make Northern Ireland a more appealing place for investors. I support the  amendment.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel (Mr P Robinson)</strong>: I have listened with great interest  to the debate, and it is clear to me that the days of ducking and weaving have  gone, and that the days of hiding behind NIO Ministers are over. The time for  mature politics has clearly arrived. Every Minister in the Executive and every  Member of the Assembly will have to avoid the routine of political adolescence,  which allows calls for more resources without coming clean and acknowledging  that that will either require higher local taxation or the reduction of  resources elsewhere. The test for the Assembly will be found in its willingness  to confront those hard decisions in the coming months and years.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The challenges and threats posed by the global economy have  been acknowledged for some time. The Chancellor highlighted last week in his  pre-Budget statement the importance of  improving UK competitive&shy;ness,  and that applies ever more so to Northern Ireland. With GVA per capita in Northern   Ireland lagging behind the UK average by  some 20 percentage points, there must be a concerted effort to improve our  international competitiveness.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The key issue for the Executive now is to ensure that it  creates a policy environment that will facilitate economic growth and development in Northern Ireland. That  growth and development will be achieved only by delivering the 2015 economic  vision of an outward-looking, export-orientated, innovative, wealth-generating  economy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A domestic market of 1&middot;7 million is not alone going to  provide the basis for higher growth and productivity. Our private sector, with  a few notable exceptions, is too insular and reliant on local demand. That has  to change. How can we effect such change?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Clearly the Executive will have an opportunity to create an  environment that is conducive to economic growth. We need to encourage those  sectors and activities that can provide a foundation to compete  internationally. That means assisting those individuals and companies who are  enterprising and innovative and who have skills and talents that are valuable  in a global context; and providing an environment that is attractive as an  investment location, with quality infrastructure such as good transport,  energy, and communications systems.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The draft Budget that the Executive will shortly issue for  public consultation will highlight our commitment to growing the economy. I  make that commitment in an environment of ever-tightening public expenditure  resources because I believe that a strong and vibrant economy offers the best  prospect for enhancing wealth and living standards for all the people of Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive will obviously consider all proposals that  offer the prospect of additional resources, but Members need to appreciate the  limited room to manoeuvre that a devolved Administration has when working  within the framework of the Treasury&rsquo;s statement of funding policy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Fiscal policy remains a reserved matter for deter&shy;mination  solely by the Chancellor. He jealously guards that  role, and the level of tax revenue is closely monitored to ensure that  the stability of the UK  fiscal regime &mdash; including the so-called golden rule &mdash; is maintained.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A number of Members have referred to the Varney Review. The  Executive has presented a robust case to Sir David Varney, calling for a  corporation tax dis&shy;pensation for Northern Ireland,  which would indisputably transform the attractiveness of the region as a  place in which to invest.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I understand that Sir David Varney is expected to release  his report in the coming weeks. I have not seen any of the emerging findings,  but the concerns that the Treasury will have on issues such as repercussiveness  and revenue loss should not be underestimated.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If it is any guide to Members, I can say that I have a feeling that there are suggestions that the  Varney Report will be more concerned with analysis than recom&shy;mendations.  I also believe that Sir David Varney is likely to leave it to the Chancellor to  respond, based on the economic assessment that he has made. Time, of course,  will tell.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There are some, limited, policy levers that the Executive can use to generate resources for  deployment in the Budget process. Determination of rates and water  charges resides with the Executive. Obviously, a balance needs to be achieved  as to what people can afford and what is fair on both issues.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">5.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members will be aware of the release last Friday of the  Independent Water Review Panel&rsquo;s report. It covers some complex issues, and I will consider its implications with  my Executive colleagues over the next few days. As with many other financial  issues, there is a need to adopt a balanced approach in that area.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members have debated the need for fiscal powers, but we  need to appreciate that they represent a double-edged sword. Increasing the tax  take in Northern Ireland  would generate additional public expenditure, but possibly at the expense of  constraining regional competitiveness, making this a high-cost region for  companies to operate in. Alternatively, we might decide to lower rates and  water charges, but that would reduce available public expenditure, impacting  directly on public services for which many Members have lobbied vociferously.  Perhaps some Members think that HM Treasury will provide the additional  funding, but with a regional fiscal deficit of somewhere between &pound;7 billion and  &pound;8 billion, I do not think that there is much hope for help from that quarter.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Let me turn to some of the specific comments made by  Members. The proposer of the motion indicated that it was his purpose to keep the spotlight on the economy. That is  a worthy purpose, and he set out with the best and most altruistic of motives.  However, I think that other events today may have dimmed that spotlight a  little. I suspect that the &lsquo;Belfast Telegraph&rsquo; has not held its front page for  the outcome of this debate. Never&shy;theless, he rightly indicated the importance  of strengthening the private sector and redressing the imbalance that exists  between public and private sectors. That must be a key consideration in the  policies advocated and implemented by the Executive.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Neeson and a number of other colleagues referred to  industrial derating. I will say a word about that. The Economic Research  Institute of Northern Ireland (ERINI) is finalising its report on industrial  derating. I have some knowledge of the conclusions that it is moving towards;  however, the institute has still some macroeconomic analysis to carry out. I  hope that that report will be published before too long, and that the Committee  for Finance and Personnel will consider its contents.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, I have made it clear elsewhere that I accept the  strong arguments that are being put forward in relation to the level of  industrial rates. I recognise that there would be some contradiction if, on the  one hand, we wanted economic growth and sought to encourage industry in Northern Ireland,  while at the same time laying a heavy burden upon it. Those issues will have to  be considered by the Executive, and I hope to make a statement on that subject  to the House within the next month or so.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member for East Antrim Mr Beggs made some comments  about what he considered to be the inadequacy of the wording of the original  motion. For many Members, there is much agreement on the general issues  relating to the economy. There is an agreed analysis of where our economy  stands, what needs to be done and what the drivers are. I could support either  Mr Beggs&rsquo;s amendment or the motion. The proposers of both want the same thing.  However, the amendment will be taken first and, if it is made, the other choice  will not fall to us.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Beggs made specific reference to the Varney Review. I  have touched on my early feeling for what the eventual shape of that report  might be. Mr Beggs and others indicated that they are not exactly holding their  breath for the answers to our economic questions to come out of the Varney  Review.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">At any rate, Members must recognise that the report itself  will not be the key element but the consideration and decisions that fall to  the Treasury as a result of Varney&rsquo;s  findings. Of course, as the amendment suggests, the Executive want to  work with the Treasury on the outcomes of the Varney review.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member for East Antrim Roy Beggs also raised the issue of small-business rate relief. During a  previous Question Time, I believe that I told the Assembly that I had  asked ERINI to consider the matter of small-business rate relief. It will do so  when its current consideration of other rate matters has concluded. How&shy;ever,  it will probably be further down the line before that work is completed. We are  all mindful of the important role that  small business plays in Northern Ireland. Although a recent ERINI report suggested that  business costs in the region are not uncompetitive with those of other UK regions, it  is a concern that the Chancellor&rsquo;s  proposals on business taxes appear to hinder small businesses  disproportionately. Small businesses in Northern Ireland make up a  considerable part of the economy, so that will have a detrimental effect. I  will highlight that matter and express the Assembly&rsquo;s concern in my engagements  with Treasury Ministers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Deputy Chairman of the Committee, Mr Storey,  appropriately reminded the House of the loss of our former colleague, Mr George  Dawson. Mr Dawson made many contributions to economic debates, which, I am  sure, are missed by all Members. I certainly miss his wise counsel.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Storey also mentioned the role of Wrightbus Ltd in his  constituency &mdash; I am not sure whether that was advertising. Having visited its  plant in North Antrim, I am convinced that the  business has considerable export potential. Indeed, its StreetCars can be seen  in Chicago and elsewhere around the world. That is exactly  the kind of business that can lift the Northern Ireland economy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Storey also referred to the need to stimulate the  economy, and pointed to corporation-tax reduction as being one of the  mechanisms for doing so. I have consistently warned the House that, although  the lowering of corporation tax would be a step change that would significantly  encourage economic growth, other mechanisms could be used that may not have  such an immediate or powerful effect but that would, nonetheless, be useful. As  some of his colleagues have indicated, the Assembly has the power to take  certain steps in order to stimulate the economy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Chairman of the Committee, Mr Mitchel McLaughlin, referred to economic forecasts. He is  correct: the economic forecast until 2015 shows only marginal economic  improvement in GVA per capita. However, he and I will agree that that is a  reflection of the direct-rule policy framework, which the Executive and  Assembly are keen to leave behind. I confidently expect the Executive to set  more ambitious targets. If they are not, I am pretty sure that the Chairman and  his Committee would ask why. Therefore, we must ensure that the policy delivers  those material improvements, which I hope will start with the Budget, the  Programme for Government and the investment strategy for Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Moreover, the Chairman also expressed some doubts, which, I  suppose &mdash; in a quiet moment &mdash; I would share, about the extent to which Sir  David Varney might separate himself from some of the thinking that has been a  pattern in the past. However, we shall have to wait and see.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member for North Antrim Mr Declan O&rsquo;Loan referred to  the fact that our economy can grow by other than fiscal means. There are a  whole range of mechanisms that can be employed by the Executive. I take, very  strongly, the point made by Mr George Robinson that there is a feel-good factor.  However, I warn everyone that the window for a feel-good factor &mdash; as regards to Northern Ireland &mdash; does  not stay open for long, especially in a global economy. Therefore, it is essential that we make full use, and take real  advantage, of that window while it is open.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member for North Antrim urged me to endorse the policy  of merging the IDA and Invest Northern Ireland. He will not be surprised  that I do not jump to take him up on his suggestion. Leaving aside the  political issues involved, there are a number of other matters that I ask the  Member to consider. We have talked about some of those differences during the  debate. The Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland have different tax  regimes. There are different accountability processes, different legal remits,  and different funding sources. We need to remember that we are often in  competition.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As I said week before last to the Irish Taxation Institute,  there is much advantage in greater collaboration and co-operation with the Republic of Ireland in economic matters. However, we  should remember that, in many cases, we will be seeking the same jobs and the  same type of development. Nevertheless, there will be occasions when working in  collaboration with the Irish   Republic will be to our  mutual advantage. We do not want to miss out on that.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>: I am short of time, so please forgive me for not giving way. I want to try to cover everyone&rsquo;s  contributions to the debate, as far as time allows me.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member for Strangford Mr Simon Hamilton referred to the  drivers of growth in our economy &mdash; skills, innovation, enterprise and  infrastructure. He is absolutely right. They go to the heart of our ability to  compete in the global economy. He, too, warned that we should not put all of  our eggs in the one basket and wait for them to be delivered as part of the  Varney Review. There is a lot that we can do for ourselves. That must be the  important role that the Executive and their Ministers play.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McCann gave an accurate analysis of the present economic  situation in Northern    Ireland. He, properly, drew attention to the  need to increase the role of the private sector. He said, rightly, that the  Assembly needs to do something different. If we continue to do what the direct  rule administration did in the past, we can expect the same results. That is  why we must consider more radical ways of  dealing with those issues. I hope that we will see that in the weeks to  come.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McQuillan also referred to the North/South economic issue. I say to him that we in Northern Ireland  can have the best of both worlds. We are an integral part of the United Kingdom  and of its economy. At the same time, we can take the advantages of the  North/South economy. If we can get the best of both worlds, we should by all  means do so. In my own community &mdash; the unionist community &mdash; there exists  sufficient confidence to take full advantage of that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Adrian McQuillan referred to the views of business  leaders, particularly, as regards corporation tax. He felt that it was too  early to talk about fiscal reforms before the Executive&rsquo;s trajectory had been  set. The Executive&rsquo;s policy must be unveiled. We must see the direction that  the Executive takes before we begin to look at some of the wider issues that  might come under the heading of fiscal reform.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">5.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Cree made a very worthwhile speech in which he talked  about low-wage economies elsewhere in the world.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Will the Minister draw his remarks to a close?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  I will.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Cree also mentioned the need to find our own niche  market to help the Treasury to create a competitive economy in Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I trust that Members will continue to remain focused on the  economy in Northern Ireland.  Over the next few weeks, the Executive will certainly give Members  opportunities to debate the matter further.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I  again thank Mr Neeson for bringing the motion to the House. As we move towards  the Budget process, it is important that this issue remains foremost in our  minds. However, it is regrettable that Mr Neeson once again advocated  tax-varying powers. I remind Members that nearly every time that that term is  used, tax-raising powers are often meant. For that reason, I will stick with my  amendment, and I hope that the House will support it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Mervyn Storey noted  that the Scottish Parliament has wisely chosen not to use its  tax-varying powers because of its fear of the implications that they may have on the Scottish economy. I welcome his  recognition of the importance of the word &ldquo;competitive&rdquo; in my amendment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mitchel McLaughlin highlighted the poor projected growth in  our economy that past direct rule administrators set out. There is an obvious  need to improve that situation and to introduce changes to enable such an  improvement.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Given that Declan O&rsquo;Loan had no enthusiasm for the motion  or the amendment, it is disappointing that he did not table an amendment  himself. Should any Members find themselves in that situation in future, I  advocate that they consider tabling an amendment.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  did table an amendment, but unfortunately it did not appear on the Marshalled  List.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  Fortunately, the Member did not table a competent amendment. <em>[Laughter.]</em></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">He advocated merging Invest NI and the IDA, but he did not  explain how that would bring about the supposed miraculous change. His argument  seems to be stuck in the North/South, all-Ireland agenda, and he does not  appreciate the risks and dangers that could arise were companies to experience  the tax advantages of another jurisdiction. In fact, some of the companies that  could have chosen to come to Northern    Ireland could relocate elsewhere.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Like myself, Simon Hamilton recognised the lack of clarity  in the motion and the confusion about the meaning of the expression &ldquo;level  playing field&rdquo;. He highlighted the importance of the economy&rsquo;s being at the  heart of the Programme for Government. I am sure that we all look forward to  learning more about the final shape of the Programme for Government.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Fra McCann highlighted the fact that the level of  incapacity benefit in Northern    Ireland is 74% higher than average; however,  he then advocated supporting the motion rather than the amendment. The proposer  of the motion advocates tax-raising powers that will make it more difficult for  people on incapacity benefit to return to work. Thus, there is some  inconsistency in Mr McCann&rsquo;s comments. I imagine that he also predictably  believes that our problems would be miraculously solved should the IDA and  Invest NI merge. Again, however, I did not hear any facts to support that  argument.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My colleague Leslie Cree spoke of the global economy, and  it suddenly struck me how much the economy has changed in recent years. There  is much more world trade and freedom to trade throughout the world than ever  before, and we can all take cognisance of that. Mr Cree also highlighted the  challenge to the Treasury. Either it will allow devolved regions such as ours  the freedom to compete more successfully, or three regions of the United  Kingdom will continue to subsidise the other nine, as presently occurs.  However, we hope that we will be able to create a more sustainable Northern Ireland  ourselves and that subsidisation will not remain forever.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">George Robinson highlighted the fact that lower corporation tax levels had attracted high-value  industry, high levels of productivity  and foreign direct investment to the Republic of Ireland.  I am sure that we all wish that we could attract additional spending here.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Minister of Finance and Personnel for attending  the debate and giving us his insight. Like him, I look forward to seeing the  detail of the Varney Review. I appreciate his comment that it may well be the  Chancellor or the Prime Minister from whom we will subsequently eagerly wish to  hear. I hope that Members will support the amendment, as I believe that it  proposes better solutions for Northern    Ireland&rsquo;s economy than does the original  motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  Discussions of the economy have been rare in this Chamber over the six months  since devolution, which may be surprising, given the importance accorded to it  by so many parties, and indeed, the Minister of Finance and Personnel. I hope  that this debate has gone some way to addressing that imbalance. It is not  without significance that a special subgroup was set up alongside the Committee  on the Preparation for Government this time last year to examine the economy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">To set the debate in context, the local economy is  improving and there have been very respectable levels of growth over the past  decade. The current rate of unemployment is as low as it has been for 40 years,  and there are tangible signs of growing wealth across society. There are signs  of increased investment, and there is no doubt that there has been a peace  dividend.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Nevertheless, as other Members have said, there are major  structural problems in our economy that must be addressed. Overall, our economy  is too small, and on a per capita basis, compared with the Republic of Ireland,  we are well behind. At an incredibly high and unsustainable 71% of GDP, our public  sector is too large and is well out of line with all the other regions of the UK and other  European Union countries. A very interesting table in &lsquo;The Times&rsquo; last Thursday  set out all those figures in some detail.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Our public sector has been badly distorted by the legacies  of conflict and division, and we have a very small domestic market. Northern Ireland&rsquo;s huge subvention from the UK  Treasury currently stands at over &pound;7 billion; over 40% of public spending in Northern Ireland  depends on money that is raised elsewhere. The level of economic inactivity  stands at an unsustainable 26%, which, again, is well out of line with other  regions of the UK.  Although there has been growth in recent years, it has tended to be in  low-added-value jobs and low-added-value investment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The fundamental problem was set out by Mitchel McLaughlin: the lack of convergence of Northern Ireland with the rest of the UK economy. Our  GVA per capita is around 80% of the UK average. Indeed, it is well  short of the GVA of the Republic   of Ireland. As Leslie  Cree said, the British Government are committed to regional convergence, but  more in theory than in practice. There is a &ldquo;one size fits all&rdquo; approach that  allows nothing to jeopardise the status of London  and the south-east of England  as the main drivers of the UK  economy. My party believes that the British Government are happy to leave the  regions of the UK financially dependent, rather than give us the powers to  compete on a more level playing field. That would allow us to address social  and environmental problems more effectively.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The current capacity of the Assembly permits us to examine issues such as infrastructure, skills  improvement, the encouragement of enterprise and entrepreneurship, and  the promotion of research and development. As Mr Hamilton said, those are the  drivers of the economy that we can control.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The draft regional economic strategy, which was a legacy of  direct rule, did not foresee any meaningful convergence of our GVA with the UK average  based on the powers that we have.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I appreciate that the Minister of Finance and Personnel  will bring forward a comprehensive spending review, and he has already told the  House that that will include a revised regional economic strategy. However,  without fiscal powers, I am not entirely sure how those underlying predictions  can be any different on any tangible and real basis.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Fiscal powers will provide a greater capacity to attract  high-value investment, high-value well-paid jobs, to grow the local tax base  and to make the local economy more sustainable. Fiscal powers do not relate  solely to corporation tax; they might also include powers such as research and  development tax credits, &mdash; which, admittedly, have not been taken up as  effectively as was hoped &mdash; fuel excise duty, climate-change levy and also the  concept of enterprise zones. Members have also referred to industrial derating,  which could also be part of fiscal reforms. If the Assembly were to have fiscal  responsibility for tax-varying powers, it could consider other taxation  policies. For example, it might wish to raise green taxes that would allow the  regional rate to be lowered. That could be done on a tax-neutral basis.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The problem with the amendment is that it restricts the  issue of fiscal reform to the Varney framework and, as Sean Neeson and Declan  O&rsquo;Loan said, much more can be done outside the context of corporation tax.  Tax-varying powers are a prerequisite if the Assembly is to have the ability to  vary corporation tax.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: Will the Member recognise that the Varney Review entails much  more than just corporation tax? It will consider R&amp;D tax credits and  capital-investment tax advantages. The review will address more than  corporation tax.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: Although that is factually true, Mr Beggs, on the one hand, states his party&rsquo;s support for  corporation tax and, on the other hand, rubbishes tax-varying powers.  How does he envisage that the Assembly will exercise its ability to vary  corporation tax? The Azores ruling is clear; the Assembly will have to take on  the power to vary tax in order to deliver a differential rate of corporation tax from the rest of the United Kingdom.  That would lead to a loss of revenue, which would need to be made up from local  expenditure. The issue is becoming rather confused; some people say that they  want corporation tax but are against tax-varying powers. Such a position does  not add up. To be straight about the matter: if we want a differential rate of  corporation tax for Northern    Ireland, we must support tax-varying powers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Tax-varying powers can mean higher taxes; equally, they can  mean lower taxes. Taxes can be lowered with the  acceptance that there is less money to spend on public services. As an  Assembly, we may wish to make that choice in order to encourage growth in the  short term, rather than investing in public  services. That is perfectly fine.  Equally, tax-varying powers can produce a tax-neutral outcome. The  Assembly may wish to increase green taxes and lower the regional rate. That  would be an example of using fiscal powers for a good outcome.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I echo the contribution that was made by the late George  Dawson on this subject, and I pay tribute to his economic knowledge. Mr Storey  and Mr McQuillan took a conservative approach; they seemed to want to put off  the Assembly&rsquo;s setting its stall out for an economic vision of what must be  achieved in society. I found that disappointing.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McLaughlin set out the one-size-fits-all approach of the  British Government, which is to the detriment of Northern Ireland. I am surprised at  Mr O&rsquo;Loan&rsquo;s lack of enthusiasm, given that he is usually enthusiastic on such  matters. He would recognise that the Assembly must discuss the economy much  more.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Hamilton and Mr Cree both talked about globalisation and  the importance of competing on the basis of  high wages, not low wages. I have no argument with that. For Mr Cree&rsquo;s  benefit, the Marshall Plan was not a precursor to a global economy on today&rsquo;s  scale. The Marshall Plan was about creating political stability in Europe and  creating a market for US exports. How&shy;ever, the Marshall Plan took place, not in an open  world economy, but in very much a closed world economy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Perhaps the best comparison is with what happened between  1870 and 1914, a period sadly ended by the outbreak of the First World War.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">5.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">These are interesting times as the Assembly awaits the  results of the Varney Review. I appreciate the scepticism that many Members  expressed about the outcome of that review. However, it is incumbent on us, as  an Assembly, to challenge that outcome and any further statement by the  Chancellor, should either be disappointing. The Assembly must have fiscal  powers in order to make a step change to the economy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I appreciate the spirit of the amendment, and the Alliance  Party will not force a Division on it. It is important that the Assembly sends  out a united message, albeit that the amendment is somewhat deficient. A united  voice from the Chamber would be most helpful to the interests of the economy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText"><em>Question, </em>That the amendment be made, <em>put and  agreed to.</em></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText"><em>Main Question, as amended,</em> <span class="B3BodyTextItalicChar"><span style="font-size:11.0pt; ">put and agreed to.</span></span></p>

	      <p class="B3BodyText"><em>Motion made:</em></p>

	      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="5"></a>Adjournment</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Traffic-calming Requirements at Loughview Primary School  and Nursery</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Business Committee has agreed to introduce limits on speaking  times for Adjournment debates. The proposer will have 10 minutes and other  Members will have approximately five minutes, depending on how many wish to  speak.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr McDonnell</strong>: I will be brief, and I hope not to take the full 10 minutes,  but thank you for the kind offer.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The main reason for seeking today&rsquo;s Adjournment debate is  that I was approached by several of my constituents, who are parents of  children attending Loughview   Integrated Primary    School. There are serious road-safety problems in  the area, and parents are extremely worried that a major accident is waiting to  happen. An accident could easily occur and cause serious injury to one of their  children &mdash; or, God forbid, even worse. Thank God that there has been no serious  accident so far, but anyone who has surveyed the road layout around the school  would realise how dangerous it is.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Most of my colleagues have seen the area, but I will  briefly describe it for those who have not. Some 10 or 15 years ago, the area was rural, but it is now becoming  urbanised. However, the contour of a narrow country road remains and carries  heavy urban traffic. The school is on Church    Road in Castlereagh, which is not far from  Stormont and close to the boundary between the South Belfast and East Belfast constituencies. It is a highly successful  school with a wide catchment area, and it attracts children from both  constituencies.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the past decade, the school has grown immensely from a  small base of 26 pupils in 1993 to a 2007 enrolment of some 435 children. The  grounds at the side of the school include a well-spaced turning circle off the  main road. It can accommodate buses and some limited short-stay parking areas  for parents to drop off or pick up their children.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A few children arrive on foot, but the vast majority arrive by bus or car. That generates a massive  additional amount of traffic in the  area and on the adjacent Church Road during school starting and finishing times. As  Members can imagine, it takes many cars and a few buses to transport 435  children. It is almost too dangerous for children to arrive on foot. I plead  with the Minister to try urgently to create the circumstances whereby children  living in the vicinity or within half a mile of the school can access it on  foot.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the immediate  vicinity of the school, there are two day-care  facilities that double up as after-school facilities.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">One of those, the Learning Tree, has a roll of over 120  children. The other day-care facility is in the Orange Hall, and over 50  children attend. Both are situated about 30 or 40 yards away from the school,  so that creates a complex that is attended by 600 to 650 children every day. In  addition, Castlereagh Borough Council&rsquo;s Henry Jones memorial playing fields are  opposite the school, so it is a busy junction when the school and the playing  fields are in operation. I repeat my earlier point that Loughview  Integrated Primary   School is on a narrow, winding, country road, close to the  junction of Church Road  and Manse Road,  and about half a mile from Lagan   College. It is situated  between two bad bends, where the road rises and there is no footpath, so all  the hazards are present.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A few hundred yards away, a 30 mph speed limit is in place, where the Church Road meets the Ballygowan Road, near the junction with Upper Newtownbreda Road. A 40 mph speed  limit is in place about half a mile on the other side of the school, from Manse Road to  Garland Green at Four Winds, to facilitate children going to Lagan College.  However, the speed limit for the stretch of road in between, which is the vital  part of road for Loughview   Integrated Primary    School, is 60 mph. Even if the road were clear  and there were no children around, traffic travelling at 60 mph would be at  risk of having an accident due to the poor road conditions. Thank God, there  has never been a serious accident involving a child, and I pray that there  never will be. We should not wait until an accident happens &mdash; we must do  everything in our power to ensure that the circumstances for an accident are  avoided before they arise. Parents are worried, and they are right to be.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I reiterate the risks: there is no footpath in the vicinity  of the school, which is located on a hill between two bends, on a narrow road.  Between 600 and 650 children attend the complex every day; and the Henry Jones  memorial playing fields are located across the road, adding to traffic entering  and leaving the school at particular times. Like the parents, I am concerned  that cars and lorries travel along the road with impunity at speeds of up to 60  mph.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As winter approaches, there is always the added risk of a  slippery road surface caused by falling leaves or ice. A long-term solution is  necessary, but that would require discussions with the school principal, the  board of governors, the parents, and  everyone else concerned. The road may need to be widened and the bad  bends removed, but that would entail cutting into approx&shy;imately 20 ft of the  Henry Jones memorial playing fields. Such  measures would take a long time; however, in the short term, the speed  limit on the road must be reduced to 30 mph, or, preferably, 20 mph, in the  immediate vicinity of the school. That limit must be introduced as soon as  possible. In fact, I would go further and say that perhaps we should look at  other schools in similar circumstances and take &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  Does the Member recall that when members of Castlereagh Borough Council lodged  objections to the location of Lagan College and of Loughview Integrated   Primary School, we were  accused of sectarianism? We said that the locations were unsuitable because the  roads infrastructure was hazardous. Improvements costing hundreds of thousands  of pounds have now been made to Lagan   College. Pavements have  been laid, trees have been removed, and a road widening scheme has been  introduced. Surely it is unfair that the integrated sector gets the schools  where it wants them &mdash; in very unsuitable areas &mdash; and, when those have bedded  down, looks for money to improve the neighbouring roads, which was the very  reason we objected to the location of the schools in the first place.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr McDonnell</strong>:  I am happy to debate all aspects of education with the Member on another  occasion. However, we are where we are. Fourteen years ago the school was  located there. It now has 450 pupils, with around 170 children also attending  nursery and after-school facilities nearby. I was not privy to any of the decisions  that were made in 1993; therefore, I can consider only the current situation.  The school has proven itself and is one of the biggest in the area, so it must  be doing something right. Credit for that success must go its principal, the  board of governors and the parents. I am all in favour of parental choice, and  parents are voting for that school with their feet.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Whether the school should be moved is a moot point. It  would be cheaper, and simpler, to widen the road and erect some speed-limit  signs rather than relocate the school. Although I specifically mention the  speed limit, we must ensure that there is a general improvement in safety  outside schools, and we must do that by looking at all schools. Safety outside  many schools is very good, but there are some outside which it could be  improved. Other traffic-calming solutions may exist, and I compliment the  Minister for Regional Development, his Department and Roads Service on their  contribution to finding some ingenious solutions. I urge the Minister to do  everything possible to make Loughview   Integrated Primary    School and its nursery school a safe place for  its pupils to attend.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Spratt</strong>:  As a Member for South Belfast, I am speaking on the issue because several of my  constituents have contacted me about it. However, the matter concerns  the constituency of East Belfast, and I know  that its local Member of Parliament has, on a number of occasions, raised  issues concerning the school. A little bit of me &mdash; the cynical part &mdash; suspects  that the reason why the Assembly is debating Loughview Integrated   Primary School is that Dr  McDonnell thought that there might be a general election campaign under way.  Many of the parents of children at that school come from South   Belfast, where he would be fighting for his political survival, so  he may have thought the school would have been a good topic to debate.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr McDonnell</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. The Member should not be allowed to  make those accusations and degrade what is a sensible and intelligent debate  about school safety.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: That is not a point of order. Mr Spratt, you may continue.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Spratt</strong>: I  stand by the point that I made. That said, I support the parents&rsquo; campaign,  because the road in question is very dangerous and its safety has been debated  for a number of years. I can speak with some authority on the issue, because I  am a councillor for the area concerned. I know that the issue has been raised  on many occasions, including in meetings of Castlereagh Borough Council. Every  party on the council has raised the problems that are associated with the road  over a number of years.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As Dr McDonnell mentioned, Church Road is a rural road that must  cope with a great deal of traffic. He also mentioned the car park at the Henry  Jones memorial playing fields, which belongs to Castlereagh Borough Council and  is used by parents of pupils at the school in the morning, at lunchtime and in  the afternoon during the week.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That car park was not open on Friday morning for some  reason, and one of the parents told me that that created a lot of problems  because cars were parked everywhere. It is a dangerous area, as Dr McDonnell  said, but that matter has been raised before over the past several years &mdash; as I  am sure the Minister will confirm. The Roads Service has examined the matter,  and I hope that the Minister can confirm that some traffic-calming measures  will be put in place. There is a need for more traffic-calming measures around  the school, and I hope that the Minister can inform the House that road surveys  have been carried out, because the road in question is dangerous, with a  considerable amount of traffic, particularly at busy times when the school and  the two playschools are operating.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">6.00 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The need for traffic-calming requirements in that area has  been raised on a number of occasions with the Roads Service district manager.  He briefs Castlereagh Borough Council every three months, and I have been  present at council meetings when members from all political parties have  supported the taking of additional measures in the area of Loughview Primary School.  There is no doubt that a footpath would be helpful, because children, some of  whom are very small, have to walk 60 or 70 yards from the school to the car  park at the Henry Jones playing fields. That is dangerous. Flashing lights have  been fitted, but no speed limit is currently  enforced in that area. A Presbyterian church, its car park and hall are also beside the school.  Occasionally, there is a funeral or a wedding at the church during the  day, and that increases the traffic in the area.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As Dr McDonnell said, no one has been injured thus far &mdash;  thankfully &mdash; but a number of minor accidents have taken place, and some folks  have told me that there have been many near misses. It is right that the parents  have raised this issue, and I know that they have raised it with the school  principal, the parents&rsquo; council and the board of governors. There has been a  concerted campaign to do something about this matter.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I urge the Minister to have his officials examine the  traffic situation around Loughview   Primary School in  particular, and to see what additional measures can be put in place to  alleviate the problems that are affecting small children who are going to and  from school. I support any action that will  be taken to address this issue.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.  I support the comments that have been made. Regardless of motivations,  concerns or objections, I commend Alasdair McDonnell for securing this debate.  I commend the parents and the representatives of the school who have long been  determined to raise the issue of traffic management around the school, bearing  in mind the danger to the children.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Like the previous two contributors, I am thankful that no  children have been injured as the result of any accidents. However, there is a  chaotic traffic situation in close proximity to Loughview Integrated Primary  School, and, as Alasdair McDonnell said, the Learning Tree day-care facility  and the Young Ones nursery are alongside the primary school, and Leadhill  Primary School is only slightly further down the road.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Within that small geographical area, are three speed-limit  zones: 60mph; 40mph; and 30mph. The Member for South Belfast Councillor Spratt  has hit the nail on the head. Representatives of all parties on Castlereagh  Borough Council, other elected representatives, the school principal,  representatives from the school, and the board of governors have been  campaigning for a long time for effective traffic-management provisions at that  school. Very often, elected representatives and others are frustrated at the  length of time that it takes for decisions of this nature to be taken. I do not  wish to rehearse the arguments that have been made, because they have been well  put, but there is a danger to the children of that school.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The turning circle at the school facilitates only about 50  or 60 cars and, as has already been pointed out,  the school and the two facilities beside it are growing fast, with  increasing enrolments. That is good and should be encouraged.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister have the Department consider restricting  the speed limit around the school to 20 or 30 miles per hour, perhaps on a  part-time basis when the children are coming and going? Will the Minister also  consider the provision of a footpath outside the school? As Alisdair McDonnell  said, it is really a semi-rural area.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister also have his officials broker further  measures? The school is adjoined on either side by two nurseries, so walkways  could be established that might ease pedestrian traffic throughout the day.  Those are three simple measures.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Flashing pedestrian lights were installed on the road after previous representations were made, but  they have either not been working, or they have been covered. Why have  those lights not been repaired? Why do the school and elected representatives  persistently have to make representations to have those matters addressed?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Minister for being in the Chamber this  afternoon, and I look forward to hearing his response to long-standing basic  demands from the parents and representatives of the area for reasonable speed  limits and traffic-management measures to be established around the school to  ensure the children&rsquo;s safety.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  I speak as a representative for South Belfast, although I am aware that the  school is located geographically in east Belfast.  However, a number of the pupils live in south Belfast, and I too have been  lobbied and approached by parents over the years about the difficulties of  traffic and congestion in that area at busy times during the school day.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am grateful to Alasdair McDonnell for raising this  matter, and I strongly support his view, which was also expressed by Mr Spratt  and Mr Maskey, that a modest amount of  traffic calming will go a long way to meeting the needs of the area. The  road, which was once a rural one, is now in a built-up area with no footpaths  and a 60 miles-per-hour limit, and the  school currently has well over 400 pupils. That is an awful lot of  traffic coming and going to the primary school and the facilities on either  side of it. The Roads Service could deal with that matter with a modest amount  of investment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am grateful that the Minister is in the House, because he  could make a lot of people very happy with a modest amount of expenditure.  Traffic-calming measures, changing the speed limit, and ensuring that traffic  that passes the school does so at a safe speed, are all that is required.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The best people to indicate where the dangers and perils  lie are the users of those facilities. The head&shy;mistress, the staff of the  school and, above all, the parents should be listened to when they point out  the dangers in taking children to and from school. The children&rsquo;s safety is the  key priority, and that requires intervention by the Roads Service. Plans for  the improvement of the road probably exist, and they could be brought forward  for a comparatively modest amount of investment. Speed limits and traffic  calming will go some of the way towards  making the school safer for the people who use it &mdash; above all, the  children.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>: I  am speaking as a representative of East Belfast,  where the school is located. What Mr Spratt has said about Castlereagh Borough  Council&rsquo;s activity must be recognised, as quite a number of demands and  requests have been made to Roads Service.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I will outline the history of the situation. The school is  located &mdash; as other Members have said &mdash; on a relatively rural stretch of road.  However, it is rural only in the sense that, historically, it was a rural area;  the volume of traffic is certainly not of a rural nature. Indeed, the road is a  cut-through to what has now become the &ldquo;outer outer ring&rdquo; along Manse Road that  takes traffic off the main dual carriageway and across from east to south Belfast without having to  come as far as the Knock Road  junction. Therefore, it is an extremely busy part of the road network.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As regards the work that has already been done, other  councillors in Castlereagh, from my party and from other parties, have been  campaigning on the matter for a long time, and I will outline some of the stuff  that we have been doing of late.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In 2001 and 2002 a petition for the extension of the 30 mph  speed limit on Church Road  to cover both Loughview Primary School and Leadhill Primary School,  both of which were outside the 30 mph speed limit area, was presented to Roads  Service. Mr Maskey has referred to the need for quick decisions &mdash; there has  been no shortage of decisions, but unfortunately they have all been negative.  There was also a request for fixed speed cameras. Both requests were turned  down at that time, on the basis that it was a rural road and that the fixed  speed camera scheme would not extend to it, although mobile patrols were put in  at that time to try to control some of the speeding.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In 2002 and 2003 the matter was raised again, and there was  a site meeting between Castlereagh councillors, Roads Service and the police.  Again, in 2003, any request for traffic calming was refused. In 2004 I again  raised the issue, in a letter this time, asking that traffic calming &mdash; not  necessarily speed humps, but some form of traffic calming &mdash; be considered, and  that at least a 40 mph speed limit should be extended beyond the schools. Again,  that was refused. We also again requested fixed cameras, and that was refused  for the third time.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In 2005 we made  enquiries about pedestrian facilities &mdash; both crossing facilities and  footpaths &mdash; on Church Road.  Again, that was refused. Roads Service said that it recognised that there was a  cluster of activities in the area from schools, play facilities, churches and  so on. However, Roads Service said that there was low pedestrian demand, and that the need for land acquisition ruled out a footpath at that time. The issue of  pedestrian demand is controlled by the fact that no one in their right  mind would walk along that stretch of road at the moment and, therefore, it  would be hard to note any footfall along it. If a pavement were there, people  would certainly use it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Roads Service initially agreed to put in flashing lights on  the signs for Leadhill Primary School, and that was extended to include Loughview Primary School as part of the safer  routes to schools scheme, and I welcome that. There was further correspondence,  and Roads Service upgraded the street lighting along Church Road with new lanterns as an  interim measure, while it waited for further upgrades of street lighting. Again, the road&rsquo;s being poorly lit was a further  concern.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In 2006 there was a further request for some kind of  speed-reduction measure. Surveys had been conducted in 2002 and 2005, but again  Roads Service said that the road was not wide enough to sustain anything other  than traffic humps, which would not be suitable on what it called a rural road.  Roads Service did, however, move the 30 mph speed limit by about 100 m towards Manse Road, so it now covers Leadhill Primary  School, but not far enough to cover  Loughview Primary School. Roads Service did install the flashing warning  lights under the safer routes to schools  scheme at both schools.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Unusually, I want to pay tribute to some people. Normally  when people&rsquo;s names are mentioned in the Chamber,  it is to say less than pleasant things. However, I want to pay tribute  to John Kee from the Castlereagh section office, who has done a lot of work and  dealt with a lot of enquiries over the years on the issue. I also want to pay  tribute to Tom McCourt and his predecessor Joe Drew, both of whom have been  very active, along with Alan Micklethwaite, who dealt with the issue of street  lighting.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Having received further enquiries earlier this year, I  talked to the parents who had contacted me. I went through the requests that  had already been put and explained the history of the site. I suggested that I  was happy to lend my continued support, but that it would be more appropriate  to progress the matter through the board of  governors and the parent council at the school, as there might be other  local solutions that could be introduced. While I welcome this opportunity to  raise the issue again, that might be a more appropriate mechanism to get a  resolution. It is important to ensure that whatever measures are suggested have  the full support of the parents and the board of governors, and also the  involvement of the transport officers from the two education and library  boards.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In cases such as Lagan College,  which was mentioned by the Member  for Strangford, road safety improvements led to the removal of free  school transport for a small number of children. They did not benefit from  those road-safety improvements because the exceptional hazard was deemed to have been removed. Therefore, the board&rsquo;s transport officers must be involved in  discussions.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">6.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Newton</strong>:  Naomi Long is a councillor who, like me, represents East   Belfast. I say &ldquo;Amen&rdquo; to the comments she made about those in the  Roads Service, and I hope that I get the same favours that she is now bound to  get, having paid tribute to them in such a manner.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">All Members are concerned about the safety of children as  they go to school and all other road users, including pedestrians. We are  calling for traffic calming. However, we are not specifying what we mean by  that term, which covers a wide range of issues. Devon County Council states  that:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Traffic calming consists of a package of measures  affecting the movement of vehicles and other traffic for the purpose of  promoting safety, or preserving or improving the environment. The essence of  traffic calming lies not so much in the use of specific measures, but in the  achievement of the objectives of improving driver awareness and behaviour.  Traffic calming is a generic term used in reference to tools used to change the  horizontal and/or vertical alignments, introduce narrowing/build outs,  roundabouts, entrance gateways or coloured surfacing.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In my experience, traffic-calming measures are usually  introduced only after a long campaign to have them incorporated into budgets.  Hull County Council states that:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Traffic calming is usually introduced as part of a  local safety scheme or outside schools in an attempt to reduce injury accidents  or vehicle speeds. Traffic calming is often part of a 20 mph speed limit zone  and can in some cases include traffic calming measures such as speed humps or  cushions.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">When the Minister and his officials are applying their  minds to the introduction of traffic-calming measures, according to East Sussex  County Council, they should consider the following factors:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;the number of reported crashes resulting in injury;</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">the speed and volume of traffic;</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">whether there are schools nearby;</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">the width of the road.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although I support the  need for action in the vicinity of the school, it would be wrong to  identify traffic calming as important only for that school area. I am  interested to hear from the Minister about how much money Roads Service has  spent on road realignment and traffic-calming measures in the vicinity and what  is planned. No single solution can be applied to make the roads safer for  everyone; indeed, the potential for several solutions must be considered.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members have referred  to the use of the Henry Jones memorial playing fields and the local  Presbyterian church. However, at times when sporting activities or church  services, weddings or funerals are occurring, people  must be cognisant of the needs of those associated with those  facilities. Before any changes are made to roads or footpaths, each factor that  I have highlighted must be considered holistically to include all people in the  area who use the facilities. It is wrong to isolate and encourage changes only  for the benefit of a school.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That, in itself, is probably not the best way forward. The  school would obviously benefit, and we are all concerned about the safety of  parents and children on their way to the school. We want to make all roads as  safe as possible for all road traffic and pedestrians.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Hanna</strong>:  Like other representatives for South Belfast, I have been approached by parents  who have children at Loughview   Integrated Primary    School. As has been said, those parents know the  bad traffic situation inside out.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s being present in the Chamber, and  I wish to reiterate what my colleague Alasdair McDonnell has said and add my  concerns to the debate. Alasdair painted an accurate picture of the geography  of the area and the traffic situation. He mentioned that there is a 60 mph  speed limit and that there is no footpath near the school. It has also been  said that there is a long history of campaigning with very little to show for it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Roads Service is aware of the debate, and I hope that  officials will report back to us with positive news in the near future. Parents  are very concerned about the possibility of a serious accident&rsquo;s occurring. A  recent accident reignited the safety campaign, so we must do all that we can to  reduce the risk to children.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development (Mr Murphy)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann  Comhairle. I welcome this debate, and I thank Dr McDonnell for tabling the  Adjournment topic. I thank all the Members who have contributed; they are all  familiar with the difficulties that the school has experienced. Most of them  have been working to resolve those problems for some time.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I will address in my contribution some of the issues, but I  have also asked my officials to take note of some of the points that were  raised. For example, Robin Newton asked how much money had already been spent.  If there are any points that I am unable to deal with now, I will write to the  Member concerned.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I acknowledge Jimmy Spratt&rsquo;s point that, over time, many  people have contacted the Department about the need for traffic-calming  measures at the school. Yesterday, I received a letter from the school, and I  will respond to that in due course. I will also respond to correspondence that  I received from parents and other interested parties.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Alasdair McDonnell described the geography, and I am sure  that other Members are more familiar with the location of Church Road and Loughview Integrated   Primary School than I am, so I do not propose to go over  it. As Members have said, the school is on a semi-rural part of the road that  has changed over time. The area around the school is subject to the national speed  limit from the junction between Church Road and Manse Road  for approximately 800 metres towards Ballygowan    Road. A 30-mph speed limit is in place between  that point and Ballygowan Road,  which is a residential area, unlike the upper section of Church Road.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Carmel Hanna referred to accidents. No personal injury  collisions had been recorded around the school in the past three years until  March of this year, and I accept that recent collisions have heightened  concerns.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Over the past few years, my Department&rsquo;s Roads Service has  carried out several measures on Church Road that are aimed at improving road  safety, including the repositioning of the 30-mph speed-limit signs on the  lower part of Church Road to make them more conspicuous and, under the Safer  Routes to School initiative, the provision of flashing warning signs and  associated bands of red road surface to highlight the presence of the school.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Some Members mentioned the introduction of traffic-calming  measures on Church Road,  such as road humps. Those are normally only considered for residential streets  in a 30-mph area, where the main objective is to reduce the average vehicle  speed to approximately 20 mph. Such severe measures would not be regarded as appropriate for a road such as Church Road. Other forms of traffic-calming measures, such as  central-hatching road markings with pedestrian-refuge aisles are not possible  because of insufficient road width. I know that some Members have argued for  widening the road.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Several Members mentioned the provision of a footway. Roads  Service has carried out a preliminary investigation into extending the existing  footway from the urban portion of Church    Road to Manse    Road, and Naomi Long mentioned that. I note from  the school&rsquo;s survey that few, or no, children walk to school. However, one  might say that that is a chicken-and-egg situation &mdash; if there were a footpath,  more children might avail themselves of it. I accept that that is a valid  argument.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, the initial survey into the provision of a  footpath has indicated that such a proposal would be costly due to the extent  of accommodation works that would be required at a number of properties; the  considerable earthworks that would be required due to the typography of the  area; the extensive land take due to the existing steep side slopes at the road  edge; and the severe environmental impact there would be, with the loss of  mature trees and hedges.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Roads Service also  carried out a recent site inspection, which highlighted that one of the  flashing school signs was partially obscured by foliage. An arrangement has  been made to have that rectified. It was also reported that school flashing  signs were not operating properly &mdash; Alex Maskey referred to that issue &mdash; and I  have asked for those to be inspected and reprogrammed to ensure that they are  fully operational.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Several contributors mentioned reducing the speed limit.  The character of the road is such that a speed limit of 30 mph is not  warranted. However, Roads Service officials, in association with the PSNI, have  reviewed that section of the road, and I am pleased to advise Members that it  has been proposed &mdash; subject to completing the necessary legislative process &mdash;  to introduce a speed limit of 40 mph along the upper section of Church Road, which  includes Loughview   Primary School.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I also fully appreciate the concerns raised by parents  about their children having to walk between the school and the adjoining  nurseries: again, Mr Maskey referred to that. However, both nurseries share a  common boundary with the school, which would permit the construction of access  to and from the school without the need to use the public road. Provision of  such access facilities are the responsibility of the owners of the nurseries  and the school authorities.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Since entering office, I have received many requests to  reduce the speed of traffic outside schools. As a parent, I appreciate that  this is a very sensitive topic; and parents are quite rightly concerned about  the safety of children going to and from  school and the increasing volume and speed of traffic and how that  contributes to those concerns.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I assure Members that my Department and I take child safety  at schools seriously. Roads Service has installed a range of measures outside  many schools to improve safety and has been researching the possibility of  introducing part-time speed limits around schools at key times, such as when  the children are arriving or leaving. Such a proposal would be aimed especially  at roads where the national speed limit applies and where traffic speeds are high.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As part of its studies,  Roads Service has investigated experiences in Scotland, where a comprehensive  system of part-time speed limits has been introduced outside many schools.  Following its positive findings, Roads Service has been preparing to install  pilot schemes at a couple of schools here to determine their effectiveness in  reducing speeds. The PSNI has agreed to ensure enforcement at those locations,  where the proposal is that a speed limit of  20 mph will be applied.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Depending on the legislative process and the availability  of suitable electronic signage, Roads Service hopes to have the system  operating in this financial year. Following a comprehensive assessment of the  trials, including speed surveys, Roads Service will consider bidding for resources  to roll out a more extensive installation programme.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that all the concerns and points raised by Members  have been addressed. If not, my Department and I will address them in writing.  I certainly intend to respond to the school and to any parents or  representatives who have contacted us in writing.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">With Roads Service, I am happy to discuss the idea &mdash;  suggested by several Members &mdash; that a holistic approach is required to deal  with the issue. There are implications for some of the measures that may be adopted &mdash; Naomi Long pointed that out &mdash; and we  need to ensure that we have a proper consultation process and  discussions with schools authorities; transport authorities; Roads Service; the  PSNI; and whoever else may have an interest in travelling on that length of  road, to enable us to address all those concerns.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have asked my officials to take note of the Hansard  report. Therefore, if I have missed any points that Members raised, I will  write to them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText"><em>Adjourned at 6.29 pm.</em></p>
