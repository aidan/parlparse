                </font></b><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the final sitting of the New Northern
                Ireland Assembly, on Monday 29 November 1999, Mr Peter Robinson
                asked whether it was appropriate to refer to another Member as a
                murderer where it was believed that a Member had been
                responsible for murder. He questioned whether this was
                unparliamentary language.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He is correct. Where a reference is clearly
                made in respect of either an individual Member or a group of
                Members, this would be unparliamentary language, except in the
                circumstance where the particular Member being referred to had
                been convicted of the offence by due process and through the
                courts. There has recently been a circumstance in respect of the
                analogous term to which the Member referred in another place.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have studied references made during the
                last sitting, and, whilst I believe that some Members were
                sailing close to the wind, I do not believe that unparliamentary
                language was used.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have received formal notice from the
                Minister of Finance and Personnel that he wishes to make a
                statement. The statement will be made at a convenient time after
                10.30 am tomorrow.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some Members may have received an incorrect
                Marshalled List of Amendments. Owing to an administrative error
                a line was omitted at the end of the second amendment on the
                Marshalled List. That was corrected, and copies of the revised
                Marshalled List were issued. Let me point out, in case any
                Member has received an incorrect copy, that under the heading
                &quot;Amendment to the Motion to insert a new Standing Order
                after Standing Order 57&quot; the final line should read</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The Committee shall consist of 17
                members.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members who have a Marshalled List which does
                not include that sentence should dispose of it and obtain a
                revised version from the Doorkeepers in the Lobby.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Maskey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr Speaker. I ask for a
                suspension of the Assembly for one hour, particularly in the
                light of your last comment. We have been handed a list of
                amendments, some of which are complicated and have far-reaching
                implications, and we have not been given time to consider them.
                That is not satisfactory. It is also unsatisfactory that this
                practice is starting to take root in the Assembly. Sinn Féin is
                very unhappy about the way this has been done. The issues
                involved in some of these amendments are very serious, so I ask
                for a suspension to enable us to consider this matter
                thoroughly.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Robinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Further to that point of order,
                Mr&nbsp;Speaker. The request for a suspension has some merit.
                Some Members may be confused about which sheet of paper is being
                dealt with and about which amendment is pertinent. A shorter
                period — I believe that you can suspend proceedings for less
                than one hour — would be enough to enable us to clarify the
                position before starting the debate.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I can understand that there may be some
                element of uncertainty and confusion, and I apologise for that.
                It seems reasonable that we should suspend proceedings so that
                Members can consider the matter. May I have the leave of the
                House to suspend proceedings for 30 minutes?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Then it will have to be taken a little later.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">May I have the leave of the House to suspend
                the sitting for 30 minutes to enable Members to consider these
                amendments? It is not because they came late — Members will
                know that amendments can be brought — but because there was an
                administrative error, and therefore an element was introduced
                about which Members may wish to be clear. When we return,
                Members may still be unclear, and we shall have to consider the
                matter again. I am somewhat hesitant to give a longer suspension
                at this point, because there is a good deal of business to be
                transacted today.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members will have had an opportunity to look
                at the Marshalled List of amendments. Since we are all trying to
                find our way, perhaps I should explain what is meant by
                &quot;Marshalled List of Amendments&quot;. When all the
                amendments are in, we marshall them for the ease of the House by
                putting them in the order of the items to which they relate. On
                this occasion it is fairly simple as there are only two
                amendments. However, in the case of a Bill with perhaps many
                amendments it would be more valuable to have a Marshalled List.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr Speaker. I am
                reasonably content with the Marshalled List of amendments. The
                other problem we face relates to the Order Paper itself. On the
                first Order Paper that I received there was a motion, in the
                names of Mr Ford and myself, relating to the Committee of the
                Centre, seeking to bring under scrutiny other matters that were
                the responsibility of the First Minister and the Deputy First
                Minister. I now have two Order Papers with different font sizes.
                The amendment sheet says</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;At line 3, delete from ‘Committee of

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You are right. These are contentious issues.
                I recently discovered that the Act on which this Assembly is
                based has certain imperfections of a similar kind, so we are not
                alone in this regard. The Order Paper that was issued first
                reads</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;delete from ‘Committee of the’ to
                end of line 10 and insert —&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With the reduced font size, &quot;line
                10&quot; became &quot;line 8&quot;. This is a technical problem
                that we will have to make sure does not arise again. My

                Has the First Minister crossed the Floor permanently? Perhaps he
                feels more at ease with SDLP Members than with his Colleagues on
                the Unionist Back Benches.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In fairness to the First Minister, the Deputy
                First Minister and the House, I shall explain how we propose to
                deal with statements. In this case the First Minister or the
                Deputy First Minister or both will make the statement. Any
                Minister making a statement may use one of the lecterns that
                have been provided. Members will then be able to ask questions
                for up to one hour.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This will not be a debate, so there will no
                vote or long speeches. Questions — in this case to the First
                Minister and the Deputy First Minister — should be short and
                to the point. Either may reply, and both felt that it would be
                sensible for them to sit together. While I will call Members to
                speak, I will not call Ministers to respond. They will have to
                sort out between them who is to reply.</p>

                move that it be noted. Surely if that Question is before the
                House, Members must have an opportunity to say &quot;Aye&quot;

                in this or any other place, by a vote. Those words will not
                necessarily be used at the end.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The following Ministers participated in the
                meeting: Mr David Trimble, Mr Seamus Mallon, Ms Bairbre de Brún,
                Mr Mark Durkan, Sir Reg Empey, Mr Sean Farren, Mr Sam Foster, Mr
                Michael McGimpsey, Mr Martin McGuinness and Ms Brid Rodgers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This report has been approved by all the
                Ministers who attended that meeting and is made on their behalf
                by the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council agreed a Memorandum of
                Understanding on Procedure, which sets out procedural
                arrangements relating to the proceedings and operation of the
                Council. A copy of the memorandum has been placed in the
                Assembly Library.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The locations of the headquarters and the
                other offices of the six North/South implementation bodies were
                agreed. Waterways Ireland will have its headquarters in
                Enniskillen and three regional offices in the Republic. The Food
                Safety Promotion Board will be based in Cork, and the Trade and
                Business Development Board in Newry. The Special European Union
                Programmes Body will have its headquarters in Belfast and
                regional offices in Omagh and Monaghan. The Irish Language
                Agency of the North/South Language Board will have headquarters
                in Dublin and a regional office in Belfast, while the
                headquarters of the Ullans Agency will be in Belfast, with a
                regional office in County Donegal. The Loughs Agency of the
                Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission will be based in
                Londonderry, with a regional office near Carlingford Lough. The
                Lights Agency will be based in the Dublin/Dun Laoghaire area.
                The new Tourism Company, when it is established, will have its
                headquarters in Dublin and a regional office in Coleraine.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council also appointed members to the
                boards of the Food Safety Body, the Trade and Business
                Development Body, the North/South Language Body and the Foyle,
                Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council agreed an outline programme of
                work in relation to the six areas for co-operation identified in
                the 15 February 1999 report to the Assembly by the First
                Minister and the Deputy First Minister as a basis for follow-up
                in the appropriate sectoral formats. It also agreed that the
                relevant proposals in the outline programme of work should be
                tabled at the first meetings of the council in each appropriate
                sectoral format.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council agreed that it would meet in
                sectoral format to consider issues relating to the six
                implementation bodies and the six areas of co-operation at the
                earliest possible date and that the question of additional
                sectoral formats would be agreed by the Council meeting in
                institutional format. It agreed that the next meeting in plenary
                form would take place in Dublin in June next year.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr Speaker. According to
                the Act it is incumbent on Ministers to report to the House. It
                was also stated to the people of this Province that the House
                would be sovereign with regard to these matters. You have now
                told us that there will be no opportunity for us to put these
                matters to a vote, that there will simply be a statement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am well aware that a statement in the House
                of Commons attracts questions and answers only. Are you telling
                us that the reports from these bodies are going to be in the
                form of a statement? Having been told that all these matters
                will be finally decided by the Assembly, we are now being told
                that we cannot vote on what took place at the first meeting. No
                one in the Assembly other than those associated with Mr Trimble
                and Mr Mallon knew what was going to happen. We did not see an
                agenda. Now we are told that we, as representatives of the
                Ulster people, cannot vote on these issues.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order. First, let me say that an agenda was
                circulated to Members. As regards voting on the matter, the
                Member knows and has said that statements do not afford the
                opportunity for voting. However, there is no reason why there
                should not be other appropriate opportunities for voting in the
                House if, for example, there were a question of administrative
                actions being probed or motions being put down in relation to
                them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We now have two Standing Orders which will
                give Committees the opportunity to scrutinise various aspects of
                the work. In that context there may well be opportunities for
                matters to be raised and votes to be taken. As the Member knows,
                a statement is not meant to be used as an opportunity for a
                vote, but motions may, of course, be put down by Members.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Robinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the referendum campaign — indeed,
                even after it — the issue of accountability in relation to the
                decisions that would be taken on a North/South basis was much
                discussed. It was made quite clear by those from the Unionist
                tradition who supported the Belfast Agreement that there would
                be accountability. The distinction in this matter is vital. If,
                in order to make Ministers accountable for decisions that will
                be taken on a North/South body, there is a requirement for
                people to put down a motion objecting to what they have done,
                the onus is on those who object to get the necessary percentages
                of both sections of the community in order to ensure that those
                Ministers are stopped. If, on the other hand, the Executive is
                required to get the support of the Assembly for what it has
                done, the support must come from both sections of the community.
                That is the key distinction.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker, would it not be in order for you
                to remind Members that the creation of these implementation
                bodies was debated and voted on in January and, I think, March?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is not for me to judge whether House
                procedures are satisfactory or unsatisfactory (politically they
                may be either); I can only rule on whether they accord with
                Standing Orders or ‘Erskine May’. The First Minister has
                made the point that there has been a vote on the matters. I can
                rule on points of order but not on political accountability or
                propriety or anything like that.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker, I am sure you are aware that we
                took a decision — against the better interests of the Unionist
                community, I think — in relation to the establishment of such
                bodies. We are now dealing with the modus operandi of those
                bodies. That is a very different issue. I want it to be clearly
                on the record that on the basis of Mr Trimble’s argument, what
                we have here are North/South bodies that will not be accountable
                to the Assembly unless Members put down motions which require
                the support of the Nationalist community.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr Ian Paisley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are not dealing with the content; we are
                dealing with the fact that this is the first statement from the
                First Minister about decisions taken at a meeting. We, as well
                as the general public, were continually told — and this was
                sold from the Unionist platforms both at the election and the
                referendum — that this House would be sovereign. The First
                Minister said on the television last night that we need not
                worry about the minority position in this Council, and that
                everything would come before the Assembly eventually. The First
                Minister cannot take it upon himself to say &quot;I am going to
                make a statement&quot;. If he does, according to your ruling, Mr
                Speaker, we are never going to be able to have a vote on his
                statement. The words &quot;I beg to move that the statement be
                noted&quot; should be put to the House, and every Member should
                have the right to say &quot;Aye&quot; or &quot;No&quot;. We are
                now being muzzled; we cannot even ask the First Minister
                questions. A Member can ask one question, the First Minister
                will reply, and then he moves on to another.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those of us who are parliamentarians in other
                places know the uselessness of questioning a statement. This is
                a Government’s way of dealing with policy quickly, without
                having a real debate. May I put down a motion on this issue
                today, to be debated tomorrow?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member knows that he can, with the leave
                of the House, put down a motion today for debate tomorrow. If he
                did not receive the leave of the House, the first opportunity
                for such a motion would be at a subsequent sitting. I note what
                he says about the use of questions, and so on, in other places,
                but we must be cautious about being unduly critical of other
                places and other Parliaments. That is not proper. The situation
                in respect of a statement is clear, and the First Minister and
                the Deputy First Minister have volunteered the statement. There
                may be other ways of dealing with such a matter. A Member could
                put a motion down or new Standing Orders could be approved.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The real issue is the principle to which Mr
                Robinson and Dr Paisley have referred — the accountability of
                the Executive to the Assembly. I suggest that that principle was
                canvassed very strongly by Mr Trimble. Are he and his colleagues
                entitled to take Executive decisions and tell the House about
                them in the form of a statement without permitting any debate?
                In other words, can they make the Assembly subject to decisions
                already taken in the Executive?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The point that you are making, Mr Speaker, is
                that we can ex post facto have a debate on something that has
                already been decided upon at the North/South Ministerial
                Council. Such procedure would make a nonsense of the principle
                that the Executive is accountable to the Assembly.</p>

                Matters of principle will have to be discussed in another way.
                They may be related; I do not dispute that. My role is to
                address points of procedure. When you say that the Executive is
                not accountable, that is a matter of dispute in other places.
                This is not unique to ourselves, and it will continue to be a
                matter of dispute and discussion. The question is whether I can
                rule that any of the proceedings are out of order. I cannot do
                that, for they are clearly in order.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should proceed so that Members have an
                opportunity to ask questions and get replies from the First
                Minister and the Deputy First Minister. To that end I call Mr

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So far as the point of order is concerned, I
                have repeatedly given the ruling that a statement is not an

                contained questions to which the Members making them did not
                want answers. The statement made by the Deputy First Minister
                and myself was made in fulfilment of a statutory requirement. It
                was not a matter on which we had a choice.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As to the point raised by Dr Birnie, I can
                confirm that Mr Robinson (the Minister for Regional Development)
                and Mr Dodds (the Minister for Social Development) were asked if
                they would attend the inaugural meeting of the North/South
                Ministerial Council, but they both declined. Consequently, on
                that occasion, they were not nominated to represent the
                Executive, thus avoiding their being in breach of their pledge
                of office. It is an undoubted fact that they would have served
                themselves and their interests much better if they had
                participated.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to decision making in the
                council, as the Assembly will know, under Section 52 of the
                Northern Ireland Act the First and the Deputy First Ministers,
                acting jointly, must, as required by the Belfast Agreement,
                nominate Ministers to achieve cross-community participation in
                the North/South Ministerial Council. That agreement requires
                that arrangements be made so that the Assembly as a whole is
                represented at summit level and in dealings with other
                institutions in order to ensure cross-community involvement.
                Decisions made in the Council are by agreement and within the
                defined authority of those attending. This ensures that there
                is, at each stage, consensus and that any decision taken at the
                North/South Ministerial Council is within the terms of the
                authority granted by the Executive of this Assembly. Each side
                of the council remains accountable to its legislature, whose
                approval will be required in the event of any decisions going
                beyond the defined authority of those attending.</p>

                In my experience, the more questions he asks, the greater the

                activities of these bodies were set out in the report which the
                Deputy First Minister and I presented to the House on 18
                December last year, and the report was approved by the House in
                two votes made in the first few months of this year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What we are seeing now is introducing nothing
                new in terms of substance; it merely sets out some of the
                administrative arrangements necessary to implement the decisions
                taken by the Assembly on those occasions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to costs, I regret to say that I
                am not currently in a position to give the detailed answers that
                the Member has sought. I will not on this occasion offer to
                write to him but will refer him to the statement to be made
                tomorrow, with your permission, Mr Speaker, by the Minister of
                Finance and Personnel. I expect that his statement will contain
                figures which will show the planned expenditure for each body
                over the course of the next financial year. The Member can then
                make his own assessment as to the significance of that
                expenditure in relation to the objectives to be achieved.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As to the distribution of work between
                headquarters and sub- and regional offices, all I can say at
                present is that headquarters will be headquarters, and a
                sub-office will be a sub-office. The extent to which the work is
                divided between one and the other will obviously vary from body
                to body, and no decisions have yet been taken. These are
                comparatively minor administrative matters which, I am sure,
                Members will wish to pursue through the relevant Committees.</p>

                Minister on 18 December 1998. The Assembly, on that date,
                approved brief descriptions of the subject matter for
                co-operation through existing channels. Under the heading

                co-operation through existing channels at that stage. The report
                of 18 December 1998 has been reprinted several times.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition, officials have considered
                possible ways in which that co-operation can be carried out in
                practice. Those proposals will be tabled through sectoral
                meetings of the NSMC in the coming months. As there are six
                areas where there are implementation bodies and six areas where
                further co-operation is to be considered, it will take some time
                to work through those. The details of the working through of
                these matters will be fully available for discussion between the

                to these six areas for further co-operation beyond what was

                that he had made to the electorate who put him in this Assembly?
                Indeed, he was not even acting for all the members of his party.</p>

                representatives of the Government of the Irish Republic? Can the
                First Minister explain why in 1974 he and his Colleague Sir Reg
                Empey opposed the Council of Ireland under the power-sharing
                Executive? I remember Mr Empey stopping traffic at the top of

                misunderstanding of the nature of what was done. There was no
                agreement then that was in any sense analogous to the Belfast
                Agreement. Yesterday there was simply a working out of the
                detailed implementation of agreements already entered into —
                namely, agreements made by the Assembly when it approved the
                report brought forward by the Deputy First Minister and me. This
                report was published on 18 December last and was subject to
                votes in this Chamber on at least two occasions. That was the
                agreement that we were implementing, and, of course, that flowed
                directly from the Belfast Agreement — the existence of the
                North/South Ministerial Council and these particular areas for
                co-operation were, in many cases, foreshadowed in the Belfast
                Agreement itself.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member who spoke answered his own
                question when he pointed out that the Belfast Agreement had been
                endorsed by a clear and overwhelming majority of the people of
                Northern Ireland voting in a referendum. It was subsequently
                endorsed again in the Assembly elections. It is quite clear that
                there is democratic validity for what is being done. On another
                occasion I will be very happy to take the Member through the
                differences between what was done in 1998 and what was proposed
                in 1974 in order to point out the manifold nature of those
                differences to him, but it would not be appropriate to take the
                time of the House today.</p>

                Chairpersons £6,400 or IR£8,000. With regard to the amount of
                time involved I cannot give a detailed response now, but it is
                fairly clear that there are significant responsibilities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The remuneration is entirely in line with
                that for equivalent posts in other public bodies. The figures

                Minister confirm that the consultation which preceded the issue
                of the memorandum was inadequate and that they did not meet the
                remit that they set out for themselves in the report of 15
                February 1999 — to have further consultations with parties on
                the draft before it was finalised in the North/South Ministerial
                Council? In particular, do they agree that parties are right to
                be critical on hearing for the first time the nominations to
                these bodies and, indeed, the remuneration? Nowadays public
                bodies go to press when looking for nominees, particularly in

                remuneration.</p>

                negotiations that helped to establish the implementation bodies,
                was inadequate, what steps will they take to improve
                consultation in the future, particularly in relation to the
                independent consultative forum that is referred to in paragraph
                19 (strand two) and the joint parliamentary forum referred to in

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members should bear in mind that in the last
                two weeks we have done a considerable number of things in quite
                a short time. Not everything has been achieved, and it is
                perfectly clear that some elements of the agreement have still
                to be put in place. These include the establishment of the Civic
                Forum and parliamentary groups and the consultative forums with
                regard to North/South co-operation, to which the Member
                referred. We will consider these matters and take them forward
                as soon as we can.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There was a clear desire on the part of a
                number of parties — ourselves included — to see these major
                building blocks put in place as soon as possible, particularly
                as so many months had elapsed. Agreement was reached in December
                1998 and was implemented by legislation in March 1999. The delay
                in establishing these institutions was causing considerable
                uncertainty and inconvenience in the public services North and
                South, and it was natural that once the Assembly went live our
                next priority would be to have the inaugural meetings of the
                North/South Ministerial Council and the British-Irish Council
                and to start to implement those things agreed in December 1998
                and January and March 1999.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am sorry if the Member feels that the
                consultation was inadequate. There will be plenty of
                opportunities in the Assembly for consultation about the working
                out of these programmes — in particular, through the
                appropriate Committees, whose purpose is to enable Members to
                obtain information, to make their views known and to be involved
                in the development of policy.</p>

                It is a requirement that arrangements for its establishment be
                made within six months of devolution. Steps are being taken to
                ensure that that will happen. Maximum consultation will take
                place, in the same way as before, so that it will be a genuine
                consultative forum, as intended. The same applies to the
                proposed interparliamentary forum. I welcome debate on that, and
                I welcome very widespread consultation. This is one of the most
                important matters that the Assembly can consider. It derives
                directly from the Good Friday Agreement, as does the Civic

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCartney:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I direct this question specifically to the
                First Minister. Is he not being at best disingenuous and at
                worst misleading when he refers to this House as having
                endorsed, on 18 December 1998 and in February 1999, the
                arrangements whose outworkings were dealt with at the meeting
                yesterday? At that time were the First Minister and his party
                not telling both this House and the pro-Unionist community that
                there would be no further outworkings of the agreement and that
                they would not be participating in any Executive unless guns
                were handed in?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Did he not, both at that time and
                subsequently in the European election, support the literature of
                the Ulster Unionist candidate, Mr Jim Nicholson, which
                specifically said that if guns were not handed in, there would
                be no participation in government? Is it not therefore quite
                wrong of the First Minister to chasten Members of the Assembly
                with the suggestion that what happened yesterday was authorised
                on the basis of what happened on 18 December 1998 and in
                February 1999, at which time he was advocating an entirely
                different set of circumstances to those which presently obtain?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second leg of my question relates to the
                appointment of the various members of these boards, whose
                remuneration, but not the extent of whose duties, we have been
                hearing about today. I note that Mr Barry Fitzsimons of the
                Ulster Unionist Party, who helpfully seconded the First Minister’s
                motion at the executive council, is one of the appointees. Mr
                Jack Allen, a former chairman of the Ulster Unionist Party and
                currently the party treasurer, is another. Mr Bertie Kerr, a
                well-known Fermanagh Ulster Unionist apparatchik and, I believe,
                father of the First Minister’s publicrelations man, is an
                appointee, as is Lord Laird, who was elevated to the House of
                Lords on Mr Trimble’s recommendation. All these gentlemen are
                paid appointees to these bodies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Was Mr Bertie Kerr, for example, appointed on
                the basis of his well-known expertise in the food and health
                industry, or was it simply a question of jobs for the boys? I
                suppose that Lord Castlereagh got it wrong in 1800 when he said
                that with the Act of Union he had purchased the fee simple of
                Irish political corruption. Or is this something that is
                purchased, First Minister, in each generation?</p>

                misled by comments which I have made today, I am quite at a loss
                to understand it. It is clear that the arrangements for the
                cross-border implementation bodies and the areas for further
                co-operation which were agreed by the Assembly on 18 December
                and subsequently are exactly those that were put in place on the
                coming into operation of the Act. The Executive made some fairly
                routine administrative decisions regarding their operation and
                then saw them brought into effect through the meeting of the
                North/South Ministerial Council.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The reasons for locating the Northern Ireland
                office of Tourism Ireland in Coleraine are obvious, as the
                Member has pointed out. It appeared to be an entirely
                appropriate place, and it was equally appropriate to have a
                sub-office in Northern Ireland. We expect that the new company
                will be formed following a meeting of the North/South
                Ministerial Council in the appropriate sectoral format. This is
                likely to take place early in the new year. The development of
                the company, its budgets and staffing will be matters for early
                consideration. The eventual staffing of the body will depend on
                the structural arrangements agreed by the council with the
                respective tourist boards.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We cannot, therefore, know exactly how many
                jobs will be located initially in Coleraine. We expect that the
                office will be large, given the need for a major initiative on
                tourism in Northern Ireland.</p>

                said about Northern Ireland’s position as it is today in law
                and the lack of any constitutional implications of these bodies.
                The other statement that he referred to was of an aspirational

                yesterday, what we are reporting on today — which will be part
                of the ongoing political process — threatens no one. It is
                something that can and will be of benefit to the people of
                Ireland, North and South. It will be of benefit to people in
                every part of the island. In Northern Ireland especially, it
                gives an opportunity to diversify, to expand and to have the
                type of relationship with the South of Ireland which makes sense
                in the type of world we live in nowadays. The world has shrunk
                in such a way that Ireland is now, whichever part of it we speak
                about, a very small place, and it is only by partnership that
                threatens no one and that will threaten no one that we can
                maximise our influence in socioeconomic terms.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I fully agree with the Member regarding the
                locations. I believe that the institutions will be beneficial to
                the areas in which they are placed. They will have a substantial
                spin-off in terms of not just employment but also of status and
                in the type of involvement which we hope to encourage in terms
                of decentralisation as it applies in the application of these

                this matter will not go by default because of his absence. It is

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Memorandum of Understanding and Procedure
                is the product of very lengthy negotiations between officials
                North and South. Its function is to set out the arrangements for
                the proceedings and operation of the North/South Ministerial
                Council. Of course, the memorandum is not legally binding.
                Rather, as its name suggests, it represents simply an informal
                understanding between the two Administrations, North and South,
                on how the North/South Ministerial Council should operate.
                Either side can at any time propose changes to it, although any
                such changes will be adopted only by mutual agreement between
                the two sides, North and South.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important to note that nothing in the
                Memorandum of Understanding and Procedure overrides the Good
                Friday Agreement. Officials went to considerable efforts to root
                the memorandum very carefully in the provisions of that
                agreement. That is why, before every paragraph of the
                memorandum, is corresponding provisions of strand two of the
                Good Friday Agreement are reproduced in full. It was felt that
                it was appropriate to clarify that the Memorandum of
                Understanding and Procedure flowed directly from the agreement
                and was fully compatible with its provisions.</p>

                buy licences from the Fisheries Conservancy Board and the Loughs
                Agency? One licence may have to be paid in sterling and the

                Irish, will now be matters for consideration, North and South,
                at that level. I would like to believe that all of us in the

                our cultural being and not as a political flagship or a
                political issue with which to promote what we regard as our
                culture, or to denigrate anyone else’s. It is that respect,
                and, indeed, self-respect, which should inspire anybody involved
                in these two bodies to try to create a cultural unity that will
                accommodate the type of cultural diversity which is so needed in

                responsibility for the Economic Policy Unit, equality and
                community relations. It will liaise with the North/South
                Ministerial Council, the British-Irish Council, the
                British-Irish Governmental Conference, the Civic Forum, the
                International Fund for Ireland and with the Secretary of State
                on excepted and reserved matters.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Office of the First Minister and Deputy
                First Minister will also deal with European affairs and
                international matters, and it will include the Policy Innovation
                Unit and the Executive Information Service. In addition, the
                Office will undertake important work in relation to human rights
                and equality, and it will be responsible for the Office of the
                Legislative Counsel.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister and the Deputy First
                Minister also have extremely important joint functions under
                strand one of the Good Friday Agreement. They convene and
                preside over the Executive Committee and co-ordinate its work
                and the response of the Northern Ireland Administration to
                external relations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A crucial feature of the Office of the First
                Minister and the Deputy First Minister is that it is a
                Department headed jointly by myself and the Deputy First
                Minister. There is, consequently and inevitably, a considerable
                element of negotiation between the two parts of the Office
                involved in jointly resolving policies and actions, and this
                places a particular burden on it which other Departments do not
                carry.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members will recall that the report of the
                First Minister and the Deputy First Minister set out in detail
                some of the functions of the Economic Policy Unit. I do not need
                to rehearse all those functions in detail. They include
                undertaking, together with the Minister of Finance and Personnel
                and the Secretary of State, negotiations with the Treasury on
                the size of the Northern Ireland block grant and on European
                Union and International Fund for Ireland funding; determining,
                within the Executive Committee, the Administration’s detailed
                strategic goals and inputting them into the programme of
                government and the allocation of financial resources;
                co-ordinating the Executive’s economic policies and monitoring
                the effectiveness of public spending in achieving the
                Administration’s economic goals, including having
                responsibility for the economic and social steering groups;
                co-ordinating European Union policy and reviewing the progress
                and effectiveness of European Union and International Fund for
                Ireland funding; and providing central initiatives such as the
                Policy Innovation Unit and improving the effectiveness of
                management in government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members will be aware of the importance of
                equality and human rights matters in the Belfast Agreement. That
                is reflected in the provisions of the Northern Ireland Act,
                creating, as it does, a single Equality Commission and
                establishing the Human Rights Commission. The legislative and
                executive competence of the Assembly, Ministers and Northern
                Ireland Departments is constrained by the obligation to act
                compatibly with the rights contained in the European Convention
                on Human Rights. That convention is now operative with regard to
                devolved matters in Northern Ireland, even if the Human Rights
                Act is not yet in force with regard to other matters. The
                Assembly has no power to pass legislation requiring Ministers or
                Departments to do anything which discriminates against any
                person on the grounds of religious belief or political opinion.
                The Act also requires equality schemes to be prepared by public
                offices. These are critical functions for the Northern Ireland
                Executive Committee, and they will require sustained ministerial
                oversight.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have given a picture of the functions of
                the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister,
                and I have underlined the wide range and critical importance of
                those functions in a number of crucial areas but particularly in
                respect of matters of policy co-ordination. This is a remarkable
                burden that the Deputy First Minister and I have to carry, and
                it was for that reason that I reached the conclusion that we
                urgently need ministerial deputies to whom much of the
                day-to-day work could be delegated and done under our joint
                supervision.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In mentioning the extent of the burden, I do
                not intend in any way to diminish the role of other ministerial
                colleagues in running their Departments, but I think that it
                will be acknowledged that the First Minister and the Deputy
                First Minister have a role in their own Department and in and
                through the Executive Committee which differs significantly from
                that of a departmental Minister.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister (Mr Mallon):</b> It
                is crucially important that the work of the Office of the First
                Minister and the Deputy First Minister should not suffer from
                the attention of its Ministers being focused on the wider issues
                that the Administration as a whole has to face and the very
                demanding representative role that they both have to play at
                regional, national and international level. Accordingly, the
                First Minister and I have decided that it would be in the best
                interests of our Department if it were to be assisted by two
                junior Ministers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to say how we propose junior Ministers
                should operate and how they should be appointed. Junior
                Ministers would operate entirely under the direction and control
                of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister, who will
                remain responsible to the Assembly for all that happens in that
                office. That is as it should be.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister and the Deputy First
                Minister operate jointly, decisions have to be taken jointly,
                and in appointing junior Ministers we must have regard to that.
                Each of the two junior Ministers will be responsible for
                assisting the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister in
                the exercise of their functions in relation to the Office of the
                First Minister and the Deputy First Minister.</p>

                also answer in respect of their particular brief?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A Member:</p>

                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr Ian Paisley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And in Committees.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will deal with that matter later. As I have
                said, in parallel with the joint responsibility of the First
                Minister and the Deputy First Minister, each of the two junior
                Ministers will have joint responsibility. However, within that
                arrangement there is substantial specific and urgent work for
                junior Ministers to take forward, particularly with regard to
                the Economic Policy Unit, the Equality Unit and work on
                community relations, the Civic Forum and victims. That is a huge
                panoply within the Equality Unit — so huge that when we were
                in serious deliberations about Departments many Members, with
                some justification, advocated that the issue of equality should
                have a Department of its own. I am conscious of the fact that
                there are enormous amounts of work to be done in that unit, not
                least in relation to the question of women’s rights and the
                rights of children.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is understood that it may arise that the
                junior Ministers, rather than the First Minister and the Deputy
                First Minister, should appear before Assembly Committees to
                answer questions. We will make arrangements in the Office of the
                First Minister and the Deputy First Minister to decide how
                junior Ministers will appear and exercise accountability to the
                Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There have already been suggestions that the
                appointment of junior Ministers should be taken forward by using
                the d’Hondt mechanism which led to the appointment of
                Ministers to this Executive. I understand why that may seem
                superficially attractive. The First Minister and Deputy First
                Minister need to have full confidence in the junior Ministers.
                Those junior Ministers will act under the direction and control
                of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister and will pursue
                policy objectives that are endorsed by both of us.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To draw junior Ministers from other parties
                would cause difficulties in at least two ways. First, there
                would be difficulties for the junior Ministers themselves. They
                would need to subordinate their own political views to those of
                the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister in carrying
                forward the policy and direction that is jointly established by
                us. Secondly, there would be difficulties in terms of our
                confidence in junior Ministers who hold different political
                philosophies and beliefs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have made it clear that this is an initial
                determination. On the basis of the merits of the arguments, we
                shall have to consider whether other colleagues will also need
                junior Ministers. Given the limited amount of time that they
                have been in post, it has not been possible to form a sensible
                judgement about that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is one safeguard worth mentioning. Any
                future determination for junior Ministers will automatically
                result in junior Ministers who are appointed under this
                determination ceasing to hold office. In other words, any future
                determination must cover all junior ministerial appointments.
                That means that there is no question of our adding to the number
                of junior Ministers without the Assembly’s being able to view
                the overall position and form a judgement about whether the
                allocation of junior Ministers is in line with the needs of
                government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have therefore determined, as we were
                empowered to do by section 19(1) of the Northern Ireland Act
                1998, that two Members will be appointed as junior Ministers,
                that the appointments will be made by the First Minister and the
                Deputy First Minister acting jointly, and that the function of
                the junior Ministers will be to assist the First Minister and
                the Deputy First Minister in the exercise of the full range of
                policy responsibilities of their Office.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This determination meets specific identified
                needs. Good government requires the appointment of junior
                Ministers in the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy
                First Minister to carry forward the important policy areas that
                the Assembly has decided should reside there.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In order to avoid confusion, may I point out
                that when the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister are
                acting jointly that will be identified as such on the Order
                Paper. Therefore any proposal by them will be a joint proposal.
                That is why, as in this case, Members will find both of them
                speaking at the same point in the debate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When they table a motion to which both names
                are appended but are not specifically acting as the First
                Minister and the Deputy First Minister, one of them may move a
                motion and make the winding-up speech, or one may move the
                motion and the other deliver the winding-up speech. There is a
                difference between that and the provisions in the Initial
                Standing Orders under which only one person could move a motion
                and deliver the winding-up speech. I mention that to avoid
                confusion and because it may be relevant to the amendment in the
                names of Dr Paisley and Mr Dodds.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dodds:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;this Assembly, keeping in mind that the
                First Minister and the Deputy First Minister have already six
                paid assistants in their Office, disapproves their determination
                to appoint two further, junior Ministers.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The amendment stands in my name and that of
                Rev Dr Ian Paisley. First, I listened carefully to the First
                Minister and the Deputy First Minister and heard the list of
                responsibilities which the First Minister read out. Any Minister
                could list a considerable number of responsibilities, some of
                them in a broad range of policy areas, yet Ministers have one
                special adviser and one private office. Let us set this matter
                in context. Members will recall that when proposals were being
                drawn up about the membership of the Assembly, the Democratic
                Unionist Party made it clear that 108 Members were far too many.
                However, it was agreed that there should be 108 Members.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If I am correct, this happened at the
                particular insistence of one of the smaller parties, which did
                not succeed in getting elected to this House. It was adamant
                that six Members should be elected from each of the 18
                constituencies. The number of Members was dictated not by the
                interests or the needs of the people of Northern Ireland but by
                political considerations and for political interests.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.00 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Similarly, when the House determined the
                number of Departments, it was clear to many of us that there was
                no real justification in having 10 Departments to serve the
                people of Northern Ireland and meet the needs of the community.
                As we pointed out at the time, the Deputy First Minister, Mr
                Mallon, was on record in a Sunday newspaper as saying that this
                happened for political reasons, to ensure that sufficient places
                were created to satisfy the political demands of parties in the
                House.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Once again, to satisfy paper needs, there is
                a proposal for two junior Ministers for the Office of the First
                Minister and the Deputy First Minister. Nothing said by the two
                Gentlemen who have spoken has given any real justification for
                the appointment of two more Ministers, no doubt with two more
                private offices, more civil servants at their beck and call and
                special advisers in addition to those already there — three
                special advisers, each with a private office.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When one considers what is already at the
                disposal of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister to
                assist them in the execution of the various duties which they
                are asked to perform under the terms of the legislation and by
                agreement with the House, one cannot sensibly come to the
                conclusion that this justifies the appointment of two more
                Ministers — other than for the purposes of putting political
                appointees in positions and creating jobs for the boys.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was interested to hear Mr Mallon say that
                it would not be possible or feasible or realistic to have junior
                Ministers who did not have the same political affiliation as
                their principals. Yet we have a First Minister and a Deputy
                First Minister who are of different parties.</p>

                address them to Mr Mallon. There will be opportunities in the
                debate for others to participate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The reality is that the argument that junior
                Ministers may not be from different political parties does not
                stand up. The two senior Gentlemen are from different political
                parties, and the Government is made up of different political
                parties.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I find it disturbing that the determination
                contains no job description for these junior Ministers. We know
                only that they will assist the First Minister and the Deputy
                First Minister in the exercising of their functions. What
                functions these junior Ministers will exercise has been left
                completely open, and we are to be asked to vote for them even
                though we do not know specifically what they will do. After
                hearing from the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister we
                still do not know exactly what the lines of accountability are
                going to be. Will the junior Ministers come forward to answer
                questions in this House on behalf of the First Minister and the
                Deputy First Minister? Will they go to the Committee of the
                Centre?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that we will eventually get a
                Committee set up to examine the functions of the Centre, for,
                having taken the decision last week to set up two Standing
                Committees, I notice that this week we are going to abolish
                those Committees and set up a different one.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the junior Ministers stand in for their
                superiors in the Committee? That has not been indicated either.
                It is quite clear that there is no real justification for these
                appointments. It is purely a case of ensuring a little bit more
                political patronage so that Mr Trimble and Mr Mallon can satisfy
                members of their own parties.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Northern Ireland will be the most
                over-governed part of Europe that it is possible to imagine,
                with many Ministers, junior Ministers, Assembly Members,
                councils and quangos. The House is aware of the feedback from
                the community last week, yet here we are, on the proposal of the
                First Minister and the Deputy First Minister, once again being
                asked to spend more on posts that are unnecessary in terms of
                the functioning of the Office of the First Minister and the
                Deputy First Minister. Two Ministers are surely enough. They
                would not want to admit that they are not up to carrying out all
                the functions that are within the remit of this determination.
                Are they saying that they cannot handle it, that they do not
                have the time to do it, or that other pressing engagements take
                up their time and they need extra help? No proper, coherent case
                has been presented. It is clearly a case of jobs for the boys,
                and the House should reject it.</p>

                substantive motion. If the amendment falls, there will be a vote

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McLaughlin:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a Chathaoirligh. Sinn
                Féin will vote against the amendment. We recognise the need for
                junior Ministers. That has been our consistent position.
                However, we have considerable difficulty with the determination
                because it is so imprecise. Why is the Assembly being asked to
                vote for what will be virtually a blank cheque for the First
                Minister and Deputy First Minister?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have agreed and have given authority to
                the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister to nominate and
                appoint, but we require them to give us specific information
                about the functions. The documentation states that the junior
                Ministers will assist the First Minister and the Deputy First
                Minister in exercising of their functions. That has to qualify
                as the most indeterminate determination possible.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The point was well made by the proposer of
                the amendment that the Assembly is not equipped with the
                information that would allow it to make an informed decision. Is
                there any good reason why the Assembly was not afforded the
                courtesy of such information? Why should Assembly Members have
                to rely on media speculation about what is in the minds of the
                First Minister and the Deputy First Minister? Even a home help
                would be given a job description. This is a serious issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is possibly a disagreement about how
                the functions of the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy
                First Minister should be divided. Perhaps a convention of
                &quot;I’ll have whatever you’re having, and let us set aside
                all this trouble with accountability, proportionality and
                inclusiveness&quot; has been arrived at.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If this Assembly is about anything, it is
                about a new beginning. We should set jobbery behind us for ever.
                Throughout the tortuous process that brought the Assembly into
                existence, Sinn Féin campaigned for transparency and
                accountability. We argued for checks and balances, democratic
                inclusiveness and proportionality. We have campaigned, as every
                party here will testify, for senior stand-alone Departments to
                be established for equality and children’s rights. We have
                also argued vociferously that the Office of the First Minister
                and the Deputy First Minister is top-heavy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is not surprising that there is a need for
                junior Ministers. If we had gone for a more equitable
                distribution across the Departments, this issue might not now be
                before the House. Despite our disappointment at losing those
                arguments in last year’s negotiations, Sinn Féin Members were
                hopeful that our concerns would be addressed by the First
                Minister and the Deputy First Minister. Regrettably that has not
                happened. They have spurned an opportunity to demonstrate a
                wider vision for our society. They have chosen to forgo an
                opportunity to set aside party political interests for the wider
                interest. It is a matter of great regret that they have chosen
                jobs for the boys rather than inclusion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Office of the Centre is to become a
                closed shop for the Ulster Unionist Party and the SDLP. In their
                remarks, neither the First Minister nor the Deputy First
                Minister had the grace to admit that that is their position.
                Sinn Féin will vote against the motion and against the
                amendment. We shall ask the First Minister and the Deputy First
                Minister to reconsider this matter, both in terms of the
                specified functions of the junior Ministers and in respect of
                the benefits to the new political process of an inclusive
                approach that could bring some of the smaller parties into the
                frame. Go raibh míle maith agat.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ford:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As has already been said, this is a rerun of
                the debate of 15 and 16 February, when we covered the report
                from the then First Minister (Designate) and Deputy First
                Minister (Designate). In that debate Members expressed concern
                about openness and accountability. As Mr McLaughlin says, we
                also discussed the setting up of Departments and the issue of
                equality, human rights, community relations and victims needing
                a Department of their own.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The determination is extraordinarily vague. I
                wish I had thought of the &quot;indeterminate
                determination&quot; line. I listened to the First Minister and
                Deputy First Minister, and I think that we have at least
                established something a little bit more determinate than was
                initially put on paper. It would have been much better if it had
                been put on paper in the first place. We seem to be discussing
                two major functions — the economic policy unit, with European
                connections and all that that implies, and the equality human
                rights, et cetera agenda. It is sad that issues such as
                community relations and victims’ rights are now regarded as an
                &quot;et cetera&quot;. We have not had the level of detail I had
                hoped for, although the Ministers did start to put a little
                flesh on the bones.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am concerned about their raising the issue
                of confidence between Ministers and junior Ministers. Perhaps it
                is a statement of the current situation. Confidence is not
                exactly brimming over in the Chamber. It is understandable that
                people want their friends beside them. One reason Alliance Party
                Members will not take any junior Ministerial posts is that we do
                not see that as a viable option for a party which has no seats
                in the Executive. I welcome the Deputy First Minister’s
                assurance that any future determination on junior Ministers will
                affect the existing appointments. Therefore the matter has to be
                kept under review.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have considerable problems with the
                amendment proposed by the DUP. Mr Dodds eloquently explained
                some of the problems but failed to outline many of the
                solutions. Had he been querying the six paid assistants, rather
                than the appointment of junior Ministers, he might have had more
                sympathy from my party.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McLaughlin asked for some information. I
                hope that the Ministers, when they wind up, will add to the
                information given so far. I take issue with him on one point. He
                said that the arguments were not won — referring to the
                setting up of Departments in the December statement. Some
                Members did win the arguments, but the two largest parties
                dictated what was going to happen. Members will have to take
                issue on how that will be handled when the four-year review
                comes up. Clearly there are problems. Junior Ministers are
                needed now because the only alternative is to reconsider the way
                the 10 Departments were cast last December. It has only taken
                Members 51 weeks to realise the mistakes that were made.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I ask the Ministers to be more specific than
                they were in their opening speeches. Will they assure Members
                that there will be real roles for junior Ministers? These have
                been hinted at, but will there be real and clearly defined roles
                for these two Ministers, and for any future junior Ministers,
                before the determination is laid before the House — not a week
                or two after it?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Mallon said that the Ministers will decide
                how the junior Ministers will answer to the Assembly. Can an
                assurance be given that Members will be told exactly how this
                will be done, if not at the end of this debate, then soon after?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One important possible use of junior
                Ministers has been ignored so far — namely, on those important
                cases where cross-departmental issues arise (for example, family
                and children’s issues). I was nearly going to include the
                environment, which is supposed to be at the heart of the
                Government, but Mr Foster has left, and he might not have
                appreciated it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Issues relating to families and children are
                of major concern across a number of Departments. Can Members be
                assured that the issue will be taken on board and properly
                co-ordinated within the Centre?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr B Hutchinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also oppose this motion. I oppose it on the
                grounds of the briefs of the junior Ministers, which my party
                would argue are far too broad and do not give an opportunity for
                an impact to be made on the workload and responsibilities of the
                Assembly. It would have been better if the appointments were to
                Departments other than the Office of the First and the Deputy
                First Minister. An obvious choice, and many parties have
                mentioned it, would have been a junior Minister for children. We
                are also concerned about the lack of information and believe
                that it makes it impossible for my party to support the motion
                standing in the names of the First Minister and the Deputy First
                Minister.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I listened to Sinn Féin’s response. It
                seems that it is arguing for a slice of the cake rather than
                considering how the posts would best serve the community.
                Mitchel McLaughlin said that even home helps would have a job
                description — people who serve the elderly just as well as two
                junior Ministers would serve the Centre. Members must put this
                into context. I am sure that there will be an opportunity
                tomorrow to talk about what this is going to cost, and the money
                that the four parties which sit in Government will receive above
                the basic wage.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If an impact is going to be made, Members
                must ensure that people are put in positions where they can work
                across Departments and not just in one area.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am also concerned about the appointment of
                these two junior Ministers. In annex 1(a) of the report of 15
                February 1999, the functions of the Office of the First Minister
                and the Deputy First Minister were laid out. I note that there
                were 26 functions. It seems that some of these have now been cut
                back or disappeared altogether. The determination is so general
                that it does not tell Members which of these functions are going
                to be delegated to junior Ministers and which will remain with
                the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we are proposing to pay a junior Minister
                £55,341 we should require the post to have a job description.
                This represents an increase of £17,305 on a Member’s salary
                — assuming that the Member does not already hold another
                position.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly has already paid out £652,216
                — in terms of the allocation of the posts of First Minister
                and Deputy First Minister, Chairpersons, Deputy Chairpersons and
                Assembly Commissioners — to the four parties in the
                Government. Before any more appointments are made each post
                should have a detailed job description, especially if it
                commands a substantial salary.</p>

                understand that the members of the Assembly Commission operate
                on a non-party basis and do not necessarily represent their
                parties when making decisions. The Assembly will decide, and
                Members should bear that in mind. If they want to be smart, they
                should get the facts.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The point I was making is that in acting in
                that interest they have allocated £652,216 to four particular
                parties. It is with that concern in mind that I stress that we
                must be held accountable. Therefore we should have job
                descriptions for the posts we continue to allocate. None of the
                parties are opposed to the position of junior Minister; we
                simply want to know in detail what that junior Minister is
                expected to do.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issue that we come across during our
                constituency work — and this has already been debated in the
                Assembly — is that we have missed a trick by not looking at
                the needs of families and children. Northern Ireland is now the
                only devolved region that has not got a ministerial portfolio
                for families and children. Wales and Scotland have such a
                portfolio.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion is about the Office of the First
                Minister and the Deputy First Minister, and, again, I am
                concerned about the functions contained in that Office.
                Yesterday I was concerned that two Ministers, each with his own
                portfolio, took on the portfolio of &quot;Minister for some
                victims&quot; when they should have been attending to their own
                portfolios elsewhere.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need to respond to the desperate needs in
                the community. Members who listened to last week’s debates
                should note in particular the issue of the memorial fund —
                this was raised by victims — and the lack of money coming from
                that fund to those who have suffered. The question victims
                constantly ask me — and I am sure they ask other Members —
                is &quot;Whom do we go to?&quot; It seems that Adam Ingram has
                this portfolio as a reserved responsibility. If the Office of
                the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister has a function
                in relation to victims, what is it exactly? Is it intented that
                all four Ministers and Adam Ingram should share this function
                between them?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am also concerned that women’s issues, as
                usual, are last on the agenda. I am not sure if that is because
                women are far down in the alphabet or because that is where
                certain people consider they should be — the responsibility of
                a junior Minister.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need to pay attention to this. If a junior
                Ministry on women’s issues had been established we might well
                have asked why, if the process of nominations to these bodies
                and implementation bodies is so transparent and so accountable,
                only 25% of the nominees are women. If we in Northern Ireland
                are to give ourselves the fresh start which the agreement
                constantly speaks about, then we have to move away from what has
                been referred to today over and over again as jobs for the boys
                — though I assume that sometimes those boys are men.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My party is opposed to the amendment. The
                position of paid assistants will be discussed in a later debate
                and has no relevance at this time to the appointment of junior
                Ministers.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCartney:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker, I am sure that you, along with
                the other Members of this Assembly, will recall that in George
                Orwell’s ‘Animal Farm’ it was the pigs who were in charge
                of the operation and that Napoleon the pig pointed out that,
                while all animals were equal, some — namely the pigs — were
                more equal than others. A point has been well made here that the
                major parties, particularly the SDLP and the Ulster Unionists,
                have hogged the spoils of devolution. What has happened today is
                another example of this.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Even the harsh critics of the peace process
                and of devolution — those on the editorial columns of the ‘Belfast
                Telegraph’ and the ‘News Letter’ — were somewhat put out
                last week to find that one of the Assembly’s first acts was to
                vote its Members a pay rise. And I made some comments about
                that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am glad that Prof McWilliams has raised
                this point again, because this is another example of jobs being
                allotted to Members of the major parties. Can anyone here doubt
                for a moment that Mr Trimble will appoint one of the worthies
                from the Ulster Unionist Party or that Mr Mallon will feel most
                comfortable with a member of the SDLP? In relation to the
                cross-border bodies, I have already referred to the basis upon
                which it appeared to me — and, I believe, to many members of
                the public — the four aspirants for office in the quangos were
                appointed from the ranks of the Unionist Party, and we are
                having a rerun here.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was under the illusion that the Executive
                (indeed, the entire Assembly) was based not on the usual
                principle under which democracies operate — there being a
                majority and an Opposition which hopes to become the majority by
                persuading people to its way of thinking — but on this
                wonderful new consensus democracy. It was to be hands across the
                ocean and across the border, and everybody was to work in the
                spirit of political ecumenism.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We were to have a First Minister and a Deputy
                First Minister who were to work like a pair of Siamese twins
                joined at hip and thigh, and they were going to operate for the
                betterment of the entire community. Instead, we heard in the
                Deputy First Minister’s speech the suggestion that what is
                really needed to make this process work is a junior Minister who
                is not only a person from your own party but also someone you
                can trust implicitly because you may have to deal with the enemy
                within — that, of course, being Mr Trimble and his chum, who
                will be close by him protecting his back against the ravages of
                the SDLP.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Not at the moment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is the scenario that we have. When I was
                a member of the Standing Orders Committee I indicated that the
                great danger in the Assembly — at that stage members of the
                minority parties and even Sinn Féin agreed with me — was that
                we would have a very strong centralised Executive dominated by
                the two major parties, who would essentially carve up
                everything. The SDLP could always deliver the Nationalists no
                matter what Sinn Féin thought, and the Ulster Unionist Party
                could always deliver, or almost deliver, the Unionists. Between
                them they would carve up everything and divide the spoils.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am in favour of this amendment. The
                Assembly, the Executive and all its outworkings are expensive
                and, in many cases, unnecessary and, I venture, will be
                inefficient. When I had discussions with Mr Mallon about the
                number of Departments, it became perfectly plain — as Mr Dodds
                has pointed out — that the criterion was not efficiency or
                having the right number to deliver an effective administration.
                They decided there should be 10 Departments because, under the d’Hondt
                system which had already been worked out, that would make for
                harmony. There would be five Nationalist and five Unionist
                Ministers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There was no need for 10 Departments and 108
                Members. In Scotland, where the population is three times that
                in Northern Ireland and where they have greater devolved powers,
                which include the tax-raising power, there are 129 Members. If
                they were pro rata with Northern Ireland they would have 350
                Members. Similarly, Wales would have 218 Members instead of 60.
                Mr Dodds is absolutely correct in saying that the Assembly is
                completely overburdened given the number of Members and the
                Executive. However, having got that far, we have spawned, on the
                consensus principle, two First Ministers, 10 Ministers, 10
                Committee Chairmen, with the possibility of an additional two,
                and 12 Deputy Chairmen, all of whom are on the payroll. Now we
                are to have two quite unnecessary junior Ministers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I raised the issue of salaries being paid to
                the porkers in the House of Commons when the power to appoint
                junior Ministers was discussed. It was not sufficient that we
                were to be overburdened with Members and Ministers — the
                porkers — but we were going to be able to let the First
                Minister and the Deputy First Minister, as a matter of largesse
                and patronage, deliver fodder to the piglets, the baby Ministers
                and junior Ministers. The Deputy First Minister did not say that
                this was to be the end of the breeding pen of the piglets. He
                hinted that by a process, perhaps of artificial insemination,
                more litters of piglets would be delivered to the other
                Ministers. He was not ruling out the possibility that these baby
                porkers would be snuffling away at the fodder at some future
                date. We could have 10 little grunters all snouting about, each
                playing a role as a gofer for their respective Ministers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Prof McWilliams and the other Members got it
                right when they spoke eloquently about the lack of definition in
                the duties of these baby Ministers. They do not have anything
                specific assigned to them. They are going to be gofer piglets
                — &quot;go for this&quot; and &quot;go for that&quot;. They
                will be at the beck and call of the First Minister and the
                Deputy First Minister, and they will have to be friendly little
                piglets who grunt at the correct time because the large boars
                would be discomfited by having people beside them who were not
                happy with what they were being asked to do.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I speak of this in jest, but there is a very
                important, underlying principle which the public should be
                alerted to. It is the principle that public funds will be
                provided out of the block grant or from an increase in the
                regional rate — funds that will not be spent on hospitals or
                children’s issues or a myriad of social and economic needs and
                requirements. They are going to be spent on fodder for the
                piglets. It is all about jobs for the boys.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us look at the First Minister and the
                Deputy First Minister. Between them they will employ six special
                advisers on a scale between £22,000 and £70,000. Rest assured
                few of them will come in at the bottom of the scale. These
                advisers are specialists who must have particular esoteric
                knowledge to advise the heavyweights whom they serve. They are
                going to cost a lot of money and will be at the beck and call of
                the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister. Of course that
                is only the top layer — the close chums to whom the new
                Minister will be added. There is also a raft of highly qualified
                civil servants with specific tasks who will be assisting the
                First Minister and the Deputy First Minister in the discharge of
                their duties.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The truth is that these junior Ministers are
                being appointed for the purpose of affording another means of
                party political control to the parties that really matter. The
                Northern Ireland Office was not interested in any of the little
                parties because none of them could deliver individually or
                collectively. Members of the Women’s Coalition, the
                Progressive Unionist Party and the Alliance Party should be
                under no illusions that they have any clout here. They do not.
                They are here to make up the numbers. It was necessary to have
                108 Members for the purpose of distribution. Members should
                realise that far from being a democratic Assembly this is an
                Assembly created by the machinations of the Northern Ireland
                Office to serve the interests of the British Government. The
                numbers, the distributions, the system and the placing of power
                in an Executive are designed to serve those interests.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was surprised when I read two speeches of
                the Secretary of State, Mr Mandelson, in which he talked about
                an Assembly that was accountable to the Executive. He talked not
                about an Executive that was accountable to the Assembly but
                about an Assembly that was accountable to the Executive — and
                that was repeated twice. I pointed this out to Senator George
                Mitchell. He said that he would take it up with the Secretary of
                State, but he thought that perhaps it was a mistake. If it was a
                mistake it was one that was repeated not once but twice, and it
                was never remedied.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the wider scope of things Members may ask
                what Bob McCartney is talking about — this is about two junior
                Ministers. These two junior Ministers and the power of the two
                major parties to appoint them goes right to the heart of the
                matter. It is an example of the power that will continue to be
                exercised through the Executive by the SDLP and the Ulster
                Unionist Party.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some parties in the Assembly are not minnows;
                they are budding herrings. I am talking about Sinn Féin and the
                DUP — both substantial parties in their own right, but in this
                game not carrying a great deal more clout than the smaller
                parties collectively.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the amendment. This is an example
                of unnecessary political jobbery. Nothing has ever arisen to
                show us that it is necessary. I share and sympathise with the
                views of Monica McWilliams and others about the criteria or job
                descriptions for these posts. The reason there is no clearly
                defined job description — a Minister for children’s issues,
                a Minister for women and children’s issues, or a Minister for
                any of the other matters — is that this is not about servicing
                a need. These appointments are about servicing party needs.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the amendment. At a sitting of the
                Assembly on 15 February 1999 I did not move the motion that I
                had given notice of to have your position as Presiding Officer
                of the House formally endorsed and for you to become permanent
                Presiding Officer of the New Assembly, as it was then.</p>

                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;When I first considered placing this
                motion before the Assembly, it was reasonable for me to expect
                that it would have the support of all parties. However, over the
                past few days it has become clear to me that the prospect of
                all-party support for the motion has disappeared. Indeed, I have
                received reasonably sound information to suggest that the SDLP
                and the Ulster Unionist Party intend to oppose it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I feel that I have a duty to make clear the
                reasons for these parties’ opposition to the motion to
                everyone in the Chamber, to those in the Galleries, and to the
                wider public. It gives an indication of the shape of things to
                come. We will have in the Assembly what in the business world
                would be known as a cartel. Those who have been preaching the
                gospel of inclusivity and responsibility sharing are about to
                carve up between them all the positions of responsibility in the
                Assembly. These jobs for the boys will be shared between the
                Ulster Unionists and the SDLP.&quot;</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I mentioned that this was the shape of things
                to come, and what we are witnessing today is a further
                outworking of exactly that mentality. We have heard words like
                &quot;inclusiveness&quot; and the high-sounding reasons for
                bringing people together to share responsibility and authority.
                The reality is, Mr Speaker, that in the weeks to come you will
                need to fix yourself very firmly to your seat. There will
                probably be people here eyeing up your position, not because
                they believe that they have more ability or that they would
                serve the Assembly better than you, but because of the job and
                the money that goes with it.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Over the years many of us have listened to
                the gross accusation that the old Stormont, the ancien régime,
                existed on the basis of corruption, that it was based on jobs
                for the boys and that Catholics need not apply. <i>[Interruption]</i>
                I hear people from the SDLP shouting &quot;Hear, hear.&quot; Of
                course, it was black propaganda; it was lies. The reality is
                that today the SDLP are party to corruption. They are party to a
                decision that is about jobs for the boys, and people who are not
                part and parcel of their party, people who are not yes-men, need
                not apply. Over 400 jobs in the Assembly are to be advertised,
                and there have been allegations that those jobs will also be
                jobs for the boys.</p>

                in relation to this matter, given the fact that your own two
                Ministers appointed parliamentary private secretaries without
                even coming to the Assembly to tell us that you had done so. You
                did this quietly and at your own bidding; nobody else asked you
                to do that, and you attempted to employ them.</p>

                the attention of Mr Maginness.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My party pays certain members to fulfil a
                political role, and it raises money to do so. It is perfectly
                entitled to do that. The money does not come out of the public
                budget or out of the Assembly’s purse. It is hard-earned
                money, and we can do as we wish with it. There is nothing
                corrupt about this; we did not have to bring it before the
                Assembly for approval by the Member or his party. <i>[Interruption]</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We did not. It was a decision made within our

                Assemblies across Europe there are in parties similar
                functionaries who are paid to fulfil a certain role.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issue is that in the first few days of
                the Assembly, since the Executive was established, we have seen
                more exploitation by the SDLP and the Ulster Unionists. We have

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The SDLP puts out the long arm to Europe,
                pulls back a former member and puts him in the First Minister’s
                Office. I have not found out whether he is still being paid by
                the European Parliament.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Paisley Jnr:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In today’s ‘Irish News’ it is suggested
                that the SDLP are paying daughters of Members with regard to the
                new posts that were established yesterday in Armagh. That point
                will raise its head again and again. Other Members referred to
                an article in the ‘Irish News’ which states that a number of
                positions have been given to party hacks and party faithful. I
                will not go over the names that Members have already read into
                the record.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">None of the posts the First Minister and the
                Deputy First Minister are asking us to vote for have been
                equality-tested. We hear about equality and fair representation,
                but these posts have been tested to see who is fit to follow
                every whim of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister.
                Those who match up to that standard will be appointed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The comments made by the First Minister and
                the Deputy First Minister have exposed the fact that Northern
                Ireland is to be over-bureaucratised. For years democrats across
                Northern Ireland have complained that there is not enough people
                power, that we do not have democracy and that we need real and
                accountable democracy and access to the levers of power. Over
                the past few months there has been an increase in bureaucracy
                and a decrease in democracy. In the past, three Ministers
                serviced six Departments. Now we have 10 Departments and 10
                Ministers, and we are to have two junior Ministers. That is an
                increase in bureaucracy, not an increase in democracy, and that
                is sad.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Who is to pay for these junior Ministers? The
                answer is that the money will come from the public purse.
                Mr&nbsp;Durkan (the Finance Minister) and Mr McGimpsey have been
                on the radio voicing their concerns about the budget and how
                they hope to make the figures add up. They will need a creative
                accountant, some stir-frying and bit of cooking to get the books
                to balance. The amount that will be taken from the public purse
                to service the new appointments will be a public scandal. I do
                not often agree with the leader of the Women’s Coalition, but
                she pointed to the tip of the iceberg when she spoke about how
                much this will cost.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What is the real purpose of these
                appointments? Is it accountability, transparency, openness and
                real democracy? The reason for appointing the two junior
                Ministers — Ministers literally without portfolio who can
                stick their noses into any business the First Minister and the
                Deputy First Minister decide — is to prevent proper Assembly
                scrutiny of the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy
                First Minister. Their actions will cover over what the First
                Minister and the Deputy First Minister are doing and prevent the
                establishment of proper scrutiny Committees to examine and
                probe.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the commencement of this debate Mr Mallon
                said</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;It was in the best interests of our
                Departments&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After voting for an exorbitant pay rise, he
                now wants someone else to do his job. As Mr Dodds said, if the
                Deputy First Minister and the First Minister do not feel up to
                the job, they should resign. To appoint someone else to do the
                jobs that they are paid to do is a scandal. The Deputy First
                Minister said that good government requires these posts. Good
                government does not require a waste of resources or the
                extending of bureaucracy and the diminishing of democracy. When
                Mr Dodds moved the amendment on behalf of my party he spoke
                about sincerity. I share the view that the First Minister and
                the Deputy First Minister are not sincere when they talk about
                equality, openness and transparency. Theirs is the most
                insincere position of all.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us call a spade a spade. This is a
                carve-up for party political purposes. I noted the comments of
                Sinn Féin inside and outside the Chamber. They were crying
                crocodile tears and saying that these junior Ministers should
                not be appointed: &quot;Appoint us instead. Appoint Sinn Féin.
                Give us the jobs.&quot;</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They do not object to the waste of resources
                or to the abuse of the democratic process. What they object to
                is that they have not been given the jobs, and that is another
                public scandal.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Perhaps the Member could inform me if he and
                his party are declaring that they have no interest in any
                further junior ministerial appointments and that they would
                eschew any nomination for such?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the Member is confirming that his party
                will be proposing more and more junior Ministers and that he
                wants those posts because he probably will not get this one —
                he got a chairmanship last week — that is a matter for him,
                and I look forward to those proposals.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My party has made its position clear in the
                amendment, and anyone who supports our position can vote for the
                amendment. I hope that we will get support. It would not serve
                the purposes of open and transparent democracy for the motion in
                the name of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister to
                be passed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Before giving way to Mr Haughey I mentioned
                Sinn Féin’s using this for cover because it wants these jobs
                for the boys. It believes that this is the way it can justify
                what it has been about over the years. The more jobs available,
                the more access to power Sinn Féin will get. Of course, it
                makes Bobby Sands’s stance all the better. It proves that it
                was right. Sinn Féin wants these jobs only to undermine and
                destroy this country. It has no interest in preserving or
                defending it or making it run better.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let me send a warning to the First Minister
                and the Deputy First Minister and to the parties. They will
                probably proceed with these appointments. They will pick party
                hacks and party faithful. We have already heard the public
                outcry against certain Ministers with links to terrorist
                organisations who are now in the new Executive. May I suggest
                that if they are interested in salvaging what little credibility
                they have, they should not appoint these junior Ministers. If
                they are to appoint junior Ministers, let them be careful about
                whom they do appoint. According to speculation in the local
                press, certain names have been mentioned: people whom, in other
                places, the Law Society has described as unfit for public
                office; people who, in other places, have been told that they
                cannot practise alone as solicitors. If that is the calibre of
                people that the two parties are going to select, God help this
                country, and God help good government here. It is wrong and
                obnoxious to have this increase in largesse for the sole purpose
                of feathering the nests of the First Minister’s and the Deputy
                First Minister’s parties.</p>

                should be in a department of children’s rights, given that
                children make up one third of the population and we have the
                highest birth rate in the European Union. Many children live in
                areas of high and long-term unemployment, and 37% of them are
                affected by poverty. Also 39% of young people have mental health

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member supports what I am saying about a
                junior Minister for children.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In an average week three children under the
                age of 16 will be raped and a further 12 will be indecently
                assaulted. The overall picture in relation to children and
                children’s rights is a negative one. Sometimes I am ashamed
                that all the parties in the Assembly claim to represent the
                rights of children. However, when it comes to promoting those
                rights, their interest ends.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with some Members that it is a case
                of jobs for the boys. Although the 10 Departments all have a
                remit for children, there is not a holistic policy approach. I
                am also concerned to ensure that the appointment of junior
                Ministers should not be looked upon as another opportunity for
                the Ulster Unionist Party and the SDLP to appoint some of their
                Colleagues who missed out on becoming full Ministers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should send the clear message that we are
                here to deliver benefits and to recognise the sizeable section
                of our community which has so often been ignored. When speaking
                about children, Members often say that they will do this and
                that for them. However, when it comes to the bit, no one cares
                because children do not have a vote. We should send out a clear
                message that children’s rights should be at the centre of the
                Assembly.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the debate on the amendment many parties
                expressed concern about the way in which the proposal has been
                put forward, the lack of detail in terms of the functions that
                are described in the written determination and the notion that
                the two parties that are represented by the First Minister and
                the Deputy First Minister should take these two positions of
                patronage to bolster their party positions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our amendment is totally consistent. We have
                pointed to the fact that this is not the place to talk about
                special advisers. We have mentioned the extent of existing
                support for the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister and
                the raft of civil servants.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have not heard any proper case for the
                First Minister and the Deputy First Minister requiring two
                junior Ministers in addition to their raft of advisers and
                supporters to carry out the functions of that Office. It has
                clearly emerged during the debate that there is concern as to
                how the public will view this. Already a number of parties have
                described it as jobs for the boys. It is clear that that is what
                it is.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I urge Members to support our amendment. If a
                proper and reasonable case can be made, the First Minister and
                the Deputy First Minister can come back to the House. They have
                all the support and back-up that they need to carry out their
                current responsibilities. No proper case has been made for the
                appointment of these two junior Ministers. The determination is
                devoid of any job description or detail as to what these people
                are to do. I again urge Members to support the amendment.</p>

                theme of quite a few contributors. Mr McLaughlin was the first
                to state it when he referred to the determination as being too
                imprecise. Others said that when they first saw the

                determination necessarily used formal language. It had to refer
                to the range of functions of the Office of the First Minister
                and the Deputy First Minister. It would not have been possible
                for the determination to refer to specific matters.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several Members spoke about equality and they
                said how important that was. It is something we acknowledge. We
                appreciate how crucial the equality unit within the Office of
                the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister is going to be
                in the effective functioning of the Administration as a whole.
                We are well aware of the need to ensure that equality aspects
                have been properly examined with regard to every legislative
                measure and almost every policy issue. We know how important it
                is that legislative measures and policy issues should not be
                farmed out to 10 different Departments to have 10 different
                standards applied. There will be only one standard.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It would not have been wise to mention only
                that matter and to delegate it to a junior Minister. That would
                be to completely misunderstand the nature of the operation. This
                is not a delegation of any function of the Office of the First
                Minister and the Deputy First Minister. This is a matter of the
                appointment of junior Ministers who will act under the direction
                and control of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister
                at all times. No function will be delegated to them. We will
                give them work to do, and that work may well be in the area of
                equality.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was not appropriate, nor was it possible
                in terms of the formal language that is necessarily used in the
                determination, to assign specific roles to junior Ministers.
                Furthermore, when one considers the joint nature of the Office,
                Members will see how inappropriate that would be. It would be
                quite wrong for one junior Minister to be assigned to equality
                and another to the economic policy unit. That would clearly be
                wrong when it is a joint Office. We cannot have a joint Office
                shared between two parties and then delegate part of that Office
                to one party. That runs counter to the whole nature of the
                operation. While junior Ministers may be given a responsibility
                with regard to economic policy or equality, it will have to be
                done in a manner in which the Office operates as a whole. It
                will have to be done with a degree of joint approach, as is
                appropriate, and with the ability to adapt it to the needs of
                the particular situation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The determination necessarily had to cover
                the whole range of matters. However, the Deputy First Minister
                and I have a number of clear ideas in mind about what should be
                done and how it should be carried out. We also have a clear
                understanding of how it will have to be adjusted from time to
                time to meet the needs that are there.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The needs are considerable. I have mentioned
                the economic policy unit and the equality unit. They are major
                elements. However, there is also the very significant matter of
                cross-departmental issues. The agreement provides the First
                Minister and the Deputy First Minister with the task of
                co-ordinating policy across Departments. This is a more
                significant role with regard to this form of Administration than
                it would be with regard to a conventional one. As this is a
                multi-party Administration, a compulsory coalition of four
                different parties that do not always see eye to eye — indeed,
                we have difficulty seeing the eyes of some of our ministerial
                colleagues from time to time — the need for co-ordination at
                the centre becomes more important.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It adds to the burden because of the
                multi-party nature of the Administration as a whole and the
                multi-party nature of the Office of the First Minister and the
                Deputy First Minister. That underlines the need for this.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Reference was made to co-ordination on
                particular issues. That is something to which we will be paying
                very considerable attention. We are well aware of the need for a
                degree of co-ordination and focus on matters which do not fall
                within a single Department and where</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;communication and co-operation between
                departments may be difficult because of the nature of this
                compulsory coalition&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We will keep in mind particular things
                mentioned — for example, women’s issues and family issues.
                It is part of the responsibility of the Office of the First
                Minister and the Deputy First Minister to keep these
                cross-departmental issues in mind and to ensure that such
                matters do not lose out in the competition between Departments.
                I hope Members understand why the question of job descriptions
                is not appropriate. It is a matter of relating to the range of
                functions in the Office as a whole.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to touch on some particular
                issues very briefly. Reference was made to victims. It is
                somewhat unsatisfactory that certain functions remain within the
                Northern Ireland Office while others have come to a Northern
                Ireland Department. The Office of the First Minister and the
                Deputy First Minister has a role with regard to liaison, but
                Departments such as Social Development and Health, Social
                Services and Public Safety also have a role. We are aware of the
                need to give a priority to victims’ issues. I hope the
                Assembly will see before long that we have responded to it in a
                very particular way.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Children were mentioned. Equality,
                particularly in matters relating to targeting social need,
                covers the rights of children. They will continue to be a
                significant priority for us.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One comment was made which I thought was
                spectacularly inappropriate. That came, of course, from Mr
                McCartney, who said that this was not about servicing a need,
                but simply about patronage and departmental control between
                parties. That is utterly wrong. This is about serving a need.
                This is about ensuring that this Administration delivers a good
                quality service to the people of Northern Ireland as a whole. It
                is also about ensuring that, in spite of the unique nature of
                this Administration, what comes out at the end is co-ordinated
                and integrated, takes account of the crucial issues of equality
                and related matters and delivers a quality service to the
                people.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">May I first of all make reference to what I
                regard as a new low in the standard of contribution. I refer to
                that made by Mr Wilson. I will leave it at that, but at times in
                the debate I thought that some people plumbed the depths. I did
                not understand how low they could go.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not wish to cover ground which has
                already been covered by the First Minister. I wish to make a
                number of points as briefly as I possibly can. In doing so, I
                will not be able to make reference to all the points that were
                raised.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The question of a job description has been
                raised. Let us not forget that the reason for the Office of the
                First Minister and the Deputy First Minister rests in the Good
                Friday Agreement. This Office was not thought up, devised or
                schemed by the First Minister or myself. It was devised by all
                of the pro-agreement parties as a unique form of Administration
                which is not easy for anyone, and it will not be easy when it
                comes to making any decision. While we are engaged in
                craw-thumping, however, can we all remember that all the
                pro-agreement parties agreed this unique type of arrangement?</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">6.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">May I turn to job description — <i>[Interruption]
                </i>I will not give way. The hon Member’s party has had its
                say — and plenty of it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">May I very quickly list some of the areas the
                job description covers. There is the economic policy unit,
                which, in conjunction with the Department of Finance and
                Personnel, is one of the cross-cutting parts of the arrangement
                that the First Minister referred to. There is the equality unit,
                which many parties thought, as I said earlier, could stand with
                validity as a Department on its own. If that is the case, surely
                it deserves the type of junior Minister that we are talking
                about to ensure that it properly functions among the economic
                policy unit, European affairs, international affairs, the Civic
                Forum, victims, women’s issues, community relations, human
                rights, public appointments policy, machinery of government —
                to name just a few. The First Minister or myself did not decide
                these. They were decided in the agreement and in the legislation
                upon which the agreement is based. Let us not forget that. I
                would have thought that a fair job description of the type of
                function that will be required of junior Ministers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let me mention something that touched me
                deeply. Mr McLaughlin asked why the Assembly should rely on
                media speculation. Why indeed, especially when Mr McLaughlin’s
                party declared its position on this in a Sunday newspaper known
                as ‘Ireland on Sunday’ and demanded — not requested but
                demanded — one of these posts for Sinn Féin and one for the
                DUP? So when we are into the craw-thumping bit about costs let
                us remember that the craw-thumping can work in two directions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McLaughlin went further. He made a point
                of telling us that in the negotiations prior to the setting up
                of the Departments his party proposed that children’s issues
                should be a stand-alone Department. It did nothing of the sort,
                and it is on record that that is not the case. Those papers are
                on record, and I invite Mr McLaughlin and anyone else concerned
                to examine them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He also spoke about Sinn Féin’s
                contribution to the negotiating of — let me use these terms
                carefully — checks and balances in the arrangements for the
                Assembly. The reality is that during the two years those
                negotiations were taking place they opted out of any discussion
                on strand one — any discussion to do with the Assembly, the
                Office of the First and the Deputy First Minister, not to
                mention any checks or balances of that nature.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">May I also remind Mr McLaughlin that on the
                question of children’s rights — and that is a huge issue —
                his party holds the portfolios of the two Departments jointly
                responsible for bringing forward a children’s strategy, along
                with Mr Dodds in his ministerial position. Let us see how all
                Departments — and I mean all — handle children’s issues
                internally and elsewhere.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">May I also remind the House that one of the
                most important functions of the Office of the Centre will be its
                responsibility for targeting social need. It will also be
                responsible for overseeing human rights. Nowhere will that need
                — and the application of that need — be more evident than in
                ensuring the well-being of children.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would have liked to have the time to go
                through the contributions made by each Member, but I will make a
                few general points. I understand the position of Members who
                would like to have a junior Ministry for their party or who
                would like to have junior Ministries for various parties. So
                would I. If the First Minister and I had made a different
                decision it might have been easier — much easier — for us,
                but, while I do not want to get into the business of casting
                aspersions, I can think of some people in the DUP that I would
                not want to put in charge of children’s issues, women’s
                issues or any other issue. That would be to the detriment of
                this Administration.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If Members think about what I have said they
                may consider that it was said advisedly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I can think of others and other parties who
                have a craw-thumping attitude, but they stated publicly that
                they wanted a junior Minister. I would like to see all parties
                have a junior Minister. If that had been the proposal, would we
                have had the financial analysis that has been put forward today?
                Would we have had all this self-righteousness? Would we have had
                all the variation between pontification and the gutter stuff
                that we have heard from some quarters?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a serious and immediate need for the
                appointment of junior Ministers. I refer Members to that job
                description. I refer them to the future well-being of this
                Administration. I refer them to the fact — and reference was
                made to this — that it is right that Members of this Assembly
                should be appointed. There were one or two references to the
                fact that other advisers might be able to do this. That
                suggestion was implicit — other advisers might be able to do
                this. The First Minister and I could not possibly have agreed to
                that. That decision-making process is a matter for this House
                and no one else. It is most surprising, not to say almost
                shocking, that those who are and have been attacking the
                position of policy advisers may themselves have certain ideas on
                that matter, that they may themselves have made indications of
                that nature, that they may themselves recognise that there are a
                remarkable number of problems within any Department on which
                help and advice are needed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unfortunately I do not have the time to refer
                to every point that was made. However, all points will be
                replied to in writing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I look forward to the experience of applying
                the new targeting social need (TSN) in the Office of the First
                and Deputy First Ministers. In those circumstances I look
                forward to going to all the parties to tell them what the
                equality unit and equality legislation requires of them. I will
                try to explain to everyone that women’s issues and children’s
                issues should not be used as a political, emotional brush to
                beat people with. They are much too serious for that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is a crucial responsibility, and it is a
                responsibility which the First Minister and I are determined to
                fulfil. I will say it again: we need the two junior Ministers to
                ensure that the work in that job description is carried out and
                that the crucial issues, especially those which centre on TSN,
                economic policy, children, women and human rights, with other
                factors, are properly dealt with. That is what this is about,
                and I regret that some Members have helped to degrade a motion
                which is to the benefit of those in society who need it most.</p>

                order of the rest of the business. There are two motions in the
                name of Mr Conor Murphy which would make amendments to the
                Standing Orders that were agreed at the last sitting in respect
                of the two Committees that were set up to scrutinise the Office
                of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister. However,
                given the debate that is likely to ensue, not on the substantive
                motion that follows on the Committee of the Centre but on the
                amendment, there is the prospect, if the amendment and the
                substantive motion are carried, of negativing the two proposals
                in Mr Conor Murphy’s name and of those Committees, whose terms
                of reference are set out, no longer existing. For this reason I
                propose that we defer the two issues until later. Whether or not
                the two proposals remain competent will depend on the outcome of
                the votes on the Committee of the Centre proposal and the
                amendment. Given that this will save time, I am sure there will
                be general agreement.</p>

              unanimously voted through by the Assembly earlier this year. The
              reason is that the transitional sections in the Northern Ireland
              Act do not permit a decision taken by the New Northern Ireland
              Assembly on this matter to be carried forward beyond devolution.
              We must formally take the same decision again. The Register of
              Members’ Interests before devolution was desirable; it is now a
              legal requirement. It is impossible to get proper guidance without
              the Code of Conduct and Guide to the Rules, which are only

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker, you have answered some of my
              queries about the Register of Members’ Interests. I spoke to the
              Clerk of Standards on Friday 10 December and asked him why, by 21
              May 1999, 17 out of 18 Sinn Féin Members had not complied with
              the directive that this was to be completed by 30 April or with
              the letter of 30 April which said that we had to comply by 21 May.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Would it be in the public interest to find out
              why 17 of the 18 Sinn Féin Members had not declared their
              interests? What had they to hide? Do Mr Adams, Mr McGuinness and
              others in Sinn Féin have other incomes which should have been
              declared?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order. Let me repeat what I said. Prior to
              devolution there was no statutory requirement in respect of the
              Register. It may have been desirable to have interests declared,
              but there was no statutory requirement. That statutory requirement
              came with devolution, and it cannot be met without the passage of
              the Code of Conduct and Guide to the Rules.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I caution Members against raising matters of
              privilege on the Floor of the House, for a number of reasons. The
              due process is for such a matter to be raised with the Clerk of
              Standards — and the Member has indicated that he has indeed
              sought such guidance — and then, if appropriate, for it to be
              taken to the Standards and Privileges Committee.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If such a matter is to be raised on the Floor
              of the House, it ought to be contained in a motion on the Order
              Paper, and if it were to be debated on the Floor of the House
              tonight under the auspices of the current motion, two things would
              be accomplished besides those I have already mentioned. First, it
              could be argued that such a debate would diminish due process if
              the matter were later raised in the Standards and Privileges
              Committee. Secondly, if there were a vote on the matter, there
              would be no way of properly discussing any possibility of appeal.
              The proper process is to go through the Clerk of Standards and
              then to the Committee on Standards and Privileges, and any
              decision of that Committee could then be appealed on the Floor of
              the Assembly. If the matter had already been dealt with here,
              there would be no proper process for appeal. I strongly caution
              Members that this is not something that we should debate now,
              because of the timing, because of the place and because of due
              process.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">May I draw the attention of the Assembly to the
              first page. The public-duty section says that Members have a duty
              to uphold the law and to act on all occasions in accordance with
              the trust placed in them by the public. Members have a duty to act
              in the interests of the electorate and the community as a whole,
              and they have a special duty to their constituents. It is
              therefore obscene and appalling that Members who, in the words of
              the Prime Minister, Tony Blair, are inextricably linked to
              terrorist organisations which carry out shootings, bombings,
              robberies, racketeering and extortion are now in positions in
              Government. Thus we are seeing all the evil of the
              &quot;ballot-box and Armalite&quot; strategy.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to draw the Assembly’s attention
              to the seven principles of public life. The first principle is
              that of selflessness. Holders of public office should take
              decisions that are solely in the public interest and not to get
              financial or other benefits for themselves, their family or their
              friends.</p>

              the Member of whom he is speaking is not here to respond — he
              will prejudice any due process. If the Member wishes to comment on
              the Code of Conduct itself or on the Guide, that will be perfectly
              appropriate, but comments about Members who are here, and
              especially about those who are not here, are not in order.</p>

              observing it? Will you please give a ruling that will make it
              clear to the Member that this is the case and that he is not
              entitled to raise these matters now?</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Haughey is correct. The Code of Conduct must
              be appropriate to the needs of the House, but it goes further than
              that: its purpose is to fulfil the law. Were we not to agree this
              issue it might be argued that the House was in default of its
              responsibilities. That is an entirely separate issue from any
              questions, queries or accusations in respect of Members which, as
              I have already ruled, are out of order.</p>

              proceed to the next item of business. If, however, he is going to

              matter.</p>

              Order 53, and, a Chathaoirligh, I wish to say a few words.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These changes are supported by all of the
              parties that are participating in the Assembly’s Committees. The
              intention is to carry on from the model which was used in CAPO in
              the early days of the Assembly. In spite of the fact that there
              were Members who were politically opposed to one another
              fundamentally, they nevertheless worked well together in a
              consensual way to try to ensure that the business of the Assembly
              was conducted in a proper and orderly way.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also wish to point out that the changes seek
              to re-establish the very important principles of inclusivity and
              proportionality — I believe that this was lost sight of today by
              some senior Members, including the First Minister and the Deputy
              First Minister — by increasing the membership from 11 to 13.
              This will allow all the other parties to have representation on
              this Committee and will give proper weight to the proportionality
              principle, since voting, if there is voting, will be on a
              proportional basis.</p>

              </font></b><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I no longer have any authority in relation to
              Standing Orders, but Members will recall that I was co-Chairman of
              the Committee on Standing Orders with Mr Cobain during the shadow
              period of the Assembly. I am therefore in a position to inform the
              House about the deliberations of that Committee and its
              conclusions.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the end of our period on the Committee
              several matters remained to be tidied up. As Members, Mr Cobain
              and I have attempted to assist the House in tidying up those loose
              ends, and a number of matters have been dealt with in that way.
              Unfortunately, this matter is one that we missed, and I should
              like to inform the House of the circumstances in which it arose.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Standing Orders Committee considered the
              matter, and it was agreed that equality proofing of certain
              legislative measures which would come before the House should be
              carried out by what would effectively be an Ad Hoc Committee.
              There were discussions about what this Committee and others, apart
              from the statutory departmental Committees, should be called. It
              was in that context that the Standing Order which mistakenly
              referred to the Equality Proofing Committee as a Standing
              Committee came before the House.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Standing Committees are set up to exist
              throughout the lifetime of the Assembly, but that would not be
              appropriate for this Committee. I chaired the meeting in which
              this issue was considered, and it was agreed, after legal advice
              had been taken from the Office of the Clerk of the House, that I
              would propose amending Standing Order 54 accordingly. I will read
              briefly from the speaking notes which were prepared for me by the
              Committee staff. They say</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The Committee on Standing Orders wishes
              to make a minor amendment to Standing Order 54. Originally, when
              drawing up Standing Orders, we had thought it appropriate that the
              special Committee on Equality Matters referred to in paragraph 11
              of Strand 1 of the agreement should be a Standing Committee.
              However, on further reflection, and having taken more advice on
              the matter, we are clear that this Committee is not one which
              should have the fixity of a Standing Committee. It needs to be
              constituted and reconstituted as necessary to deal with the
              matters referred to it. Its membership will vary according to the
              subject at hand to ensure that its deliberations are not
              prejudiced and that no conflicting interests are allowed to bear
              upon matters. This Committee is unique, or, as the agreement puts
              it, ‘will be a special Committee’, but its constitution is
              intended to be ad hoc and not permanent. It is therefore a special
              Ad Hoc Committee and should be so described, and that is the
              effect of the change to the Standing Order that is being
              proposed.&quot;</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Maskey:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat. I do not entirely accept
              the explanation given by Mr Haughey. Indeed, I wish to draw
              attention to the fact that during the last few meetings of CAPO
              — now the Business Committee — it was the fairly universal, if
              not unanimous, opinion of its members that the final work of the
              Standing Orders Committee was not of a very high standard. Indeed,
              it was most unsatisfactory, and I made that point myself. I can
              name Members who shared my view. If I remember correctly, it was
              shared by Members from all the parties sitting around the
              Committee table.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not accept for one moment that paragraph
              11 of Strand 1 intended this to be an Ad Hoc Committee. In spite
              of what the Deputy First Minister said, we did have lengthy
              discussions in the Good Friday negotiations on equality and
              related issues. This very question came up, and it was deliberated
              upon at length. We can deal with that later. Recent work by the
              Standing Orders Committee has not been good. Mr Wilson, as I
              recall, is not even a member of the Standing Orders Committee.
              There is an agenda at work here.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This motion is seeking to downgrade the
              functions of this Committee. In my view — and I have argued this
              at the Committee in the last week or two — if a Committee is
              reduced from being a standing one to being an ad hoc one, its
              standing is reduced. There is no doubt whatsoever that our society
              needs to do a great deal of work on refocussing and reorientating
              itself on this very complex question of equality.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A Standing Committee becomes an expert
              Committee, a Committee that can draw upon the relevant people in
              any Department. If the Committee feels that there is a difficulty
              with legislation in a Department, it can call on people from that
              Department and from the departmental Committee — perhaps even
              Ministers and Chairpersons — and any other expertise it may
              require.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I ask the Assembly to take this matter
              seriously. The best thing to do is appoint a Standing Committee.
              Indeed, it is a Standing Committee and should remain so in order
              to gain expertise. In view of the likely response to the other
              changes on the agenda tonight, it is all the more important that
              the equality issue is protected in the Assembly.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This Committee is being downgraded, and I have
              no doubt that the equality agenda will be further downgraded as a
              result of other changes tonight. This is a disgrace. I understand
              why some people in the Chamber wish to downgrade the equality
              provisions, but I do not think that other parties should collude
              in that. I ask Members not to support this motion.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McFarland:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a degree of confusion here. As a
              member of the Standing Orders Committee, I would like to say a few
              words. I do not wish to address items of business concerning the
              Department of the Centre, which is where the equality issue rests.
              However, if this motion is resolved, there will be a Committee to
              examine equality issues.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That Committee, if the Assembly agrees to it,
              will be permanent. The Assembly agreed this Committee last week,
              but a change has been proposed. The Equality Committee under
              discussion is specifically designed to have the legal aspects of
              equality referred to it by the Assembly. If someone in the
              Assembly is not happy about the equality aspects of a particular
              Bill, he can have it referred to the Committee for re-examination.
              In theory it will have been examined already, but if a Member is
              not happy about it the Assembly, if it agrees this motion to amend
              the Standing Order, will be able to set up an Ad Hoc Committee to
              examine the matter further. As I understand it, this Committee was
              not designed to look at equality matters per se, which is why it
              is changing from being a standing one to being an ad hoc one and
              why there will be a Committee looking at equality, in one form or
              another, I hope, after these deliberations.</p>

              misrepresentation of what was intended by those who negotiated the
              agreement. As one who had a considerable hand in drafting
              paragraphs 11 to 13, which is essentially the special procedure
              that will concern this Committee, I can tell Mr Maskey, and assure
              the House, that what Mr Haughey is saying is correct. That was the
              clear intention of those who negotiated and drafted those

              clarification on that. He is entitled to his opinion.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I note Mr Maskey’s point, but I have no
              recollection of Sinn Féin’s involving itself in that point of
              the negotiations whatsoever. Sinn Féin did make a case in
              relation to the Equality Commission. Some of us pointed out that
              the provisions for the Equality Commission on its own were not
              enough. The Equality Commission is outside this House, and so too
              are the courts, so we cannot rely on them. We said that we needed
              an equality provision that would allow the House to test whether
              the Equality Commission had been given full information on any
              particular measure.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At any time when a Petition of Concern is
              raised that a measure be tested in terms of its impact on equality
              or rights, this Ad Hoc Committee will be able to examine the
              matter and call for all relevant persons, including people from
              the Equality Commission and the Departments, and papers. It will
              really be quite powerful. You, Mr Speaker, in a former life, knew
              something of the provenance of this matter and were involved in
              the negotiations on it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This was designed to be an ad hoc measure
              because we believed that, depending on what the issues were,
              parties would want to put different people forward who had
              expertise in particular sectoral matters, be that expertise
              economic, social, legal or whatever. We thought that the parties
              would want to pick horses for courses precisely because there
              would have to be thorough investigations and that this would allow
              them to put their most specialised people to work. In fact, it was
              envisaged that there might be several versions of this Committee
              at any given time, several Ad Hoc Committees, created by this
              special procedure, to examine different measures. This was not
              seen as downgrading equality proofing in any way. It was actually
              seen as adding to it and substantiating it in a way that would
              make its work transparent and effective to the House. It was aimed
              at complementing all the other equality measures and not, as Mr
              Maskey wrongly suggests, downgrading them.</p>

              Standing Orders.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today we have debated the enormous range of
              functions which rest with the Office of the First Minister and the
              Deputy First Minister and the centralisation that has taken place
              there. In effect, we now have joint Prime Ministers who are also
              heads of the largest single Department. This is not just because
              of Standing Orders. The Good Friday Agreement lays down procedures
              for Committees in paragraphs 9 and 10. It is sometimes forgotten
              that paragraph 8 says</p>

              function appears to have been lost. The more paranoid of us have
              been wondering what has happened to it. There are clear crossovers
              with other Departments. I am not sure that the Minister of Finance
              and Personnel, who has just spoken, would be very happy if his
              areas of responsibility were subject to scrutiny while the
              Economic Policy Unit within the Committee of the Centre was not.
              The issues which we have already debated on equality, community
              relations, human rights and victims also need to be covered.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This motion has been put forward because a gap
              has opened up and some issues are not being properly covered. An
              amendment is to be moved which appears to my Colleagues and me
              broadly to cover our concerns. Given the frequency with which
              Standing Orders have already been amended, further amendments may
              be forthcoming. Having said that, I welcome the change.</p>

              Trimble and myself.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is clear that all sides in the Assembly
              agree that there should be scrutiny of the policy functions that
              fall within the Office of the First and Deputy First Ministers.

              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important to note that the Good Friday
              Agreement refers to &quot;a Committee&quot;.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly previously approved the creation
              of two non-Statutory Committees — one relating to equality,
              community relations and human rights, and the second to look at
              European matters. The motion on the Order Paper calls for a third
              Committee to examine the remaining functions of the Office of the
              First and Deputy First Ministers.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The effect of the amendment would be to follow
              the practice which exists for all the other Departments and to
              create a single Committee to perform the scrutiny function for the
              Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister, thus
              complying fully with the terms of the Good Friday Agreement.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The amendment proposes detailed and specific
              policy functions for which the Committee would have a scrutiny
              responsibility. In the debate on junior Ministers we made clear
              the importance that we attach to these policy functions. Issues
              such as equality, community relations and economic policy go to
              the very heart of the new institutions that have been established,
              and it is right and proper that the Assembly should be able to
              scrutinise those functions fully.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">David Trimble and I have considered very
              carefully what was said in the debate that was held in the
              Assembly in March, when the Standing Orders were debated. In that
              debate there was widespread support for scrutiny of the Office of
              the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister. Our proposals
              are designed to meet that concern.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important to recognise the difference
              between what we are proposing and the call for a third Committee
              for the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister
              in the motion. Our amendment clearly recognises a critical
              distinction.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That distinction is between the policy
              functions carried out by the Office of the First Minister and the
              Deputy First Minister and the institutional roles which David
              Trimble and I play as a consequence of the positions we hold. It
              would be without parallel for Executive Committee business or any
              institutions relating to the First Minister and the Deputy First
              Minister to be the subject of Assembly scrutiny.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is essential that discussions in the
              Executive Committee or the negotiating positions for the Northern
              Ireland Administration in relation to the North/South Ministerial
              Council or the British-Irish Council remain private. The Executive
              collectively, and the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister
              specifically, are accountable to the Assembly for those decisions
              and their ramifications. That accountability to the Assembly is
              critical, and it is one that we fully recognise.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The other key difference between our amendment
              and the motion is that we are seeking to remove the requirement
              placed on the Committees dealing with equality, community
              relations and human rights and European matters to examine only
              matters &quot;referred to it&quot;.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The amendment to the proposed Standing Order is
              cast in the following terms:</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;to examine and report on the following
              functions and on any other related matters determined by the
              Assembly&quot;.</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the amendment we are seeking to expand the
              role which the scrutiny Committee can play in relation to the
              Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister, and
              that would bring that Committee into line with the departmental
              Committees established for the Departments of all Members of the
              Executive Committee.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The amendment is fully reflective of the Good
              Friday Agreement, which refers to a committee to scrutinise the
              main Executive functions. It places the Office of the First
              Minister and the Deputy First Minister on the same footing as
              those of all the other Ministers and ensures that the Committee
              established to scrutinise the work of the Centre will operate in
              the same way as all the other Committees. It establishes very
              clearly the functions that the scrutiny Committee will cover.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister for Regional Development
              (Mr&nbsp;P&nbsp;Robinson):</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></b>&nbsp;I detect some sleight of hand in what
              is being proposed.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The initial motion was put down on the basis of
              what the Assembly considered was the best option, and it had
              decided that two Committees should be set up. It decided,
              following the judgement of the First Minister and the Deputy First
              Minister, that one Committee should deal with European matters and
              the other with equality issues.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I did not agree with that decision. My party
              made it clear to you, Mr Speaker, in a private meeting, that we
              felt that serious issues were arising from the First and Deputy
              First Ministers’ refusal to come forward with a proposal to
              cover other areas within their remit. We attempted to address this
              through a motion —and I think its terms would have been broadly
              acceptable to a number of parties, outside of those whose
              representatives were in the Office of the First Minister and the
              Deputy First Minister — and that would have dealt with all of
              the other matters that fall within the responsibility of the First
              Minister and the Deputy First Minister.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The amendment which we are discussing today
              produces, to me at least, a better structure — one in which it
              will be possible to have those responsibilities scrutinised.
              Having taken that step forward, however, and having suggested one
              Committee through which this can be comprehensively dealt with,
              they step back and, I regret to say, do not include in the
              amendment all of the functions that are their responsibility. That
              is to be regretted, and I hope that they will reconsider, even
              before this debate is over.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The division suggested by the Deputy First
              Minister is somewhat spurious. Any Minister could choose to
              distinguish between the type of functions that are operated in his
              or her Department. It would be very easy to say that the Committee
              should be allowed to look at the policy issues that we deal with
              but not at the administrative matters that are our responsibility.
              I do not think that that would be satisfactory to the Assembly in
              respect of any other Department, so why should it be so for the
              Department of the Centre?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is apparent, from earlier discussions, that
              the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister consider that
              their Department has such a weighty burden that they need to draw
              in further assistance to help them carry it, that they have
              matters of significance and substance to deal with. But that is
              contrary to the kind of open government that many of us are
              arguing for. Only today, I said that we should move away from
              colonial-style government where you do not produce the facts,
              where you do not allow people to scrutinise a Department in
              detail. In effect, the First Minister and the Deputy First
              Minister are saying that their Department is different from the
              others, that only some of its functions may be scrutinised, but
              not all.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Speaking as a Minister, at least for the
              present, I admit that it is not comfortable to have to defend one’s
              policies and provide answers to questions from awkward people on
              the Committee — and I am not looking at anybody in particular
              — who want to get to the bottom of an issue that is important to
              them. But that is what a democracy is about. One should not be
              advocating policies that one cannot defend, whether it is to do
              with North/Southery or anything else.</p>
              <i>

              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In annex 1a of the report from the then First
              Minister (Designate) and Deputy First Minister (Designate) Members
              will see that they raised fewer than half of the number of issues
              that the Committee will be capable of scrutinising. That report
              itemised very clearly the various issues for which they were
              responsible. I expect that it did not take into account many of
              the other areas on which they will make their opinions known,
              express views and even take decisions, areas that we will never be
              able to address because as soon as the Chairman of the Committee
              wants to move from the issue that is before him to one that a
              Member raises, he will have to look at his remit. The remit states
              that the Committee of the Centre is only to examine and report on
              the specific functions that are laid down as subjects that the
              Committee is entitled to scrutinise. If the Committee goes outside
              those specific functions, it will be acting ultra vires, and the
              First Minister and the Deputy First Minister will hold up their
              hands and say &quot;I’m sorry, but it is not within your remit
              to look at those issues; you will have to have a special motion
              resolved by the Assembly in order to do that.&quot; The amendment
              is saying that the Assembly can deal with other issues, if it so
              determines, but that it will require a further vote in the
              Assembly, and a weighted vote at that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I say to the First Minister and the Deputy
              First Minister that it would be far better if they came clean on
              the issue and made themselves subject to the same kind of scrutiny
              that other Ministers will be subject to. It is in the interests of
              any Department to put forward its arguments on issues publicly and
              to stand over matters that it has been dealing with privately.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister advanced the argument
              that they could not talk about the private negotiations that go on
              on a North/South basis and so forth in a Committee and that they
              are subject to the scrutiny of the Assembly. Well, if the
              negotiations are so private, it might be a lot easier for them to
              talk to the Committee rather than to the Assembly in a public
              session. That might be an easier route for them to take.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This does look, at best, a little indecisive.
              Last week Members sat here and set up two Committees, and this
              week we are demolishing those two Committees and setting up a
              different one in their place. The public might just expect people
              to think a wee bit ahead of the game and not set up one thing one
              week and then try to get a new structure going in its place the
              following week. If they have this new flexibility, next week they
              will come and add on the other 12 or 13 subject matters that they
              have not included in the amendment today.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I say, most assuredly, that this matter will
              not go away. They are not going to get off with it. They are going
              to be scrutinised, and if they are not scrutinised in a Committee,
              they will be scrutinised here. And it would be far better for
              scrutiny to be done in the atmosphere of a Committee, where we can
              lay the facts open and have proper discussion, than in the
              Assembly.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clearly there are matters that the legislation
              enables the Assembly to deal with in open session, particularly
              North/South matters. But in spite of what the legislation says
              there is a plethora of issues in the report from the then First
              Minister (Designate) and the Deputy First Minister (Designate)
              that have not been included.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I ask the First Minister and the Deputy First
              Minister to think again. If they are not prepared to do that
              today, and to include all the areas over which they have
              responsibility for scrutiny, we shall put down a substantive
              motion to have them included. We cannot amend their amendment, so
              we cannot do that today, but we will do it at the earliest
              possible opportunity and continue to bring this issue up until it
              is properly addressed.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The public have a right to be certain that not
              just 10 Ministers but all Ministers will be subject to this kind
              of scrutiny. Many of them are likely to ask &quot;What have these
              two guys got to fear? Let them stand on their own feet in exactly
              the same way as every other Minister and be answerable in the same
              way as every other Minister. They should not be different.&quot;</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr C Murphy:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A Chathaoirligh, it is important to trace the
              history of this Committee of the Centre. There was a huge amount
              of discussion and consternation in the Standing Orders Committee
              when it was discovered that there was what was described as a gap
              in the legislation and no provision for a Statutory Committee to
              scrutinise the Centre. We got the NIO Minister, Mr Paul Murphy, in
              to discuss ways of attempting to plug the gap through legislation
              in the House of Commons, but we were unsuccessful.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The urgency to resolve the matter increased
              greatly in December 1998 when the determination from the First
              Minister and the Deputy First Minister appeared to &quot;pack
              out&quot; the Centre. This was reinforced by their positions at
              that time. We had not opposed the absence of a Committee on
              Equality in the 10 Departments that were agreed, but we were keen
              to see proper scrutiny of the Centre.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Various solutions were suggested in the
              Standing Orders Committee to deal with the issue. One of those was
              to spread scrutiny of the Centre over a number of Committees, and
              I felt that there was general agreement on that. The motions that
              were passed by the Standing Orders Committee suggested that a
              Committee on Equality, Human Rights and Community Relations, a
              Committee on European Affairs, and a sort of catch-all Committee
              to deal with the other matters that rested with the First Minister
              and the Deputy First Minister would be established.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I understand from the minutes of the Standing
              Orders Committee that the joint Chairmen and the Clerk of the
              Standing Orders Committee were mandated in July to present a
              proposal for a Committee of the Centre. At a previous sitting of
              the Assembly, we agreed to set up the Committee for Equality,
              Human Rights and Community Relations and the Committee for
              European Affairs. Surprisingly, the draft Order Paper for that
              sitting proposed a Committee of the Centre in the name of one of
              the then Chairmen of the Standing Orders Committee, yet that
              proposal was withdrawn from the Order Paper itself.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is an element of farce in that at which
              the DUP has rightly poked fun, but I note that it does not express
              any regret at the potential loss, given the terms of the
              amendment, of the Committee on Equality, Human Rights and
              Community Relations. That should strike home on this side of the
              House.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today we have had a proposal, which has been
              dropped, and an amendment relating to a Committee of the Centre,
              and neither came from the Standing Orders Committee, where such
              was supposed to originate. Indeed, the amendment came from the
              Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister. It is
              a matter of concern that the Standing Orders Committee was
              mandated to do this and did not. I believe that there has been a
              welter of confusion over Standing Orders. As a member of the
              Committee, I accept the criticism from Members about its way of
              doing business in the months before the transfer of power. In
              spite of that there are greater concerns about the amendment from
              the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister.</p>

              Committees in recent months.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have other concerns about the proposal from
              the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister and not just
              because the detailed proposal on how the Department of the Centre
              would be scrutinised by the Assembly comes from the Department
              which is the subject of that scrutiny. We are also concerned
              because half of the items on the long list of the Department’s
              functions are omitted from the list given by the First Minister
              and the Deputy First Minister in their amendment.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What concerns me most is the proposal in the

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I turn to the debate that arose from the
              determination by the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister
              on 18 January, when the current Minister of Higher and Further
              Education said, in relation to equality,</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;We believe that the Assembly should
              assist in this task by the establishment of a special Committee to
              scrutinise equality.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That was reinforced by Mr Nesbitt, who will be
              a beneficiary of today’s proceedings. He said</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Indeed, we believe there is a case for a
              Scrutiny Committee to deal with this aspect of rights and
              equality.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was intended then to have a Committee to
              scrutinise the equality functions at the Centre. Suddenly today,
              without any notice and regardless of any discussion and agreement
              in the Standing Orders Committee, in the Committee to Advise the
              Presiding Officer and in the Business Committee, the SDLP and the
              UUP, as represented by the First Minister and the Deputy First
              Minister, have changed their minds on the issue.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given that these gentlemen have spent most of
              the evening trying to convince us that the remit of the Department
              of the Centre is so vast that four Ministers are needed to cover
              it adequately, we must question the logic of their proposal to
              reduce the number of Committees scrutinising that Department from
              three to one. The suspicion that they do not want proper scrutiny
              of their Department is hard to avoid.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The net effect of today’s business is likely
              to be less scrutiny, less accountable Government and the
              downgrading of equality. Contrary to Mr Mallon’s suggestion,
              that is not the vision of politics that underpinned the Good
              Friday Agreement. It should be rejected to allow us to proceed, as
              we agreed some months ago, with proper scrutiny of all the
              functions of the Executive. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Morrice:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I oppose the amendment. As Mr Peter Robinson
              and Mr Conor Murphy have said, we are surprised by its
              introduction. For about 18 months it was understood and accepted
              that the Committee on European Affairs and the Committee on
              Equality, Human Rights and Community Relations were necessary and
              would be set up. The effect of the amendment would be to revoke
              the Committee on European Affairs and the Committee on Equality,
              Human Rights and Community Relations and, as Mr&nbsp;Peter
              Robinson has said, to reduce the amount of scrutiny of the
              Department of the Centre. Fewer than half the matters for which it
              is responsible would be subject to scrutiny.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a dire need for the Equality, Human
              Rights and Community Relations Committee, and the best example of
              that need is to be found in yesterday’s appointment of people to
              advisory boards. The Deputy First Minister has said that equality
              goes to the very heart of our institutions. Where was the gender
              balance when those board members were appointed? For example,
              Trade Business and Development has 12 members, of whom four are
              women; Food Safety has 11 members, of whom two are women; the
              North/South Language body has 16 members, of whom five are women;
              and the Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights body has 12 members,
              of whom two are women.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">9.00 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we are serious about equality why was more
              effort not made to ensure that there was a gender balance? That
              would have given a much needed example of the new Government’s
              attitude to equality. Equality and women’s issues should be at
              the heart of the practice and not just the words of this
              institution. They are not political points to be scored. That was
              not the case with appointments to these bodies.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Europe is our future and European affairs cut
              across every Department. I have often heard complaints about the
              Dublin Government’s interfering in our affairs, but people
              forget that since 1973 the Dublin Government, along with the
              French Government and the German Government, have been setting the
              price of our butter. This interference in our affairs has been
              happening since we joined the European Union. European affairs
              affect every policy area, and it is very important that we have a
              Committee on European Affairs to cover that. This has always been
              accepted in the Assembly, and I do not understand the logic of
              this amendment to eradicate these two Committees.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The most important point, and one that Mr Peter
              Robinson has raised, is that the effect of this amendment would be
              to leave 13 out of the 26 areas for which the First Minister and
              the Deputy First Minister are responsible with no scrutiny
              whatsoever. The North/South Ministerial Council would not be
              covered, nor would the British/Irish Council and key issues
              relating to the machinery of government. Liaison with the
              Secretary of State and the International Fund for Ireland would
              not be covered, and information services, which are vital to the
              machinery of government, would have no scrutiny whatsoever.
              Neither would there be scrutiny of cross-departmental
              co-ordination, the Assembly Ombudsman, the Policy Innovation Unit
              and the awarding of honours.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It would be wrong of the Assembly to accept
              this amendment on the grounds that there should be openness and
              transparency. Committees should be able to scrutinise all areas of
              government. We need a Committee on European Affairs, a Committee
              on Equality, Human Rights and Community Relations and a Committee
              of the Centre, covering all the Centre’s responsibilities. That
              is the way forward.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I oppose the amendment and therefore support
              the motion. I am dismayed by today’s affairs. I do not wish to
              believe that the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister are
              naïve, but it is the best option open to me. The only alternative
              is to think, as has been suggested, that there has been a sleight
              of hand. We agreed to have two Committees and to generate a third
              to cover the remit of the First and Deputy First Ministers’
              Department. Substantial portions of the report they produced when
              they were, as Mr Robinson said, &quot;Designate&quot; are absent.
              The fact that there has been no consultation about this and the
              immediacy with which they have landed pieces of paper on this
              Table are bound to give people cause for concern.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A malaise is creeping in. Whether it is because
              of the amount of patronage there is for some Members or the
              benefits of creating junior Ministers, with which we agree, I do
              not know — we are just not happy with what is happening because
              we have not been told enough about it. This behaviour is arrogant
              and in the nature of big parties. Members can see from Hansard
              that we have talked about the fear of patronage before. We have
              also talked about the lack of inclusion, and the big parties are
              inclined to get carried away with that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not advocating that anyone from a small
              party like ours should be the chairman of such a committee, but I
              am saying very clearly that unless there is consultation, there
              will not be support. If something were to be done which seemed
              either naïve or shifty — and I would prefer it to seem naïve
              — I would be inclined to believe that it was neither if someone
              were reasonable enough to discuss it. Each issue has to come to
              the Floor of the House. The requirement for cross-community
              support may or may not make a difference this evening, but it will
              at some point in the future. Let the two large parties who are
              responsible for this — and they will no doubt support the First
              Minister and the Deputy First Minister — be warned that if it is
              to be the nature of things in the future, we will not support
              matters about which we are unclear or which are designed for the
              benefit of the big parties alone. In that respect today’s
              proceedings have not been good, and we will undoubtedly support
              the motion.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What we are experiencing today is not the
              fundamental sickness that will affect the Assembly, but merely
              some of the symptoms of that sickness. The Assembly was founded on
              unique and undemocratic principles. Such principles were imported
              because it was said that Northern Ireland was a unique place for
              which the ordinary principles of democracy were unsuited, and that
              is why the Belfast Agreement created the sort of institution that
              we have here. Ministers were elected on a peculiar and unique
              system — the d’Hondt system. It is unique in British
              parliamentary experience. It may be suitable for some German
              Länder, but it is not suitable here.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is an absence of democracy in the sense
              that there is no Government and no Opposition — an Opposition
              that could hope that by persuading the electorate of the defects
              of the current Government it would one day enter into Government
              in their place. Such an Opposition would have had the task of
              questioning and examining, on the Floor of the Assembly, the
              workings of the Government. Instead of that, we have the consensus
              arrangement under which the four major parties divided up the 10
              ministerial offices among them and, together with the First
              Minister and the Deputy First Minister, control the Executive. If
              this continues, subject to the present position of the DUP, the
              vast majority of the Assembly will always be in Government with a
              few minor parties hanging about, perhaps least of all my own, such
              as the Women’s Coalition, the Alliance Party, the United
              Unionists, and, to a lesser extent, Sinn Féin and the DUP.
              Essentially, the Executive is controlled by two parties which,
              with a little assistance from their friends from time to time, can
              deliver the Nationalist and the Unionist vote in accordance with
              the principles on which the Executive has been erected.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Therein lies the problem. To counterbalance the
              overwhelming power of the Executive, which is centred on the two
              major parties, we were to have a series of scrutinising
              Committees. Again, the overwhelming membership of those Committees
              would come from the four major parties that constitute the
              Executive. At an early stage in the meetings of the Standing
              Orders Committee, I pointed out that Standing Orders would have to
              be very zealous in protecting the Assembly against an over-mighty
              Executive. I and other members of the Committee will recall that
              Dr Farren, who is now the Minister of Higher Education, suggested
              that the plenary sessions of the Assembly should be held on two
              days a month as all other business would be conducted in
              Committees and by the Executive. Plenary sessions were seen to be
              an irritation to the backside. That was the extent to which the
              Assembly was to be reduced, and one has to superimpose the party
              system on all that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Under this amendment, the Assembly can deal
              with any other related matters, as determined by the Assembly, as
              well as with the 50% of the matters in the Annex that are excluded
              from the scrutiny of the Committee of the Centre. What will happen
              when it is decided to have a vote on whether a matter should be
              sent to that Committee? The SDLP will follow its leader, and the
              UUP will try to screw up enough support to carry it through if
              voting is on the basis of a majority decision. The two of them
              will organise their Members to vote down any proposal from the
              rest of us to have such a matter sent to the Scrutiny Committee
              for examination. The distribution of patronage and the organising
              of those on the payroll are part and parcel of the means by which
              Executives in every country control their legislatures.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the difficulties about Westminster, the
              Mother of Parliaments, is that its role is being totally reduced.
              There is an elite in the Executive and a collection of Lobby
              fodder in Parliament. Because they are part of the hierarchical
              party system, they want to keep their noses clean to ensure that
              they will progress up the greasy pole to the ultimate position.
              They go through the Lobby, although most of them do not know which
              Lobby to go through and have to be directed by the Whips. The
              Executive is exercising more and more control and is reducing the
              plenary sessions of Parliament to a ghastly joke.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Under that arrangement, however, there is at
              least an Opposition. There is still the hope that somewhere along
              the line the Opposition will become the Government, as happened to
              Labour. Therefore there is at least some examination, if only out
              of self-interest. Where is the self-interest here? The
              self-interest, if any, lies between the two major parties.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I must make it plain that the Government and
              the Northern Ireland Office knew this all along. Those Members of
              the Women’s Coalition who ululated when this great thing was
              brought into being, those Members of the PUP who were conned —
              some of them were told that, in other circumstances, they would be
              world statesmen — are, in effect, no longer necessary to the
              propagation of this scheme. So far as the Centre is concerned, the
              Women’s Coalition may go on about its equality agenda, women’s
              rights and Europe, and Ms&nbsp;Morrice can talk about butter and
              all the rest of it, but the truth is that the Women’s Coalition
              is a pain in the butt to those who really want to get on with the
              business of running this Government. Those people do not want to
              be faced with the idea that one or other of the smaller parties
              could be heading a Committee that was going to give the ruling
              parties any trouble. That is the truth. <i>[Interruption]</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hear Mr Ervine muttering about patronage in
              North Down. There is no patronage in North Down. I am not looking
              for anything from the Government by way of financial remuneration,
              and I am bitterly opposed in principle to the honours system, so I
              am not concerned with that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us get back to the main issue which is that
              this amendment relates to the ever-increasing centralisation of
              power within the Executive and within the control of the First
              Minister and the Deputy First Minister. That is why the smaller
              parties are being excluded from this. That is why, through working
              the party system, they will be able to prevent the smaller parties
              from ever bringing any matter to be scrutinised by this Committee.
              This is all about Executive power against the power which Members,
              as a body, hope to exercise in plenary sessions. All of this is
              related to matters which we discussed last week and this week —
              matters such as patronage, with more than 50% of Assembly Members
              on the payroll at a salary above their normal one.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It makes you begin to wonder who is dispensing
              this patronage. Who will decide who is to be a Whip? Who will, as
              happened this morning, decide who will be a junior Minister and
              for what? The Executive, not the Members. While we have this
              fundamentally flawed, allegedly consensual arrangement, effective
              scrutiny Committees under the control of the Assembly will be
              vital. If those at the very centre of power can, by this
              amendment, exclude matters from the scrutiny of the Assembly or
              its Committees — and they are effectively excluding them from
              both — the Members’ function is thereby diminished.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members should think very carefully about the
              fundamentals of this. Why are Members here? Are they really here
              to be Lobby fodder for the First Minister and the Deputy First
              Minister? Are they motivated by what is best for the people of
              Northern Ireland or are they motivated by party loyalties alone,
              or are they, from time to time perhaps, motivated by a mixture of
              party loyalties and self-interest?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have heard the allegation made that it is all
              right for Bob McCartney — he is not worried about his salary or
              this or that. That may or may not be true, but it does invest me
              with the capacity to stand here, owing nothing to any man and
              wanting nothing from any man, and say what needs to be said. It is
              time the Assembly and its Members started taking note, or are they
              all going to be placemen and placewomen?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I listened to the Members from the Northern
              Ireland Women’s Coalition, and behind all their talk about
              Europe and women’s rights was the suggestion that both were
              admirably fitted to be a Chairperson in charge of the question of
              Europe or women’s rights. The talk about inclusivity is because
              the smaller parties — and the Women’s Coalition in particular
              — are being excluded from office. That is what this is all
              about.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All of this, however, is cloaked with the
              appearance that they are very concerned about these things. Their
              concern makes me smile, not at the subject matter of their
              concerns, which are very real, but at the way in which these
              Ladies are presenting them, a way which any intellectual feminist
              abandoned 20 years ago. <i>[Interruption]</p>

              want to repeat what my Colleague Mr Conor Murphy has already said.
              However, I have to put on record my disappointment at events in
              the House tonight.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly has moved from our position in the
              Good Friday Agreement, which suggested that we have a dedicated
              Department of Equality, to talking about and rejecting the
              suggestion that we have a dedicated junior Minister for equality.
              It has moved from talking about and rejecting a standing committee
              to scrutinise equality, human rights and community relations to
              lumping the equality unit into the Office of the First Minister
              and the Deputy First Minister, where it will be swallowed up
              entirely.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Inequality, discrimination, community relations
              and human rights have now been shifted again, and we must question
              the agenda which is driving the debate in the House tonight. The
              inequalities which have existed for years were what prompted me to
              enter politics in the first place, and I am disgusted that every
              attempt to scrutinise the delivery of equality in our society is
              being thwarted. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister (Mr Trimble):</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is my job to wind up the debate on this
              issue, and I hope to be brief.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to touch on some of the contributions
              which have been made, and, first of all, I shall touch on the
              penultimate contribution — that made by Mr&nbsp;McCartney. It
              was interesting to listen to the Member contrast the operation of
              parliamentary principles, as they are known at Westminster, with
              our practice here. I do not intend to follow him into the detail
              of that. Rather, I wish to note the contrast between the
              differences he drew and the fact that he treated Assembly Members
              here in exactly the same way as he treats Members of Parliament at
              Westminster. If he continues to do that, he will have as many
              friends in this Assembly as he has at Westminster. <i>[Interruption]</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Moving on to the points of substance that were
              made by other Members, specifically Ms Morrice and
              Mr&nbsp;C&nbsp;Murphy, I expressed concern about the
              rationalisation that these proposals are to bring about. It is
              fair to say that over the months — indeed, years — a number of
              different proposals have been made on scrutiny of the Office of
              the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister and the
              responsibilities within it, and a number of Members here have
              changed their positions on the matter.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should acknowledge that we have arrived at
              what I think is the best outcome. We are not abandoning scrutiny
              on equality issues, European issues or other issues, but we are
              consolidating them on a better basis. Mr Robinson acknowledged
              this because he conceded that this amendment will produce a better
              structure, and I agree. By way of criticism, Mr Robinson also
              suggested that we are attempting to treat the First Minister and
              the Deputy First Minister more favourably than other Ministers and
              that some matters will not receive scrutiny. That is not a valid
              criticism. We have to draw a distinction, as the amendment tries
              to do, between the process by which policy is formulated and the
              question of a policy’s merits, how it is implemented and what
              its consequences are.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In all systems, the process by which policy is
              evolved and the discussions which take place with officials are
              free from scrutiny. That is also true of other Departments. I am
              certain that Mr Robinson, together with his ministerial
              colleagues, will respond in the same way as we are responding if
              his Committee asks what advice he received from officials and what
              matters were considered when he was formulating policy.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister made the point when
              he was introducing this matter. He said</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;It is essential that discussions which
              take place in the Executive Committee, or the negotiating
              positions for the Northern Ireland Administration in relation to
              the North/South Ministerial Council or the British-Irish Council
              should remain private.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The amendment provides for that. It also
              provides for the scrutiny of all of the significant functions in
              the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister
              which have any Executive character and does so in a much more
              rational and coherent manner than previous proposals.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is a pity that it came through late.
              However, this reflects the fact that over the past few weeks we
              have had a flurry of items to focus on in the operation of our
              Office. I apologise to Members that the amendment was tabled at
              such short notice. This was largely because we were able to focus
              on the matter only last night, when we started to look at its
              implications. The amendment evolved after consultations with some
              Members. I concede that not all Members were consulted.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Robinson:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, having listened to the First Minister
              and the Deputy First Minister, I am not convinced that there is a
              distinction between the policy issues and the outworking of those
              issues in their Office that is any way different from that of any
              of the other Departments. Every Department has policy and
              strategic issues, and there is an outworking of those policies.
              Ministers will be questioned, interrogated, and turned upside down
              on all of those issues — and rightly so.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not think that there will be any such
              distinction either in the minds of those on the Committees. They
              will be able to ask us how we arrived at our decisions, and in
              many instances they will have taken part in our arriving at them.
              In formulating our decisions we will have to seek advice, and,
              under legislation, we will be given advice by the Committees. The
              First Minister and the Deputy First Minister will be denied that
              advice by excluding these matters from the remit of their
              Committee.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, by excluding those matters, the First
              Minister and the Deputy First Minister know that they are taking
              one significant power away, and that is the power to require
              papers to be produced. That cannot be done in the Assembly, but it
              can be done in Committee if the excluded matters are included in
              the Committee’s remit.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I return to the point that I made earlier. The
              distinction, which the Minister is trying to blur, does exist. It
              is to be found in the Deputy First Minister’s comment which I
              quoted earlier. It is essential that discussions which take place
              in the Executive or the negotiating positions which we adopt —
              regardless of whether they be for the North/South Ministerial
              Council, the British-Irish Council, or Brussels — remain
              private. That was our central concern when we framed this
              amendment.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have provided for effective scrutiny to
              cover all the concerns that were expressed by Ms Morrice, Mr
              Murphy and Mr Ervine. I am quite confident that we have in this
              amendment a more coherent, better and more effective procedure for
              scrutiny than we would have had in the provisions that were
              otherwise evolving.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am reluctant to speak for a third time on the
              issue, but if you insist, Mr Speaker, I shall do so. My speaking a
              short time ago was little more than an intervention, but since the
              First Minister allowed me to make it, it was valid. I also note
              that he did not bother to respond to it, which shows how
              worthwhile it must have been.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I accept — and I made this very clear during
              my remarks — that in structural terms there are significant
              advantages in having all issues dealt with in one Committee. Some
              of those who wish to see three Committees instead of one would
              regret that before too long, since there would be an overlapping
              of functions.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The key issue, on which all of those who have
              spoken against the amendment are united, is that all the functions
              of the Department must be scrutinised, whether by one Committee or
              three. If I am asked to choose whether I would rather have one
              Committee dealing with half of the matters or three Committees
              dealing with them all, I will opt for the latter. We should not,
              however, be forced to choose.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I offered the First Minister and the Deputy
              First Minister an opportunity to place the rest of their
              responsibilities under the Committee’s remit so that we could
              deal with them all in the proper, structured way suggested.
              Unfortunately, they did not avail themselves of that opportunity,
              and, regardless of the arithmetic at the end of today’s debate,
              it is simply not going to wash.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Issues will arise. The First Minister and the
              Deputy First Minister may feel that they are avoiding them by not
              having all their responsibilities included in this remit. It is,
              however, a feature of all deliberative Chambers that they have in
              them people of sufficient ingenuity to ensure that such matters
              are raised again and again. However, it is far better to do it in
              some structured way such as in a Committee than have it come out
              through cracks in the system, which would be most unfortunate for
              the whole running of the Assembly.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I cannot read the mind of the Member who moved
              the motion, but I detect from what people have been saying that a
              number of them are not content with the amendment and intend to
              vote against it. I hope that they will do so in sufficient numbers
              to allow the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister to
              recognise that they are not carrying the House with them. When we
              are dealing with the very structures of business, it is not
              sufficient to have a mere majority. Policy issues differ from
              those of structure in that, with a policy issue, one can get away
              with a mere majority. One can operate the policy. However, one
              cannot expect people to work on an ongoing basis within a
              structure that does not have the consent of a significant number
              of this Assembly’s Members — it will simply not work.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They should learn the lesson, sooner rather
              than later, that they do not have the mind of the Assembly on this
              issue yet. If they were prepared to set up two Committees last
              week, only to dump them this week and set up another, then, before
              too long, if they do not accept the burden of what is in the
              motion, they will have to return to the Assembly to seek
              sufficient consensus. I trust that they will take this on board.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is not a matter of looking for
              opportunities to snap at the heels of the First Minister and the
              Deputy First Minister — though for some that might be the case.
              The reality is that this would be good for democracy. It would
              give people an opportunity to get off their chests all the issues
              which burden them and, more importantly, burden the people
              outside. If they are not given vent within a democratic structure,
              they will be given vent outside in an undemocratic fashion. It is
              up to democrats to make sure that the opportunity for this is
              given within the structures of the democracy, rather than allow it
              to be pushed out where it will adopt a more unseemly face. I trust
              that they will think again. Even if they win the vote today, they
              will have to return to this issue before too long.</p>
