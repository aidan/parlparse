                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Paisley raised with me the use by a Member’s
                researcher of the Assembly e-mail address as a point of contact
                in respect of an article that the researcher had written, and
                which was published in ‘The Irish&nbsp;Times’ on
                7&nbsp;December. The researcher is a Mr Steven King. The matter
                relates to a member of staff, not a Member of the House, so it
                is for the Assembly Secretariat to deal with it. I have put it
                in the hands of the Head of Administration for his attention.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I can tell the House that the Head of
                Administration has ruled that Assembly e-mail accounts are
                provided for staff use on Assembly business only and that their
                private or commercial use is prohibited. The Head of
                Administration is writing to the Member’s researcher to remind
                him of the rules governing the provision and use of Assembly
                services and to inform him that any further breach of these
                rules will result in the withdrawal of Assembly services.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have to advise the House that the Second
                Reading of the Electronic Communications Bill on the Order Paper
                for today has been withdrawn by the relevant Ministers.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr&nbsp;Speaker. I want
                to thank you for your ruling. I am glad that this matter is
                being dealt with as you have described.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Molloy:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A Cheann Comhairle, go raibh maith agat. With
                regard to the issue of my speaking as Committee Chairperson
                yesterday, the point was raised by Mr&nbsp;McGrady that I had
                extended that by actually making a political speech. It is quite
                clear from Hansard that I made a differential between speaking
                as a Committee Chairperson and speaking as a party member. I
                want to draw that to the attention of the House.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr Ian Paisley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Further to that point of order,
                Mr&nbsp;Speaker. Hansard reports that I spoke as the Committee
                Chairperson. I was not called as the Chairperson, and I made it
                clear to the Speaker that I was speaking in my own capacity.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGrady:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a further point of order, Mr&nbsp;Speaker.
                Is it possible for a Member who is a Chairperson of a Committee
                to be called in privilege and precedence as a Chairperson of a
                Committee and then use that calling as Chairperson to make a
                personal political speech?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">May I refer all the Members to the comments I
                made yesterday, which are recorded in Hansard, about the calling
                of Members as office holders in the Assembly. I pointed out that
                on some occasions Members who were office holders were not
                called as such because they had said that they did not want to
                speak in their office. There is a dilemma for those Members who
                are office holders who wish to make reference to matters which
                are the subject of their office but also want to make reference
                to other matters, as under Standing Orders they may only be
                called once in the course of any debate. They could not be
                called once as a Chairperson or Deputy Chairperson and then
                subsequently called again.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hesitate to make an immediate ruling on
                that matter because it is a difficult one and I wish to give it
                further consideration. I will return to the matter when I have
                considered it and consulted with the Business Committee.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr Ian Paisley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Further to that point of order,
                Mr&nbsp;Speaker. I made it clear to the Deputy Speaker that I
                did not want to be called as Chairperson of the Agriculture
                Committee simply because political points had been made against
                my party and, as its leader, I wanted to answer them. I did not
                take any precedence whatsoever — I was well down the list.
                Therefore, Mr&nbsp;McGrady can go home and sleep well, knowing
                that everything was done decently and in order.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I can confirm that Dr&nbsp;Paisley was not
                called in his capacity as Chairperson of the Agriculture
                Committee and did not have precedence either in the Assembly or,
                I note, even in the speaking order of his own party.</p>

                second meeting of the NSMC in language sectoral format on
                Tuesday 5&nbsp;December&nbsp;2000 in the National Art Gallery,
                Dublin.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Following nomination by the First Minister
                and the Deputy First Minister, Dr&nbsp;Farren and I attended the
                meeting. The Irish Government was represented by Mr&nbsp;Eamon&nbsp;Ó&nbsp;Cuív

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council considered and approved an
                interim programme of activities for Foras na Gaeilge for 2001,
                including interim staffing arrangements to manage that
                programme. The programme of activities is divided into four main
                sectors: the development of a corporate plan and detailed
                organisational structure for Foras na Gaeilge, subject to the
                approval of the NSMC; allocation of more than IR£7 million to
                Irish language organisations and projects, including funding of
                an estimated IR£750,000 to an new pre-school organisation, and
                an estimated IR£400,000 for Irish language newspapers and
                journals; projects and partnerships run by Foras, including book
                publishing and distribution; and administration and personnel,
                including an increase in staff numbers from 40 to 65 and the
                establishment of a permanent office in Belfast.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council also noted a progress report on
                Foras na Gaeilge’s corporate plan. The Council approved, in
                principle, funding of IR£3·1 million — that is £2·37
                million sterling — over a five-year period for a modern,
                high-quality English-Irish dictionary which would supersede the
                current major English-Irish dictionary edited by Tomás De
                Bhaldraithe, which was first published in 1959. The new
                authoritative dictionary will have 50,000 key words and 250,000
                sample sentences.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council also agreed, in principle, a
                three-year action plan to ensure that there is an adequate
                provision of Irish language textbooks and resources for primary
                and post-primary schools and colleges. The plan would include
                ensuring that teachers are released from their teaching duties
                to produce the resources and that they would receive training to
                do so. The material would be made available in printed and
                electronic formats.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council considered and approved the body
                of the corporate plan of Tha Boord o Ulster-Scotch. The plan
                supported four major themes at a total cost of £1·45 million.
                They are: supporting Ulster-Scots as a living language and
                promoting its use and development; acting as a key contributor
                to the development of Ulster-Scots culture; establishing
                partnerships with the education and community sectors to promote
                the study of the Ulster-Scots language, culture and history; and
                developing the public’s understanding of the Ulster-Scots
                language and culture.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council considered a request by the
                chairperson of Tha Boord o Ulster-Scotch for assistance to carry
                out his duties and agreed a means by which this could be done.
                The Council also noted the resignation from Foras na Gaeilge of
                Cllr Cionnaith Ó Súileabháin and appointed Gearóid Ó hEara
                as his replacement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council considered the draft equality
                schemes for Tha Boord o Ulster-Scotch and Foras na Gaeilge. It
                noted both drafts and advised that they should be amalgamated
                into one scheme for the North/South Language Body. It
                acknowledged that further work would be required to agree the
                final format of the draft, taking account of the need for each
                agency, in its particular context, to be able to consult fully
                and comprehensively. The final draft equality scheme for the
                North/South Language Body will be submitted to NSMC for approval
                before public consultation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council considered the recommendation of
                a selection panel on the appointment of a chief executive to the
                Special EU Programmes Body. The name of the candidate put
                forward by the selection panel was accepted by the Council and a
                further announcement will be made in due course following
                acceptance of the appointment. The Council agreed to meet again
                in this sectoral format in Northern Ireland in February/March
                2001.</p>

                In particular, I welcome the fact that resources will be
                directed to teaching duties, that teachers will be able to be
                released from their duties so as to produce these resources,
                that they will receive the necessary training and that material

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with much of what the Member said
                about our rich and varied indigenous linguistic tradition, not
                least the tradition of Ulster-Scots. A number of his points were
                well made, in relation to teaching, studying for GCSE, teacher
                training, educational support and also availability for study at
                tertiary level. Tha Boord o Ulster-Scotch is looking at all
                those areas, and it has a number of exciting plans for the
                linguistic and cultural development of Ulster-Scots. That is
                obviously a very rich vein of our shared heritage and tradition.
                The agency is well aware of those areas, and I am confident that
                its work will encompass all of them.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Further to yesterday’s award of £1·2
                million to be spent on the language issue, I would be interested
                to hear the Minister’s views on accountability and reporting.
                I note the points he made this morning on the proposed corporate
                plans for both the Irish language and Ulster-Scots, but there is
                a clear need for full and detailed plans to be made available as
                soon as possible, giving precise information on the proposed
                activities of the body and the funding implications.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Looking at the information, I am concerned
                that once again proposals for the Irish language, including
                additional jobs and the establishment of a permanent office in
                Belfast, far outweigh and outstrip the resources being made
                available for the promotion of Ulster-Scots.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the Minister detail what mechanisms or
                directives are in place to ensure that a full report of the
                North/South Language Body and its activities for the current
                year will be presented at the earliest opportunity, given the
                non-presentation of any previous corporate plan?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGimpsey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The flow of information is very important,
                and we are trying to increase this communication through, for
                example, this statement. Everything is accountable to the
                North/South Ministerial Council and, therefore, to this
                Assembly. That is why I have made this statement. There is a
                clear flow of information from both the North/South Language
                Body, answerable to the North/South Ministerial Council, and
                from the two language agencies, which are answerable to the
                body.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The corporate plan for Tha Boord o
                Ulster-Scotch is complete in draft form, and the draft corporate
                plan for Foras na Gaeilge, the Irish language body, will be
                available early in the new year. Those will come together as
                part of the plan for the body as a whole. It is also important
                to reflect that an equality statement is a key part of that
                organisation, in common with all the other bodies attached to
                this Assembly and to the settlement. Equality statements have
                been prepared for both the agencies and, as I said in my
                statement, are in the course of being amalgamated into one
                single statement that will govern the work of the North/South
                Language Body.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Hilditch mentioned the disparity in
                funding. Under direct rule, Ulster-Scots got £118,000 per year.
                In the first year of devolution we multiplied that by five, and
                took it up to £667,000. In the second year we have doubled that
                to £1·3 million. As a result of devolution, over the past two
                years we have seen a tenfold increase in funding for
                Ulster-Scots. We recognise its importance. It was not getting
                the sort of support and resources that it merited.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As for the number of staff employed, it is
                wrong to benchmark one language against another. Ulster-Scots is
                clearly in a more embryonic developmental form. Gaelic is much
                more mature in its development. As I said this morning, the
                Irish-English dictionary is being updated. The dictionary
                currently in use is some 50 years old, and needs to be updated,
                whereas the Ulster-Scots agency is about to undertake the very
                first dictionary. That gives an indication of the different
                levels of development of, and, therefore, the different degrees
                of resources needed by each language.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Tha Boord o Ulster-Scotch will say that
                funding is adequate at the moment, and that it has its hands
                full in relation to work programmes. The Foras na Gaeilge staff
                is increasing from 40 to its complement of 65. That increase has
                been slow, because of the concern that the suspension would not
                be lifted early and the resultant delays in recruiting permanent
                staff.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Tolerance, respect and understanding of
                languages, including Irish, Ulster-Scots and ethnic minority
                languages, are the key policy objectives towards which we are
                working. Currently, Irish Gaelic has Part III European Charter
                status; Ulster-Scots has Part II status. The Ulster-Scots agency
                is confident that the language will achieve Part III within 10
                years, and Ulster-Scots can claim to be one of the fastest
                growing minority or regional language movements in Europe. There
                is much to be welcomed, not just in the activities of the Boord
                o Ulster-Scotch, but in the activities of Foras na Gaeilge.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important that the Assembly take steps
                to support Irish and Ulster-Scots, so long as they are
                complementary to each other and are not just restricted to one
                tribe or the other. I look forward to the day when we will hear
                substantial contributions in Irish from Unionist Members and
                Ulster-Scots from the Nationalists. We would support that, but
                not if the language issue is going to be split down the middle

                provision of services in other important languages, such as
                Cantonese, Mandarin and Urdu? Does the Minister agree that more
                people on this island speak those as first languages? Many of
                those people have difficulty understanding English and miss out
                on important information and opportunities. Has the Minister any
                plans to raise those genuine concerns at future North/South
                Ministerial Council meetings?</p>

                languages, including Irish, Ulster-Scots and the ethnic minority
                languages, are overriding principles of the Belfast Agreement.
                The North/South Language Body comprises two agencies — the
                Irish language agency and the Ulster-Scots agency. The Irish
                language agency is Foras na Gaeilge and the Ulster-Scots agency
                is Tha Boord o Ulster-Scotch, and each of those has a specific
                remit. I have received no proposal for a third language agency,
                and I am not sure whether it would be appropriate to consider
                that now.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are other methods of funding and
                supporting ethnic minority languages. I agree with the Member
                that it is important; there are 8,000 Cantonese speakers in
                Northern Ireland, which is a sizeable constituency. For many of
                those people, Cantonese is their first language and English
                their second. If we are to promote tolerance, respect and
                understanding, it is important that resources be directed
                towards, for example, the Chinese Welfare Association, with
                which I have had some contact. There are mechanisms to provide
                support, but I do not know whether that support is adequate. The
                matter does not fall within my remit, but I think that those
                groups would be the first to agree that there is support
                available to them.</p>

                can be implemented, sooner rather than later, as part of the
                curriculum in all primary schools. Will he consider setting up a

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A Foras na Gaeilge office is being set up in
                Belfast. Tha Boord o Ulster-Scotch has its headquarters in
                Belfast, and it is setting up an office in Donegal. Attempting
                to straddle and to reach the whole constituency is very much
                part of the agenda.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a resource allocation for support at

                responsibility —the Member is aware that boards of governors
                are responsible for delivering the curriculum in the classrooms.
                Their support comes from education and library boards, which, in
                turn, derive strategy from the Department of Education. It would
                not be for me — or, indeed, for the language bodies — to
                determine what happens in the classroom. There is certainly an
                interest in providing that type of support. I also refer to the
                answer that I gave to Dr Adamson. I said that both agencies see
                it as part of their remit to look at how they give support to

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to ask the Minister a number of
                questions and to make a number of points. First of all, I want
                to express disappointment. I know that the Minister has said
                that the Ulster-Scots Heritage Council and the language society
                are happy. I understand that they are far from happy about the
                funding that has been offered to them. If you look at the
                overall figures, it is very clear that Ulster-Scots is almost an
                afterthought. It is a poor relation. To be honest, it is a very,
                very poor relation when it comes to the funding which has been
                allocated to the different organizations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have no problem with the promotion of the
                Irish language, as long as it is done to promote the language
                and not used as a political tool. Perhaps the Minister can
                reassure us that the promotion of the Irish language will be on
                that basis and will not be used by political organizations to
                promote an ethos, culture or political viewpoint which would be
                alien to a large proportion of the people in the Province. I
                would like that reassurance first.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister also mentioned staff and
                locations. We see that the staff in the Belfast office for the
                Irish language agency will be increased from 40 to 65. He also
                mentioned that an Ulster-Scots office will be established in
                Donegal. Can he tell us when that will be established, what the
                staffing numbers will be, and where the staff will come from?
                What criteria will be used in choosing the staff of the
                Ulster-Scots office? Can he also tell us how many staff will be
                in the Belfast office, and what criteria will be used to select
                them?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also have a question about book publishing
                and distribution. I am a bit disappointed that Ulster-Scots has
                not been given significant — or, indeed, any — help towards
                book publishing and distribution. I know that the Minister is
                aware of the Ulster-Scots books that have been written by a
                number of enthusiasts who are committed to the Ulster-Scots
                language, culture and tradition. They have paid for the
                publications from their own pockets and through private funding.
                Where is the funding for this?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister also mentioned the English-Irish
                dictionary that will have 50,000 key words and 250,000 sample
                sentences. Can the Minister say whether there will be similar
                help for Ulster-Scots? In the last sentence —</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Shannon, I ask you to be a bit more
                concise when asking your questions. They are quite difficult to
                follow.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Shannon:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the last page of his statement, at the
                third paragraph from the end, the Minister states that the final
                draft equality scheme for the North/South language body will be
                submitted to the North/South Ministerial Council for approval
                before public consultation is carried out. Can the Minister
                confirm once again that the public will be asked for its opinion
                once the recommendations have been made?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">May I also ask the Minister —</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Technically, the Minister may answer only one
                of those questions. You cannot keep adding points.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Shannon:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is my last question. Can the Minister
                confirm that the Ulster-Scots language, history and cultural
                tradition will, and can, receive funding so that they can be
                adequately promoted? Will that commitment be given here today?
                Unfortunately, we have not had it so far.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGimpsey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As you said, Mr&nbsp;Deputy&nbsp;Speaker, I
                am only required to answer one of Mr&nbsp;Shannon’s questions,
                but I will do my best to answer all of them, not least because
                it is Christmas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have responded to his question about
                funding on a number of occasions, both here and in writing, but
                I do not mind answering it again. Two&nbsp;years ago, funding
                for the Ulster-Scots tradition was £118,000. In the first year
                of devolution, we multiplied that figure by five to bring the
                total funding up to £667,000. The following year, we doubled it
                again, so we have now seen a tenfold increase in funding. That
                is as much, I believe, as the Ulster-Scots movement can handle
                at the moment. It has a three-year corporate plan to develop
                this funding. We are not trying to force this mushroom to grow;
                it is doing so of its own volition. This is not simply about
                money.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Ulster-Scots tradition, language,
                heritage and legacy do not revolve around money. They depend on
                the dedication and interest of a large number of people in this
                country — it is wrong to put a price tag on everything. One of
                the problems which affect our culture, heritage and legacy is
                that people throw money at them, walk away and forget about
                them. That is not what this is about.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Shannon said that the Ulster-Scots Agency
                is not happy — that is news to me. Nobody is content;
                everybody could spend more money, but it has the support that it
                needs for the moment. It is, however, a rapidly growing
                movement, and I am determined that it should get support.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;Shannon asked for assurance that the
                Irish language would not be used by political organizations. The
                North/South language body has two agencies, both of which are
                governed by certain standards. In response to his question about
                the recruitment of staff, each agency has its own equality
                scheme. Neither Foras na Gaelige nor Tha Boord o Ulster-Scotch
                is about politics — they are about promoting tolerance,
                respect and understanding of the languages. The headquarters for
                the Ulster-Scots Agency is in Belfast, and there will also be an
                office in Donegal. Foras Na Gaeilge has a headquarters in Dublin
                and an office in Belfast. None of this information is new; it is
                all available in libraries and elsewhere.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Irish language body, Bord na Gaeilge, was
                taken over by Foras Na Gaeilge, which took over existing Irish
                language organisations. There is almost a replication of what
                was there before, and the Irish language movement is not getting
                the same level of increases as the Ulster-Scots movement. But
                this is not a competition; this is not a zero sum game. One
                culture is not diminished by the promotion of another or vice
                versa — we are seeking to enrich all cultures. The
                Ulster-Scots movement, in its corporate plan for the first three
                years, is intending to recruit 12 staff. We are looking at the
                budgets as well. That is what is in its corporate plan, and that
                is what it believes it can handle.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Part of its work is an Ulster-Scots
                dictionary and another project is an academy of Ulster- Scots,
                which I understand has been agreed with the University of
                Ulster. It is also working not just on the regional office in
                Donegal, but also on new partnerships throughout the academic
                arena and the community. It is also looking very carefully at
                east/west links through Scotland, mirroring somewhat the sort of
                links that it is seeing through the Colm Cille Initiative for
                the Irish language.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My understanding is that the Ulster-Scots
                Agency is benefiting from advice from the Irish Language Agency.
                The agencies do not see themselves in competition, and this
                agency is taking Ulster-Scots down the same path that the Irish
                language movement has trod in the past. The Irish language
                movement is not slow to offer advice. It does not see this as a
                competition. We are supporting the dictionary and part of its
                funding.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I totally refute the argument that because
                they do not get the same amount of money, one is being treated
                unfairly. The key here is equity of treatment. That is our aim.
                I have told Mr Shannon that there has been a tenfold increase in
                the amounts given in the past couple of years. It is wrong to
                try to force-feed and force growth; this is not about money.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Ulster-Scots movement is strong and
                vibrant, and it is growing. Incidentally, it is a movement that
                Mr Shannon and I are comfortable with because we come from that
                tradition in Newtownards. He does not have the right or the
                authority to make the charge that this is all about money. I
                repeat: this is not about money. This is about equity of
                treatment, and together with the House and the Executive
                Committee, I am determined that everybody be treated properly
                and fairly.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McElduff:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.
                Cuirim fáilte roimh ráiteas an Aire sa Tionól inniu agus ba
                mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leis dá bharr. Tá mise
                sásta go bhfuil an Foras Teanga ag dul i neart agus go bhfuil
                sé de rún aige oifig bhuan a lonnú i mBéal Feirste roimh i
                bhfad. I want to welcome the statement from the Minister, and I
                am pleased to observe that Gaelscoil Uí Néill continues to go
                from strength to strength. The three-year action plan to ensure
                adequate provision of language textbooks and resources for
                schools and colleges is extremely important. To date, many
                schools have been lacking those resources. Given yesterday’s
                announcement that Gaelscoil Uí Dhochartaigh and Comhairle na
                Gaelscolaíochta in Coalisland and Strabane respectively have
                reached grant-aided status, it is clear that increasingly the
                Irish-medium sector needs to be properly resourced in this way.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I particularly welcome the news of the
                imminent establishment of the pre-school organization, and I
                would like some more information on how that may interact with
                Gaelscoil Uí Dhochartaigh and Comhairle na Gaelscolaíochta.
                Similarly, I welcome plans to establish a permanent office in
                Belfast and will be glad to learn where that will be situated
                and when it will be fully operative. Finally, I just want to
                wish the Minister Nollaig shona agus Bliain Úr faoi mhaise</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGimpsey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A temporary office is being established at
                the moment. It will move to permanent offices when premises have
                been found. I understand that the temporary office will be in
                Berry Street in Belfast. A permanent place will then be decided
                upon.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the pre-school organization, I
                do not have the information at hand to help the Member in that
                respect, but I will try to find it for him. If we have it, I
                will give it to him, and, if we do not, we will tell him where
                to get it. I assume that the Department of Education or,
                perhaps, the education and library boards know more about this
                than I do. Incidentally, discussions are ongoing between
                officials in my Department and Department of Education
                officials.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a clear interest in Irish-medium
                sector education and Foras na Gaeilge recognises that. This is
                why it is updating Irish-language textbooks and dictionaries.
                Its three-year action plan is not yet available, but Members
                will have an opportunity to look at it and comment on it early
                in the new year. Foras na Gaeilge and Tha Boord o Ulster-Scotch
                recognise the interest that schools have and the need to promote
                educational texts and dictionaries.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Poots:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, can the Minister tell the House what
                party and what council Mr Cionnaith Ó Súilleabháin
                represents? I know what his replacement represents, but I am not
                sure if Mr Ó Súilleabháin represents Istanbul city council.
                Perhaps the Minister can inform us.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As for the £7 million allocation, can the
                Minister tell us how much of that comes from the Northern
                Ireland Budget? Does he agree that, given the constraints on
                library spending, an excessive amount of money is being spent on
                the Irish language when towns like my own, Lisburn, do not have
                a decent library that is open and available to everybody?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGimpsey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not know which council Cionnaith O
                Súilleabháin represents. He was appointed to the board of
                Foras na Gaeilge, he resigned, and he has since been replaced. I
                will certainly find out and I will pass the information on to
                the Member.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure
                will provide £2·3 million to the North/South language body in
                its start-up year. Of that, £1·8 million will go to Foras na
                Gaeilge, and £0·5 million will go to Tha Boord o
                Ulster-Scotch. Indicative funding will rise next year, and the
                Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure will provide a total of
                £3·5 million to the Irish language and Ulster-Scots. Tha Boord
                o Ulster-Scotch will receive £1·3 million, which represents a
                tenfold increase on the funds it received a couple of years ago.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And then we are back to a library for Lisburn.
                I can add nothing to the answers I have given the Member on
                other occasions. I am actively bidding for capital funding for
                libraries — I am straying off the subject, Mr Speaker, if you
                will forgive me. It has been decided to go down the private
                finance initiative (PFI) route for a library for Lisburn rather
                than go down the traditional route of approaching the Department
                for capital funding. If that is successful, a library will be
                provided, and if it is not, traditional funding will doubtless
                be sought from the Department, as was the case with other
                libraries.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Libraries are important, but our language and
                our heritage are also important. Heritage is valuable to us,
                and, as Dr Johnson said, &quot;Language is the pedigree of
                nations&quot;. Languages are an important part of our culture
                and our heritage, and we are particularly lucky here in Northern
                Ireland, and in the British Isles in general, to have a rich and
                indigenous linguistic tradition. It would be a shame if we were
                to lose that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is an oral tradition in Ulster-Scots
                that is vanishing because time marches on and the tradition is
                held by elderly members of our population. Tha Boord o Ulster-
                Scotch is recording that oral tradition so that the vocabulary
                and phraseology are not lost. This is very timely.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have to be prepared to spend some moneys,
                and this year we are contributing £2·3&nbsp;million to
                language. Next year we will be contributing £3·5&nbsp;million.
                From the overall Budget of £6&nbsp;billion that was discussed
                yesterday, the allocation of £2·3&nbsp;million to preserve
                something as important as the tradition of Ulster-Scots, for
                example, is worthwhile. I also firmly believe that we have rich
                indigenous linguistic traditions in Ulster-Scots and Irish that
                are worth preserving. The small amount that we are talking about
                to ensure that Ulster-Scots is preserved and promoted is
                important because it enriches all of us.</p>

                employs 143&nbsp;staff and has a budget of £22&nbsp;million.
                Set up in 1992, it is responsible for spearheading the drive for
                competitiveness in Northern Ireland companies through
                innovation, research and development and the use of technology
                and technology transfer. It also provides a range of scientific,
                technological and environmental services to the Government and
                industry. Since 1995, IRTU has been a Next Steps agency.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company Development Programme (CDP) was
                formerly administered by the Training and Employment Agency.
                However, it is currently part of the Department of Enterprise,
                Trade and Investment and employs 30&nbsp;staff. It provides
                assistance to management and skills training in companies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, there is the Northern Ireland
                Tourist Board (NITB), which, in addition to its promotional and
                marketing roles, has some 30&nbsp;staff who administer financial
                support to businesses in the tourism sector. The NITB is a non-
                departmental public body.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a first step in this process, I
                commissioned detailed research on the current arrangement and on
                how economic development support is administered in other parts
                of the UK, in the Republic of Ireland, in mainland Europe and
                further afield. I also asked for a detailed report on local
                enterprise provision. In October, I issued a consultative paper
                entitled ‘Towards a New Structure for Economic Development
                Support in Northern Ireland’. I sent it to ministerial
                Colleagues, the Enterprise, Trade and Investment Committee, the
                business bodies, other social partners, through the Economic
                Development Forum, and NIPSA, the trade union representing staff
                in the existing agencies. Responses were received from over 40
                interested parties, representing a wide cross-section of
                opinion. The clear and constructive input of ministerial
                Colleagues and the Enterprise, Trade and Investment Committee
                was particularly appreciated and helpful.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The overwhelming weight of opinion supported
                the view that the time is now right for a better and more
                efficient delivery of economic development services, and that
                the best and most efficient means of achieving this is through
                the establishment of a new, single agency. The clear
                predominance of opinion is that the agency should have more
                flexibility and creditability and it would also be more
                responsive to the needs of its clients if it were at arm’s
                length from Government. In short, it needs to be capable of
                responding quickly and should not play catch-up in an intensely
                competitive global market place. It must be dynamic, nimble and
                focused, with more emphasis on getting the job done and less on
                bureaucracy and it must have as its core a more aggressive and
                targeted approach to the international stage to position and
                promote Northern Ireland as a business base with few rivals.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In my deliberations, I have examined a wide
                range of options. These include: integration of service delivery
                entirely within the Department of Enterprise, Trade and
                Investment; the status quo and minor variations from it; a
                lead-agency scenario, and the setting up of a single agency both
                inside and outside Government. Many commentators and respondents
                to the consultation paper have been adamant that structures
                should follow strategy and that if the strategic context and
                policy direction are not right, the structure, in itself, will
                not contribute significantly to the success or otherwise of our
                efforts.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although the work I have undertaken has been
                focused primarily on the most appropriate structures, I should
                emphasise that a great deal of work has already been done on
                both the strategic context and the policy framework. This
                includes not only work on Strategy 2010, but more recently, the
                detailed work which led to the draft Programme for Government
                and ongoing work in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and
                Investment on corporate planning on a three-year basis and
                operational plans for the coming year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department has also been looking
                critically at aspects of service delivery that cut across a
                number of the existing agencies. These include: export services
                and programmes; the use of repayable forms of assistance; and
                how indigenous businesses are handled.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These deliberations have been set in the
                broad framework of post-Strategy 2010 thinking, in the context
                of Northern Ireland business’s operating in a global economy
                and facing ever more rapid technological change and in the
                context of the growing role of local government in economic
                development.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Globalization means that all businesses in
                Northern Ireland — large and small — face the same
                challenges, and all must innovate and respond to new
                technologies. In turn, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and
                Investment must provide a comprehensive service to businesses,
                and I believe that a single agency is now the most appropriate
                vehicle to deliver this.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some may ask &quot;Why bother?&quot; That is
                a valid question, and the answer is simple: for years, our
                agencies did sterling work, both at home and abroad, against the
                backdrop of a reign of terror. They had to grapple with the
                negative image of Northern Ireland created by the gunman and the
                bomber. Corporate doors were closed to them — not unnaturally.
                Potential investors sought stable economic and political regions
                before even considering the sales pitch. This means that the
                successes they have scored were all the more remarkable, and for
                that they are owed a debt of gratitude.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The climate is changing, however. Northern
                Ireland is climbing slowly back to normality, and we need to
                capitalise on the new opportunities that are opening up. That
                means that to attract the best, we have to modernise, innovate
                and seek new ways of doing the job.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have considered in detail whether such an
                agency should be inside or outside Government. With the advent
                of devolution and the re-organization of Departments, there are
                plausible arguments for keeping such significant expenditure —
                currently in the region of £200 million — within the direct
                control of Government. However, in order to meet the challenges
                of the knowledge- based economy — which we must promote even
                more keenly — we need structures which facilitate rapid
                decision taking and give flexibility to respond to changing
                markets. We need to be able to employ key specialists and offer
                the terms necessary to motivate them. I am convinced that this
                cannot be easily achieved within the Civil Service. Northern
                Ireland is unique in the United Kingdom, and, indeed, in these
                islands and further afield, in having economic development
                responsibilities so close to Government.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.30 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have, therefore, concluded that the right
                model is a single economic development agency in the form of a
                non-departmental public body (NDPB) sponsored by my Department.
                In such an arrangement, accountability will be a key issue. The
                details are yet to be defined, but the permanent secretary will
                remain as overall accounting officer. I have had helpful input
                from the Minister of Finance and Personnel, Mr Durkan, and
                officials from his Department on accountability arrangements and
                financial and personnel implications. We shall wish to follow up
                on the detail with the Department of Finance and Personnel in
                due course. I also wish to consult with other ministerial
                Colleagues in order to learn from best practice on
                accountability in their areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although the performance of the existing
                agencies has been strong, particularly in the last few years, we
                face new challenges, and the new agency should be designed to
                meet them. It will not be an amalgamation of the existing
                agencies, but an entirely new body. As an NDPB, it will have an
                executive board. I shall consider the composition of this board
                carefully, but shall certainly wish to include representatives
                of the social partners. The agency’s ethos will be
                professional, businesslike and responsive to customer need. The
                mainstay of its focus will be the promotion and facilitation of
                innovation and entrepreneurship in the economy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The new approach will facilitate a shift
                towards assistance more appropriate to the needs of dynamic
                indigenous businesses seeking to respond quickly to the rapidly
                changing demands and skill requirements of the knowledge-driven,
                service-based global economy. It will seek to accelerate the
                modernization of our traditional businesses and will strongly
                promote international trade in support of GDP growth. It will
                liaise with and develop appropriate partnership arrangements
                with local government and will be responsible for attracting
                inward investment aggressively.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The creation of jobs and wealth is essential
                to it all. Talent is a precious commodity, and we have it in
                abundance. We cannot afford to export it to other countries
                where it flourishes. We must be creative in finding new ways of
                keeping that talent at home, of saying and then proving to our
                people — our asset base — that they need not emigrate and
                put down new roots elsewhere, for everything they want is right
                here. To do that, it is vital that we engineer the right
                business and economic culture to allow talent to blossom, new
                products to be developed, and jobs to be created.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This &quot;road map&quot; to address the
                challenges and opportunities that lie ahead is therefore
                people-centred and people-driven. I do not suggest change for
                the sake of change; change is imperative if we are to realise
                our full potential and build the kind of future that many of us
                in this House have worked for so long to achieve.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I therefore propose to establish an entirely
                new economic development agency that will have a high degree of
                autonomy, but also be clearly accountable to my Department and
                to myself. It will have a remit including the existing
                activities of the IDB, LEDU, IRTU, the company development
                programme (formerly part of the T&amp;EA) and the business
                support activities of the NITB.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Members will be aware, the new North/South
                Tourism Company will promote the island of Ireland as a single
                tourist destination to the mutual benefit of both parts of the
                island. However, the NITB continues to have statutory
                responsibility for its important functions of promoting Northern
                Ireland as a holiday destination, regulating the industry, and
                assisting its small businesses. Through this restructuring, I
                propose to integrate the development of Northern Ireland’s
                tourism businesses into mainstream local economic development.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In response to my consultation paper, many of
                those commenting on tourism were firmly of the view that
                assistance to the tourism sector was no different in principle
                or practice to business support for any other business sector.
                Indeed, it is perceived that support for businesses in the
                tourism sector will be strengthened in the new economic
                development agency. This transfer of business support functions
                will free the NITB to concentrate on functions which should
                remain with a free-standing statutory tourist board. Of key
                importance is the need to build a strong, professional marketing
                role based on an understanding of what Northern Ireland has to
                offer and how it should best be communicated.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is imperative that the NITB continues to
                work closely with key industry interests in tourism, so that a
                coherent approach is presented and understood by all.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of Enterprise, Trade and
                Investment will continue to exercise its responsibilities in
                relation to wider economic development policy, energy, tourism,
                health and safety, consumer interests and business regulation.
                The Department will retain the key responsibility to set and
                drive policy in relation to the new single agency. As noted, the
                Department will be a key link in the accountability chain for
                the agency’s expenditure.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am acutely aware of the importance of
                integrating strategy and policy with service delivery. In
                developing detailed implementation plans for the new agency, I
                will be seeking to build in mechanisms to ensure close working
                relationships between the agency, the Department and the other
                Departments that have key roles in economic development.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The policy, practice and implementation of
                industrially focused research and development will be centrally
                embedded within our new economic support structure. By
                effectively harnessing our existing expertise, the new agency
                will fully exploit the contribution of the science and
                technology base in the creation of a sustainable,
                knowledge-based economy. In furtherance of this, relationships
                between the agency, the Department of Higher and Further
                Education, Training and Employment, the universities and
                business will be fully developed. The mainstay of our focus will
                be the promotion and facilitation of innovation and
                entrepreneurship in the economy. The &quot;golden thread of
                innovation&quot; will be woven through the entire fabric of the
                new agency.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The restructuring I am proposing will not of
                itself impact on the arrangements for local economic
                development. At present, LEDU has the lead role within the
                Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment for liaison with
                the councils and other bodies that undertake local economic
                activities. The IDB has a separate but important responsibility
                to work with the councils to market their areas to potential
                inward investors. These two functions will be brought together
                and enhanced in the new agency within the context of the small
                business strategy, which is one of my actions in the Programme
                for Government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is considerable scope for better
                co-ordination and elimination of duplication in local economic
                development, and my aim will be to make as much progress as
                possible on this, pending the review of local government. I
                welcome this review, and I hope that a restructured local
                government will be better placed to develop its relationships
                with the new agency and to exploit the greater scope which will
                exist for specific actions to be undertaken in due course by
                councils.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Closely related to local economic development
                is the social economy, and we have accepted that this is a
                sector that has potential to contribute more to our social
                inclusion agenda. At this stage, I have not decided whether the
                new agency should have the lead role on the social economy
                within the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment or if
                this should remain with the Department. I will be considering
                this as part of the detailed planning for the new agency.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Staffing of the new agency will be critical.
                We are indebted to our existing staff for their efforts
                hitherto, sometimes in very trying circumstances. I am proposing
                to build on the expertise of the agency staff who will be
                working at the new agency from its launch. I expect many of them
                to remain and develop their careers therein. The existing staff
                are a mix of civil servants, mainly IDB and IRTU staff, but it
                includes a small number of former T&amp;EA staff in the Business
                Support Division, and public servants, mainly from LEDU. There
                is also a small number of employees from the NITB, who currently
                administer grant support to small businesses in tourism. I have,
                therefore, decided that the best way to proceed is to second the
                civil servants to the new agency, transfer LEDU staff and
                relevant staff of the NITB, and give the agency the facility to
                recruit directly in order to meet its changing needs quickly and
                flexibly. The agency will have a strong regional profile and
                will draw up and implement its own equality scheme. A high level
                of priority will be given to both equality and New TSN issues. I
                am wholly and practically committed to determining how more
                efficient and effective business support can be increasingly
                focused in the areas of highest need, many of which also now
                offer the best opportunities for employers to attain the
                employees they need.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although decisions have been taken in
                principle, there is still significant work to be done. I want to
                pay particular tribute to the restructuring unit in my own
                Department, which has worked so hard and coherently over the
                last six months. Preliminary assessment shows that the changes
                that I am contemplating are likely to have a positive financial
                impact, but a full cost-benefit analysis will be required as
                further details are established. Work has been carried out on
                the equality implications of such a change, but, again, more
                comprehensive consideration will be required, and consultation
                with section 75 groups and others will be undertaken.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will present a policy memorandum to the
                Executive Committee in January, seeking approval to introduce
                legislation as soon as possible thereafter. However, on the
                basis of the weight of legislation currently under
                consideration, I feel that it is unlikely that the legislation
                will be passed before autumn 2001. The new agency will be
                formally established as soon as it is practicable to do so
                thereafter.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will conclude by summarizing matters.
                Currently, Northern Ireland is substantially a small and
                medium-sized (SME) business economy. In recent years, great
                strides have been made towards normality. In business terms,
                significant and welcome progress has been made. For example, in
                1999 employment in Northern Ireland in the new industries —
                tradable services and information and communications technology
                — increased by over 30%.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Significant new challenges still lie ahead.
                The economy must be increasingly geared towards meeting the
                needs of the rapidly changing, knowledge-based, global economy,
                where demands are increasing all the time. To do this, we need
                more vibrant, entrepreneurial, local businesses, which are
                capable of winning export business and generating greater
                wealth. It is imperative that the Northern Ireland economy grasp
                the opportunity now available to it. We must respond with
                confidence to these new challenges. If it is done correctly, the
                future can be faced with confidence — a future with greater
                wealth and prosperity for all in an inclusive, fair and stable
                society.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Northern Ireland has a long and proud
                tradition founded on its inventiveness and its ability to
                innovate. That same business acumen and courage will dictate the
                shape of our second industrial age. Already, efforts to nurture
                knowledge-based industries have been impressive, but I must tell
                the House that they are merely a beginning. If this necessary
                restructuring of our agencies is driven with vision and vigour,
                we can fast track the growth — along with the hope — that we
                all need in the Northern Ireland of the new century.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I know that more investment can be encouraged
                from home and abroad. I also know that our local businesses, our
                workers, and the staff in my Department and its agencies have
                the confidence to achieve what is needed for the future. I ask
                the House to support me, my Department and the new agency in the
                daunting task that lies ahead.</p>

                also welcome his kind comments about my Committee. The Minister
                recognised the clear and constructive, collective input that the

                statement a commitment to innovation, co-operation, the tourist

                the comment on page four of the Minister’s statement that the
                climate is changing and that we are slowly climbing back to
                normality. However, does the Minister recognise that the North’s
                negative image has many more roots than those mentioned in his

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I said in the statement that New TSN and
                equality issues will be, and will continue to be, at the heart
                of this. We have set targets in the Programme for Government.
                Those targets are very ambitious, and are aimed at achieving not
                only 75% of first-time visits into TSN areas by potential inward
                investors, but 75% of new jobs in those same areas. Those are
                very ambitious targets.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In my opinion, there is potential in many of
                those areas, because they have the potential resource of
                personnel that companies need. I said in my statement that I
                believed that we could match the needs of companies to the
                skills in those areas. That is not something that can be done by
                my Department alone. We will need to audit the TSN areas to
                ascertain the skills base and training needs to match the skills
                of the local community to the requirements of the new
                businesses, and the indigenous businesses which we hope will
                expand.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is a huge task, and I must acknowledge
                the co-operation of Dr Farren, Minister of Higher and Further
                Education, Training and Employment, and his Colleagues, because
                we are working very closely with them to ensure that there is a
                real possibility of achieving those objectives.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not want the House to doubt for one
                minute our desire to succeed. One of the purposes behind the new
                agency is to create the recognition that Northern Ireland is a
                small economy. Its compactness, the free movement of ideas, and
                the joining together of the different themes will help to
                accelerate our achievement of the aims set out in the Programme
                for Government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our negative image goes back a long way. We
                owe a debt of gratitude to those working in tourism and to those
                who have tried to achieve inward investment and indigenous
                expansion against our background of the last 30 years. It would
                be churlish not to place on the record our debt of gratitude to
                those civil servants and other public servants who have achieved
                very considerable success against such a terrible backdrop.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I warmly wel- come the Minister’s very
                important statement today. During the Committee’s
                investigation into ‘Strategy 2010’, we found very strong
                support in the community for the proposals which the Minister
                has brought forward this morning.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In his statement, the Minister said that
                Northern Ireland is substantially a SME economy. We made a very
                successful visit to North America in August. We visited the
                offices of the American Small Business Administration, which is
                very innovative in dealing with small businesses and encouraging
                a much wider remit for the development of small businesses than
                we have under LEDU. Bearing that in mind, will the Minister be
                taking on board some of the ideas and lessons that we learnt
                from that visit, and does he also recognise that, through such
                innovative developments, more women can be encouraged to
                participate in business?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, does the Minister also accept that,
                if we are to move away from the grant culture towards providing
                softer incentives for business development, local banks will
                need to become more involved in the economic development
                process?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am indebted to the Member for his comments.
                I accept that our economy is primarily a small- business
                economy. We are indebted to LEDU for the work that it has done,
                and is continuing to do, in that sector.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our visit to Washington in August, when we
                met representatives from the Small Business Administration, was
                not our first encounter with that organization. Dr McDonnell and
                I, along with our colleagues, met Aida Alvarez, the American
                Cabinet Minister, who is responsible for the Small Business
                Administration, in Belfast in 1998. We were impressed then, as
                we were in August.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no doubt that the vast growth in the
                American economy has come from employment in small businesses.
                The major Fortune 500 companies have not increased employment.
                Small businesses have also brought many more women into
                business. Most of those setting up new businesses through the
                Small Business Administration are women. Northern Ireland is
                behind in that area, although we are improving. However, we
                should take a new look at how to develop the required packages.
                We are trying to move away from the grant culture and, in the
                case of small businesses, we are — to a significant extent —
                succeeding. However, further work is required.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is continuing criticism of the role of
                the clearing banks in business in Northern Ireland and
                throughout the United Kingdom. In America there is a different
                legal framework which obliges them to provide certain services
                to local communities. I am keen to explore the idea of offering
                loan guarantees to replace grants.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must change the way that we offer
                assistance. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment
                is considering proposals on how to rebalance the packages that
                we can offer. I am open to the Committee’s views on how that
                could be best done, but I am conscious that a new agency will
                want to focus on what it believes to be the best way of getting
                back the spirit of entrepreneurship that used to be dominant in
                Northern Ireland. A century ago, Northern Ireland had one of the
                most innovative economies in the world. I want us to return to
                that, because we have been languishing in recent years, despite
                some significant improvements. Much more could be done, and that
                is one of the major challenges that we face.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I remind Members and the Minister that many

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I congratulate the Minister on dealing with
                this issue. It has been long discussed but, until now, no action
                has been taken. It has often been said that form should follow
                function. Given that, how does the new structure promote
                innovation and the attainment of a higher rate of research and
                development spending in the local economy?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Minister think that the Company
                Development Programme (CDP) is better located in the new agency
                or in its former home, the Training and Employment Agency? The
                statement is relatively silent on the issue of the internal
                demarcations in the new agency. Will there be sub-divisions, for
                example, for internal industries and externally owned firms?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the principal reasons for the
                reorganization was to put innovation at the core. In the
                consultation document, I said that the golden thread of
                innovation would run right through the agency. The IRTU, which
                was the most recent of the organizations to be set up, has made
                a significant improvement to our recognition of the importance
                of research. The Department has tried to take that work forward
                through the information age initiative, but I felt that it was
                wrong to have it sitting in splendid isolation; it must be
                brought into the centre of things. I assure the Member that a
                top priority will be to reach the targets set out in the
                Programme for Government for an increase in research and
                development.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is the only way that we will keep ahead
                of the competition. It is the key issue in the knowledge-based
                economy to which we are committed. The CDP was not put into the
                Training and Employment Agency when the new Departments were
                created, because CDP concentrates on training for people who are
                in work, as opposed to those who are out of work.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I said to Mr&nbsp;Doherty that the key will
                be to match the needs of companies to the new situation and,
                therefore, to the skills of their employees. We have to bear in
                mind that we are in the era of lifelong learning, so when an
                employee joins a company, he has to be continuously trained and
                retrained. It is one of the mechanisms we can use, as opposed to
                grants — one of the softer forms of assistance that we can
                make. For that reason, I am fully committed to having the CDP as
                an integral part of the agency.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There will be internal demarcations, but I
                wish to consult further with the Department, and I may engage
                other assistance, because we must remember that we have a
                transition programme to move through. There is a great deal of
                detail to be worked out, and consultation must take place with
                regard to section&nbsp;75 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998, so
                it will be some time before I can bring forward detailed
                proposals. All of these matters will have to be addressed in the
                new agency.</p>

                Now that we are in the twenty-first century, we all recognise
                that there is a desperate need to refocus our efforts on the
                whole range of economic development. We have seen how many North

                last few years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The statement goes a long way towards
                clearing the air and removing the uncertainty and indecision
                that prevailed. I particularly welcome the Minister’s comment
                that the new agency will need to be capable of responding
                quickly and not playing catch-up in an intensely global
                marketplace; that it must be dynamic, nimble and focused, with
                more emphasis on getting the job done, and less on bureaucracy;
                that it must have, at its core, a more aggressive and targeted
                approach —</p>

                the challenges that we face. We need a much stronger emphasis on
                innovation and research. Can we assume and ensure that the
                &quot;golden thread&quot; that the Minister mentions is
                sufficiently robust and effective, and that it is not so fine
                that we can barely see it? That is the nub. We can have a golden
                thread running through it, but if it is very fine, it may get
                lost. That thread will need to be very strong, because it will
                form the backbone. Can we get the necessary legislation moving
                much more quickly? I am a little worried by the suggestion that
                it will take a year to put the whole thing in place. We need to
                avoid wasting time. What can we do now to begin to implement the
                reshaping and restructuring that will move the process on? The
                rest of the world will not wait for us; we have to get ahead.</p>

                being isolated; I was also concerned about the information age
                initiative’s being isolated. I want the ideas, skills and
                knowledge of people in those organizations to continue to exist
                throughout the new agency. If that does not happen, we will have
                failed, and we will not be successful in the market place. It is
                as simple as that.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the Member’s point about
                legislation, I was trying to end the uncertainty, as he
                suggested. I am conscious, however, that a great deal of staff
                there are doing a good job. I am conscious that they have
                careers, and I do not want to delay or lose the momentum of the
                agencies. I will be doing everything to work with the staff to
                ensure that that does not happen.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members control the legislation, and the best
                thing we could do would be to improve the speed with which we
                pass legislation. In reviewing the Assembly’s performance so
                far, it seems that we have not passed legislation with the speed
                which we would like. If this legislation could be passed more
                quickly, I assure the Member that I would not be holding it
                back.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the Minister accept that there would be
                a general welcome for what has been proposed? It is very much in
                line with what the Committee decided.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the tribute paid to the staff who
                played such an important role in promoting inward investment
                during a very difficult period of Northern Ireland’s history.
                Does the Minister accept that there will be a great deal of
                concern and uncertainty on the part of the staff of the present
                agencies about his statement that a &quot;majority&quot; of the
                staff will be transferred to the new body? The implication is
                that a number of staff members will not be transferred to the
                new body. Can he tell the House how many staff will not be
                transferred and what grades will be affected? Can he assure the
                House that those who are not transferred, but who are civil
                servants, will be offered alternative employment within the
                Civil Service? What will happen to those members of staff who
                are not civil servants, and who have not been offered an
                opportunity of employment in the new body? Will he accept that
                there will be some concern if the reward for staff who have been
                working for 10 or 15 years, trying to promote Northern Ireland
                in terribly difficult circumstances, is to be made unemployed as
                a result of this decision.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Inevitably, in any change process, there is
                bound to be concern. I have made it clear, on a number of
                occasions this morning, that I appreciate the work that has been
                done. I said that, from day one, the agency will be staffed by
                people currently working for existing bodies. The precise scale
                has not yet been determined. There are outstanding matters. For
                instance, I have not concluded how we should treat the social
                economy — whether it should be done in the Department, through
                the agency, or by some other mechanism. However, we have been in
                close contact with our trade union representatives, and I have
                assured them that there will be no compulsory redundancies as a
                result of this activity. I have further assured them that no
                individual member of staff will be personally disadvantaged as a
                result of this reorganization.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Staff in the agencies are of various
                categories. Some are civil servants and some are public servants
                — for example, LEDU is a company limited by guarantee outside
                the Government. People are of different status. Within the IDB,
                civil servants have different categories. It is a very
                complicated issue, but it is our intention to ensure that nobody
                is disadvantaged; there will be no compulsory redundancies, and
                staff have been assured of this.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We will be working as hard as possible to
                ensure that we do not lose our present momentum. When it comes
                to carrying out the reorganization, people will be given every
                opportunity. I believe that the majority will choose to remain
                in Economic Development and develop their careers there.
                Obviously, there may be positive financial aspects from this, as
                the total number of staff may be less than is currently
                employed. The precise details of that have not been worked out,
                but I can assure the Member that people will not be
                disadvantaged or made redundant.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr O’Hagan:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a Member of the Enterprise, Trade and
                Investment Committee, I look forward to working with the
                Minister on this and other issues in the coming months. An
                overhaul of the agencies, especially the IDB, has been long
                overdue. Concerns have been expressed about accountability,
                transparency, performance and value for money. These were
                especially outlined by the Westminster Public Accounts
                Committee. Will the Minister assure this House that adequate
                measures will be taken to ensure that the mistakes of the past
                are not repeated?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Enterprise, Trade and Investment
                Committee intends to visit the South of Ireland, Scotland and
                Wales in January. We will meet with other bodies in those three
                jurisdictions. It is to be hoped that those meetings will show
                us how they do things, and we will pass that on.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A Department of Enterprise, Trade and
                Investment working group reported that there was considerable
                scope for greater co-operation in trade development on the
                island of Ireland. What links and co-operation does the Minister
                foresee between this new body and the Industrial Development
                Agency (IDA), Enterprise Ireland and the all-Ireland trade body,
                InterTrade Ireland, which was established under the North/South
                Ministerial Council? Go raibh maith agat.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am looking forward, obviously, to hearing
                from the Committee after it visits the other agencies in these
                islands to see how they do things. As I said, we have carried
                out a body of research, which I am sure has been available to
                you, and it will be interesting to meet people and to see how
                they see things.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of course, we must remember at all times that
                we are competitors and that we are fighting for many of the same
                pieces of potential inward investment, but that has not stopped
                us from co-operating. In May, the IDB and IDA met for the first
                time. They have undertaken some work, particularly in the
                north-west — as the Member’s Colleague will be aware — and
                there has been further communication since then. I have every
                reason to believe that the board of the IDB is planning to
                continue that work.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">InterTrade Ireland has specific roles, which
                do not include inward investment, but it does have the role of
                promoting trade, in which it has been very active. There is a
                good deal of communication between all the development agencies
                and InterTrade Ireland for the simple reason that it is
                necessary to work together to ensure that there is no overlap.
                InterTrade Ireland had a focused remit in the first few months
                of its life, which was drawn from the agreement. It had a
                particular agenda to work through from its inception. It is
                working its way through that, and a progress report was given at
                the last meeting of the body. It is beginning to develop its
                corporate plans and find the most effective use of its time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Co-operation between these organizations —
                joining up their activities —is common sense. I am confident
                that the new agency will, as part of its natural development, be
                able to harness any communications and work together with other
                organizations to avoid duplication. I do not doubt that it will
                wish to review the general memorandums of understanding that
                exist in these islands to ensure that we are not involved in
                Dutch auctions for potential inward investments.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Beggs:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Minister’s reassurances that
                no staff will be disadvantaged by the change and that there will
                not be compulsory redundancies in any of the agencies. Does the
                Minister agree that one of the benefits of having a central body
                is that there will be less central administration than within
                the former four bodies? Does he agree that this will provide
                better support for local businesses and enable more money to be
                spent on support and advice to businesses, rather than on civil
                servants who are operating administration within the various
                Departments?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A central administration will possibly be
                more effective than having three or four, and, as I pointed out,
                the impact of this is likely to be financially positive, but
                quite apart from the savings, it will bring organizations
                together with the exchange of ideas, networking, and so on.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If people who are doing the same sort of work
                in isolation, inevitably, a great deal of experience and
                knowledge will be lost as a result of that. We want to minimise
                the bureaucracy and focus the maximum amount of resources on the
                delivery of a service to businesses. I must say that I agree.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are up to 300 different organizations
                in Northern Ireland that deliver some form of economic
                development or training service. This illustrates our huge task
                of ensuring that there is no duplication, that we do not spend
                more money than is needed on administration, and that the
                maximum effort is focused on service delivery. Despite the
                financial aspect, this will ensure that the same quality of
                service is delivered throughout the Province. That is why the
                organization must have a regional focus.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Byrne:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Minister’s comprehensive
                statement, particularly the thrusts and themes it contains. The
                Minister is certainly grasping the nettle in relation to
                economic development agencies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I contend that LEDU was so successful because
                it was very close to people in all regions through its area
                offices. We must ensure that a more centralised, bureaucratic
                system does not evolve as a result of the creation of a single
                agency. Will the agency have area offices in all the regions?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, it is important that the board
                reflect all of Northern Ireland, and not simply specific or
                preferred persons. A geographical spread is needed. The staff
                and the culture of the staff are vital, and I pay tribute to the
                employees that have been involved. However, if there is to be an
                enterprise-driven culture, it will be necessary to develop a
                more innovative and energetic culture among the senior
                management of this new agency. This will promote the enterprise
                drive that we will have to face in the future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, I have been concerned about inward
                investment for some time, particularly the almost unhealthy
                relationship that exists between preferred consultancy firms,
                accountancy firms and the agencies. This causes annoyance to
                other smaller accountancy firms, which feel that they too could
                prepare professional business plans and make good assessments of
                potential projects. Can the Minister assure us that, in the
                future, there will not be the same cosy relationship that might,
                in the past, have existed among some of the larger accountancy
                firms?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will take note of the Member’s last point
                and seek advice on it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This organization will have a regional focus,
                but I cannot make any assurances to the Member about West
                Tyrone, which is presumably what he is driving at. If the agency
                is to be effective it must be represented throughout the
                Province, rather than in only one location. I have made that
                clear.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Furthermore, I have said that the board will
                reflect the social partners, and all issues will have to be
                incorporated. We must have effective people. I am conscious of
                the regional aspect involved, and that has been taken into
                account in appointments to existing boards. It is a very
                difficult task. There will be competition under the normal
                guidelines for membership of this new board, and, when we are
                setting the criteria, we will have to take care to get it right.
                Once those are set, the matter is beyond our control. We will
                certainly wish to take those points into account.</p>

                Among those of us at local government level, the issue has been
                raised on and off for years. I hope my response to Mr&nbsp;Wells
                clarified our direction. I was anxious to end the uncertainty,
                not to create more. Staff are now conscious of what we are
                doing, and they know where we are going with this. Our task in
                the next few months is to ensure that we carry this out in a
                businesslike and professional way. When the final distribution
                of area offices is determined, we will see whether the Member
                believes that I am grasping the nettle.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Minister’s statement,
                particularly the point about putting more emphasis on getting
                the job done and reducing bureaucracy, and everybody would
                welcome that. Further to that, can the Minister outline the
                efficiency that would result from the amalgamation of the
                agencies? Will he also tell us about ongoing developments with
                local authorities? The Minister talks about doing this on the
                basis of a review of local authorities, but it might take up to
                four&nbsp;years before that is complete and the new local
                authorities are in place. In the past, there has often been a
                &quot;hands off&quot; relationship between local authorities
                and, for example, the IDB. Can he also outline the relationship
                with the North/South Trade and Business Development Body? When
                will the issue of accountability be clearly defined? Will the
                Minister guarantee that the appointments to the non-departmental
                public bodies will be made fairly, and that people will not be
                excluded because of their political viewpoints?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the relationship with local
                authorities, the Member will know that I spent many years
                working in local economic development. I strongly believe in
                local economic development and in a specific role in that for
                local authorities. A few years ago, we were given that
                opportunity for the first time, and it has been a resounding
                success in councils across the Province. It has given councils a
                focus. Against the background at that time, we were not even
                allowed to control car parking — incidentally, we still have
                no control of that. We were not fit to do that. When people gave
                us something to do at local government level, we did it, and we
                did it well. I strongly believe that the improvement in local
                government is due, in no small measure, to the handing over of
                some local economic development powers to local authorities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I sincerely hope that it does not take
                four&nbsp;years to sort out revised local government
                arrangements. I accept that there has been a &quot;hands off,
                stay away&quot; approach in the past. I have experienced it
                myself, and I understand the reasons for it. I hope those days
                are over. I believe that local government must have a meaningful
                relationship with the new agency.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Local authorities should have an increased
                role in local economic development as we move forward. One
                inhibiting factor is the fact that some local authorities,
                because of their size and financial base, are at a significant
                disadvantage and are not, therefore, capable of implementing
                programmes which I would like to see implemented. The Member
                knows what I am getting at.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nevertheless, it is my intention that local
                government will continue to play a significant and growing role
                in the delivery of economic development services. That, I
                believe, is what people want.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to accountability, I said that I
                am in discussions with the Department of Finance and Personnel.
                As an Assembly, we have to take a view, and the legislation,
                when it is passed, will give Members the opportunity to satisfy
                themselves that the accountability mechanisms in place will be
                adequate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The appointments to the board will be carried
                out properly and people will not be penalised for their
                political views. The agency’s relationship with InterTrade
                Ireland will be a matter for the agency. InterTrade Ireland does
                not have an inward investment function and the organisations
                will not, therefore, clash in those areas. All the agencies and
                bodies involved in this matter, including local government, will
                find it easier to deal with a single organisation, rather than
                having to replicate their lobbying activities with three or four
                organisations.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Nelis:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.
                I add my voice to those who welcome the Minister’s statement.
                As the Minister stated, we need a rapid-response mechanism to
                cope with changing global situations, which we have not had from
                the IDB and LEDU. There are concerns about what has taken place
                at the Hawkes Bay factory, Ulster Ceramics, Carrington, Viyella,
                Milanda and United Technology and the raft of closures in the
                Foyle constituency because, in large part, these jobs are filled
                by women.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How will the new agency service those areas,
                which are seen by some as the far-flung reaches of the Six
                Counties, namely the west and the north-west? All of the stars,
                a LeasCheann Comhairle, cannot be located in the east;
                therefore, does the Minister envisage the new agency
                establishing local offices in those constituencies with the
                highest unemployment, working in tandem with councils and their
                social partners?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also welcome the Minister’s decision to
                integrate the tourism business into mainstream local economic
                development work, in co-operation with the North/South tourism
                company. Why does he feel it necessary to keep the NITB in
                place? Surely, this will be an unnecessary expense as well as
                causing some confusion?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will deal with the last point. The NITB
                will be required and will continue because it has the role of
                promoting tourism in Northern Ireland. Do not forget that the
                NITB and Bord Fáilte have established the tourism company. The
                new company is a marketing company in which the two tourist
                boards are shareholders. It will effectively be the delivery
                mechanism for regional marketing but the substance of that
                regional marketing will come from the tourist boards. Their
                chairmen and chief executives will be on the board of the new
                company.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is also the matter of the whole range
                of other promotional activities. There is the regulation of the
                industry, and a range of other matters including how aid is
                given to tourist businesses. In my statement I said that the
                business support mechanism for carrying out and administering
                grants or other forms of assistance to tourism and businesses is
                currently undertaken by about 30 persons in the NITB. They are
                doing the same job as, for instance, the IDB, which operates on
                a much larger scale. Just because a business focuses on tourism,
                it is not necessarily different from other businesses. It does
                not change the grant mechanism or the processing of the work.
                Therefore it was natural to bring those business support
                mechanisms together under one umbrella.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There will be an ongoing need for a tourist
                board. The Republic, Scotland and Wales are all promoted by
                strong tourism boards. That will remain the case. I detect no
                desire on the part of Bord Fáilte to close itself down.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have made it my business to be in the
                north-west as frequently as possible and I hope, if I am spared,
                to be there again very shortly. I am aware of the recent
                closures. I am also aware of the recent openings and
                announcements. Some of them have been very positive, and I hope
                that before the week is out we will have another positive report
                to make.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the key issues is the ability to
                provide a rapid response. The nature of the businesses that we
                are dealing with has changed. Quicker answers are required. The
                time between starting a project and getting it under way has
                been greatly reduced. Our system has clearly been creaking
                somewhat in its attempt to keep up. The time is right,
                particularly with the new types of industries and businesses
                that we have to deal with, to review how we deliver the service.
                That is part of the rationale for reorganisation.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Minister’s announcement on
                the restructure of the agencies. I am aware of the work of local
                councils, including my own, Derry City Council, in the field of
                economic development, and I welcome the Minister’s commitment
                to this. As a former member of the NITB, I also welcome his
                commitment to it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What response will the Minister or the
                existing agencies make to the disastrous announcement made
                yesterday by Hawkes Bay about redundancies in Derry and
                Newtownards? As the Minister is aware, 5,000 jobs have already
                been lost in the manufacturing sector in Northern Ireland since
                1997, often at the rate of 300 per month. I come from a socially
                deprived area which, in the past, depended on the shirt-making
                industry. This is a further blow to an already ailing textile
                industry, which is facing an uncertain future. We need urgent
                action to counteract these job losses.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I remind Members that questions must be based
                on the statement.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I always admire the resourcefulness of
                Members from the north-west in managing to squeeze something in.
                I also welcome the Member here. I am very aware that this is a
                digression, but we should perhaps get it out of the way because
                it is obviously on a number of people’s minds. I am aware of
                the issue to which the Member refers. However, that particular
                matter may not be finished, and people will have to be patient.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These redundancies come at a terribly bad
                time, but compared with other areas, our manufacturing sector
                has been holding up remarkably well — far better than that in
                Great Britain, for instance. There have been problems, but they
                are not as bad as they might have been. The gains are still
                exceeding the losses, and we have to remember that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that this new agency will be very
                focused. In response to Mr P Doherty’s statement, I have said
                that new targeting social need and equality issues will be at
                its core. That has implications for the regions. I can assure
                Members that that will be one of the methods by which its
                success will be judged.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Hussey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Minister’s statement. I was
                not in the Chamber to hear it, but I heard it on the radio on my
                way here. It is long overdue. The Minister is aware — and I
                think this is where his reasoning has come from — of the idea
                that LEDU deals with small businesses and the IDB deals with the
                large ones. A group of small-to-medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)
                has always been caught in the middle. Can the Minister assure us
                that the new body will have a broader banding than merely
                &quot;big&quot; and &quot;small&quot;?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the greater coherence in job
                creation, with the involvement of local economic development
                organisations, including local authorities. This will encourage
                the growth of indigenous SMEs, particularly at local level.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Has it taken on board the tremendous
                potential for growth in tourism? Can the Minister further assure
                us that the new organisation will not be bogged down in red
                tape, that the application forms for support from the new agency
                will be simpler, and that the agency will be of immediate help
                to those who are seeking to set up or to expand a business?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am glad to see that the Member is here, and
                in good form, after his late night yesterday. As the Member
                suggested, the size differential was one of the reasons for
                change. The problems of a business are very often the same,
                irrespective of its size. Major growth is taking place in small
                and medium-sized enterprises, while the big battleship
                companies, which employ thousands, are few and far between. It
                does not make any difference whether you employ 49 people or 51.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There have also been overlaps — some
                companies with more than 50 employees are under LEDU’s wing,
                while others with fewer than 50 employees are under the IDB’s
                wing. That has been a source of confusion. In addition, certain
                policies have been delivered in different ways by different
                organisations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am trying to get rid of banding and to
                treat the problems of small businesses and larger businesses in
                the same way, although issues of scale prevail.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to red tape, a review was carried
                out of the forms, and a number were reduced. I started a
                re-examination in my Department within the last two months. I am
                looking at every piece of paper that is issued by each division
                in every organisation. I want to ensure that every piece of
                paper is essential. If it is not, we will try to get rid of it.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Minister’s announcement. Will
                he consider giving local authorities a more active role? I want
                to emphasise to him the need for localised offices to represent
                the new agency so that local entrepreneurs can, at first hand,
                avail of the important services that will be available. I think,
                in particular, of the needs of my constituency and of Newry and
                Armagh, which would both be very important venues for such an
                agency.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I understand that Newry and Armagh are
                important venues for the Member, and I am very pleased to see
                that the south-east is at least trying to compete with the
                north-west. On a serious note, I said that there will be a
                regional dimension to this organisation’s work, and the
                precise nature of that is yet to be determined, but I am sure
                that the Member will have more to say to me about that on
                another occasion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is significant potential for a more
                active role for local authorities. I believe very strongly in
                local economic development, as the Member knows. However, as I
                said in response to Mr Poots, the attempt to accelerate the work
                of local authorities is, to some extent, constrained by the
                present scale of some of the local authorities. I would like to
                see some reorganisation, and I see no reason for that to take
                four years. I hope that it will happen much sooner. A
                restructured local government with a clearer view of what local
                authorities should be doing would deliver. Local authorities
                have proved that, if given responsibility, they can deliver.</p>

              now pass.</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For the benefit of Members I shall summarise
              why the Bill was introduced and its main provisions.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Under existing legislation, courts and resident
              magistrates have no discretion in dealing with a dog that has
              attacked a person or has worried livestock. They must order that
              the dog be destroyed. There are relatively few cases each year
              where destruction orders are made; there were 56 last year.
              However, I consider it appropriate that courts and resident
              magistrates should have some discretion in determining the fate of
              a dog. The major change proposed is that rather than order the
              destruction of a dog, a court may opt to make an order requiring
              certain measures, such as muzzling or confinement, to be taken to
              prevent the dog from being a danger to the public and livestock.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Peter Robinson was concerned that this did
              not go far enough, in that it did not cater for special
              circumstances in which a court might wish to absolve the dog
              instead of applying restrictive measures. Consequently, he moved
              an amendment at Further Consideration Stage which the Assembly
              accepted and which, in effect, gives a court the discretion not to
              apply restrictive measures if it is satisfied that exceptional
              mitigating factors exist. A court will, therefore, have the widest
              possible discretion.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second change relates to dangerous dogs. At
              present, when a person is convicted of an offence relating to a
              dangerous dog, the court must make an order for the destruction of
              the dog. The Bill will give the courts the discretion not to order
              the destruction of the dog if they are satisfied that it will not
              be a danger to the public.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The third change relates to the powers of
              resident magistrates in connection with the seizure of dogs. Under
              the Bill, a resident magistrate must still order the destruction
              of a dangerous dog, but the Bill, if passed, will allow a person
              to apply for a certificate of exemption from the requirement to
              have the dog destroyed. The conditions of this certificate must be
              complied with within two months of the date of the order. In
              relation to all other seized dogs, the Bill proposes that a
              resident magistrate should have discretion not to order the
              destruction of such a dog, if he is satisfied that it is not a
              danger to the public.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, the Bill also allows for a
              reconsideration of cases where it has been ordered that a dog be
              destroyed but where the destruction has not taken place.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am grateful to the Members who contributed to
              the debate on the Bill. I also wish to express my thanks to the
              Chairman and members of the Agriculture and Rural Development
              Committee who carried out detailed scrutiny of the Bill and who
              afforded my officials the opportunity to give evidence to it.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Robinson:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill has been improved by the Assembly’s
              acceptance of the amendment. May I say to the Minister that since
              my election to the House of Commons in 1979, I have probably
              proposed over 100 amendments at Westminster. Never once did I
              succeed in having an amendment accepted, so I welcome the fact
              that the duck has been broken by the Minister and the Assembly’s
              accepting the amendment at Further Consideration Stage.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">From a local government point of view, I will
              closely monitor several other elements to which the Minister
              responded in writing to see how they work out in practice. If
              further amendments are necessary, I will be happy to let the
              Minister know the reactions of the people who have to enforce the
              legislation that this House will pass.</p>

              that these new structures have not only allowed us to bring this
              Bill forward, but have also allowed Mr&nbsp;P&nbsp;Robinson to
              break new ground. I hope he recognises that his Northern Ireland
              Colleagues perhaps have a more open mind and are more flexible
              than his Westminster Colleagues. That is also a bonus.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As this is the season of goodwill, I hope we
              will not have too many problems with the motion.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Legislation requires an Assembly motion to
              change the Comptroller and Auditor General’s salary. Under the
              terms of his appointment he was due an increase from 1 April 2000.
              I have agreed with the Minister of Finance and Personnel that it
              is appropriate for me as Chairperson of the Audit Committee to
              move this motion in the light of my Committee’s important role
              in the examination of the expenses and work of the Comptroller and
              Auditor General. The Audit Committee has considered the background
              to the amount stipulated and recommends it to the Assembly.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will explain the reasoning behind this. If
              amendments proposed to the Government Resources and Accounting
              Bill are passed, it will further increase the Comptroller and
              Auditor General’s ability to follow public money wherever it
              goes in Northern Ireland on the Assembly’s behalf. This would
              increase his workload and responsibility, an issue which my
              Committee will be reporting on in its forthcoming report to the
              Assembly.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Comptroller and Auditor General is an
              officer of the Assembly and plays a vital role in providing it
              with independent assurance, information, advice and proper
              accounting for the assets and liabilities of Northern Ireland
              Departments, as well as other public expenditure. He is required
              by statute to examine and certify the accounts of all Northern
              Ireland Government Departments and a wide range of other public
              sector bodies, including Executive agencies. He also audits
              several central Government accounts by agreement with the
              Department of Finance and Personnel and the bodies concerned and,
              on behalf of the National Audit Office, the accounts of the NIO
              and the Northern Ireland Court Service. He also reports to the
              Assembly on value for money, and the economy, efficiency and
              effectiveness of the use of resources, which makes Departments
              accountable to the Assembly for the money they receive from the
              public purse.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Committee has seen at first hand the
              commitment and dedication of the Comptroller and Auditor General
              and the staff of the Northern Ireland Audit Office in carrying out
              these tasks. I therefore commend the motion to the House.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Before getting into the detail of the
              allowances determination, Members may find it helpful if I set out
              the background to the Determinations and to the one that the
              Assembly will consider shortly.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In February 1999, the Assembly Commission
              presented its first report to the Assembly, which established the
              basis for the Assembly estimates of £36 million. After a debate,
              the Assembly passed the following resolution:</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;That this Assembly will accept the
              recommendations of the Senior Salaries Review Body in respect of
              the salaries and allowances for Ministers and Members.&quot;</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">— <i>[Official Report, Vol 12, No 3, p125].</p>
              </i></font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly Commission has remained faithful
              to that principle during the passage of three Bills dealing with
              Members’ pensions, financial assistance to political parties,
              severance allowances to Members, and the 1999 Determinations of
              salaries and allowances.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Commission has continued to follow the
              recommendation of the Senior Salaries Review Body (SSRB) that the
              allowances Determination should be uprated by the increase in the
              retail price index for the period 1999-2000, calculated at 2·6%.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will now deal with each allowance as I go
              through each paragraph of the schedule to the Determination.
              Paragraph 1 deals with travel allowances. The rate for mileage
              under 20,000 miles has been increased from 51·2 pence to 52·5
              pence per mile, with the 20,000-plus miles rate increasing from
              23·6 pence to 24·2 pence per mile. The rate for mileage in a
              hired car also increases from 51·2 pence to 52·5 pence per mile.
              For those hardy souls who travel by bike, the rate per mile
              increases from 6·5 pence to 6·7 pence per mile. I am sure that
              will be welcomed by them all.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Paragraph 2 covers subsistence rates. The rate
              for hotels inside London is increased to a maximum of £150 per
              night, with a maximum of £100 per night elsewhere in the United
              Kingdom. Those changes reflect the difficulty of finding suitable
              accommodation at the present rates of £100 and £80 respectively.
              Outside the UK, the provision in this Determination has been set
              at a maximum of £200 per day on a full-board basis. That
              provision removes the need for reference to outdated Foreign and
              Commonwealth Office (FCO) rates, which caused Members travelling
              abroad some confusion. However, the Finance Office will use
              up-to-date FCO rates as a guide to expected outlay. There is also
              an allowance of £5 for out-of-pocket expenses.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Paragraph 3 of the Determination adds 2·6% to
              the office costs allowance, an increase from £34,850 to £35,756
              per year. Many Members will welcome that increase, modest though
              it may be.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The disability allowance remains unchanged.
              However, for the purpose of clarity, the word
              &quot;disability&quot; has been defined in paragraph&nbsp;4 and
              &quot;session&quot; has been redefined as a year.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recall expenses remain the same, and
              paragraph&nbsp;5 refers to this. In paragraph&nbsp;6, travel
              allowance for employees remains as before, although the
              opportunity has been taken to define &quot;Inland Revenue
              rates.&quot; Paragraph&nbsp;7 does not change previous
              arrangements for staff pensions and redundancies, although the
              wording has been changed slightly to increase clarity of
              expression.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The rules on temporary secretarial allowance in
              paragraph&nbsp;8 have been radically altered. Previously, that
              allowance was payable only after office cost allowance had been
              exhausted. The new provisions separate those two allowances. A
              temporary secretarial allowance can now be paid irrespective of
              the position in regard to office cost allowance. That is in line
              with new arrangements at Westminster.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Paragraph&nbsp;9 is new. It allows for the
              annual uprating of certain allowances in the Determination
              according to the change in the retail prices index over the
              previous year, as recommended by the Senior Salaries Review Body (SSRB).
              This provision obviates the need for an allowance Determination to
              be brought before the Assembly annually. More importantly, it will
              allow Members to arrange for the uprating of the wages of their
              support staff at the beginning of the financial year.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Paragraph&nbsp;10 is also new, although it
              contains little that is different. It merely defines some of the
              terms used in the Determination, many of which appeared as
              sub-paragraphs in the 1999 Determination. It is proposed that with
              the agreement of the Assembly — and I stress that — the
              provisions of this Determination will take effect from
              29&nbsp;May&nbsp;2000, which was the date of the reinstatement of
              the Assembly following suspension. Obviously, we cannot legislate
              for the period of suspension.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Commission is aware that there is some
              discomfort with the principle of backdating rises in allowances
              and salaries. However, I remind Members that the Commission is
              only proposing to put in place the same arrangements as exist in
              Westminster, Scotland and Wales: a 2·6% uprating of allowances
              with effect from 1&nbsp;April&nbsp;2000. Many Members have already
              introduced wage increases for their staff. These Members will
              experience financial difficulties if the rise in allowances is not
              backdated to the beginning of the financial year. I commend the
              allowances Determination to the Assembly.</p>

              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Colleague, Mr&nbsp;Fee, when he presented
              last year’s salary Determination, referred to his role as a
              &quot;poisoned chalice&quot;. I hope that I will not have to lift
              such a chalice on this occasion, and I assure the House that I
              will be abstaining from any strong or spirited beverages.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not intend to make a lengthy preamble, but
              I will respond to some of the recent press coverage on this issue
              which, at best, has been grossly inaccurate. The proposed rise of
              2·9% in salaries is below and not, as reported, above the rate of
              inflation, which is 3·2%. Today, the Assembly is not voting for a
              Members’ pay rise above the increases to be awarded to their
              support staff. It is for individual Members as employers to agree
              pay rises for their own staff. I am confident that all Members
              will act fairly on this issue.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Furthermore, the Assembly is not passing the
              task of determining Members’ salaries over to an independent
              body. Under section&nbsp;47(7) of the Northern Ireland Act 1998,
              the Assembly may not delegate the function of making a
              Determination on salaries and allowances.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Commission is proposing in paragraph 3 of
              the salaries Determination that salaries be uprated annually by a
              percentage rise recommended by the Senior Salaries Review Body (SSRB)
              for the senior Civil Service pay bands. It will always be in the
              Assembly’s gift to vote on different arrangements for the
              Determination of Members’ salaries and allowances. However, as
              with the allowances Determination, the salaries Determination is
              designed to keep in line with SSRB recommendations and to achieve
              parity with arrangements in Westminster, Scotland and Wales.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The SSRB recommended that Assembly salaries
              should be uprated each year, in line with the average movement in
              the nine senior Civil Service pay bands below that of permanent
              secretary. For 2000-01, the increase is 2·9%, which compares
              favourably with the current inflation rate of 3·2% and an average
              rise in public-sector pay levels of 3·4%.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I have already said, the Determination
              provides at paragraph 3 for an annual uprating of salaries, so
              that there is no requirement to present salaries Determinations on
              an annual basis. Certain minor flaws in the 1999 Determination,
              with regard to dual- and triple-mandate Members, have been
              corrected in this new Determination. The Commission has
              recommended that the new salary should take effect from 29 May
              2000, the date of the reinstatement of the Assembly following
              suspension.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I note from the amendments put down by several
              Members that retrospection is a matter of concern. In bringing
              forward this Determination, the Commission is trying to ensure
              parity with other United Kingdom legislatures, where pay rises of
              2·9% took effect from 1 April 2000.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I commend the salaries Determination to the
              Assembly.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Three amendments have been submitted, and I
              have selected all of them. They all address the date of
              implementation, but have different dates from that in the motion.
              I intend to deal with them in chronological order.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Each Member who has tabled an amendment will be
              asked if he wishes to move it. When all such Members have spoken,
              a debate may ensue if other Members wish to speak. Then, as usual,
              in reverse order, each Member who has moved an amendment will be
              given an opportunity to wind up. The mover of the motion will then
              wind up, and we will vote on the amendments in chronological
              order.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If an amendment is taken — if, therefore, it
              is made by the Assembly — the subsequent amendments will fall,
              because those amendments, if passed, would not make sense. They
              would simply be wrecking amendments. They would simply add dates.
              If the first amendment is made, the other two amendments fall; if
              the first one falls and the second amendment is made, then the
              third one falls; if the first two amendments fall, the third
              amendment may be made, and so on.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If Members are clear, as I trust they are, on a
              matter of such interest to them, I will take the amendments now in
              chronological order.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;subject to the date in paragraph 1(4)

              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I concur with many of the remarks made by Mr
              Coulter on behalf of the Commission. I am pleased that even the
              British Broadcasting Corporation now seems to have recognised that
              the Commission is recommending only that which was recommended by
              the SSRB, and that it is a rate of increase below that of
              inflation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a wider recognition by the media that
              Members are starting to do the job for which they were elected.
              However, it would be naive and a tad optimistic to suggest that
              the people of Northern Ireland think that Members are fulfilling
              the responsibilities that they were elected to do. That is why Mr
              Close and myself tabled the amendment. I make no apology for
              supporting much of the Determination.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.15 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In future, Members will no longer be directly
              involved in this haggling over money, and salaries will be linked,
              like those of the other authorities in the United Kingdom, to the
              public-sector pay scale. This is an appropriate way of saying that
              Members are seeking to distance themselves from the matter as much
              as possible. However, Members have to face up to the decision that
              must be taken today.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The people of Northern Ireland do not believe
              that Members have yet done the work that they are here to do,
              although they might accept that Members are starting to do it,
              having heard the long and detailed Budget debate. There is still
              much to be done on such issues as the Programme for Government and
              the playing of a full role in new legislation. This morning
              Members once again failed to advance one Bill, so we are still not
              fulfilling all that we should be.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is why the Alliance Party believes that it
              is inappropriate for the pay increase to be backdated to 29 May.
              It should become effective from today because we are taking the
              decision today, and we are seen to be taking our responsibilities
              from this time.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would have no difficulty with the concept of
              applying the 1 January date, but I would have some difficulty in
              suggesting that we take the pay rise on 31 March, given that
              Members are due next year’s rise on 1 April. Two annual rises in
              two days would be a bit much for anybody to stomach.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The amendment says that we should take our pay
              rise from today on the basis of independent settling and not on
              our own decisions. I ask Members to support it.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. It
              appears that Mr Ford’s stomach has become more delicate since
              the Alliance Party accepted and supported the backdating part of
              this proposal at the Commission. He has suddenly developed a
              distaste for backpayments.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was not possible to amend the date to any
              later than 31 March because the report applied to this financial
              year. Therefore that was the furthest date that could be provided.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since the Assembly Commission voted on this
              issue and since Friday, when the media began to shine the
              spotlight on it, the ghosts of Christmas appear to have visited
              some of the parties and that is evident from some of the
              amendments. The SDLP, UUP and Alliance Party voted for what is
              contained in the motion, but since the spotlight has been shone on
              it —</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ford:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Member accept that Commission members
              do not have a party role? The decision that they make has no
              reference to their Colleagues.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr C Murphy:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That argument occurred before when it was
              alleged that a Sinn Féin Member had voted in the shadow
              Commission, thereby linking Sinn Féin to that vote. Members
              cannot have it both ways. Either a party representative is
              representing his party on the Commission, or he is not. I am sure
              that representatives of the Alliance Party consult, as most party
              representatives do, with their party on matters of such
              importance.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Therefore I assume that the Alliance Party
              backed this matter in the Commission, and I did not hear from any
              members of the Alliance Party on Friday. Perhaps they were not
              listening to the media when this was debated. I did not hear any
              reticence about the proposals until this morning.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a similar case concerning the UUP. In
              the media on Friday a UUP Member tried to defend the backdating of
              the pre-Christmas lump sum that they were preparing to receive.
              Once again, we see the UUP moving to distance itself from the
              Christmas bonus.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Fee:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is grossly unfair to suggest that the
              members of the Commission act as party representatives,
              particularly when Mrs E&nbsp;Bell represents all the smaller
              parties and, as far as is possible, consults all of them. The
              Commission makes its decisions under the Northern Ireland Act 1998
              and under the direction of the Assembly. The Assembly has voted
              twice in the past to act in line with the SSRB. Today, Members can
              decide on these amendments, but the Commission was simply
              fulfilling its responsibility to the House.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr C Murphy:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the sitting of the Shadow Commission we
              informed the Member that we did not support the recommendations of
              the SSRB. He said that Sinn&nbsp;Féin supported it in the
              Commission, but people cannot have it both ways. Either a party
              Member is identified with his party on the Commission, or not. I
              accept that the commissioners act on behalf of the whole Assembly,
              but if Members vote in the Commission to give themselves
              pre-Christmas lump sums, the parties cannot then attempt to
              distance themselves from it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members queued up yesterday to take pot-shots
              at Sinn&nbsp;Féin over our proposed amendment to the Budget
              motion, and claimed that we had supported it in other forums.
              People cannot have it both ways. In effect, the lump sum proposed
              by the Commission would give Members a pre-Christmas bonus of
              between £500 and £1500. Even Jeffrey, in his &quot;letter to
              Santa&quot;, which was subsequently plagiarised by the
              First&nbsp;Minister, would not have been so audacious in his
              request.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sinn Féin has no difficulty with linking the
              salaries to annual increases that reflect inflation because that
              is a common trade union argument. We have argued that this should
              be the case for pensions, allowances and benefits. We do, however,
              have a difficulty with people proposing to give themselves a lump
              sum backdated to 29&nbsp;May.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Assembly Members are quite well paid, and we
              all accept that every elected representative has a difficult job
              and is entitled to an appropriate level of pay. Members should
              send out a strong signal by saying that they will forego the
              backdating of this pay and not accept any pre-Christmas pay rise.
              In effect, that is what Mr&nbsp;Ford’s amendment does. He
              scurried away from the backdating of the pay, but he is voting for
              a pre-Christmas pay rise. If we forego that by voting in favour of
              the 31&nbsp;March&nbsp;2001 option, we will send out a signal that
              the gravy train is not operating in the Assembly, contrary to the
              signal that has consistently been sent out since the Assembly
              began. The last time we debated the SSRB proposals, I said that if
              a substantial pay cut had been proposed, Members might not have
              been so willing to accept it. The same applies in this instance.
              We should reject the clause in the Assembly Commission’s
              recommendation that we backdate this to 29&nbsp;May. We should
              also reject the pre-Christmas pay rise proposed by Mr&nbsp;Ford,
              and we should accept the amendment and bring this report into
              effect from 31&nbsp;March.</p>

              agree that it should be backdated; that is inappropriate. We agree
              that we should wait until the annual upgrading of salaries, as
              foreseen in this Determination; that is important.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members will have heard mentioned the salaries
              of those who are &quot;double jobbing&quot; — that is the term
              we use to describe Members who sit in the Assembly and at
              Westminster. Paragraphs 2(1), 2(2) and 2(3) provide for the
              salaries of Assembly Members who are also Members of Parliament at
              Westminster and Strasbourg to be reduced to take account of this
              &quot;double jobbing.&quot;</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker, are you aware that the
              Disqualifications Act 2000 which has been passed in the House of
              Commons allows for Assembly Members to become TDs? Why is there no
              reference to the need for salaries to also be reduced in such
              cases, in the same way as for Members of Parliament or Members of
              the European Parliament? Can either the Assembly or the Commission
              do anything about that?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I should respond to that myself, since it is a
              matter of the authority and competence of the Assembly. The Member
              is right that in section 47(4) of the Northern Ireland Act 1998
              provision is made for a reduction in salary if the Assembly Member
              is also a Member of either House of the Westminster Parliament or
              of the European Parliament and is receiving a salary for that. If
              he or she is a Member of the Oireachtas, there is no such
              provision for the Assembly salary to be reduced. If such a
              reduction were sought, section 47(4) of the 1998 Act would have to
              be amended to refer to membership of the Oireachtas, consequently
              the salaries Determination would have to include such a reference.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is regrettable that since this anomaly arose
              from the Disqualification Act 2000 no opportunity was taken during
              the passing of that Bill to address the matter, the more so since
              the Assembly itself cannot legislate on the matter. It is a good
              example of why this Assembly should be consulted on any
              legislation that affects it, but it is not a matter that the
              Assembly itself can address. I hope that that clarifies the matter
              for both the Member and the House.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCartney:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not agree with the awarding or the
              acceptance of any pay increase. The amendment that comes nearest
              to my own view is that advanced by Sinn Féin. After the Act of
              Union in 1800, Lord Castlereagh said that he had purchased the fee
              simple of Irish political corruption. I wonder whether it has to
              be repurchased in every generation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This Assembly has 108 Members to represent
              roughly 1·65 million people. The Scottish Parliament, which
              represents 5 million people, has 129. On a pro-rata basis with
              Northern Ireland, it would have over 300 Members. The Welsh
              Assembly has 60 Members and represents a population of just under
              3 million. There can be no doubt, and very few people would argue,
              that some of the 108 Members — and that number was chosen
              specifically to include as many people from as many different
              parties as possible, some of them of questionable genealogy as far
              as democracy is concerned.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have heard it said — I have not checked the
              figures — that at the date of the Assembly election, some 30 of
              the 108 Members who grace this Chamber were unemployed. How many
              Members of this Assembly can honestly put their hand on their
              heart and say that they were in receipt of a bigger salary than
              the £29,000 that was originally granted before this Assembly
              voted itself an increase of over 30% and brought it up to the
              current £39,000? Here this Assembly is arranging to increase its
              salary again.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The argument to which everybody has clung to
              justify this is that the Assembly is not actually fixing the
              amount.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.30 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, the Assembly is agreeing and fixing
              the criteria by which that amount is measured. It is done on the
              basis of taking the average of the salaries of the nine fairly
              high-ranking civil servants beneath the rank of permanent
              secretary, and determining the percentage increase. In this case
              it is 2·9%. Having set the criteria for working out what one is
              going to get at a fairly high level, one then adopts the
              &quot;holier than thou&quot; attitude of saying, &quot;Well, it is
              not us that is awarding it; it is being awarded by the SSRB.&quot;
              However, the SSRB decision is based upon criteria that have been
              approved by the Assembly.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The public are looking at this Assembly, and
              appreciating that the running of the Assembly and the 11
              Departments — there were formerly six — is costing over £670
              million this year and is budgeted for £750 million next year.
              That sum, which now includes 11 Departments, is coming out of the
              block grant — the block grant that provides money for the
              Departments of the Minister of Health, the Minister of Education
              and the Minister of the Environment. Everybody knows that, for
              example, the Health Department is grossly underfunded. Everybody
              knows that many of the buildings providing educational facilities
              for our children in Northern Ireland are grossly defective and
              need a great deal of capital investment.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not suggesting that the 2·9%, backdated,
              discounted or otherwise, will make a vast contribution to those
              Departments. However, it shows that the Assembly is conscious of
              the lack of money affecting many people in Northern Ireland. Some
              people are not having heart bypass operations, people who are
              having children in maternity facilities that really have very
              little to rejoice about, and children, particularly in rural
              areas, who are in school buildings that are really Victorian in
              their design and facilities. They will now say that Members of the
              Assembly, who have scarcely broken ground in delivering anything
              in Northern Ireland, are, for the second time in a year, voting
              themselves a substantial and significant salary increase.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I, for my part, have no great affection for
              this — <i>[Interruption].</i> I am told that I do not need it.
              That might be right, but is the fact that one needs it a
              justification for taking it? That is the point.</p>

              people of Northern Ireland. It does not matter that Members howl,
              sneer or ask questions about which Committees I am on. Sticks and
              stones may break bones but words will certainly not hurt me.
              However, the words that Members use and the attitude that Members
              display on the television cameras will go out to the people of
              Northern Ireland, and they will be watching Members howling to

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I remember all about Holywood. To get back to
              the fundamental issue, I think that what this Assembly should do
              is say that we are entitled to this money according to the
              decisions and deliberations of the SSRB, but that entitlement does
              not justify acceptance. Members should say &quot;Certainly not. We
              are not going to take this.&quot; Indeed, I question whether there
              should not be a moratorium on salaries for at least the next two
              years.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Would anybody be seriously hurt if he did not
              get his 2·9% this year and again next year? Would it not show a
              good example to the people who see enormous sums being spent on
              this place? Someone asked me the other day &quot;If they vote this
              increase through, Mr&nbsp;McCartney, will you be taking it?&quot;
              That is a very pertinent question. The answer is yes; I will be
              taking it. However, I will not be keeping it. If this is voted
              through — and I am entitled to any increase along with everyone
              else — it will be divided equally between the Belfast City
              Mission, St&nbsp;Vincent de&nbsp;Paul and the Salvation Army. I
              think that at Christmas instead of Members voting themselves a big
              backdated bonus, as recommended by the Commission, they should be
              thinking about those who do not enjoy all the facilities and
              benefits that they do.</p>

              speaking as someone who, whatever committee he serves on, may from

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to make four or five points.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCartney says that people will draw
              conclusions about the Assembly based upon the salaries
              Determination which may go through today. If they do, those
              conclusions will be based upon a shallow premise. However, I think
              that people will look at yesterday’s debate and say that it was
              characterised by a voice from the Government, such as Mr&nbsp;Durkan’s,
              and a voice close to the Government, such as Mr P&nbsp;Robinson’s.
              The quality of their contributions, and their statements on the
              future society that they want to construct, will have a greater
              affect on people’s conclusions about the Assembly than the
              vagaries of the salaries Determination on which we are about to
              vote.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCartney also told us that Irish political
              corruption is being repurchased this afternoon. Well, I draw two
              conclusions from that. Either we are cheap at the price —
              because the Determination proposed by the Alliance Party will
              amount to £380 between now and the end of this financial year —
              or the contention is evidently ludicrous. Mr McCartney makes some
              incredibly powerful contributions inside and outside this Chamber,
              and this contention is at odds with the quality of many of his
              previous contributions.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCartney also said that 30&nbsp;Members of
              the Assembly were unemployed before they came here. You move on to
              very dangerous territory when you bring that sort of argument on
              to the Floor of the Assembly. This is for two reasons: first you
              leave yourself vulnerable, and I know you did not mean this —</p>

              might believe that it echoes a past when people did not qualify
              because of their religion, gender, sexuality or class. Those
              politics do not have any place here. But more importantly, people
              who are unemployed have the same right to stand for political
              office as people who are employed.</p>

              unemployed people who take up political office are in that office
              because of the money is demeaning to them and diminishes the

              to the increases, and the point from which the increases were
              being given. If you were unemployed and are now on a salary of
              £39,000, whether you were fit to stand or not, is irrelevant.
              What is relevant is whether you need an increase on that at this

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As politicians, we have a duty, and that duty
              should be based on principle. Principles inform the judgement that
              has been made by the Commission and, presumably, the amendment
              proposed by the Alliance Party. It is a valid principle to pay
              people what they are entitled to. There have been far too few
              examples of this having been done in the years of Tory misrule in
              this part of the island of Ireland and in Britain.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is also the principle that when one makes
              an independent adjudication of what a politician, doctor or a
              nurse may be entitled to, it must be honoured. A time will come in
              this Chamber when we will have to make a judgement. Will we back a
              salary review recommendation for someone else in the public
              service? We will be tested and judged at that moment. However, by
              applying the principle to ourselves to uphold the independent
              assessment of what we are worth means that we will, in the future,
              apply a principle about what others are worth. That is why the

              today, it appears that the light has been switched on in the shop,
              and people have been caught with their hands in the till.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I observed some of the parties before today’s
              debate started. There were some hurried consultations between the
              Ulster Unionist party, members of the Commission, who were
              obviously not representing their own party, but happened to belong
              to the SDLP, and the Alliance party about the amendments and what
              parties would and would not accept. The Ulster Unionists obviously
              decided that they could live with an extra 10 or 12 days of a pay
              rise, instead of going for 1 January and withdraw their amendment.
              Nobody was fit to enquire what Sinn Féin thought. We also had an
              amendment tabled, but no one asked what we thought or what they
              were interested in when coming to an arrangement with the others.
              There was, it appeared, a hurried coalition of interest between
              some of the parties that had previously supported the backdated
              pay rise, and which are now supporting the pre-Christmas pay rise.
              They have scurried away from the proposal for a pre-Christmas
              bonus.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The DUP has very little to say on this matter.
              They said yesterday that their hands were clean in all of this,
              and obviously they have decided to keep their hands clean again
              today. They will adopt that position. I have noticed that when
              there is a debate on salaries in this Chamber, their Front Bench
              is always empty. The DUP always appears to be able to distance
              itself by sitting further towards the back of the Chamber in the
              hope that somehow they will not be involved in the debate. They
              will, however, take the pay rise or whatever bonus comes along,
              but they will not get involved in the debate, so it will not be
              their fault.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are faced with a choice. The Commission has
              proposed a pre-Christmas bonus for Members. Mr Ford’s amendment
              withdraws that but gives us a pre-Christmas pay rise. I think that
              we should support my amendment. It sends out a signal that we
              recognise that there is a great deal of hardship in this society,
              and that many face a very bleak Christmas. We have a
              responsibility to send such a signal to show that we will play our
              part by not giving ourselves a pre-Christmas bonus or a
              pre-Christmas pay rise. We must demonstrate that we have a
              responsibility to those people, and that we will accept that
              responsibility.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is necessary to respond to some of the other
              Members’ comments. The word &quot;principle&quot; has been
              bandied around, and I use that term deliberately. The labourer
              being worth his dues has been well recognised, and it is fitting
              for the Northern Ireland Assembly and its Members to accept an
              increase. We had difficulty in backdating it for obvious reasons.
              The Assembly was not fully functioning at that time. However, it
              is right that the appropriate increase, which was due some months
              ago, should be paid as and from now. I make no apology for that.
              We are following the standards of the SSRB. I find it interesting
              that Sinn Féin is making a big issue about a pre-Christmas
              increase. It has also attempted to mislead the public by
              deliberately using the bonus figures — £500 or £1,500, or
              whatever — while fully conscious of the fact that there is no
              bonus at all if the pay increase takes effect from today. That was
              an attempt to mislead. I also find it ironic that in rejecting a
              pre-Christmas —</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Member accept that the pay rise
              referred to by Mr C Murphy represents a scale comprising Members
              who do not hold office right through to Ministers? That ranges
              from £500 to £1,500, even before the various allowances are
              counted. The figures cannot be ignored. They are presented by the
              Assembly Commission, of which the Alliance Party is a member, and
              which it supported.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Close:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I apologise if I misunderstood Mr C Murphy’s
              comments. I understood that he was referring to &quot;bonus&quot;,
              and that he deliberately used the word &quot;bonus&quot;. A bonus
              is over and above a pay increase. A bonus entails some degree of
              backdating, and that is what I understood him to say. If that is
              the case, I stand by my original comments.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I find it interesting that Sinn Féin rejects a
              pre-Christmas increase but is anxious to have a pre-Easter
              &quot;rising&quot; increase. Could that be coincidence? I wonder.
              I also find it interesting that there may be some pangs of guilt
              emanating from Sinn Féin, following what it did yesterday —
              crying about the poor people and needs, et cetera, yet happily
              going into the Lobbies and supporting an 8% increase in the
              regional rate.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member will know, if he was listening
              earlier, that I asserted — and the Speaker nodded in assent —
              that this could not have been done beyond the end of this
              financial year. Therefore the date was not to ensure a pre-Easter
              &quot;rising&quot; pay increase. I am not sure on what date Easter
              falls next year, but this was the latest date that we could give
              for these proposals. I made that point at the start, and it was
              acknowledged by the Speaker.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In relation to yesterday, if the Member was so
              exercised about the rise in the regional rate, why did he not
              bother to get in early enough to table an amendment to the motion.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We will not rehearse those arguments again. The
              reason my party did not table an amendment, and subsequently voted
              against the 8% increase, has been well examined. It cannot be
              denied that the Member is proposing a pre-Easter increase.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCartney began his comments by complaining
              about there being 108 Members. Whether he likes it or not, those
              Members are here to fill what was referred to as a democratic
              deficit; to try to bring proper accountable government to the
              people; and to represent the people of Northern Ireland through
              the appropriate Departments. Any member of the public would accept
              that and would recognise the import of the 10 Departments and
              their respective statutory scrutiny Committees which, I believe,
              are doing a reasonable job.</p>
