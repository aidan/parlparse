                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker:</p>
                </font></b><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have received notice from the Minister of
                the Environment that he wishes to make a statement on the
                North/South Ministerial Council sectoral meeting on the
                environment, which was held on Friday 15 June 2001 in Dromad,
                County Louth.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of the Environment (Mr Foster):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Following nomination by the former First and
                Deputy First Ministers, Mr Durkan and I attended the fourth
                North/South Ministerial Council sectoral meeting on the
                environment. The Irish Government were represented by Mr Dan
                Wallace TD, Minister of State at the Department of the
                Environment and Local Government. Mr Wallace chaired the
                meeting. The statement has been approved by Mr Durkan and is
                also made on his behalf.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The meeting began with a review of the
                progress of the joint working group on water quality, which was
                established to consider water quality strategies for the Erne
                and Foyle catchments and the implementation of the EU Water
                Framework Directive.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A primary objective of the Directive is to
                harmonise approaches to water management across EU member
                states. The water quality working group has been examining a
                number of technical issues related to that objective. A
                technical advisory group has been established to provide advice
                and support to the working group.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The technical advisory group’s priority
                tasks will include the development of an agreed characterisation
                system, or typology, for surface waters, and the development of
                a map of North/South shared river basins to assist the process
                of identifying appropriate international river basin districts.
                To assist the group with the latter task, the Council endorsed a
                number of principles on the development of proposals for the
                delineation of international river basin districts in Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council received a report on the
                tendering for a jointly funded contract to develop an
                interactive web site of current environmental research. The
                tendering process followed Government procurement procedures and
                was overseen by the Northern Ireland Government Purchasing
                Agency. The Council noted the outcome of the tendering process
                and agreed that the Environment and Heritage Service and the
                Environmental Protection Agency should award the contract to a
                Belfast-based company, Infinet Design. The Council looked
                forward to viewing a prototype of the web site at a subsequent
                meeting.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council was updated on the substantial
                existing co-operation between North and South on a range of new
                technology for monitoring issues. Areas brought to the Council’s
                attention included remote sensing, fish stock assessment and
                on-site monitoring. Dr Eon O’Mongain of Spectral Signatures
                Ltd made a short presentation to the Council on airborne remote
                sensing for water quality monitoring. This sophisticated
                technology has been used in recent years for lake monitoring in
                the North and in the South. The Council recognised the long-term
                nature of the work and agreed that further progress reports
                should be provided as significant developments occur.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council noted the proposals on land cover
                mapping and key databases. On the first of these areas, the
                Council received a short presentation from Mr Robin Fuller, of
                the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, relating to the technology
                used in developing these complex maps and the associated
                benefits of capturing the information. The Council approved the
                planning work on a sample cross- border area for comparison of
                the respective land cover maps.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In relation to key databases, a small working
                group has been set up to test the compatibility of the
                environmental databases, North and South. This will be done
                using water quality data. The working group will carry out some
                benchmarking of other environmental organisations to explore how
                the data, once captured, can best be presented for the ease of
                users, particularly the public.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council noted that progress on taking
                forward the scoping study on the environmental impacts of
                agriculture had been slower than anticipated. This was due to
                the foot-and-mouth disease crisis, which had necessarily been
                the focus of attention and effort of the agricultural
                authorities North and South. The Council did, however, approve
                the preliminary methodology for taking forward the scoping study
                when conditions permit. Under this methodology the study will be
                conducted as a six-month desk analysis to be carried out by two
                postgraduate students, one from each jurisdiction, under the
                overall direction of a steering group on which the relevant
                Environment and Agriculture Departments and agencies will be
                represented. The steering group will be co-chaired by the two
                Environment Departments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council then turned its attention to
                waste management. It agreed that there is scope for a
                co-operative approach to the development of markets for
                secondary materials and recyclates on the island and that
                officials should work together to bring forward formal proposals
                for a structured approach to the establishment of a joint market
                development programme. It was also agreed that, should an
                appropriate opportunity present itself, the Environment
                Ministers would jointly examine and evaluate a successful
                recycling and market development programme abroad. The Council
                agreed that officials should give consideration to a
                cross-border proposal to encourage community-based recycling.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council noted the success of the recovery
                scheme for farm plastics operated by the Irish Farm Films
                Producers’ Group in the Republic of Ireland. The Council
                agreed that the Department of the Environment, in discussion
                with the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, would
                consider the desirability of a complementary initiative in
                Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, the Council considered and agreed
                the text of a joint communiqué to be issued after the meeting.
                A copy has been placed in the Assembly Library. The Council
                agreed that the next sectoral meeting on the environment will
                take place in Northern Ireland in October2001.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Environment Committee
                (Rev Dr William McCrea):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister stated that the meeting related
                to the progress of joint North/South programmes on waste
                management. I find that interesting. At the last meeting of the
                Environment Committee, Thursday 20 September, the three regional
                groups in Northern Ireland — the one in the north-west is of a
                cross-border nature — said that there was poor co-operation
                between them and the Minister’s Department. We were told that
                £1 million of the £3·5 million allocated and made available
                this year was to be handed back.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the Minister tell us why progress on
                that important issue has been so slow in Northern Ireland? Why
                has none of the money been spent to date, when it seems that
                even more of that £3·5 million could be surrendered before the
                year is out? How much did the North/South Ministerial Council
                sectoral meeting cost the Northern Ireland exchequer?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Foster:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not agree entirely with the Member’s
                statements, because progress has been made, even though it has
                been slow. Reasonable progress has been made in implementing the
                waste strategy since its publication in March 2000. For example,
                district councils submitted their provisional waste management
                plans to my Department in June 2001. Those plans have been
                reviewed, and they will be developed further by district
                councils prior to full public consultation early next year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Moreover, the Waste Management Advisory Board
                has been established to assist with the strategy’s
                implementation; policy guidance on planning and waste management
                has been issued for public consultation; further guidance on the
                best practicable environmental option has been published; three
                detailed waste status studies have been completed to assist the
                development of waste management plans; proposals for new
                regulations for duty of care will be published for consultation
                in the next few weeks; and a consultation paper on new waste
                management licensing regulations should be published by 31 March
                2002.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The £3·5 million budget for this financial
                year was dependent on the completion and adoption of the waste
                management plans and was intended for their implementation. The
                recent transfer of £1 million to other important areas of
                public expenditure, to which the Member referred, does not mean
                that there is a lesser requirement for extensive financial
                support for waste management. That simply reflects the need for
                expenditure to be properly planned and focused. Prior to the
                completion of the plans, the Department listened to the views of
                district councils and the Waste Management Advisory Board on
                immediate expenditure needs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In this financial year the Department will
                invest £400,000 in the UK-wide waste resource action programme;
                it will complete £400,000 of data studies; and it will invest
                £500,000 in the initial public awareness and education
                programme, which will occur in tandem with the public
                consultation of district council plans.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At present, a sum of £130,000 is reserved to
                provide further financial assistance to district councils to
                complete their waste management plans and to support pilot
                schemes such as additional recycling and composting mills for
                households.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Minister’s statement and the
                joint approach to a market development programme. In view of the
                urgency with which it must be done, will the Minister make it a
                priority to examine best practice in successful recycling and
                market development programmes in tandem with the consultation,
                education and culture change that is required to implement our
                waste management strategy?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I assure the Member that my Department will
                do all in its power to encourage people and to ensure that the
                educational message is put across. Much depends on the district
                councils working through the management plans and issues
                themselves. However, I assure the Member that the Department
                will be there to help.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Carson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Minister’s report of the
                sectoral meeting. In the past there has been a lack of
                co-operation in attempts to deal with the Erne system’s
                problems. I do not like to hark back to that issue, but what
                progress has the working group made on water quality in the Erne
                catchment in particular? The zebra mussels make life difficult
                for the tourist industry in the bay area at Kesh, where
                waterskiers and boats are already having problems. Furthermore,
                I have come across a peculiar word in environmental circles —
                CORINE. Perhaps that is the name of a strange woman. Will the
                Minister explain the meaning of the word?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Foster:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">CORINE is not a strange woman. The acronym
                stands for the &quot;co-ordination of information on the
                environment&quot; and is a European land cover mapping project.
                A land cover map records in detail the extent and type of land,
                including forest, wetland, farm land and coastal areas;
                information that is valuable to environmental planners,
                regulators, agriculturalists and conservationists. Northern
                Ireland is included in the more detailed UK land cover 2000 map,
                which will integrate the collection of data on land cover across
                the UK.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Zebra mussels are a major problem in Northern
                Ireland, many parts of Europe and also North America. They first
                appeared in the Erne system in 1996. It is impossible to remove
                zebra mussels once they have become established, although they
                tend to reach a natural limit in waterways. That is why the
                emphasis must be on prevention rather than cure.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the spring, my Department launched a
                publicity campaign to educate the public, particularly boat
                owners, anglers and those engaged in water sports, about the
                mussel problem. Their help is needed to prevent the spread of
                zebra mussels to unaffected waters. The campaign, which included
                the issue of information leaflets, alerted those groups to the
                danger of transporting zebra mussels to unaffected waters. It
                received good coverage in the local media and explained how
                boats and equipment can be cleansed by steam cleaning. Once
                zebra mussels are there, it is very difficult, if not
                impossible, to remove them. The mussels must be controlled, and
                I urge people to pay attention to any advice given because they
                will create many problems in our waters if they are not dealt
                with.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A North/South technical advisory group now

                quality standards across a range of scientific and conservation

                carried out in the mid-1990s on water quality management
                strategies for the Foyle and Erne waterway systems. That was

                to be international it has to involve the interests of at least
                two countries. Will he also agree that the willingness of the
                Dublin Government to acknowledge that international dimension on
                the island of Ireland has come about as a direct consequence of

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I refer to my response to an earlier
                question. I participate on the basis that the two separate and
                distinct Administrations reflect separate and distinct
                jurisdictions, but they can and should co-operate where that can
                deliver genuine mutual benefit. The environment sector’s
                agenda passes that test by concentrating on practical measures
                rather than on symbolic gestures. I welcome the acknowledgement
                by the Republic of Ireland that we are a separate jurisdiction.
                My opposite number, Mr Noel Dempsey, and I work very well
                together, and co-operation is excellent.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Water Framework Directive requires member
                states to identify cross-border waterways as international river
                basin districts and to co-operate on their water quality
                management.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the problem of general refuse and waste
                management, does the Minister agree that a critical mass is
                required for the economic and effective recycling of waste and
                the possible creation of energy from it? Does he agree that an
                all-Ireland approach is required? The matter has been talked
                about for more than a decade, but there has been no real
                progress in quantum recycling and the production of energy. Will
                he put at the top of his agenda for the next North/South
                environmental meeting the need for a common approach to
                recycling and the critical mass required for it? It cannot be
                done piecemeal. For example, the nine councils around Belfast
                are at present trying to introduce a scheme for the recycling of
                tyres. Does the Minister agree that that needs to be done on a
                much larger all-island basis? It should not involve only tyres,
                but all domestic and other waste.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no doubt that we are keen to
                co-operate on recycling and to facilitate it where possible. The
                waste management strategy, in promoting recycling, sets a target
                for district councils to recycle or compost 25% of household
                waste by 2005. That will entail a significant increase on
                present recycling levels by councils in Northern Ireland,
                currently estimated to be around 5%.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Key to the success of any recycling programme
                is the co-ordination of systems to recover materials and the
                development of markets for their use. I am pleased that my
                Department will provide financial support for the development of
                new markets and will assist councils to implement their waste
                management plans, particularly in respect of recycling.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All district councils now belong to one of
                three sub- regional groups which are examining the establishment
                of a network of waste management facilities, including provision
                for recycling. Cross-border co-operation will come into that and
                will provide the economies of scale necessary to make investment
                in recycling and recovery facilities viable. The smaller scale
                is not viable. A larger market will be provided for products
                made from recycled materials.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I thank the
                Member for his point. The negative impact of all sorts of
                packaging, including plastic bags, has long been a matter of
                general concern. The EC Directive 94/62/EC 1994 on packaging and
                packaging waste was specifically designed to bring about a
                reduction in the use of packaging by placing recycling and
                recovery obligations on businesses that are involved in the
                making or filling of packaging or in the sale of packaged goods.
                Several of the larger supermarket chains including Tesco and
                Sainsbury’s are now using multi-trip bags such as Tesco’s
                &quot;bag for life&quot;. More recently, companies have been
                investigating the extent to which biodegradable bags might meet
                the requirements.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Agricultural plastic is not a controlled
                waste. Therefore it is exempt from waste legislation. That is
                likely to change in the near future when agricultural waste
                becomes a controlled waste under the terms of the proposed
                controlled waste regulations for Northern Ireland. The Republic
                of Ireland has introduced new regulations that govern the
                collection and recycling of waste farm plastics. Producers and
                suppliers of farm wrap must register, operate a deposit scheme
                of £200 per tonne and collect farm plastics for recycling or
                recovery. In conjunction with the Department of Agriculture and
                Rural Development, my Department is looking at the necessary
                primary powers to introduce a similar scheme in Northern Ireland
                and the feasibility of setting up voluntary collection schemes.</p>

                Have the waste management schemes that were put forward by the

                sticking to their rejection of them because they do not cover a
                long enough period? I understand that the schemes cover a
                five-year period, and the Department is looking for a 20-year

                recycling, which breaks down waste into gas, minerals and
                metals? The problem with recycling, as the Minister knows, is

                management strategy allows for cross- border co-operation as
                part of the district-council- based management plans. The market
                here is not large enough for such a system, so we are proceeding
                on an all-Ireland basis. Any cross-border co-operation will need
                to comply with both the waste management strategy and the UK
                management plan for exports and imports of waste. The UK plan is
                currently under review and is likely to allow cross-border
                imports and exports of waste where there are sound economic and
                environmental reasons for doing so and where the activity is
                included in each district council’s waste management plan. We

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are co-operating with the authorities
                across the border, and we will take into account what the Member
                has said. The Water Framework Directive aims to improve water
                quality through the management of complete river catchments.
                There is an important issue there. The Directive requires member
                states to agree water quality management plans for cross-border
                waterways, which are known as international river basin
                districts.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Water Framework Directive was adopted by
                the EU on 22 December 2000 and must be incorporated into
                Northern Ireland legislation by 2003. In order to achieve good
                water quality status, water quality management plans for all
                river basin districts must be prepared by 2009 and implemented
                by 2015. The plans will then be reviewed, as it is a continuous
                process. It is an important plan, which we are working on.</p>

                aggregates tax, which is distorting the quarry industry in the
                border regions, mentioned in the Minister’s discussions?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given the Chancellor’s decision to impose
                that tax on Northern Ireland, has there been any discussion
                about the need for the imposition of a similar tax in the South,
                which would remove that distortion and provide a fair playing

                the aggregates tax, but I am aware that it creates a great
                problem in Northern Ireland. The Northern Ireland Quarry Owners
                Association has approached me about the matter. It is a big
                environmental issue, and I know how difficult it will be for
                quarry owners in this jurisdiction. It is important that we
                examine this touchy and difficult issue, because there could be
                disastrous consequences for local quarry owners.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That this Assembly calls on the Executive to
                establish an interdepartmental working group to make
                recommendations on the removal of paramilitary flags, emblems
                and graffiti from public property.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The University of Ulster will this week
                publish a report entitled ‘Spaces of Fear’. It demonstrates
                the paradox that exists in our society: although much progress
                has been made as a result of the Belfast Agreement, bigotry,
                sectarianism and segregation have increased rather than
                decreased. We should be alarmed by those findings.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There has been a marked increase in the
                amount of graffiti and the number of paramilitary flags —
                sometimes on lamp posts along arterial routes — murals,
                kerbstone painting and monuments in virtually every housing
                estate in Northern Ireland. They are the physical manifestation
                of sectarianism and segregation in our society and a sign that
                paramilitary groups have entire areas in their sights.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall not argue about which flags are
                intimidatory and which are not; opinions on that will differ. I
                refer to Republican, Loyalist and other potentially racist
                graffiti. I do not intend to attack anyone’s national flag,
                nor do I want to argue about when a mural is offensive and when
                it is artistic. Most of us can see the artistic talent in many
                of the works on gable walls. However, murals depicting guns and
                which bear the initials of paramilitary organisations are
                deplorable.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Flags, murals and kerbstone painting cause
                considerable offence to many. Those emblems mark out territory
                and send out a message that certain parts of our country are the
                exclusive preserve of one side and that, by implication, others
                are unwelcome. The threats and intimidation behind the emblems
                are clear and are unacceptable. Furthermore, some murals
                celebrate the most brutal killings of the troubles, and cause
                immense offence to victims. That is totally unacceptable.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An important point is that such displays are
                not merely offensive to the perceived minority — they are
                offensive to those in the majority who reject the implication
                that these flags symbolise good community relations. Many decent
                people who like to put a flag on their property at certain times
                of the year, and for specific reasons, find these practices
                offensive and wish that they did not happen at all. These
                emblems pose a major challenge to the cause of preserving a
                common civic space across Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Tattered flags left flying at the end of
                every summer and through the worst of our winters are nothing
                but an eyesore, regardless of their colours or origin. What must
                tourists and potential investors think when they see our society
                divided up in this way? It is certain that properties are
                devalued as a result of these unwanted items being foisted upon
                them, and that too concerns owners.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a great sense of powerlessness and
                frustration across the community that the problem has gone
                unchallenged. Individuals are afraid to act or speak out,
                because they risk being threatened or intimidated — they might
                get a brick, petrol or pipe bomb through their window. People
                are scared to complain to the police or to take legal action
                based on equality legislation. Under section 75 of the Northern
                Ireland Act 1998 and the Fair Employment and Treatment (Northern
                Ireland) Order 1998, arguments can be made that public
                authorities have a duty to maintain neutral, non-discriminatory
                public space. However, those laws are of little use if people or
                public authorities are afraid to take action. In Britain, or
                elsewhere, if racist flags and murals causing substantial
                offence and damage to good racial relations are put up on public
                property, people can be sure that the authorities will act
                swiftly to remove them. Here the authorities simply do not act.
                Either they point to inadequacies in civil or criminal law or
                simply pass the buck. If you phone the police to complain about
                the young lads — and, in some cases, the not so young —
                putting up flags, they will advise you to ignore them. Taking
                them down may result in the erection of even more. That is
                simply not good enough.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The erection of a flag can be construed as an
                action likely to lead to a breach of the peace. However, the
                police will only act when flags are being erected in areas
                perceived to be of the other side of the community. Indeed, you
                are more likely to be arrested for taking down a flag. If you
                phone the Department of the Environment, the Roads Service or
                the Housing Executive to complain, they will usually say that
                they are powerless to act, because more will go up.
                Alternatively, they point to the dangers posed to their staff.
                Also, to date, councils have no power to intervene. Worse is the
                number of anecdotal stories of agencies advising concerned
                callers to raise the matter with the local paramilitary leader.
                That merely increases the control of paramilitaries in certain
                areas and reinforces the division of society.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are no easy answers to the problem, but
                we should recognise that there is a serious problem, and face up
                to it rather than run away from it. Many of our Departments,
                particularly the Department of the Environment, the Department
                for Regional Development and the Department for Social
                Development, have public property affected by this problem.
                However, time after time, when asked questions about this,
                Ministers have said that they are powerless or have passed the
                buck.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I suggest that the Executive create an
                interdepartmental working group to discuss the matter, to guide
                public bodies and to co-ordinate an appropriate response. The
                group should work in liaison with the police, consider how the
                existing criminal and civil law could be better enforced and
                highlight what legislative changes could be made by the
                Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Everyone in the House should support the
                motion. It simply calls on us to show leadership on the issue
                and perform our duty by examining the problem and trying to find
                solutions. I ask for Members’support.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is said that evil triumphs when good men
                do nothing. The particular evil of paramilitary displays,
                whether they be flags, emblems or murals, will continue to
                triumph in our society if we, as good men in positions of
                responsibility in the Assembly, fail to act against it. I
                welcome the motion. Kieran McCarthy has done a great service by
                bringing the matter to the attention of the House. He has
                described accurately the situation that obtains in our society.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is a continuing problem. Many people are
                deeply offended and outraged that paramilitary organisations
                continue to put flags and emblems on public property.
                Paramilitary displays and emblems are threatening and
                intimidatory no matter which side they come from. They deter
                inward investment in the areas of our community that need it
                most. They also deter the development of tourism. We are aware
                of the situation in many of our coastal towns that normally
                attract greater numbers of tourists. The presence of
                paramilitary flags, murals, and displays has a significant
                adverse effect on visitors to those areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Flags and emblems create a paramilitary
                culture in many parts of our towns, villages and housing
                estates. Unfortunately, they have become the norm. Young people
                are growing up in a culture in which paramilitary displays are
                seen as a part of ordinary life — that cannot be right. It
                cannot be right, by any democratic standard, that we, as
                legislators, should continue to tolerate such a situation. It
                corrupts the people who live in those areas and the children who
                grow up in such an environment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There has been an extraordinary growth in the
                number of paramilitary displays on both sides of the sectarian
                divide in the past few years. We require effective measures to
                counteract that growth. Flags and emblems create the appearance
                a fiefdom controlled by a paramilitary organisation. They help
                to reaffirm sectarian divisions. Paramilitary displays are
                grossly offensive to ordinary people who live in areas polluted
                by them. Many do not want such displays and want us to condemn
                their use. However, people will not support us, because they
                feel intimidated and cowed by the might of those who have
                imposed offensive displays on their communities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Paramilitary displays are offensive not only
                to those who live in the affected areas, but to people who work
                in, travel through, or visit the areas. Many people are
                affected. In principle, it is wrong to impose the burden of
                testing opinion on residents of affected housing estates,
                because they are not in a position to freely exercise their
                rights.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Member accept that there can be a
                solution to the problem that he has outlined? In South Down, a
                local community association wrote to every resident in a certain
                — in this case, Loyalist — estate, asking them for their
                views on paramilitary flags. A confidential response was sent
                back to a post office box address. The responses showed that the
                overwhelming majority of residents in the estate — the Langley
                Road estate in Ballynahinch — was opposed to the flying of
                paramilitary flags. Is that not a way forward without
                opportunity for intimidation?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr A Maginness:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I accept Mr Wells’s point. That is a good
                scheme, and I am aware of it. It was carried out in an effective
                way that removed the chances of intimidation of the local
                community by paramilitaries. I accept that there are effective
                ways of doing that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want, however, to reaffirm the general
                principle that it is wrong to place on people an unfair burden
                that they, alone, have to discharge. It is wrong in principle to
                allow something as fundamentally offensive to democracy as
                paramilitary displays to remain in any public place.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I disagree with Kieran McCarthy’s comments
                on national flags. That issue must be handled sensitively, but
                national flags, although not used as paramilitary displays, are
                used in an overtly sectarian manner. I would have thought that
                Mr McCarthy’s motion could have encompassed that factor.
                Although the motion is limited to paramilitary displays, that
                aspect of the problem should also be addressed by the
                interdepartmental working group if the motion is accepted by the
                Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a sense of powerlessness and
                hopelessness among those in our community who see these
                offensive displays everyday. We, as legislators and people in
                authority, must take effective action. Prima facie, the
                interference by anyone other than a lawful authority in relation
                to public property would, in my view, be unlawful. I would have
                thought that, even now, the public authorities and the police
                have at least some residual power to deal with this problem. The
                paralysis of public authorities, and of the police, in regard to
                this problem, which has been evident over the past number of
                years, highlights the need for the Assembly to introduce, as
                expeditiously as possible and as a top priority, legislation to
                deal with the problem. There must be practical and effective
                legislation to outlaw paramilitary displays in public areas.
                Such legislation should be the objective of the
                interdepartmental working group. That will be the only effective
                means of dealing with this evil. As I said at the beginning,
                evil triumphs when good men do nothing. We, as good men
                representing the public good, should act and do so quickly.</p>

                paramilitary flags, no matter where they are displayed in the
                Province. First, it is all very well for us to sit as public
                representatives in the Assembly, to agree to the motion, and to
                pass whatever laws we want, but, at the end of the day, we are

                issue has been discussed over the years, and the problem has
                grown.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A solution must come from within the
                community where it occurs. If it were tackled in the wrong way,
                many people, particularly paramilitaries, would see that as a
                challenge. As a result, more flags might go up, rather than come
                down. In my area of Foyle, we have managed to resolve the issue
                in some areas where the public have come together and worked on
                a solution for the removal of the flags.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Flags, especially those of paramilitary
                organisations, threaten the entire community. They are often
                regarded as a sign that an area is being targeted or controlled.
                Paramilitaries feel that the more flags they put up, the more of
                an area they control. However, that is often not the case. The
                community would quietly disagree with the flying of flags
                outside their homes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The problem has to be addressed without
                creating another problem. In two areas of my constituency we
                have been reasonably successful in removing all flags through
                hard work with the community to collectively resolve the issue.
                We could pass legislation in the Assembly, and we could discuss
                it at local authority level, but, at the end of the day,
                somebody somewhere — the RUC or, perhaps, personnel from the
                Department for Regional Development — would have to remove the
                flags. Employees in my constituency have often been threatened,
                some seriously. One person had to leave the area after he
                attempted to remove flags. The solution to all of these issues
                lies in the local community.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Member agree that the approach by
                the authorities is sometimes not even- handed? When Loyalists
                removed tricolours in parts of Ballymena, they were arrested and
                taken to court. There is a perception in the Loyalist community
                that Republicans are not arrested when they take down Loyalist
                posters or signs. Is it not important that the police are
                even-handed in their approach to this? If people break the law,
                they should be seen to be prosecuted.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will take on board the hon Member’s
                comments about getting that balance. There is a feeling that
                often the authorities have not got the balance right. There are
                people who put up paramilitary flags, or flags of any nature,
                and who try to get them as close as they can to either a
                Nationalist area or a Unionist area. In some areas of my
                constituency, tricolours fly so close to a Protestant area that
                it is clear that they were only put up to create problems from
                the neighbouring community.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.00 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The only reason for putting up those flags
                was to try to get a reaction from the Protestant community. It
                is good that that community did not react, because the
                Republican movement has, over the years, tried to get a reaction
                from that Protestant estate. During the summer, it decided that,
                everything else having failed, it would try to put up a few
                tricolours. The Protestant estate was very restrained and did
                not react.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Flags have been a problem for 30 years. This
                issue will not be resolved over the next number of months, or
                even years. It is a major problem for both communities, and it
                is on the increase. Unfortunately, there are occasions on which
                public representatives make a bad situation worse.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a way to tackle and resolve this
                issue. The only way in which it can be genuinely resolved is if
                communities say that enough is enough and are no longer prepared
                to allow people to come into their areas to put up paramilitary
                flags and then leave those areas feeling under threat. When
                Government agencies and others drive through those areas, it can
                appear that the UDA, the UVF or the IRA controls them. In many
                instances, that is not the case.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not, in principle, opposed to the
                setting up of a working group. However, I do not know what that
                working group would recommend on the removal of flags. It would
                be a miracle, because if we got that right, we would probably
                get everything else right here. In any case, I do not know how
                the working group could enforce its recommendations, and if the
                recommendations could not be enforced, the group would have
                failed. My party is not against the motion in principle; the
                difficulty is in its delivery on the ground.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.
                Aontaím le focail an mholtóra — leis an chuid is mó acu ar
                a laghad. Níl mé i gcoinne an rúin é féin, ach tá ceist
                agam ar an mholtóir: conas is féidir leis an ghrúpa seo an
                fhadhb a réiteach?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with much of what Mr McCarthy has
                said about flags, emblems and graffiti, whether they are of a
                paramilitary nature or not. I tend to agree with Mr Hay’s
                approach. Why does Mr McCarthy think that the establishment of
                an interdepartmental working group will solve the problem? He
                and others referred to the introduction of legislation. We have
                legislation that makes it an offence to deface public property.
                The Departments have the capacity to remove objects of any
                nature from their property, be it road signs, telephone or
                electricity poles, or the gables of Housing Executive
                properties. More legislation will not necessarily address the
                problem.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issue of graffiti certainly needs to be
                addressed. The Department for Regional Development is
                responsible for removing graffiti from road signs, direction
                signs and hazard signs. I note that the Minister is here.
                Perhaps he will comment on the costs to the Department of
                dealing with graffiti.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are legitimate uses of flags and
                emblems to celebrate cultural identity, cultural expression or
                an event, and there are murals that are visually attractive and
                not offensive to anybody. However, there is no doubt that in the
                work place, in schools and places of education, in places of
                worship and in mixed communities where people have different
                cultural or religious identities, flags and emblems are
                uncomfortably intimidating.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have had many discussions with Roads
                Service and Housing Executive officials and with community
                groups on the ways and means of dealing with problems such as
                graffiti and flags. The only way that they can be effectively
                addressed is by involving the community groups in the areas
                where the problem occurs. Legislation and policing will not
                solve the issues of graffiti, flags or emblems.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I ask the proposer of this motion what
                benefit he sees in establishing this group and how he sees
                legislation being effective. For any group to be productive, it
                would need to be working on the street with the communities
                involved, with a community approach, and enabling them to have a
                more constructive and attractive expression of their culture. I
                am not opposed to the motion, but I question the effectiveness
                of simply establishing an interdepartmental group to deal with
                the issue. Go raibh maith agat.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCartney:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Last week, during the debate on Holy Cross
                Primary School, I was at pains to mention that in recent years
                the Northern Ireland community has become more divided, bitter,
                angry and violent than it has ever been in the past.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the past few days a university report has
                been published on the divisions in the community of Northern
                Ireland. It confirms in the most graphic way that over the past
                seven years — a period, incidentally, covered by the so-called
                peace process — divisions in the community and a sense of
                bitterness, exclusion and fear have multiplied enormously. The
                percentage of people from one community who will not enter, even
                by car, areas perceived as belonging to the other community was
                very revealing. The figure was enormously high. Many Protestants
                and Unionists will not enter communities perceived as being
                Nationalist- dominated, and Nationalists who for years have done
                their shopping in areas perceived as being predominantly
                Protestant and Unionist will no longer enter those areas. The
                community has been completely and totally divided.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Among the features of the division are the
                signs and symbols that the extremist paramilitary groups have
                decided to impose on communities as indicating that they control
                those areas and those communities. Because they control those
                communities through fear and violence, members of the opposite
                community who might be recognised as such will not enter them.
                Members of the communities that suffer under this symbolism are
                terrified of a brutal reaction to protests that they do not
                subscribe to the views that these symbols are intended to
                convey.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly is fond of telling the world at
                large and the community in Northern Ireland about the benefits
                that devolution has conferred upon it. However, all the signs of
                the much-vaunted peace process and the investigations carried
                out by community relations bodies and academic investigations,
                such as the one I referred to, confirm that that is not the
                case. The opposite is the truth.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 1995, when I was elected MP for North
                Down, the Kilcooley estate, a large housing estate in Bangor,
                was virtually free, if not totally free, from all paramilitary
                symbolism. In the past five or six years the main thoroughfare
                through that estate has had every kerbstone painted red, white
                and blue. On the gable walls of those houses, which can been
                seen from Bangor’s Circular Road, there are massive Loyalist
                paramilitary productions proclaiming UVF or UDA brigades and
                lauding the importance of, and the dedication to, the Union of
                those groups.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have no doubt that such symbolism is
                replicated throughout many Nationalist areas. One may ask why
                that has been permitted. I have made such enquiries to the RUC
                and the Department of the Environment in the Bangor area. All
                sorts of reasons are given, but the most important reason is
                that lives might be lost or personal injury might be suffered if
                attempts were made to remove paramilitary symbols, which would
                be replaced instantly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with the sentiments of the motion. If
                it lay in my power, or in the power of the Assembly or the
                Executive, to remove effectively, efficiently and permanently
                all paramilitary symbolism and flags, I would endorse it
                wholeheartedly. However, the fundamental problem is much deeper
                than one that may be cured by an interdepartmental committee
                that makes proclamations or invokes legislation about how the
                problem should be dealt with.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since the process began — and this is why
                the problem exists — both Governments, under cover of arriving
                at a political settlement, have in fact arrived at a process of
                conflict resolution between the British state, which nominally
                has authority for the Assembly, and the representatives of
                violent Republican terrorists and their counterparts in the
                Protestant/Unionist community. It is necessary to include the
                latter because if they are excluded — and politically the UDA
                has been excluded by the electorate — they feel free to carry
                on with their paramilitary activities, thus threatening the
                Nationalist community, as they are attempting to do at present.
                The Nationalist community and its so-called representatives in
                the IRA would then react, and the whole structure would come
                tumbling down. It was for that reason that a policy of appeasing
                both sets of terrorists was allowed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An academic group, which I think was from the
                University of Ulster, compiled a report on policy in Northern
                Ireland. That group also made it clear that it believed that the
                Government were deliberately frustrating the principles of the
                Belfast Agreement by adopting a softly, softly attitude towards
                terrorists. This softly, softly attitude towards terrorism is
                reflected in the attitude to alleged breaches of the ceasefire.</p>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It seems that Republicans can murder, maim,
                mutilate and destroy within their own communities to keep them
                under control. Nationalists and Republicans murdering
                Nationalists, Republicans and Catholics does not amount to a
                violation of the ceasefire, and it is the same with their
                counterparts in the Loyalist organisations — and it seems at
                present that they are even more active in brutalising their
                community. They are creating Republican and so- called Loyalist
                areas where the rule of law does not run, where these groups can
                dominate the communities and behave in whatever way they wish.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For the sake of preserving the agreement, for
                the sake of alleging that ceasefires exist which do not, the
                Government have been prepared to tolerate this. Why have the
                Government tolerated criminality? Until last Tuesday week it was
                necessary to preserve a policy of protecting the mainland by
                appeasing terrorism in Northern Ireland, and so we have the
                manifestations of the control which the Governments, both North
                and South, have permitted.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have the manifestations of the control in
                the flags, emblems, graffiti and gable wall proclamations that
                these are areas where the rule of law does not run, where
                Republican IRA terrorists and so-called Loyalist paramilitaries
                manifestly control and declare that control through flags and
                emblems. The Government do not wish to do anything about it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are told that we should propose
                legislation, but as Mr Hay said, who will enforce the
                legislation? What if the enforcement of that legislation brings
                about open conflict with these groups? What if they shoot
                members of the security forces or murder members of the
                Department of the Environment who are carrying out this work?
                Instantly that would bring to a head a confrontation with those
                whom these symbols represent. That could threaten the policy
                that, up to now, has been one of deplorable appeasement by the
                British Government, encouraged by the Irish Government, which
                permit dumps of weaponry to remain on their soil in
                contravention of their Constitution.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no point in trying to deal with the
                symptoms of a disease, a political disease that is endemic in
                this community, without considering the underlying causes. If we
                deal with the rash without dealing with the cause of the rash it
                will perhaps manifest itself in another more virulent and
                violent form.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We do not need another commission or body to
                deal with these sectarian manifestations. Jane Morrice suggested
                a commission on sectarianism. Everyone here knows the causes of
                sectarianism, and the only people who would be qualified, in the
                view of that august party, to be members of that commission
                would be members of that party. No doubt they would be offering
                themselves for membership of the commission as most suitable and
                most qualified by their simon-pure protestations — because
                they do little else. Just like many other commissions, it would
                sit, it would talk, it would piffle and prognosticate, and it
                would not be able to produce any answer.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree entirely with the sentiments of the
                motion. Alban Maginness introduced another element: what is a
                sectarian emblem or symbol? Is it the Union flag? Is it the
                tricolour? Those emblems would not come within the terms of Mr
                McCarthy’s motion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us look into the matter a little deeper.
                Four or five years ago the great principle that everyone was
                looking for was equality of esteem. At that time there was a
                difficulty about the national anthem being played at Queen’s
                University. I remember that the SDLP Member Bríd Rodgers, who
                is now a Minister, said that Queen Elizabeth was not her queen
                and that the symbols of British authority in Northern Ireland
                were not her symbols. Her President was the President of the
                Republic of Ireland. People are entitled to espouse that
                viewpoint. However, if one of the fundamental pillars upon which
                the Assembly and the Executive is erected is the principle of
                consent — that until a majority of the people of Northern
                Ireland consent to be ruled otherwise than from the United
                Kingdom — the United Kingdom will be the sovereign power and
                Northern Ireland will remain part of the United Kingdom.
                Therefore the Union flag is the flag of Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have never been a flag flapper. I have
                never been in favour of using the Union Jack as a means of
                demonstrating any form of triumphalism or superiority over the
                Nationalist community. I deplore the use of the national flag
                for such a purpose. However, we are at the stage of becoming a
                stateless people. We are not allowed any emblems that indicate
                the political identity of the state. There are problems about
                flying the Union flag over this Building; and greater problems
                about flying it over the Departments of certain Ministers. It
                must be realised that the problem of symbols identified most
                acutely with the paramilitaries is only an extreme example of a
                divided community. That community is daily becoming even more
                divided by the policies of central Government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am in favour of the sentiment and objective
                of the motion. However, I have profound reservations. Passing
                laws, whether by the Assembly — or by the Medes and the
                Persians — is useless unless such laws are enforceable and can
                be delivered. We will have this problem until there is a real
                willingness in the community to tell the men of violence in both
                communities that they have no place here. No committee, body or
                commission will be able to offer any remedy or panacea for that
                difficulty.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr O’Connor:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion. The situation is that
                some Northern Ireland Housing Executive estates, whether
                Republican or Loyalist, are bedecked with flags and pictures of
                gunmen, which I find grossly offensive. It does not matter
                whether they are Republican or Loyalist gunmen. There are
                problems in my town of Larne. I agree partly with what the
                Member for Foyle (Mr Hay) said about community participation.
                Unfortunately, in some of those estates, the tail is wagging the
                dog. It does not apply only to estates in which there is a mixed
                community; in predominantly Protestant and Unionist estates,
                there are people who find it grossly offensive to have
                paramilitary flags flying, and I have no doubt that that feeling
                is replicated in the Nationalist community. However, people are
                too afraid to say or do anything. Should we subject those people
                to life under such conditions? Do we let the tail wag the dog by
                kowtowing to the people who are putting up the flags and asking
                them which flags we can take down?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with my Colleague, Alban Maginness,
                who said that there was a need for legislation. The current
                legislation is, at best, woolly, and it is not enforced. When
                the law is enforced, the people involved get no more than a slap
                on the wrist, because putting up flags counts only as behaviour
                that is likely to cause a breach of the peace. It is much more
                than that: such people are telling their community that they are
                the bosses — the school yard bullies — and that local people
                must do as they are told, or face the consequences. We need an
                effective deterrent, and the punishment should fit the crime.
                Intimidation is not being dealt with seriously. Crimes involving
                intimidation on religious or racial grounds must be dealt with
                more severely.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Public authorities have a duty to try to
                promote good relations. We have talked about flags on street
                lights or murals on the gables of Housing Executive houses. In
                my town, there are two gables side by side. One has a mural
                showing the Battle of the Somme, and I do not find it remotely
                offensive. The other mural portrays two gunmen in a military
                stance, and underneath are written the letters &quot;UFF&quot;:
                I find that offensive.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There may be such a thing as a cultural
                mural, but a line must be drawn. We must decide where culture
                ends and paramilitary culture begins. We must define what is
                acceptable and what is unacceptable. Anything that advocates the
                use of illegal arms or illegal force is unacceptable. Would a
                true Irishman who respected the tricolour or a true Unionist who
                respected the Union flag paint their flag on the streets for the
                dogs to run over? I do not believe so. People who respect their
                flag should use it when it is appropriate to do so.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCarthy said that some people liked to
                fly the Union flag from their home at certain times of the year;
                that is a matter for them. I am talking about the estates that
                are decked out in paramilitary regalia. The communities need
                help to get the people who are doing it off their backs. As Mr
                McCartney said, there has been a certain appeasement of such
                people. The Secretary of State has been ambivalent about
                admitting that both sides have broken their ceasefire.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I accept that, but how do we make progress?
                How do we prevent people from being intimidated? How can that
                cloud be removed from over their heads?</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.30 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Legislation may be the answer. I take on
                board Mr Hay’s and Mr McCartney’s points about the need to
                be able to enforce any legislation. People have previously tried
                to paint over murals, only to be told that they must leave the
                area or they will get a bullet through the head; they have been
                genuinely frightened. The Housing Executive, as a result of one
                such incident, is very reluctant — and understandably so —
                to send anyone back to that estate to take the necessary and
                appropriate action. However, there are other solutions, perhaps
                in conjunction with the police. One option is that undercover
                policemen paint over graffiti and arrest those who threaten
                them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There has been talk of an irresistible force
                and an immovable object. It has also been said that the more
                graffiti is removed the more will appear, but it must be removed
                every time it goes up, and those who keep putting it up must be
                prosecuted. In that way we can try to create a better
                environment for all citizens.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members of an interdepartmental working group
                may know the problems on the ground and may be able to make
                solid recommendations. On that basis, I support the motion.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Shannon:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the proposal in principle, but I
                also urge caution on circumstances that could arise as a result
                of it. It is important to address the issues that Mr McCarthy
                raised. I understand that the Department is keen to support the
                proposal, but some matters must be taken on board. Mr O’Connor
                spoke of the fear in the community. While that is true, not
                everyone is afraid of what is put up on walls.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some murals are very acceptable, for example,
                those commemorating World War I, to which many people, as
                members of the Royal British Legion, can relate. Much of the
                community thinks that those murals are acceptable. A clear
                distinction must be made between what is acceptable and what is
                not.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also urge caution on the interdepartmental
                working group. Will the Government body be able to enforce its
                recommendations? Will it be able to suggest how they should be
                enforced? Perhaps Mr McCarthy will address that. It is all very
                well to ask for changes, but we must address where such changes
                will occur and who will be responsible.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In one incident on the Ards peninsula this
                year, obscene graffiti was put up. The RUC and Ards Borough
                Council were quite happy to remove it. The graffiti appeared in
                the countryside, where there were only three or four households
                that might feel directly endangered or threatened by it. The
                graffiti was dealt with immediately because all residents in the
                immediate area were opposed to it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That was a simple situation. It happened in a
                country area and the small number of residents involved all
                agreed on the action to be taken.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Should the recommendation be, for example,
                that the graffiti, or emblems be removed, it should be noted
                that in 30 years of terrorism the enemies of our country have
                occasionally booby-trapped flags and emblems and that security
                forces personnel have lost limbs or their lives in trying to
                deal with them. Caution is most certainly needed in this regard.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When flags are removed, new ones are
                undoubtedly put up. Has anything been achieved by removing some
                and allowing others to replace them? We should perhaps look at
                the problem at every level. At last week’s meeting of Ards
                Borough Council, its chief technical services officer gave
                councillors a cautionary note on the removal of graffiti. He
                endorsed the council’s decision, but was concerned about the
                safety of his staff in implementing the proposals. Such concern
                also applies to the Housing Executive and the Department of the
                Environment. Personnel must be given protection. It must also be
                ensured that, should such a decision be taken, personnel can
                remove those articles.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Who will enforce decisions about the removal
                of emblems or graffiti? Who will police them? Who will ensure
                that staff are safe and are not threatened or endangered when
                carrying out the work?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need a group which can work in its own
                community. It is not fair for decisions to be made for the whole
                Province. In conjunction with the RUC, and staff employed by the
                Housing Executive, local councils and the Roads Service, a
                community should decide what should be removed. Those issues
                must be addressed at community level, not by the criteria of a
                Government body.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must make sure that staff are safe and
                that the community has an input into the process.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What happens where a community shows its
                support for paramilitary displays? Alternatively, what happens
                if, because of intimidation and fear, it is incapable of freely
                expressing its view on those matters? Is there not a danger that
                a community could be unable to act freely in certain
                circumstances? What happens then?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Every case must be dealt with on its own
                merit; it is always difficult to give a general answer. We who
                live in communities have our ears to the ground and a fair idea
                of community thinking. There is a way forward, but it must be
                community-based, and it must come from people on the ground. Let
                them decide.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr ONeill:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Considerable ground has already been covered,
                and Members have dealt adequately with the fact that the motion
                asks for the removal of paramilitary flags. There was discussion
                on the use — or, perhaps more accurately, the abuse — of
                national flags. Flags have a very long history and are generally
                regarded as emblems to be treated with respect and pride.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unfortunately, in our society, they are used
                to taunt the other side. Hence, people with respect or pride for
                their flag — national or otherwise — would not leave it up a
                pole to fade into tatters. To do otherwise is not a show of
                respect or pride; it is taunting. That is part of our problem.
                It is a manifestation of the divisions in our society. It was
                here — with all due respect to Mr McCartney — before the
                agreement, and it has been here since. In fact, the agreement
                states that symbols and emblems should be</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;used in a manner which promotes mutual
                respect rather than division.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That should be the benchmark for any work
                that we do.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion extends from flags to emblems and
                graffiti on public property. There are many different types of
                emblems including, as experienced in Down district recently, the
                erection of monuments on council property without permission
                from a planning authority, the local community or an elected
                politician. That type of activity — and Down District Council
                is not the only council to suffer from it — has many sources.
                It raises a big issue about equality and what our work in the
                Assembly has achieved with the Human Rights Commission and the
                Equality Commission in determining how people can live and
                operate in a society that is free from threat or alienation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These issues result, as has been well
                illustrated by Members, in the virtual ghettoisation of an area.
                In most areas it is a small minority in the estate, town or
                village that achieves it. Should we not, therefore, support the
                majority in those towns, villages and communities, and give them
                a way of emphasising and achieving what they want in their own
                area?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Alban Maginness referred tellingly to the
                economic effect, particularly in areas that depend on tourism.
                When people see these things in a particular area, they feel
                alienated. That means that any attempt to promote a tourist
                industry in that area is faulted from the start. Everybody is
                disadvantaged, both those who want it and those who do not.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Danny O’Connor said that we need to help to
                get those people off the backs of the rest of the community. Mr
                McCartney poured scorn on the idea of a commission. However,
                since he mentioned it, why not look at something that can
                intervene in the community and help people by giving them the
                guidance and confidence to work together to solve these
                problems? As a result of Mr McCarthy’s motion, an inter-party
                group may come up with suggestions about how these things could
                be done to strengthen communities. It could carry out
                independent surveys of views and get the community to feel
                confident enough to deal with the issues.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Legislation is important. However, in some
                cases, when implemented directly, it can be a very difficult and
                blunt object, as my council knows from recent experience.
                Legislation is not the whole answer. However, legislation
                combined with the creation of opportunity for people to engage
                fully with what happens in their communities might be better
                than a legislative approach alone.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The implementation of existing regulations
                and legislation is very important. The Department of the
                Environment, particularly in the past, has received a lot of
                criticism. The police, councils and the Housing Executive have
                been criticised today for not fully implementing legislation. As
                Members have said, the people on the ground have a difficult job
                in dealing with the issue. They could be putting themselves and
                their families at risk, and we should never forget that. There
                is all the more reason, therefore, for an independent commission
                that could intervene and deal with the issues to rid our country
                of this blight.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is clear that many Members are still
                confused about the roles of the Department of the Environment
                and the Department for Regional Development. When the Department
                for Regional Development opens a new by-pass, the Minister is
                reported on the front page of all the newspapers as claiming
                responsibility. However, when his Department refuses to grit
                roads, everyone blames the Department of the Environment. Unless
                emblems are on a listed building, a planning service
                headquarters, or a divisional —<i>[Interruption].</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was not referring to the present
                arrangement. The Department of the Environment has received much
                criticism in the past, as the record shows.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Wells:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was referring to another contributor, who
                blamed the Department of the Environment for things that it was
                not responsible for. I do not oppose the motion, but I wonder
                what it will achieve. I am glad that Mr McCarthy has drawn a
                distinction, as I do, between the flags of this country — the
                Union flag and the Ulster flag — and paramilitary flags. It is
                traditional for people to fly the Union and Ulster flags during
                the marching season. The flags are put up on private homes, and
                many arches across the country bear flags. That is part of our
                tradition, which has prevailed in this part of the United
                Kingdom for many years. I would not support anything that would
                prevent people from flying those flags or depicting their
                traditions in years to come. However, everyone must accept that
                there is a problem with paramilitary flags. That is a problem in
                the community and it cannot be solved easily.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In my constituency of South Down we have
                tackled the difficulty of establishing the community’s point
                of view. If a representative of the Department for Regional
                Development or the Housing Executive were to knock on people’s
                doors to ask what they thought about the display of paramilitary
                flags, people would be very reluctant to give their opinions. In
                the Langley Road estate in Ballynahinch, every resident received
                a questionnaire that was stamped to make sure that it could not
                be photocopied and misused. A pre-paid envelope was provided,
                addressed to a post office box number in Ballynahinch. An
                independent panel opened the questionnaires, and the process was
                overseen by church leaders in the community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The questionnaire provided the first, very
                clear opinion poll on the display of paramilitary flags in
                Ballynahinch. The majority of people who live on the Langley
                Road estate are opposed to the display of UDA and UVF flags
                there. Perhaps for the first time, officials from the Department
                for Regional Development and the Housing Executive, who are
                asked to deal with the situation, know that they have
                overwhelming community support for what they are doing. Such
                questionnaires might be the way forward in dealing with the
                problem. The community is perfectly happy with the display of
                Union and Ulster flags and wishes that to continue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The logical outcome of Mr McCarthy’s
                proposal is that a working party be set up, and proposals made
                to deal with the problem. However, unless Mr McCarthy takes down
                the flags himself, the ordinary staff of the relevant Government
                agency will become the &quot;storm troopers&quot;. Roads Service
                or Housing Executive officials will be expected to go into areas
                and remove flags or cover up murals.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We know from experience what will happen. We
                watched with horror the news reports of the three Northern
                Ireland Electricity officials who were sent to Crossmaglen to
                disconnect the electricity supply of an individual who was
                abusing the metering system. Two suffered horrific injuries
                while carrying out what was a legitimate task. One was absent
                from work for a considerable time. In east Antrim, another
                member of staff received serious threats after he was sent to
                disconnect an electricity supply that was being illegally used.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These employees live and work in the same
                areas where they would be expected to remove flags or cover up
                murals. It is totally unreasonable to ask them to carry out such
                work without the support of the community. If they were brave
                enough to do so, the flags, murals and kerbstone paintings would
                be replaced within a day of their removal. The proposal will not
                work if we ask people to remove murals and graffiti without
                community support. There is nothing wrong with the concept of Mr
                McCarthy’s proposal, but it will not achieve its intended
                objective.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr ONeill rightly said that not only is it
                impossible to stop people in the Province from putting up
                paramilitary flags or painting kerbstones, but that in his town
                — and I applaud the stand that he has taken on the issue — a
                full-scale monument to Republicans has been erected without
                planning permission and without the landowner’s consent. There
                was nothing within present law to prevent the monument from
                being erected. An injunction was served on a Member of the
                Assembly restraining him from any further work on the monument.
                What happened next? Individuals not named on the injunction
                completed the work. People face enormous difficulties in trying
                to prevent such activity from taking place.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Kilcoo, which is in my own constituency of
                South Down, Northern Ireland Electricity and British Telecom
                poles are being used to display pictures of dead hunger
                strikers. The pictures have been displayed for many months and
                have not been taken down. If an ordinary Roads Service employee
                were to take those down in somewhere like Kilcoo, he could be
                signing his own death warrant, because of the threats and
                intimidation that he would receive.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is a difficult problem. I do not believe
                that any party will vote against Mr McCarthy’s proposal, but
                if he thinks that the proposed group will solve the problem, he
                is wrong. I will be interested to hear in his summation speech
                how he believes the working group — when it is formed — will
                implement, and gain community support for, its recommendations.
                Only when we solve the problem of lack of community support will
                we be able to implement any recommendations of the working
                party.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Byrne:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion and I congratulate Mr
                McCarthy. People are waiting for the Assembly to do something
                about the issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Flags, emblems and graffiti are being used as
                psychological weapons to impose fear on our communities.
                Toleration of the problem is leading to greater ghettoisation
                and social alienation. The erection of flags and emblems in an
                estate pertaining to a majority of householders causes the
                minority living there to feel a &quot;chill factor&quot;. It is
                an uncomfortable environment for them, and very often they
                leave, thereby leading to greater ghettoisation. It is
                deplorable.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People want the Assembly and the district
                councils to tackle the issue. Many business owners are aggrieved
                and angry at how their image and their competitiveness is
                weakened when flags are erected or graffiti sprayed on or near
                their premises.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Road signs are being defaced and bus shelters
                destroyed. This is adding to that &quot;chill factor&quot; and
                generally makes people feel uncomfortable. Many of the graffiti
                and paramilitary emblems are obscene and threatening to visitors
                or those going to an area to work.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have made representation to the public
                authorities and tried to get obscene and paramilitary-related
                graffiti removed. In the past my own council, Omagh District
                Council, along with the Housing Executive, had a contract with a
                private company to remove graffiti. I know that two drivers were
                severely intimidated — indeed, they were psychologically
                ostracised when they went to a pub for a drink. That sort of
                intimidation must be deplored. The Assembly has to send out a
                clear message that it does not tolerate that sort of behaviour
                or activity.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are many examples of this. Reference
                has been made to employees of the Housing Executive, Northern
                Ireland Electricity and the Roads Service who have tried to
                remove graffiti under instruction from their management. Many
                felt that they were shunned or fingered. That is another gross
                example of intimidation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must start sending out a message. Are we
                for or against intimidation, or are we ambivalent towards the
                intimidation of public service workers when we ask them to go
                out and keep our environment clear of such obscene graffiti? I
                support the motion and congratulate Mr McCarthy on tabling it.
                The public wants to see a clear message coming from the
                Assembly. It is dangerous for us to create any default options
                on this.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister for Regional Development (Mr
                Campbell):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for allowing me
                to respond to the motion. I do so, not because it is the sole
                preserve or even a prime responsibility of my Department — far
                from it — but because my Department has, over several years,
                had to face the brunt of this manifestation of our community
                divisions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The problems of paramilitary flag flying and
                graffiti, including the unwanted painting of kerbstones, are
                tangible symptoms of a more serious and chronic disease. We
                should be all too aware of the difficulties affecting community
                life and community relations in Northern Ireland. The trauma,
                the hurt and the resultant mistrust are deeply embedded running
                sores caused, in no small measure, by decades of terrorist
                strangulation of normal life and society. Overcoming the
                divisions that those sores leave cannot be quickly or easily
                accomplished.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While it is important that we can all speak
                here in relative agreement about the need to tackle these
                problems on a broad front, we should not delude ourselves. No
                one should be deceived into believing that there is a quick fix
                or that the establishment of an interdepartmental working group
                will be a panacea for these ills. Nonetheless, I welcome today’s
                debate as an important and very necessary step forward.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We all have a responsibility to tackle these
                issues. Individuals cannot be compelled to live and work
                together in harmony, nor can they be compelled to express
                themselves in ways dictated by others. Reconciliation and the
                construction of good community relations can only work when
                people make a conscious effort for themselves. Constructive
                approaches to tackle the root problems of this issue have to be
                low-key and sensitively handled if they are to be sustainable.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.00 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There have been successes. I know of groups
                which, with the support of local people, have tackled the issue
                of flags and have achieved consensus. In some areas, mixed
                groups of community representatives now remove offending flags
                as they appear. Importantly, those representatives have the
                support of the local community to do so. I cannot pretend,
                however, that that will serve as a model for all areas. Many
                different approaches will be required and doubtless not all will
                succeed at first.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The harnessing of broad community support is
                the key to success. The Roads Service has found that without the
                near unanimous support of local residents, the removal of flags
                and graffiti from its property is often nugatory and can lead to
                a proliferation of material, sometimes more offensive or
                permanent in nature. Sometimes the personnel who are tasked with
                the removal work are intimidated.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Roads Service wants to respond positively
                to that problem, but there are contentious and sensitive issues
                to be considered. In particular, there is a duty of care to
                staff and contractors, and their safety must be taken into
                account. Several Members have referred to incidents where staff
                have been threatened and, on occasion, physically assaulted.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is also the unavoidable question of
                resources. Undertaking the removal of offensive flags and
                graffiti is labour intensive, and a heavy opportunity cost must
                be considered against other priority road responsibilities.
                Taking that into account, the Roads Service’s current policy
                — I have stated it frequently in the House — is to remove
                any flags or graffiti on its property that are deemed to be a
                danger to road users. In other instances where specific
                complaints are received, but where there is no perceived danger
                to road users, it gauges community reaction on the likely
                success of attempts to remove the flags or graffiti. Advice is
                sought from the RUC, local elected representatives and local
                community representatives. I stress, however, that there is no
                legislative requirement for the Roads Service to remove such
                materials.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to respond to several issues raised by
                Members. Mr McCarthy, in moving the motion, distinguished
                between paramilitary flags and flags that are not deemed to be
                offensive. That is helpful, and the interdepartmental working
                group should be able to use it as a basis for progress.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Alban Maginness said — and I can see his
                reason for doing so — that in some instances the displays of
                paramilitary flags can be deemed a threat to democracy. I can
                understand that. I will resist the inclination to ask why the
                representatives of paramilitaries being in Government cannot be
                deemed such a threat to democracy. I will leave that for another
                debate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Hay mentioned the need for consensus, and
                that need was reiterated by many Members. Mr Hay spoke about
                areas in Londonderry where that has been achieved. In my opening
                remarks, I stressed the importance of achieving consensus, as
                that is likely to lead to a permanent resolution of the
                difficulty.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other Members spoke about the costs of
                removal. Mr McCartney said that devolution was partly to blame
                for the worsening divisions. I will leave others to pass comment
                on that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr O’Connor and others distinguished
                between cultural and paramilitary murals, which was helpful.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several Members referred to the problems that
                we face in removing murals: threats and sometimes physical
                violence ensue. Mr Byrne made a useful comment when he stated
                that we must declare where we stand on that intimidation. I
                would hope and expect the House to be decidedly against
                intimidation. I referred to recent instances in which Department
                for Regional Development Roads Service employees had been
                threatened, as the issue concerns Roads Service property. On one
                occasion an employee was physically attacked. The problem is an
                ongoing one, and I hope that whatever the findings of the
                interdepartmental working group, serious consideration will be
                given to the welfare of staff. I must give that high priority.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Public representatives’ comments are almost
                always useful in attempts to resolve problems. However, public
                representatives have occasionally made matters worse by
                intervening in sensitive discussions on the removal of
                paramilitary displays. That has served to exacerbate problems in
                certain areas. Fortunately, that has not happened often.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I reiterate what I said earlier: we all have
                responsibilities to tackle this divisive issue. We must be able
                to ensure that pride in the community and business confidence be
                restored to those areas most affected by the blight.
                Responsibility for that lies not only with various Departments,
                but with local councils, the Housing Executive, the RUC and
                community groups. Perhaps most importantly, responsibility lies
                with the terrorists who seed and feed the proliferation of the
                flags and graffiti that plague our communities and that keep the
                sores of conflict and division open and unhealed. I repeat that
                no quick fix is available. I call on all to play their part in
                tackling the issue and in wresting the strangling grip from
                terrorists in order to restore normality to our society.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the constructive contributions to
                the debate from every Member, and particularly that of the
                Minister for Regional Development. I do not know why the problem
                has fallen so much on his shoulders because other Ministers have
                responsibilities — those who are involved in housing, the
                Department of the Environment and so forth. Mr Campbell has
                defended his Department well, for which we are grateful.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many points have been covered. Alban
                Maginness mentioned national flags. I said that we were not
                concerned with the national flag. The national flag must be
                respected at all times.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ervine:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does that include the occasion on which Alban
                Maginness removed the flag of our nation from the Lord Mayor’s
                parlour when he became Lord Mayor of Belfast? That showed some
                respect for the national flag.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCarthy:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Member for his contribution. Mr
                Maginness may respond to that, as I cannot answer on his behalf.
                We are discussing paramilitary trappings, flags, monuments and
                so forth today.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I congratulate Mr Hay and Mr Campbell, who
                represent the constituencies of Foyle and East Londonderry
                respectively. They seem to be more advanced than Members from
                this part of Northern Ireland — not only in this instance, but
                on other occasions. I mean that seriously. I can think of other
                occasions on which a lead has been taken from a Member from
                those areas. Those Members should keep that up, and perhaps what
                they say will filter through to the rest of Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Hay said it was about community. Of course
                it is about community, and we must bring the communities with
                us. We all acknowledge that Northern Ireland suffers, and has
                suffered for a long time, from the &quot;them and us&quot;
                attitude. That has been nurtured by various people for their own
                ends. We must try to get away from that and bring people to work
                with each other rather than pull against each other.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McNamee referred to respect for different
                cultures. People are entitled to the culture of their choice,
                and respect must be given to that. The people who have that
                respect must, in turn, respect other people’s culture. That is
                very important.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Mr McCartney’s lively contribution — I
                do not know how long he took, but it certainly was quite a while
                — he talked about the segregation on housing estates in his
                constituency. That is wrong and must be condemned. However, it
                is the situation that people find themselves in. The Assembly
                and elected representatives should be doing all in their power
                to encourage people to live side by side wherever they choose,
                regardless of where they worship on a Sunday, if they worship
                anywhere. We should be hammering that point. Unfortunately, Mr
                McCartney is not in the Chamber at present. However, we are
                talking primarily about paramilitary flags and emblems. A Member
                specifically talked about the offensive graffiti showing guys
                standing around wearing combat jackets, carrying guns and
                holding a list of the organisations that have been guilty of the
                most heinous crimes. How can someone who has suffered at the
                hands of those people pass by each day and look up at a flag
                that portrays the organisation that was responsible for the
                murder of his loved one? That is the whole ethos of this debate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Jim Shannon and the Minister talked about the
                fear involved. Other Members talked about the fear of
                enforcement and how flags can be removed. It is a major problem.
                We cannot walk away from it. We must educate the people to know
                that these things are wrong. Any workman or woman asked to
                remove these flags is fearful.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Eamonn ONeill and Jim Wells from South Down
                quite rightly referred to the problem of monuments. Monuments
                have been erected in that area without planning permission. If I
                wanted to build a structure, I would have to seek planning
                permission, not only from the Planning Service but also from the
                person who owned the land. Congratulations to Jim Wells on the
                outcome of his survey. The survey was carried out in an area
                with which I am not familiar, but if that is what the people
                there want, that is a way forward.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are all in this together, and we must help
                each other. We are debating very sensitive issues. So far
                nothing, or relatively nothing, has been done, or has been seen
                to be done, to overcome the problem. If the Assembly accepts the
                motion, Members can genuinely tackle this blot on the landscape.
                Let us work together to bring about a better environment for all
                in Northern Ireland. Bring our communities with us, and, as Joe
                Byrne has said, let us send out a strong message from the
                Assembly that we will set up this interdepartmental group. There
                is no guarantee that we will overcome the problem, but at least
                we will have tried, with the co-operation of all the Departments
                in the Executive, to tackle it. I hope we will see a better
                future for all in Northern Ireland.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the Programme for Government, we made
                clear our commitment to the creation of a cohesive, inclusive
                and just society and to tackling the problem of poverty. We are
                working to tackle the problems of deprived areas through our New
                TSN policy, objectively identifying the areas that are most
                deprived and focusing our resources and efforts on addressing
                their needs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Programme for Government highlighted the
                action that we would take to regenerate disadvantaged urban and
                rural areas. The Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development
                has published her strategy for rural development and the
                Minister for Social Development has initiated consultation on
                his urban regeneration strategy.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Byrne:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I appreciate the Executive’s efforts in
                this regard. Does the Minister accept that voluntary
                organisations, such as the Society of St Vincent de Paul, the
                Salvation Army and others, do wonderful work to help the many
                needy people in our community? There is a need for strong
                Government action to tackle poverty and social alienation in the
                ghettoised estates in deprived urban areas.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Like the Member, I want to express
                appreciation of the good work that is carried out by the many
                voluntary organisations that assist deprived communities. Much
                of what we have today would not be there had it not been for the
                steadfast service that such organisations have given over the
                years, when there was little hope in those communities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When we published our Programme for
                Government in March, we promised to &quot;identify the most
                deprived urban areas and to deliver a co-ordinated response to
                the social and other needs of people living in them, including
                problems of weak community infrastructure, and the problems
                caused by the effects of the conflict.&quot; Capacity building
                is under way in local communities to enable people to help
                themselves. It is not a matter of pushing aid down from the top
                but of giving people in those deprived communities the skills
                and abilities necessary to allow them to help themselves. That
                is happening in many areas, but there is a long way to go.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The new draft Programme for Government shows
                that we will implement strategies to renew deprived communities,
                including a north Belfast regeneration initiative supported by
                URBAN II and other practical measures to address economic and
                social problems in west Belfast.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Queen’s University of Belfast published
                research last week that showed that three groups had been
                alienated and excluded from society. Those groups were the
                Protestant community, farmers and women. Members of those groups
                in west Tyrone feel especially isolated and alienated. What will
                the Minister do to ensure that such alienation is addressed
                during the next funding period?</p>
                <b>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We all know that our rural community is
                recovering from the trauma of foot-and- mouth disease. We know
                that that community has suffered greatly because of BSE and
                other health scares. It has also suffered from changes in the
                market structure that have brought the profitability of many
                units into question.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Colleague, the Minister of Agriculture and
                Rural Development, has produced proposals which will go some way
                towards assisting farmers. At the moment a major conference is
                taking place in Belfast which is addressing some of the concerns
                of rural communities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member referred also to the Protestant
                community and women, and there is no doubt that there is
                evidence that those groups are in difficulty. North Belfast is
                one area where those difficulties have been focused upon. My
                Department has endeavoured to address the problem in west
                Belfast with its two distinct communities by establishing task
                forces which cover the whole area. For example, one is focused
                on the Shankill area.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Office of the First Minister and the
                Deputy First Minister is currently looking at the north Belfast
                situation to see what mechanisms can be created there. The
                Member will know that his Colleague is engaged in that exercise.
                The combination of the efforts of these Departments will provide
                us with the correct mechanisms for addressing the disconnection
                from mainstream society felt by these groups. It is our
                objective and consistent with the Programme for Government to
                address this.</p>

                (NIHRC) fall short of what is required for the United Nations
                standard? The commission submitted a report to the Secretary of
                State as long ago as February 2001 and has yet to receive a
                response. There is an urgent need to strengthen the
                investigative power of the NIHRC. Will the Office of the First

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Office of the First Minister and the
                Deputy First Minister has not jointly made representations to
                the Secretary of State about the review of the effectiveness of
                the NIHRC. I have, however, personally made clear to the
                Secretary of State the need to ensure that the powers of the
                NIHRC should be brought into line with those of the South of
                Ireland. This will help to ensure compliance with the Paris
                Priniciples of the United Nations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have also made clear my views that the
                NIHRC is a vital new institution deriving from the Good Friday
                Agreement and worthy of proper powers and support.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Following on from the Minister’s statement
                of his dissatisfaction with the NIHRC, will he go further and
                take up the case for proper representation for representatives
                of all the community on the commission?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It seems strange that the two largest
                Unionist parties have no members on the commission. That is
                contrary to the law, which states that the commission should
                reflect all people in the community. Will the Minister assure us
                that the commission will represent us as the law says — not
                only in powers, but also in personnel? It comes as no surprise
                that my party is not represented, but I am surprised that the
                Ulster Unionist Party is not. The NIO knows the religion of my
                people, and it despises it and discriminates against it.</p>

                of State. I am not aware of the requirement to appoint members
                of any party to this, or to any other, commission. I note the
                Member’s comments, and I believe that the Secretary of State
                will exercise proper judgement in ensuring the effective and
                dynamic operation of the commission.</p>

                the Human Rights Commission to put more effort into ensuring
                that the commission focuses on the biggest human rights abusers,
                namely the paramilitary organisations? The commission must do
                all that it can to ensure that the paramilitary organisations,
                which abuse the human rights of the children and people of

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the heart of the Member’s question is
                the way in which a society that abhors paramilitary activity
                strengthens the institutions and strengthens the Human Rights
                Commission as part of the Good Friday Agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a strong case to be made for the
                Secretary of State and all elected representatives to ensure
                that they strengthen that which is good in our society. As a
                result, paramilitary groups’ negative and destructive
                qualities will gradually become more ineffective, they will have
                less hold on our community and the positive elements will be
                able to lead in all sections. That is the greatest contribution
                that we can make.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have also established a liaison group of

                extensive round of meetings with community and elected
                representatives. The senior liaison official reports back to the
                liaison group, which meets frequently. This work will continue
                as a matter of urgency, but it is important to recognise that
                many of the overarching problems experienced by all sections of
                that community are deep- seated and will require an ongoing,
                concerted and co- ordinated effort to resolve them. The events

                interface areas throughout the Province. As in north Belfast,
                the key resolution is dialogue at a local level. We will do all
                that we can to support efforts by local communities to resolve
                their differences. Indeed, in the joint statement that Mr Mallon
                and I issued with the Secretary of State, we said that our
                short-term objective was to establish a mechanism in that area
                to facilitate dialogue, which should be the model for other
                areas. That key area has also been addressed by the ongoing
                review of community relations policy, which is closely related.
                We look forward to accelerating the review to give us the
                necessary means to respond.</p>

                Belfast, will the Minister agree that Portadown has suffered
                similar difficulties over a much longer period? In May 2001, 57
                RUC officers were injured while protecting junior Orangemen from
                attack by Nationalists on the Garvaghy Road. Will he offer
                similar resources to the Portadown area to help with community
                tensions there?</p>

                all sides of the House were appalled at the vicious attacks on
                young boys, and on the police officers who tried to protect
                them, during their parade. The then First Minister exhausted a
                huge amount of time trying to secure a settlement to the
                Drumcree dispute, and I commend him for his efforts.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If there is local support for an initiative
                led by the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First
                Minister, we will certainly do all that we can to reach a
                settlement and to improve community relations in the Portadown
                area. Forums have been suggested. We are prepared to do anything
                we can to help that community and that area.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is no surprise that the Member asked that
                question because of the common issues. It is inevitable that
                people will look at the implications of the north Belfast
                situation for other areas. Indeed, we anticipated such a
                response when we explored the north Belfast initiative. We will
                be very happy to consider any proposals that are made to us.</p>

                Indeed, the Member knows that such an example exists in our own
                constituency. The threat is very clear. As long as people are
                frightened, as many communities are, their areas will experience
                withdrawal from community involvement and those areas will be
                handed over to violent people. However, those situations are
                being manipulated — there is no point in sweeping it under the
                carpet. People see an opportunity and they are shamelessly
                exploiting it to the severe detriment of our entire community.</p>

                what the Executive were seeking to achieve from the resources
                available, but we recognised that the PSAs needed some further
                work and we are committed to that. One way in which we have
                sought to improve PSAs has been to place greater focus on the
                key outputs we wish to achieve and to locate details of actions

                against the commitments in the Programme for Government and the
                PSAs. This approach will allow the Assembly and the public to

                We are also in the process of developing new service delivery
                agreements for every Department, and those will be published.
                They will link the highest level targets in PSAs with actions,
                targets and budgets for improving service delivery. They will

                achieved, an appropriate format for meetings to consider
                institutional or cross- sectoral issues should be found so that

                parties to achieve decommissioning. That is particularly true of
                paramilitary-related parties such as Sinn Féin. Several months
                ago, the then First Minister wrote to the two Sinn Féin
                Ministers to ask for information on what they had done, or were
                doing, to secure decommissioning. Mr Trimble is still awaiting

                which has demonstrated that it is not the best example of what
                is happening in Northern Ireland. Rather than handcuffing the

                are regarded as public bodies. The public sector equality duty

                leisure pursuit, and 4% for football, which is a cross-community
                pursuit. What checks and balances has the Minister put in place
                to ensure that that is corrected and that such blatant
                discrimination does not reoccur in this round of funding?</p>

                ask that question, so I do not know the detail of those figures.
                I repeat my previous answer: all public bodies, including the
                Sports Council for Northern Ireland, which is the funding body
                with responsibility for sporting activity, are required, under
                the Northern Ireland Act 1998, to adhere to their equality
                statements. The Equality Commission is responsible for making
                sure that public bodies do that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If Mr Gibson has examples of cases where
                discrimination has occurred, he must take them to the Sports
                Council for Northern Ireland and the Equality Commission. If he
                wishes, he may also bring those cases to me and my Department to
                allow me to look into the matter further. That is a very serious
                accusation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I must make the point that funding can only
                be given after applications have come forward, and there is
                often a disparity in the applications. That is not the whole
                answer, and it is not the simple answer. If Members have
                suspicions, they should write to myself and to the bodies

                Association (SFA) has been considering making a bid to host the
                European football championships in 2008. Some preliminary work
                has been done, which has indicated that a bid by the SFA would
                be feasible. However, no decision as to whether to submit a bid
                can be taken until the Union des Associations Européennes de
                Football (UEFA) criteria for hosting the championships are
                published. Those criteria will determine whether the facilities
                needed require a joint bid, but even if that were the case,
                there is no expectation at this stage that Northern Ireland
                would be involved.</p>

                Association (IFA), in conjunction with the Minister, use this as
                an opportunity to promote Northern Ireland, which is better
                placed logistically to accommodate a joint bid with Scotland? It
                would give us the opportunity to develop a new stadium, which
                the Province badly needs.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am unaware of approaches made to either the
                Welsh Football Association or the FAI. The IFA is the body
                concerned with football in Northern Ireland, and, therefore,
                that which has any possibility of making a joint bid with the
                SFA. Under the current criteria, UEFA require six stadia with
                capacities of 30,000, one of which must be able to hold 50,000.
                I understand that the SFA can proceed with its bid because it
                has the infrastructure in place and does not need help from
                anyone. Should the criteria change from six stadia to eight or
                10, Scotland might have to look to Wales, the Irish Republic or
                Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no stadium in Northern Ireland that
                comes close to the requirement of 30,000 seats. The biggest is
                Windsor Park, which, I believe, can hold 12,000. If the IFA were
                to go forward with Scotland, and were awarded the bid, with
                support from the Government and this House, there would be time
                to redevelop Windsor Park or to build a new stadium with 30,000
                seats or more. However, that is only speculation at the minute,
                and I cannot react to speculation.</p>

                is its own matter. I agree that there is a need to upgrade a

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall take questions 4 and 7 together.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On my behalf, the Sports Council for Northern
                Ireland commissioned International Motorsports Ltd to undertake
                a study to review the current state of the Province’s existing
                short circuits, and to determine the demand, viability and
                feasibility of establishing a regional motor sport facility.
                Following the report’s publication in August, the Sports
                Council has engaged in a consultation process to gauge the
                reponse of the key partners to the report. An initial
                consultation with governing bodies of the related sports
                revealed that there was an overriding need to consider the
                principal recommendations in the context of a newly developed
                strategic plan for all motor sport activities — namely cars,
                on- and off-road motorcycling and karts.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In response, the Sports Council has agreed to
                facilitate a strategic planning process for two- and
                four-wheeled sports. A working group is currently being
                established to advance the strategic plan. The group will
                comprise representatives of all motor sport governing bodies,
                local authority recreation departments and Government
                Departments, and will draw upon expert advisors. In the course
                of the planning process, it is anticipated that the strategic
                plan will be completed by the start of 2002. The Sports Council
                will then advise me on how best to deal with the issue.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Paisley Jnr:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although I welcome that the Minister has had
                the initiative to commission a report, not everyone will agree
                with its conclusions, as many gaps have been identified.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What is the Minister’s view on the
                Aghadowey short circuit, which was mentioned in the report? He
                knows that Bishopscourt and Kirkistown have been identified as
                potentially good training beds for short circuit riders.
                However, the other courses in Northern Ireland would then face
                becoming run down, or even possible closure. Given that
                Bishopscourt is for sale — it faces many planning problems,
                and is far away from major roads and a major hospital — and
                given that Aghadowey is located close to those facilities, will
                the Minister look at the possibility of developing a training
                ground short circuit for Northern Ireland at Aghadowey? Is he
                prepared to assist that club — and, indeed, any club that
                seeks his support — in making an application to the Foundation
                for Sports and the Arts or to the lottery fund to help it
                realise its goal of providing better motor sport facilities for
                the Province?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGimpsey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Paisley is aware of how this process
                evolved — and it has been an evolving process. It began with
                work for the Motor Cycle Union of Ireland on the eight road
                circuits for motorbikes, and how we made those circuits safer.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As an adjunct, we looked at the four existing
                short circuits. Following on from that, we looked at the
                possibility of a new, purpose-built motorsport facility for the
                region. Those are the three steps, and each one is still very
                much in play. Recommendations have been made. For example, the
                Motor Cycle Union of Ireland task force report has resulted in
                the allocation by my Department of resources and support for
                safety work on various circuits. Money has been spent on Dundrod
                and the North West 200, and funding has been earmarked for
                Carrowdore and Tandragee. Cookstown has also benefited.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We looked at the four short circuits, one of
                which is Aghadowey. Around £2·3 million was needed to upgrade
                the circuits to an acceptable standard. The regional motorsport
                facility would cost between £20 million to £30 million. This
                is purely a report, and it is now a matter for the various
                motorsport organisations to determine what part of the report
                — all of it, some of it, or none of it — they wish to go
                forward with.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to Aghadowey, the recommendation
                was to apply to two circuits as an economic imperative. However,
                if you spend £20 million to £30 million on a brand new
                motorsport facility can you then justify having four short
                circuits upgraded at a cost of £2·3 million each, which will
                take business away from it? The Member has pointed to
                competition and the difficulties at Bishopscourt.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am willing to progress all initiatives and
                give what support I can, as regards applications for lottery and
                Sports Council funding. However, the process is still underway
                and the strategic review of the various motorsports will
                determine what they see as their priorities. My job, through the
                Sports Council, will be to support them rather than dictate what
                they should be doing for their sport.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is the Minister aware of a proposal to
                develop a major multi-faceted motorsport facility at Kilroot in
                the Carrickfergus area? Does he agree that that is probably one
                of the best strategically placed proposals before his Department
                at present? In what way would his Department be prepared to
                assist such a project?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGimpsey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am well aware of the Kilroot proposal —
                indeed, Mr Neeson brought it to my attention some time ago. I
                must point out that there are proposals in other areas as well.
                I am prepared to give support, but I must first hear the plan
                for the future from the motorsports organisations. That is where
                the strategic plan, which they are currently working on, comes
                in. They should report by the end of this year or early next
                year, and then we will know better.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not know whether they will express an
                option on this proposal, and I cannot predict exactly what they
                are going to say. As I said in response to the previous
                question, it is a matter for the motorsport organisations to
                strategise the way forward for their sport. It will then be a
                matter for the Sports Council to give them support, and for me
                to give the Sports Council the support that it requires. In this
                way, we will all see the sport develop in the way that we want.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Has the Minister read the International Motor
                Sport Ltd (IMS) report on motorsports in Northern Ireland and
                does he agree with the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure’s
                expressed opinion of total support for road racing in Northern
                Ireland? A purpose built motorsport centre for Northern Ireland
                cannot cater for road racing.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGimpsey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is self-evident that road racing is
                different from short circuit racing. I have said in the past
                that road racing is a sport that, for whatever reason, people
                from this country appear to be very good at — we excel at it.
                It is also a highly dangerous sport. That is one reason why my
                Department has managed to obtain resources to devote to road
                racing circuits. We have been successful in providing support to
                Cookstown, mid-Antrim, the North West 200, and giving a money
                commitment to Tandragee and Carrowdore.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is the situation at present. The sport
                has to determine how it will go forward. Members are aware —
                for example, Mr Shannon has written to me about the Carrowdore
                race — of the requirement under the safety scheme that roads
                be closed for practice the previous day. That causes conflict
                with residents who are prepared to accept closed roads for one
                day, but not for two. Those are issues for the clubs and the
                local communities to consider, because the clubs can only
                sustain their events with the support of the local communities.</p>

                for the local museums sector in the context of the local museums
                and heritage review. At present, the Northern Ireland Museums
                Council is the main channel for central Government support to
                regional and local museums, including those in Newry and Armagh,
                through its grants programme and its role in providing training
                and guidance on improving standards, both in visitor services

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recognising the importance of close working

                established a cultural forum to bring together district councils
                and a range of other relevant public bodies. The forum has
                provided direct assistance to district councils in preparing
                cultural strategies in the context of local integrated plans.</p>

                that district councils are to have an enhanced role in the
                provision and development of regional museums. However, does the
                Minister agree that that is difficult when resources are so
                splintered? The Northern Ireland Museums Council is a very small
                source of funding for many of the museums, and the Heritage
                Lottery Fund, Co-operation Ireland, the Millennium Fund and
                various other sources have helped to develop the network. Is it
                not time to have a more coherent funding policy, not just for
                local regional museums but for other such institutions in
                Northern Ireland?</p>

                However, there are approximately 400 local museums and heritage
                centres in Northern Ireland, and we cannot fund them all. In
                addition, the National Museums and Galleries of Northern
                Ireland, which runs the main museum campuses — Cultra, Omagh,

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is a matter of determining resources and
                priorities. One way forward is through the cultural forum, which
                aims to encourage local authorities to develop local strategies
                that promote the cultural well-being of an area and its people
                to enable the sharing of good practice and to monitor and
                evaluate local strategies. The Northern Ireland Museums Council
                provides a small element of grant support, but, more
                importantly, it provides expertise and help with the
                preservation, assembly, presentation and marketing of small,

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The problem at Navan has been well rehearsed.
                It is owned by a board of trustees, which has appointed a board
                of directors to run the centre for it. It is not in the
                ownership, or under the control, of the Department. We have made
                strenuous efforts in the past months to ensure continuity and,
                since the centre’s closure, to ensure that it reopens.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am confident that the Navan Fort heritage
                centre will reopen. Navan Fort is an archaeological exhibit of
                enormous importance. It is one of the most important artefacts
                on the island of Ireland and, therefore, access to it needs to
                be restored and enhanced.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The trustees currently, through their board
                of directors, have advertised for expressions of interest. When
                they are in a position to give us further information, they will
                do so. I will be happy to write to Mrs Nelis on the latest
                position when I hear what the developments are. There has been
                interest from some bodies and if some of that comes to fruition
                it will enhance the Navan experience for the visitor and make an
                important contribution to our cultural life.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bretwalda — or Brytenwalda as they are
                less commonly known — were Saxon kings who claimed, and were
                acknowledged to be, over-kings of the southern English kingdoms.
                They had no formal connection with Ireland. The British imperium
                refers to the concept of the Bretwalda having the right to rule
                not only over their own local areas but also, by extension, to
                have influence over a much wider area. As part of its major
                programme, The People’s Story, national museums and galleries
                in Northern Ireland are dealing with all aspects of the history
                of Ulster and of Ireland. This brief includes the ancient Ulster
                kings and the relationship, where such existed, between Ireland
                and the British monarchy to the present day. The Making of
                Ireland is a display sub-programme of The People’s Story. Its
                object is to communicate The People’s Story through a major
                long term exhibition that will deal with the evolution of the
                landscape and environment and development of industry.
                Nevertheless the Bretwalda does not appear to be appropriate to
                The People’s Story and therefore does not form part of the
                programme.</p>

                also the right of the old Pictish or Cruthin kings to rule not
                only in Scotland but in Ireland. Are there any plans in the
                Columba initiative to bring this fact to the fore?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Without wishing to develop an academic
                argument in the Chamber, my understanding is that Bretwalda
                relates specifically to the Heptarchy, which were the seven
                Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of England and were not in that respect a
                part of either Pictish or Celtic life. That would be the
                official academic interpretation of Bretwalda. However, I am
                happy to raise the issue of the initiative that Dr Adamson has
                referred to, because it could be that there is another side to

                inclusive bid that will reflect a broad and creative
                interpretation of culture. To date, Imagine Belfast 2008 has

                individuals, groups and organisations to raise awareness, gather
                ideas and encourage creative thinking in regard to the bid. A

                demonstration projects to promote awareness of the bid and to

                process that has widespread support. MLAs may wish to know that,

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since May 2001, I have kept the EU political
                situation regarding BSE under review to assess whether the
                climate is right to rekindle our case with the EU. One of the
                cornerstones of our case is the low incidence of BSE in Northern
                Ireland. Since May, we have been engaged in a number of surveys
                of different categories of cattle with the aim of verifying the
                true incidence of the disease in them. Those surveys are still
                in the early stages, but the initial results are encouraging.
                However, it is likely to be a few months before comparative
                results are available in the rest of the EU. Until they are
                available, it is unlikely that we will be able to persuade other
                EU countries of the strength of our case. As I have said on a
                number of occasions to the Assembly, I remain fully committed to
                having the export ban in Northern Ireland relaxed, and I will

                there is a much lower incidence of BSE than in the Republic of
                Ireland, Portugal and other EU countries, that Northern Ireland
                is still not allowed to export beef. Clearly the iron was not
                struck when it was hot last year, and we do not want to make the
                same mistake this year. We want to see progress made on this

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thought that I had explained that, but I
                will reiterate it. As the Member is aware, since I became
                Minister I have worked hard to get low-incidence status for
                Northern Ireland. However, I have no control over events in
                Europe, and events have worked to my disadvantage and to the
                disadvantage of the industry. Because of the panic in Europe
                over the incidence of BSE in various European countries some
                time ago, I was advised by the commissioner, and others in
                Europe, that it would be better not to press the case at that
                time. I explained that to the House. At present, since there is
                a screening operation going on across Europe, there is no
                possibility of the European Union considering our case until the
                exact figures and the results of our screening tests are known.
                That will not be until the end of the year, as it will take six
                months to do the necessary screening. At that point the other
                European countries will have finished their screening, and it
                will then be possible to make a comparison to see where we
                stand. Those matters are not within my influence to change. As
                soon as the time is right, and as soon as we have a good case to
                make, I will be making it.</p>

                Ireland, to reactivate the measures it took earlier this year.
                These are designed to protect all susceptible species, and by
                their very nature they protect rare breeds of cattle and pigs.
                However, if the disease were to manifest itself in or near a
                rare breed herd, I would have to take the advice of my Chief
                Veterinary Officer as to what action needed to be taken with
                that herd to prevent the wider spread of the disease. That might
                include slaughter.</p>

                people in the farming community can exit from farming and those
                who wish to commence farming could enter the farming community.

                disadvantaged as they have been by lack of transport and
                difficulty of access to hospitals and other facilities.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The grazing ban imposed on 114 farmers in the
                Silent Valley and the lack of availabile grazing land has placed
                them at an extreme disadvantage, particularly at a time when
                farmers are suffering from the effects of foot-and-mouth
                disease. Does the Minister agree that such a ban has an enormous
                impact on local farmers and that the ban should be removed? Will
                the Minister have urgent talks with the Minister for Regional
                Development and impress upon him the economic consequences of
                that ban on those 114 farmers and on the local community? The
                matter must be addressed as a matter of urgency.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with Mr McGrady that there is little
                doubt that the grazing ban has put the farmers concerned at a
                disadvantage since they have been obliged to make alternative
                arrangements for both the land itself and the feeding. The
                impact of this varies according to individual circumstances.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I cannot comment on the possible removal of
                the ban, as that decision rests with the Minister for Regional
                Development, other than to say that we all recognise that the
                ban was imposed because of the risk to public health, a
                consideration that is paramount when its removal is being
                considered. I plan to have a meeting with the Minister as soon
                as possible. My officials have been in discussions, and this
                will take place as soon as it is practical.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I cannot deal with individual areas at this
                point. It is for people to make proposals. Regarding the areas
                to be covered, forests influence many areas of our lives,
                including climate change, the economy, the environment and the
                opportunity for recreational and other activities. Forests
                occupy only a small part of Northern Ireland, and a policy will
                focus on the areas that are of most importance to us.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a guiding principle, we should try to get
                as much value out of the existing forests as possible to get an
                acceptable return on the investment of our parents’
                generation. However, at the same time we should make proper
                provision to hand on an adequate area of forest to meet the
                needs of our children.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The review will address fundamental
                questions, including the amount of forestry we need, where a new
                forest should be planted, and what kind of forest we should
                plant as existing forests are replaced. We have to determine how
                we want to achieve this and how we will pay for it.</p>

                Minister spoke about new forests being planted. Will the farmers
                and landowners in the Strangford area also be able to take

                the outbreak, and what lessons can be learned from our

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since the Member last asked the question, on
                22 January 2001, several measures have been implemented. Inside
                Parliament Buildings, portable induction loops have been
                installed at the east, west and main entrance reception desks,
                the post office, the gift shop, the basement and visitors’
                restaurants and the Library. Two additional portable induction
                loops are available for meetings. Four text phones are being
                installed to enable profoundly deaf people to make contact with
                the Northern Ireland Assembly. A hearing helper education pack,
                which includes six receivers with headphones, is available for
                use by Assembly tour guides to assist visitors who have hearing
                difficulties.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An extensive staff training programme on deaf
                and hard-of-hearing awareness and signing communication tactics
                has been completed. It will enable staff who deal with members
                of the public to communicate effectively. Doorkeepers have been
                given fire warden training, with particular emphasis on dealing
                with visitors who have varying degrees of ability.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The appointed health and safety specialist
                has proposed an extensive list of projects to comply with the
                Disability Discrimination Act 1995.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly Commission is considering the
                following programme of works: provision of disabled access at
                the front of the Building and in the reception area;
                improvements to the facilities in the basement restaurant; fixed
                induction loop systems in the Long Gallery, Senate Chamber and
                Committee rooms to assist persons with hearing difficulties;
                improvements to signage and visibility at staircases;
                improvements to passenger lifts; improved access to the basement
                restaurant; and chairlifts to the staircases leading to the
                Public Galleries of the Assembly Chamber.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is hoped that the programme of works will
                be approved and implemented over a 12-to-18-month period. The
                Building will then be as fully equipped as possible, given its
                listed status, to meet the needs of both visitors and staff with
                disabilities. The Assembly Commission is very aware of its
                responsibilities to ensure that all users of the Building,
                whether they be able-bodied or have some form of disability,
                have access to all parts of Parliament Buildings. Finally, I
                emphasise that the Assembly Commission is mindful that the third
                tranche of duties under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995
                come into force in 2004.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the improvements that have already
                taken place. I would like some more detail on the timescale for
                outstanding issues, particularly access. While there is an
                induction loop system in the shop, it is still not accessible,
                either from the front or side doors, for anybody who is
                physically disabled. What is the timescale for that and what, if
                any, further training will be given to staff?</p>

                and Rural Development, of which I am Chairperson, has met for
                more hours than any other Committee. The Committee is unable to
                meet this Friday, and no room with the necessary facilities is
                available to allow the Committee to meet on Thursday. Will the
                Member take that back to the Commission and look at the
                arrangements for when a Committee wants to change its meeting
                for just one day because of certain business that all members of

                <font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
                </font></b><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In accordance with paragraph 20 of strand 1
                of the Belfast Agreement, the Executive agreed a draft Programme
                for Government on 20 September, incorporating the draft Budget
                agreed at the same meeting. We are therefore laying the
                programme before the Assembly for scrutiny, and for future
                approval after examination by the Committees.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today’s statement also represents the start
                of a consultation process on those specific proposals, and
                continues the wider consultation begun on 18 June 2001 when the
                position report on developing the Programme for Government and
                the Budget was presented to the Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Programme for Government therefore sets
                the context for our budgetary decisions and for the development
                of the Budget which will be presented to the Assembly tomorrow
                by the Minister of Finance and Personnel.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We all desire a peaceful, inclusive,
                prosperous, stable and fair society. The Programme for
                Government is the Executive’s assessment of what must be done
                to achieve that vision. We have to start from our current
                position, which involves many challenges.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In many aspects of life in Northern Ireland,
                however, there is also much of a positive nature to report. Our
                economic performance as a region, for example, has been much
                stronger over recent years. Several key indicators, including
                employment, manufacturing output and unemployment, perform
                consistently well. Our unemployment levels are no longer high in
                comparison with many other areas. Our short-term unemployment is
                down to the UK average, which in itself is well below the EU
                average. A few years ago few would have predicted that Northern
                Ireland would become one of Europe’s low unemployment regions,
                but that is now the case.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have reason to be proud of our education
                system. A higher than ever proportion of our young people
                achieved very good GCSE and A-level results, and the proportion
                of young people leaving school or college with no qualification
                is now lower than it is in England. We can also boast a higher
                rate of participation in third- level education than that in
                most other parts of the United Kingdom.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Parts of our infrastructure, such as ports,
                airports and telecommunications, are also of good quality,
                although more can — and should — be done.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We still face, however, a wide range of
                social, economic and environmental challenges. Many of them are
                already well known. Long-term unemployment is declining more
                slowly than we would like. Wage levels are still lower than in
                most other regions of the UK, and too many outside the labour
                force are neither in work nor regard themselves as unemployed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Despite good progress over recent years in
                developing high-tech industry, we remain overdependent and
                reliant on traditional sectors and on the public sector. After
                decades of underinvestment in our economic infrastructure we
                need to accelerate the pace of improvement. I will say some
                significant things about that later.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition, our rural economy faces severe
                problems. Those have been evident for several years but have
                been exaggerated in the past year by the impact of
                foot-and-mouth disease. While we have been fortunate in having
                only four isolated cases, we cannot relax our guard,
                particularly while outbreaks continue in Great Britain. We have
                to turn to the challenge of creating a new, broader base for the
                rural economy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are not bowed down by those challenges. We
                all know the range and nature of the problems, and we know that
                we have to face up to these realities. However, we know now that
                by working together we can — and do — make a real
                difference.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was with these challenges in mind that the
                Executive revisited the five broad priorities endorsed by the
                Assembly in March: growing as a community; working for a
                healthier people; investing in education and skills; securing a
                competitive economy, and developing North/South, east/west and
                international relations. Our conclusion was that they remain
                valid and that they should continue to set the direction for its
                work.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have, however, made several important
                changes to the document we now present to the Assembly. We have,
                for example, worked to redefine many of the sub-priorities that
                support our five priorities and have introduced some new
                sub-priorities — for example, on children, accident prevention
                and culture and the arts — to reflect work, both new and
                ongoing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have published new draft public service
                agreements for each Department. Those now incorporate a stronger
                focus on high-level targets and performance, giving an improved
                sense of what each Department is working to achieve in the
                services it provides to the public.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The draft programme contains fewer specific
                actions than the first Programme for Government did. These
                actions will build on — not replace — the commitments we
                have already pledged to deliver. However, all of the more than
                250 actions set out in the first programme remain valid and
                relevant. Work is continuing to ensure that all of them are
                delivered; an annex in today’s report shows the current state
                of progress.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive’s priorities are set out in
                the draft programme. We want to secure a dynamic and competitive
                economy that creates opportunities for everyone in a wide range
                of sectors with many more skilled jobs in the new
                knowledge-based economy. We are making good progress. Industrial
                output is 22% above the level it was three years ago when the
                Belfast Agreement was signed. In comparison, output in Great
                Britain is below its level of three years ago. More than 90% of
                the new jobs promoted by the IDB in the past year were in the
                high-tech and knowledge-intensive sectors of telecommunications,
                electronics and international traded services.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The draft Programme for Government recognises
                the ever-present challenge of global competition and the current
                more difficult economic climate that is beginning to impact on
                us here. Our economy has stood up well to the difficulties of
                recent years, but we all recognise that these difficulties are
                multiplying.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our response will be in three areas. First,
                we will continue to work to increase investment in knowledge and
                create the environment in which firms can compete more
                effectively. Invest Northern Ireland will spearhead work on key
                aspects of that task. The chairperson and shadow board have been
                appointed and the appointment of its chief executive is due next
                month. We will also maintain our focus on innovation and
                research and development through the Northern Ireland R&amp;D
                and innovation strategy by working to stimulate private sector
                investment, developing local industrial design capacity and
                harnessing research and support strengths in our universities
                and further education colleges.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, we need to reverse the
                deterioration in the quality and reliability of our
                infrastructure that is the result of years of underinvestment.
                The provision of infrastructure services such as public
                transport, roads, water and sewerage are essential for the
                economic and social well-being of our economy. Hence, we will
                ensure that our infrastructure supports economic growth, and we
                will tackle the deficiencies that we identified in the draft
                programme with purpose and vigour.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The programme includes important proposals
                for realising our aim. Last Friday, I announced that the
                Executive had decided that two major gas pipeline projects would
                receive Government support up to a maximum of £38 million over
                the next six years. The Irish Government will make a
                contribution of up to IR£10 million towards that total. The
                pipelines to the north-west and the south will bring North Sea
                gas to more than three quarters of our population and businesses
                and they will protect the security of supply by providing a
                second link to Great Britain via the Republic. This national
                resource will potentially be available to most people in
                Northern Ireland, just as it is to people in the rest of the UK.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition, the draft programme undertakes
                to support transport by addressing improvement to strategic
                routes including the important trans-European network route from
                Larne through Belfast to the border near Newry. I am also
                pleased to announce that the Executive have allocated £40
                million to the project. That includes funds to complete the
                dualling scheme for the A8 road to Larne, the dualling of the
                Newry section of the proposed Newry to Dundalk road and a
                significant contribution to the upgrading of the Westlink that
                the Minister for Regional Development announced last week.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This major investment will strengthen the
                competitiveness of the ports of Belfast and Larne and will help
                to improve the integration of our economy with those of our
                neighbours in Great Britain and in the Republic.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thirdly, the programme focuses on developing
                key skills to meet the needs of our economy and on creating
                higher vocational programmes that will focus on education and
                training programmes and on getting more people with the right
                skills into employment. The task force on employability will
                have a key role working alongside Government Departments and the
                skills task force. We are indebted to Dr Farren and his
                Colleagues in the Department for Employment and Learning for
                their efforts in that area.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are also committed to regenerating the
                rural economy and to enabling the agrifood sector to respond to
                the challenges presented by changing consumer demands and
                increasing competition. Despite a slight recovery in
                agricultural income in 2000, incomes remain historically low.
                That is mainly as a result of the weak euro and low world
                prices. This year has been particularly difficult, mainly
                because of the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in Great
                Britain, which also hit the tourism and hospitality industries.
                Therefore we shall develop an action plan for the strategic
                development of the agrifood industry over the next decade and
                for stimulating alternative sources of employment in the
                countryside, such as tourism.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Much of our vision can only be delivered by
                the private sector — it knows its businesses. The private
                sector has the task of creating competitive firms. However,
                Government can support that approach; we can create the economic
                environment, supported by a good-quality infrastructure.
                Therefore our vision is of a true private- public partnership
                for driving change. The same partnership is envisaged for the
                rural economy, for which we must also form a new basis. We must
                help the rural population to develop new skills and
                opportunities to sustain their way of life and to sustain the
                countryside that we value so much.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to resources, the draft Programme
                for Government has informed and shaped our budgetary proposals;
                these will be presented separately to the Assembly. However, it
                is important to bear in mind the context of our current
                budgetary situation. Our financial allocations for 2002-03 are
                finite. As the Treasury is not conducting a national spending
                review this year, the Northern Ireland departmental expenditure
                limit remains fixed. It is against that background that we have
                developed the draft programme.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, the indicative Budget for 2002-03
                reflects a substantial rise in public spending — over 3% above
                the general rate of inflation; it is also above the rate of wage
                increases in the public sector. That builds on the 5·5%
                increase above general inflation this year. Given the problems
                facing many public services, the growth is welcome. However, it
                falls short of the amounts necessary to meet all expectations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In many areas, notably in the Health Service,
                it is clear that there is real and sustained growth in the
                demand for services. The trend in pay and price increases also
                tends to exceed the general rate of inflation. These are
                challenges that the Executive must face when it allocates
                resources. The reviews of needs and effectiveness that are being
                undertaken across a series of major spending programmes will
                help to guide us towards an optimum allocation of resources in
                future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are also examining the Barnett formula. It
                is only fair that expenditure in the United Kingdom is
                distributed in relation to need. The present Barnett formula
                clearly acts against that principle by generating a convergence
                in per capita spending across the UK. However, it is essential
                that we ensure, and are seen to ensure, that our resources are
                used to the best effect in our policy priorities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Finance and Personnel is
                engaged in an exercise to ensure that the question of the
                Barnett formula is drawn to the attention of Treasury
                Colleagues. He is conscious of the need to ensure that where we
                have a genuine need and demand that is greater than that which
                exists in other areas, it is reflected in the resources that are
                given to Northern Ireland by the Treasury.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have outlined the context in which we have
                undertaken the review and rolling forward of the Executive
                Programme for Government. Mr Séamus Mallon will now outline in
                more detail the content of the remainder of the programme.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Séamus Mallon MP:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey has set out the backdrop
                against which we have developed the Programme for Government. I
                wish to add to his assessment. In particular, I want to
                highlight the progress we have made, along with some of the key
                commitments we have given, especially under the priorities ‘Growing
                as a Community’, ‘Working for a Healthier People’ and ‘Developing
                North/South, East/West and International Relations’. Finally,
                I want to outline the arrangements for consultation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Programme for Government represents a
                contract involving the Executive, the Assembly and the people of
                Northern Ireland, mapping out a new, agreed direction. It
                demonstrates how we can work together — across parties, across
                Departments and with other organisations and Administrations —
                to make a positive difference to the lives of everyone in
                Northern Ireland. It represents the essence of the purpose of
                devolution. It should be the focus of our discussions, debates
                and actions. The extent to which the Programme for Government is
                overshadowed by other disputes and problems is a measure of the
                failure to implement the agreement properly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Cohesion, inclusion and justice are themes
                which underpin the implementation of all our programmes and
                policies. Our vision is of a just society, where everyone enjoys
                equality of opportunity, and where we, as an Administration,
                actively promote equality of opportunity and adhere to
                international standards of human rights.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The past year has, of course, been a
                difficult one for the Executive. We have struggled with
                instability and, at times, with seemingly overwhelming political
                problems — problems that had to be faced but which have
                inevitably drawn us away from much-needed work on economic and
                social policies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the same time, we have continued the work
                of building up the new institutions in Northern Ireland and on
                the island of Ireland. The Executive have sought to work
                together, but have faced the problem of the non- attendance of
                two Ministers. While they have sought to limit the Executive’s
                role in providing funds for their policies and programmes, we
                have been successful in ensuring that the Executive’s views
                and decisions are taken account of, whether in relation to free
                transport, the future of the ports or the roads programme.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, despite those problems our
                commitment is unchanged. We must start with high ideals, with
                vision, and then throw ourselves into the hard work. We must be
                realistic and learn how to work together. I believe that as an
                Administration we are finding our way through.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will set out some of our key areas of
                activity. The Programme for Government commits us to tackling
                unjust discrimination through strong leadership, coupled with
                effective legislation where necessary. We have already launched
                the process of consultation on a Single Equality Bill, which
                will harmonise anti-discrimination law and extend it into new
                categories, including age.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the same time, we realise that we have to
                improve community relations. We plan to put a cross-cutting
                strategy in place to deal with sectarian and racial intimidation
                manifested in conflict in interface areas, sectarian graffiti
                and unauthorised flag flying. Those are the most difficult,
                sensitive and intractable issues, revealing and worsening the
                deep and painful divisions in our society. We must tackle them.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.30 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We will continue to forge ahead with the
                needs of victims. In 2002 we plan to appoint a commissioner for
                children and initiate the development of a 10-year strategy for
                children and young people. We will step up dialogue with
                organisations representing older people to better identify their
                changing needs and consider better ways to tailor and deliver
                our services to them. We particularly welcome input from the
                Assembly on this. Let it be creative, robust and unremitting. We
                also welcome input from other interested bodies on this issue.
                We are increasing training and employment support for people
                with disabilities, and have established a fund in support of
                ethnic minority voluntary organisations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Poverty continues to blight the lives of
                individuals and whole communities. Eighteen per cent of children
                under 16 live in homes that are in receipt of income support.
                Poor people are disadvantaged in many ways. They get sick more
                often and die younger than those who are better off. The life
                expectancy of a member of the Travelling community is almost 20
                years less than that of someone in the settled community. They
                may have difficulty accessing services that others take for
                granted. Children from disadvantaged backgrounds are less likely
                to do well at school. Through our New TSN action plans and
                policy we have established powerful systems to change policies
                and programmes, and help us build a more equal society, focusing
                on efforts and resources to address the inequalities of our
                poorest people.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For many the best route out of poverty is a
                job with a decent wage. That is why our New TSN policy has a
                particular focus on tackling unemployment and increasing
                employability. We have now established the task force on
                employability and long-term unemployment under the leadership of
                the Minister for Employment and Learning. It is particularly
                concerned with the problems of people who have been out of work
                for a year or more and with geographic and community
                differentials in unemployment. The programme also includes a
                commitment to help ex-prisoners overcome barriers to
                reintegration.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In ‘Working for a Healthier People’ the
                draft programme recognises that a wide range of factors
                influences health. Since our first programme was published we
                have made important progress in building a cross-departmental
                approach to improving the health of our people through the ‘Investing
                for Health’ process, which will result in setting a higher
                number of level targets for health improvement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We also recognise the need to promote public
                safety and have set out the steps we have taken to reduce
                accidents at home, on the roads and in the workforce. Accidents
                are the single greatest cause of death in children under five.
                The impact is felt most among those who are disadvantaged. Every
                year around 150 people are killed on our roads, and another
                12,000 injured. Work-related deaths are two and a half times the
                national average. In our draft programme we commit ourselves to
                taking action across Departments and with other bodies to reduce
                these figures.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We will also maintain our efforts to contain
                waiting lists, address workforce shortages and increase the
                intake of student nurses. We have initiated consultation on the
                Hayes report on acute hospitals, and expect to take decisions by
                the end of next year on the future of our acute hospital
                services. In many areas, but especially in health, there is a
                real and sustained growth in demand for services. Given scarce
                resources, legitimate public expectations cannot always be met.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That will be a major concern for the
                Executive in the coming years. We will continue to focus on
                ensuring high-quality education for all, and we have made
                important progress in laying the necessary foundations at
                pre-school and primary school levels. We are on our way to
                delivering our promise that we will provide one year of free
                pre-school education for every child whose parents wish it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">By April 2002 there will be places for at
                least 86% of those children. The draft programme commits us to
                bringing forward proposals for the future structure of
                post-primary education, which will be informed by the responses
                to the consultation exercise that is currently under way. We are
                determined to continue our work to help those in work to update
                and improve their education and skills.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That challenge is great, because 19% of the
                existing workforce have few or no formal qualifications, and 24%
                of our adult population perform at the lowest levels of
                literacy. In the agreement unique structures were established to
                provide a new basis for relationships within the island of
                Ireland, the United Kingdom and east/west. It is essential for
                the sake of the agreement that all of those structures be
                allowed to work.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In delivering the Programme for Government we
                must look beyond the boundaries of Northern Ireland. The
                development of the global economy, the influence of the European
                Union and the global nature of many policy issues, such as the
                environment, which in essence know no boundaries, require us to
                work on a broader front if we are to deliver government that
                makes a difference.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our fifth priority is therefore to build
                around the need to shape a society that will develop
                relationships and interact successfully and effectively with its
                neighbours on this island, throughout Britain, with other
                nations in Europe, North America and further afield. We have
                made good progress in many areas by building on the structures
                agreed in the Good Friday Agreement. For example, co-operation
                within the United Kingdom, within this island and between the
                islands following the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease proved
                enormously effective in helping us to control the situation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have made progress with the establishment
                of the six implementation bodies. Tourism Ireland Limited and
                InterTradeIreland contribute to employment here. Important
                strategic decisions on energy and communication have been taken
                outside the implementation bodies, and we will benefit from
                enhanced cross-border co-operation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have agreed a new structural funds
                programme with the European Commission and established a
                dedicated office in Brussels. We are committed to raising the
                positive profile of Northern Ireland in Europe, and we will
                initiate a programme of events designed to promote a positive
                international image of Northern Ireland. Our draft Programme for
                Government also recognises that the Executive’s priorities
                cannot be delivered by Departments working in isolation, so we
                remain committed to working together.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The programme also commits us to working more
                effectively to improve services and to ensure value for money.
                We will continue to monitor progress, with quarterly reports
                being made available to the Assembly. The majority of actions
                are on target for completion, and slippage has been reported in
                just 30 out of the 250.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Public service agreements and new service
                delivery agreements will open the work of Departments up to
                further scrutiny. E-government will also be used to improve
                services. We will continue to look for ways of working more
                effectively across Departments and policy areas. Joined-up
                government is vital, not for the sake of it but to make a
                difference to people’s lives.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With the children’s fund come proposals for
                a commissioner for children with interdepartmental groups such
                as those in public health. With interdepartmental work under way
                on sustainable development, and a task force on employability,
                we are already moving in that direction.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The new Executive programme funds have also
                consolidated our work to promote a cross-border approach to
                problem solving. We plan to make further allocations from these
                in the coming weeks. As I have recognised, if we are to achieve
                the challenges of the Programme for Government, we cannot do it
                alone. One of the key roles that the Assembly will play will be
                through its careful scrutiny in Committee of our plans and
                proposals as set out in the draft Programme for Government. This
                programme will also give opportunities for debate in the Chamber
                on both the Programme for Government and the Budget. The debates
                are likely to take place in October and November. On a personal
                level, it is the type of opportunity that the Assembly will, and
                should, take to ensure that the views of Assembly Members are
                known and that the Programme for Government is a programme not
                just for the Executive but also for the Assembly and the people
                it serves.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today’s statement is also the start of a
                wider process of consultation. We will circulate the draft
                Programme for Government widely among our social partners in
                business, trade unions and the voluntary and community sectors,
                and we will make it available to other interested individuals
                and groups. We will also use several mechanisms, including
                seminars involving key stakeholders, to encourage discussion and
                debate on our proposals and on the extent to which they can help
                promote equality of opportunity and good relations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recognising the links between our policy
                proposals and decisions on financial allocations, this process
                will allow both the draft Programme for Government and the draft
                Budget proposals to be considered together. It is important that
                the Executive receive responses to the consultation to help
                inform decisions to be taken later this year. We have no doubt
                that Members will play their part, as they have done in the
                past, by looking carefully and constructively at this draft
                programme and letting us have their views. We hope too that
                Members will encourage their constituents to become more
                involved and communicative in the process of discussion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In conclusion, the process of agreeing the
                Programme for Government and the draft Budget that will support
                its implementation has not been easy. With limited resources we
                have had to make many difficult decisions. The crucial thing is
                that the decisions — difficult though they may be — are
                being made by elected and locally accountable politicians. It is
                a responsibility, a duty and a privilege that we should not
                easily throw away. We commend the Programme for Government to
                the Assembly.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the statements by the acting First

                programme in the areas of health and education. I am also
                pleased that the roads problem has been taken into account —
                the flyovers and underpasses on the motorway and the road
                between Newry and Dundalk — because that will have a huge
                effect on our economic development. I welcome the statement in
                principle. However, there is one aspect of the Programme for
                Government that I thought was important when it was first
                developed last year — the review of public administration.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Neither Minister mentioned it in his
                statement today. Has it been forgotten about, or has progress
                been made? I am concerned about the position regarding local
                government. Many councils in Northern Ireland do not know what
                the future holds for them and therefore cannot plan ahead. I

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive decided some time ago that a
                review of all public services, including local government, would
                be appropriate. A major part of that review concerns the Health
                Service. The Hayes report put forward significant proposals and
                it is one of the component parts that will be fed into this
                process.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am familiar with the Member’s concerns
                regarding local government, and I am aware of the uncertainties
                that any period of change brings about. In the past few months,
                the Minister of the Environment has raised the issue with his
                Executive Colleagues. He is anxious to proceed. However, we are
                trying to take all parts of the public service into account and
                we cannot do that on a piecemeal basis. Members continuously
                urge us to ensure joined-up government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The advent of devolution creates a changed
                set of circumstances within which many of the public services
                are administered. The most obvious are the health and education
                services, which have been running without devolution since March
                1972. Local government dates from a similar period. Things have
                moved on. With devolution now in place, it is appropriate that
                this review proceeds. Some work has already been done by the
                Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister
                regarding the themes and scope of the review. It has not been
                forgotten, and we will pursue it as quickly as possible.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the statement on the draft
                Programme for Government. What will the programme do to address
                the needs of children and older people?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Séamus Mallon MP:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive recognise the need to provide
                services that address the needs of older people and there are
                benefits to older people across the range of policy areas
                contained in the programme, through improved government service,
                social security, health care, transport and housing. In the
                programme we have highlighted the Executive’s wish to receive
                views on the appropriate approach to services for older people.
                In section 2.8 we have set out the main actions for achieving
                sub-priority 6 — and there are other policies relevant to the
                needs of older people elsewhere in the document. We will discuss
                the best way to develop our policies with representatives of
                older people, and we are keen to take views on this issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The test of any society is how it deals with
                people on its fringes — the very young, the aged and those who
                are marginalised. I am confident that the debate, especially in
                relation to young people and the elderly, will show evidence of
                concern that will be translated into the type of action that is
                needed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have a new sub-priority focusing on the
                protection of children’s rights, meeting children’s needs
                and including children’s voices. We are also consulting on the
                proposals for a children’s commissioner, and we have
                established the children’s fund as one of the five Executive
                programmes. Through that, significant investment has been made
                to improve our services. Some of our work will include the
                voluntary sector, and we are involving it closely in the
                development of the fund. We also plan to bring forward a 10-year
                strategy for children and young people, taking account of the
                role of parents and families. It will also examine the score for
                achieving a more joined-up approach in the Executive to children’s
                issues.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I repeat that the consultation that will take
                place, the deliberation in Committees, the debates in the
                Assembly and the way in which we approach these matters will be
                the acid test of whether there will be something different about
                this Administration, something different that is good, creative
                and positive — or will we just be administrators?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr Ian Paisley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not welcome this Programme for
                Government because we had a Programme for Government that made
                about 200 promises, not many of which have been fulfilled. That
                can be examined. Ten pieces of legislation have been passed
                since the start of devolution. Today, when the Executive are in
                a crisis about who should be Members of the Executive, one of
                the major parties of the Executive has declared through its
                leader that it will seek to expel some of them. That has all
                been forgotten. There has been no mention of the difficult
                position that we are in. However, an attack has been launched on
                the two Ministers from the Democratic Unionist Party who do not
                attend the Executive. Those are the problems. DUP Members have
                no mandate from the people who elected them to attend the
                Executive, and I have more respect for the mandate that I
                received than others in the House have for their mandate. They
                think that they can break it when it suits them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It ill becomes us, in the present state of
                play in Northern Ireland, to have this Programme for Government
                and to pick out one party only, when we have a party in the

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to ask him why he left out the
                victims. Do they not matter to him? Prisoners — oh yes, they
                will do much for them. However, the poor victims of the
                prisoners are not mentioned. What about the fact that we are
                meeting under an economic blight because of terrorism? Did the
                Government, before they wrote all these papers, not consider
                that the economic situation had changed? Have they not heard
                about what happened in America and the economic results? Have

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Why is there no promise in all of this to
                implement one recommendation that came from the Agriculture and
                Rural Development Committee? Not one recommendation is to be
                fulfilled in this programme.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member’s first point about little
                progress being made is simply incorrect. When we brought out the
                first Programme for Government, it was the first time that an
                attempt had ever been made here to marry policy aspirations to a
                Budget. In this draft, we are trying to refine that process even
                further.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is a draft programme. It will go to
                Committees, including the hon Member’s Committee, where he and
                his Colleagues will have the opportunity to scrutinise it. Over
                the years, neither he nor I nor anyone else in the House has had
                the chance to do that. Something was pushed in front of us, and
                that was it. The Member and his Colleagues will be able to
                scrutinise this, it will be debated when we come back, and we
                will ratify the final version. There is a consultation process
                in place. Mr Mallon said that he was looking forward to hearing
                comments from Members. We welcome comments from Members.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is simply not true that victims have been
                ignored. When I was taking questions two weeks ago today, I
                specifically answered a question about victims. I indicated the
                substantial amounts of public money that are correctly being
                made available to deal with victims, including £6·7 million
                from Peace II that is specifically for victims and cannot be
                interfered with by any other interest. Denis Haughey and Dermot
                Nesbitt are in negotiation with the Northern Ireland Office over
                a block of money. We have set up liaison groups between our two
                Departments to ensure that the needs of victims are dealt with.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The consultation paper on the victims’
                strategy was issued on 7 August. The consultation period will
                last until 9 November. In implementing the victims’ strategy,
                the Executive will take appropriate steps to ensure that service
                delivery is improved. Not all the changes will require financial
                solutions. In some cases, a change to existing work practices
                may be all that is required.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member also made a comment about the
                situation in America. My office is fully aware, even this
                morning, of what is happening as a result of that situation. I
                can assure the Member that we are doing all we can with those
                firms that we know to be affected. We are in a global economy,
                and what happens in another place affects us. We are very aware
                that there will be pain in our economy as a direct result of
                what has happened in America, and we are trying to assess the
                situation. This morning I instructed officials to arrange a
                meeting for this Thursday of all the key people in my Department
                and its agencies. We will assess the situation with regard to
                the impact on our economy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the matter of membership of the Executive,
                the Member will know my view. I made it clear this morning in a
                broadcast. I am acutely aware that parts of the Belfast
                Agreement have not been acted on. The Member has to realise that
                while criticising those people in the Republican movement who,
                in my view, have not implemented their part of the Agreement, he
                must not assume that his Colleagues, who seek to have their cake
                and eat it, can be free from criticism either.</p>

                prove to be aspirational, unless sufficient priority is given to
                the Health Service and resources allocated accordingly.</p>

                Programme for Government. It cannot be effective if it is seen
                as a pot of money for doling out in that way. That would mean
                that it would not be sufficiently comprehensive to stretch
                across all Departments and across the Programme for Government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have published New TSN action plans
                showing how Departments are redirecting efforts and resources
                towards those in greatest need. Those are being updated. We will
                ensure that those plans are fully implemented, and we will
                publish annual progress reports. New TSN has a particular focus
                on increasing employability and tackling unemployment. In 2002,
                we will consider the recommendations of the task force on
                employability and long-term unemployment to see how we can
                strengthen our work in those areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The element of New TSN which deals with
                promoting social inclusion involves Departments working together
                to improve the circumstances of those who are most at risk of
                social exclusion. We recently consulted on the issues to be
                tackled, and new initiatives will begin in 2002. We will
                evaluate New TSN in 2002, and the results will be fed into our
                work on the policy. I agree with the Member that the programme
                cannot deliver quantifiable, measurable results within a
                specific period. It must be fed into the Administration at every
                level in every Department and into every policy or
                implementation document, so that we go to the root of the
                problem, rather than just gloss over the top.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the decision made last week about
                the funding of the extension of the natural gas pipeline to
                other parts of Northern Ireland. It is an issue of great
                personal interest, and the Enterprise, Trade and Investment
                Committee worked with the Minister to bring it about. It shows
                clearly the benefits of devolution to the people of Northern
                Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Deep divisions persist in Northern Ireland,
                and that can be seen only too clearly on the streets. To what
                extent was the principle of sharing — rather than separation
                — incorporated into the Programme for Government, to help
                create the sort of shared and integrated society that we all
                want?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Member for his comments about the
                gas pipeline project. I thank Mr Neeson for the work that he has
                done as Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for Enterprise,
                Trade and Investment, and as a public representative. He has
                promoted the natural gas pipeline for many years; he is not a
                recent convert. He has made a significant contribution and I
                appreciate his efforts.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The natural gas pipeline provides a basic
                piece of infrastructure that was missing. One cannot exaggerate
                what it will do and it would be wrong to do so, but it is
                important to have the necessary infrastructure in place.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Neeson made a point about a shared and
                integrated society. One of the mechanisms at the disposal of the
                Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister is
                the community relations unit. We have witnessed the necessity to
                become involved in a recent dispute. As the Member may be aware,
                an exchange took place at Question Time about that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive have considered the measures to
                tackle the deep and painful divisions in Northern Ireland’s
                society. Mr Mallon said that one fault line is the difference
                between people who have skills, education and resources and
                those who do not. The draft Programme for Government contains
                policies that are designed to address those issues.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The draft Programme for Government’s
                proposals reflect and build on the actions in the previous
                programme. By 2002, it is hoped that a cross- departmental
                strategy will be developed to promote community relations and
                that that will lead to improvements in community relations.
                Actions aimed at promoting integrated education, the concept of
                citizenship among children and young people, and respect and
                support for culture and linguistic diversity have also been
                proposed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Office of the First Minister and the
                Deputy First Minister has proposed a review of the community
                relations unit, because the limited resources that the Office
                has at its disposal mean that its ability to intervene is less
                than it would like. The Office of the First Minister and the
                Deputy First Minister has proposed that that review be carried
                out to see whether it is possible to re-organise or to provide
                further resources to enable it to respond and to anticipate some
                of the problems that lead to and exaggerate divisions.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the draft Programme for Government
                and the statements from Sir Reg Empey and Mr Mallon. However, I
                note that 30 of the 250 actions still leave some cause for
                concern because of slippage and timescale problems. Given that
                the Assembly will have some slippage and timescale problems over
                the next six weeks, is the Office of the First Minister and the
                Deputy First Minister concerned about the failure to meet any of
                those actions? How does that failure impact on the draft
                Programme for Government?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Do Sir Reg Empey and Mr Mallon agree that the
                timescale for the reorganisation of the hospitals — by
                December 2002 — is too lengthy? Would it not have been better
                to have attempted to synchronise that timescale with that for
                primary care, which is set at April 2002? One will impact on the
                other.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Séamus Mallon MP:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The timescale for the re- organisation of the
                hospitals may be too long. However, the reason for that will
                become clear when one looks at the budgetary considerations and
                the factors that will be involved in the decision-making
                process. There will have to be extensive deliberations and
                consultation by the Executive — not only in their
                consideration, but in the Assembly and in the community. I am
                not sure whether there is a way to cut time out of it, but I
                hope that there is. I would like to think that there would be a
                unanimity that does not grow on trees in Northern Ireland, but I
                doubt it. However, I want to assure the House — in a loose way
                — that if it is seen that things can be done more quickly,
                they will be done so.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As for the 250 actions, the broader question
                as to whether timescales have affected those, and the wider
                problems; of course the uncertainty is damaging. There is no
                doubt that the political uncertainty in regard to the
                institutions has had an effect on the Administration and on the
                Executive, and will have a continuing effect.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When we were preparing for questions to the
                Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister this
                morning, it struck me that there might not be another such
                Question Time, if one is to believe the huffing and puffing that
                one hears. I do not know whether that will be the case, but I
                know that it is difficult to maintain a collective focus to
                ensure the delivery of the actions required. The Member is
                right; it is having an effect. However, while there is some
                slippage — I think it is in nearly 30 areas — other areas
                have developed quickly. We should be looking at how those have
                been delivered, while at the same time retaining the resolve to
                catch up with the 30 that have not been properly delivered.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Whatever the situation may be as far as the
                institutions are concerned, Standing Orders are clear about the
                time limits for today. There is one hour for questions, and a
                substantial number of Members still wish to put questions. I
                therefore ask everyone to be as efficient as possible in putting
                their questions and answering them, and we will deal with as
                many as possible within the limits that Standing Orders give us.</p>

                particularly welcome the continuing commitment to the
                improvement of levels of education. However, the statement
                highlighted the ongoing problem of literacy in our society as a
                whole. What measures are proposed in the draft Programme for
                Government to deal with that?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The hon Member draws attention to a serious
                problem. As Mr Mallon pointed out in his opening remarks, 24% of
                adults in Northern Ireland have some degree of difficulty with
                reading, writing or numeracy. That is a staggering statistic.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Through the Department for Employment and
                Learning, the Executive have received detailed advice from the
                basic skills unit. Using this advice and taking account of
                developments elsewhere in the UK and Europe, including the
                Republic, we will develop a detailed strategy and action plan
                that will be subject to extensive consultation by the end of
                this year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The key elements include new basic standards
                in the curriculum; raising the esteem and improving the
                standards of basic skill tutors through a new professional
                qualification; challenging targets for improving basic skill
                levels; a strategy for co-ordinating activity across Government;
                and the engagement of the education training community, trade
                unions and employers in tackling this key issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are aware of the extent of the problem,
                and we are taking action to improve the low levels of adult
                literacy and numeracy. That lies at the heart of improving
                economic competitiveness; it is impossible for people to advance
                personally and improve their social development without it.</p>

                Since the basic structure review will not take place until the
                end of 2002, or perhaps not until the end of 2003, there is an
                immediate concern about how efficiency will be implemented and
                about how the minor restructuring can take place. The only other
                option is unlimited finance, and that is not open to us. What
                new measures do the Ministers intend to take to reduce the
                appalling escalation in the waiting lists, as it is affecting
                every family in the community?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When we think of waiting lists we tend to
                think of people waiting to get into hospital or waiting for
                treatment. However, people, especially the elderly, must also
                wait to get out of hospital and back into their homes. It is
                easy to upbraid a Minister for not making provision for waiting
                lists or provision for the elderly or for young people when one
                knows that the money is not available. We must recognise that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am sure that many new medical techniques
                and ideas are being developed. However, one element will not
                change: without the money we shall not be able to pay for them.
                If we prioritise these things — and they should be priorities
                — we shall to have to de-prioritise other things. That is not
                of much help to the Member; he knows that I am not an expert in
                these matters. Only by making enough money available can we

                Children’s Rights — A Consultation paper on a Children’s
                Commissioner for Northern Ireland’, and we look forward to
                hearing responses to that document. It is an innovative step
                that could have national implications, because there could be
                changes to criminal law as a result of it. That would be a
                matter for the Secretary of State. MrMallon and I have discussed
                the matter with the Secretary of State and with officials, and
                we hope that after the consultation, proposals will be brought
                forward that will advance the issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A Children’s Commissioner for Wales has
                been appointed. However, in the light of the feedback that we
                will receive, we hope that we will be in advance of many areas.
                We know that Sweden and other countries have had children’s

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to e-government, we have

                by 2005. We will monitor progress towards achieving that target.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive are already committed to the
                review of public administration. As I said previously, my
                Colleague, Mr Foster, has specific responsibility for local
                government, and he is already working on it. The review will
                take place, although we are aware that there are uncertainties
                within the local government system, and we would like to move
                rapidly towards its resolution.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am hopeful that we will have the terms of
                reference finalised as the year progresses. However, I point out
                to the Member that, as the recent review of the hospitals by Dr
                Hayes shows, the administration of health services are a part of
                all of this, as is the huge area of education and its
                administration. We are anxious to ensure that this is an
                integrated review, not a piecemeal one. It is better to get the
                concept right than to get it quickly.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I
                thank the two Ministers for delivering the draft report on
                behalf of the Executive. It is a good document containing much
                information. Many questions will come out of it, and I am sure
                that the Committees will be dealing with it in their various
                ways.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Have the Executive adopted the
                recommendations of the Finance and Personnel Committee in
                relation to public-private partnerships (PPPs)? I refer not just
                to the equality impact that the document mentions on page 131,
                but to the other recommendations in regard to contracts and the
                best use of public money in building new schools or hospitals
                under PPPs. The Committee carried out an extensive consultation
                on PPPs, and I hope that the Executive will include it in their
                consultation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What additional money is being put
                specifically into targeting the cross-departmental themes in the
                Programme for Government? To return to the issue of the Health
                Service, and taking a rural area west of the Bann, it is clear
                that if it takes until December 2002 to implement a new acute
                services plan, there will be longer waiting lists and a larger
                problem, but fewer hospitals to deal with it. We need to
                rebalance services now to ensure that some of those hospitals
                are still viable by December 2002. The local government review
                is awaited with anticipation, but we should move away from
                expensive reviews on everything and spend the money on practical
                action on the ground.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Séamus Mallon MP:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Member for his questions, of
                which I have identified at least four. I will start with the
                last one on the local government review. It is not a local
                government review, but a review of administration in general. It
                is a mistake to look at it as simply a review of local
                government. We have committed ourselves to that review, and we
                hope that it will be done thoroughly — not at great expense,
                but so that we get it right. I agree with the essence of what
                the Member says. Very often, reviews go on forever, resulting in
                glossy documents that often have no substance, and which are
                often wrong. I prefer to get it right rather than to get it
                glossy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member also mentioned acute hospital
                provision west of the Bann. I am not competent, nor do I have
                any authority, to make any judgement, but it is clear that the
                sooner consultations are over and informed decisions can be
                made, the better. We will all try to ensure that that will be
                done as speedily as possible. Cross-cutting themes are a
                budgetary matter. I will ensure that that is dealt with tomorrow
                and that the information is made available.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To answer the Member’s first question, in
                line with the commitment made in last year’s programme, a
                review of public-private partnerships (PPPs) and private finance
                initiatives (PFIs) has been established. The group, jointly
                chaired by the Economic Policy Unit (EPU) and the Department of
                Finance and Personnel, will meet for the first time on
                Wednesday. It plans to conclude its work by February 2002. The
                group, which will be widely drawn from the private sector and
                will have a representative from the social partnership, will
                explore the policy, the economic and social issues behind the
                policy and the opportunities to use private finance in all major
                services.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The group will develop the equality impact
                assessment in line with the explicit commitment in the Programme
                for Government to carry it out. In carrying forward that work,
                the group will also take account of the detailed report on the
                issue, which was rightly produced by the Committee for Finance
                and Personnel. That report usefully set out many of the key
                issues that must be considered and collected a wide range of
                views on the complex matter. I thank the Committee for
                initiating that investigation and report and for making the
                report available to us.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Places on the working group have also been
                offered to the Northern Ireland Committee of the Irish Congress
                of Trade Unions. Their answer is awaited. It is sincerely hoped
                that they will join the group, because we will then get the most
                comprehensive view of what may be possible as a result of the
                consultation.</p>
                <b>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also welcome the respective statements of
                the acting First Minister and the acting Deputy First Minister,
                particularly the parts that relate to the economy. With the
                deterioration in the world economy, are the Ministers confident
                that the new Programme for Government does enough to ensure that
                the economic progress that we have experienced in recent years
                will continue?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Programme for Government contains a
                section on securing a competitive economy. As I said in my
                opening remarks, there has been remarkable progress in recent
                years. Northern Ireland is no longer regarded as the sick
                economy that it once was, with high levels of unemployment, many
                leaving these shores because of the lack of jobs, and being well
                behind in a range of areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, we cannot be complacent, because
                there is still an overemphasis on traditional businesses, which
                leaves us vulnerable to world and market trends. It would be
                unrealistic to believe that any programme could entirely shelter
                businesses from the effects of the global downturn. The hon
                Member, who is on the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and
                Investment, knows the difficulties that are being experienced in
                the telecommunications sector and others as a result of that
                downturn, and that was the situation before the events of the
                week before last. As I said earlier, it is too soon to assess
                the full impact of those events, but we will be meeting the
                Department and the agencies later this week to make what
                assessment we can and to see what steps, if any, can be taken.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.30 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member will be fully aware of the
                measures we are taking, including the creation of Invest
                Northern Ireland, to ensure that we have the most effective
                mechanism possible at our disposal to secure maximum economic
                growth.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr ONeill:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is much to be welcomed in the statement
                from both Ministers. For many years I have had an interest in
                the construction of a dual carriageway on the Newry section of
                the Newry to Dundalk road, and I am glad to see that that is
                getting up the scale.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The document refers to the crisis we recently
                experienced. Will the Minister tell us, in the simplest terms
                possible, how the Programme for Government addresses the crisis
                in agriculture?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Séamus Mallon MP:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Simply, or simplistically, we have to
                recognise that the world of farming has changed. It has been
                changed by forces unconnected with the recent problems with
                foot-and-mouth disease, but rather on account of how agriculture
                is changing throughout the world. It is crucial that we
                recognise that and devise a means whereby rural communities
                retain the role that they have always played.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the foot-and-mouth disease crisis all
                sectors and all sections of Government worked together carefully
                and successfully to deal with the real problems for farmers and
                businesses in the affected rural areas. We appreciate that the
                regeneration of the rural economy is a much longer-term issue
                and concerns deep-rooted problems. In the Programme for
                Government, we set out our intention to develop an action plan
                for the strategic development of the agrifood industry for the
                next decade.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You might well ask — and so might I —
                what that means. Surely, if we are honest, we must look beyond
                the words, and towards what it will take to sustain farming as
                an industry, to sustain the type of farming that exists in the
                North of Ireland. We must look not to the type of farming we
                would wish it to be, or that exists in Norfolk or in other parts
                of the world, but the type of farming that exists here. We must
                look at how we can tie that in to the agrifood industry.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The plan for that will arise out of the
                results of the exercise on the vision for the future of the
                agrifood industry that has been carried out over the last year
                by the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development. We await
                that with interest.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How do we help farmers and the wider industry
                to produce food that people around the world will trust and buy?
                How do we achieve the relaxation of beef export restrictions? We
                must do that as soon as possible in 2002-03.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How do we sell it abroad in not very
                propitious circumstances? The Member asked for simplicity. It
                would be a start if we were all to ensure that we bought Irish
                beef. Are we perhaps more partial to Danish or Argentinian
                produce, or are we serious about sustaining our own rural
                community?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We cannot regard rural Northern Ireland as a
                community based on farming and settlement. It is not that type
                of society. Farming is part of the settlement of the towns and
                villages. The agro-industries are part of the development of
                commerce in Northern Ireland. The vision for the future of the
                agrifood industry will therefore be crucial, because it cannot
                be considered in isolation from rural life and the farming
                industry as a whole.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr William McCrea:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other Members have welcomed the draft
                Programme for Government and commented on how much is in it for
                them. As the Chairperson of the Environment Committee, I
                listened carefully to the statements of both the acting First
                Minister and the acting Deputy First Minister and they made
                virtually no reference to the environment or any related issue.
                There were 19 pages and 35 minutes of speech. Where exactly did
                the environment come into it? I looked carefully at the 144-page
                document and found that scant reference is made to the
                environment. The environment is supposed to be a key theme
                running through the current Programme for Government. How can
                the acting First and Deputy First Ministers expect my Committee
                to believe that they are treating environmental issues as
                important?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the previous speech, sustainable
                development was mentioned repeatedly. It is not even mentioned
                in the 19 pages and 35 minutes of speech. I know that the
                Ministers are running quickly through this 144-page document.
                However, I remember their summary. I believe that the Department
                of the Environment was the only Department that did not get a
                mention in the 35-minute speech. Waste management — one of the
                biggest problems that we face — got two lines in the 144-page
                document. The protection of our built heritage is a major
                problem; it was not mentioned in either of the speeches or in
                the document. We are facing a planning crisis. Many areas do not
                have an area plan. Again, that was not mentioned.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Mallon said that we must start with high
                ideals and vision. As far as the environment is concerned, they
                mean nothing at all.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Mallon mentioned this. Today we are
                presenting the draft Programme for Government. If the Member
                turns to page 92 of the document, he will see that there are
                some 15 targets set for his Department <i>— [Interruption].</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member and his Committee will have the
                opportunity to comment on the proposal. That is the purpose of
                it. It comes back to the Assembly. The Programme for Government
                contained a commitment to publish proposals for a sustainable
                development strategy by June 2001. It was not possible to
                publish the proposals by that date. However, the sustainable
                development strategy will be published in November 2001. It will
                involve widespread consultation to encourage a debate on
                sustainable development, including indicators by which progress
                in sustainable development can be measured.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister will consider the comments made
                during that consultation and intends to publish the sustainable
                development strategy by October next year. As the Member is
                aware, that will include reducing, recycling and disposing of
                the waste that the community generates. Those will remain
                priorities for the Executive. The Member will also know that
                councils must be assisted in implementing the sustainable
                arrangements for the provision of an integrated network of waste
                facilities through their group waste management plans. When we
                attempted to put our proposals forward we ran into difficulties
                with another division of the Department of the Environment with
                regard to planning. Perhaps the Member will find something in
                the draft programme that he can get his teeth into when it
                reaches Committee Stage.</p>

                management strategy in place, can the Minister tell us what
                cross-cutting actions are taking place at local government level
                to deliver a substantial waste management strategy? Where is the
                response in the draft programme to the EU integrated product

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I resisted the temptation even to consider
                such a matter.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member asked a very important question,
                but I will refer it to those who can answer it properly. I will
                make sure that the Member gets a full and proper answer rather
                than a glossed-over one from me now. His question, which means
                something, will get an answer, which means something, because we
                know how dear waste management is to his heart and to his mind.
                I would not like the Member to go without the expert advice that
                I will ensure he gets from those who are in an expert position
                to give it.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Hussey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the acting First Minister and the
                acting Deputy First Minister for the statement. Like others, I
                welcome the plans for action in the draft programme which I hope
                will be carried out. The Ministers said that three quarters of
                the population will have access to natural gas — obviously, a
                quarter of the population will not. I am concerned about the
                lack of action planned to tackle the deteriorating rural
                infrastructure. As the acting First and Deputy First Ministers
                said, they must deal with those at the fringes. I realise that
                such action requires funds, so what steps are being taken to
                deal with the deficiencies of the Barnett formula to ensure that
                the resources available reflect Northern Ireland’s genuine
                needs and will enable this draft Programme for Government to be
                delivered?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is fortunate that our Colleague, the
                Minister of Finance and Personnel, is here, since he is
                responsible for this important issue. The Executive have major
                concerns, which are acknowledged in the draft programme. We are
                looking carefully at the operation of the Barnett formula to see
                if it can provide a fair allocation of resources. We have not
                concluded work on that, but we know that, because of the way in
                which the formula operates, we are unable to keep pace with the
                rates of increase in spending in England on programmes such as
                health and education, which are crucial. We hope to have formed
                a view on the appropriateness of the formula later this year. We
                have nothing to fear from any examination of the Barnett
                formula. However, we must continue to argue the case for a
                better and fairer formula — and a coherent Programme for
                Government is an important building block in the process of
                putting our case to the Treasury.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am conscious that the Member’s
                constituency may not have the gas infrastructure, but the
                Department aims to ensure that other infrastructural elements,
                such as telephones, will be available to his constituents.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several Members who wished to ask questions
                did not have the chance to do so. It is regrettable, but it is
                not the first time that that has happened, particularly when
                dealing with statements of such substance. The House must be
                grateful for Ministers’ preparedness to make statements on
                matters of importance in the Chamber. However, there may be
                other ways of dealing with substantial statements such as the
                Programme for Government. My office would be happy to assist the
                Executive and the Assembly to explore whether, in some cases,
                there might be a way of ensuring that more Members who wished to
                put down questions, or explore matters, had an opportunity to do
                so.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr ONeill:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order. During the debate on
                setting up an interdepartmental working group the DUP Member for
                South Down, Mr Jim Wells, made a comment about the people in the
                parish of Kilcoo. I ask you to examine his remarks when you have
                the benefit of Hansard and any other advice you may receive. In
                my opinion, it appears that he impugned the reputation of those
                people. Indeed, he even suggested that it was risky to one’s
                life to pass through the area. Subject to correction — as I
                did not quite pick up what his exact words were — I think this
                could be unparliamentary language. Would you examine this issue
                for me?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was not in the Chair at the time, so I did
                not hear the remarks. However, I will peruse Hansard and will
                respond, in the Chamber if it is appropriate, but if not,
                directly to the Member himself.</p>
