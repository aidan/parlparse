		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The Assembly met at 12.00 noon (Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr  McClarty] in the Chair).</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Members observed two minutes&rsquo; silence.</p>
		    <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="1"></a>Ministerial Statement</p>
		    <p class="H4StageHeading">North/South Ministerial Council &mdash; Special EU Programmes  Sectoral Format</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I have received notice from the Minister of Finance and Personnel  that he wishes to make a statement on the eighth meeting of the North-South  Ministerial Council (NSMC) in special EU programmes sectoral format.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel (Mr P Robinson)</strong>: The North/South Ministerial Council  met <span style="letter-spacing:-.05pt; ">in special EU programmes sectoral  format in Dublin  on</span> 7 November 2007. It was the first NSMC meeting in th<span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt; ">at sectoral format since the Northern Ireland  Assemb</span>ly and Executive were restored in May of this year.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Irish Government were represented by their Minister for  Finance, Brian Cowen, who chaired the meeting. I represented the Northern  Ireland Adminis&shy;tration, and I was accompanied by my colleague the Minister for  Social Development, Margaret Ritchie.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The meeting began with a report from Pat Colgan, <span style="letter-spacing:-.2pt; ">who is the chief executive of the Special EU Prog</span>rammes  Body (SEUPB). He updated us on developments since the Council last met in that  sectoral format, which was on 9 October 2002. Mr Colgan outlined a number of  achievements that there had been in those five years. Those included the  completion of work to close the first EU Peace programme and the performance of  the Peace II and INTERREG IIIa programmes.  The Council commended Mr Colgan on his successful management of those two programmes. Both Peace II and INTERREG  IIIa have, to date, achieved the annual spending targets that the European  Commission set SEUPB.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Colgan informed the Council that SEUPB&rsquo;s annual report  and accounts are fully up to date and have been published with clean audit  reports from the Comptroller and Auditor General for Northern Ireland <span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt; ">and his counterpart in the Republic. The SEUPB  has also</span> delivered its corporate and business plans within the time  frame that the two finance Departments agreed.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Colgan also reviewed progress on the development of the  Peace III and INTERREG IVa programmes. The Council was informed that the work  on programme development had been undertaken in both an evidence-based and  participative manner.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The final draft programmes were approved and subsequently  sent to the European Commission for negotiation. The Commission formally  approved the two programmes on 6 November. I am therefore pleased to be able to  announce that both programmes will shortly be formally launched and opened for  funding applications.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council emphasised to Mr Colgan the need to address the  observation that the Protestant community has  failed to benefit fully from the opportunities available under the Peace  programmes and, indeed, some wider Government initiatives. The Social  Development Minister and I stressed the importance of that matter, and the  importance of the full participation of all communities in the new programme.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Colgan assured us that SEUPB will continue its efforts  to promote Peace funding throughout Northern Ireland and the border  counties, and will encourage all communities  to participate. Projects to build community capacity will again be  funded, and all appropriate steps will be taken to encourage applications from  both communities.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council noted that  the new Peace III programme has a total budget of &euro;333 million. That  comprises the &euro;225 million provided from the EU budget, and match funding from Northern Ireland  and the Republic.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The programme will  carry forward the work of its two predecessors, with a continued focus  on the promotion of reconciliation and a shared society.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council welcomed the fact that victims and survivors of  the conflict in Northern    Ireland have been listed in the programme  document as a key beneficiary group for programme funding. Mr Colgan agreed  that the Special EU Programmes Body would work closely with the Commissioner  for Victims and Survivors in order to ensure that Peace III complements that  organisation&rsquo;s programme of work.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The INTERREG IVa programme will have a budget of &euro;256 million &mdash; some 40% more than its predecessor,  INTERREG IIIa. That funding will be used to assist cross-border economic  development activities in areas such as tourism and business support. The new  programme will cover a wider geographical area than its predecessor because  areas in western Scotland  are, for the first time, eligible to participate.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council welcomed the inclusion of the west of Scotland in the new programme as a development  that can both benefit from and enhance the long-established social, cultural  and economic links that exist between Northern   Ireland and Scotland. I and Minister Cowen look  forward to working with our Scottish colleagues on the ambitious new programme.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council noted that  Peace III and INTERREG IVa will have  a more strategic focus than their predecessors. As in the rest of the  EU, the emphasis will be on supporting larger, multi-annual projects that  target identified needs in a structured and systematic way.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, there will be an attempt to lessen the work of  programme administration, which some stakeholders have found unnecessarily  burdensome. To that end, SEUPB will take on more of the work of programme delivery so that the number of  intermediary bodies can be correspondingly reduced.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council approved SEUPB&rsquo;s corporate plan for 2008-10,  and its 2008 business plan. We also approved a modest increase in SEUPB staffing to enable it to deliver the new  programmes. That increase reflects the greater involvement of SEUPB in  future programme delivery, and the corresponding reduction in the number of intermediary funding bodies.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, the Council noted SEUPB&rsquo;s annual report and  accounts, which were presented in advance of their submission to the Assembly  and to the Republic&rsquo;s Parliament. The Council agreed its intention to meet  again in special EU programmes sectoral format in April 2008.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Finance and Personnel (Mr McLaughlin)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat,  a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his statement. The Committee for Finance and Personnel has  already made an initial examination of the work of the Special EU Programmes Body, and held an evidence session with  its chief executive, Mr Pat Colgan, and other officials on 26 September 2007.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Last May, President Barroso announced the creation of a special task force with the stated purpose  of assisting us to maximise the benefits of European programmes and to  make maximum use of experience from across the EU to further our economic aims  and promote growth, innovation and opportunity.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister  update the Assembly on the progress of the task force and state what  role SEUPB will play in that regard? Will he also indicate, following the introduction  of the 2007-13 programmes, what steps the  Department of Finance and Personnel (DFP) and the SEUPB will take to  promote long-term sustainability of projects and prepare for the period  post-2013?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  I welcome the involvement of President  Barrosa, and I welcomed his visit to Northern Ireland when, along with  the First Minister and deputy First Minister, I had the opportunity to meet  him. I was impressed by his interest in Northern   Ireland and with willingness  to assist, particularly in tooling-up North<span style="letter-spacing:0pt; ">ern Ireland</span> to deal with the new set of circumstances in which  it would have to compete for funds.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As funds will be allocated on a transnational basis, and  will involve other regions or members of the European Community, it will be  likely that our partner, in particular,  would be the Republic   of Ireland. In those  circumstances, SEUPB might have an important role in brokering arrangements and  assisting us.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Sustainability is part of the selection criteria for the 2007-13 programmes, and SEUPB will be promoting  more strategic projects than before. As such, that will help sustainability.  The hope is that Peace funding will be  reduced in line with the facts, and I think we are very fortunate. Most  people were delighted when the initial Peace project and funding came forward.  A lot of work was carried out by our MEPs at the time in securing the second  tranche of Peace funding, and we have been very fortunate to have achieved  Peace III funding.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Most people recognise that, with the additional burden on  the EU budget due, in particular, to enlargement, it is unlikely that there  will be a Peace IV allocation. Therefore, it is important that we get real  strategic value from Peace III.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy  Chairperson of the Committee for Finance and Personnel (Mr Storey)</strong>: I  declare an interest as a member of Ballymoney local strategic partnership and  as a member of the monitoring committee for Peace II.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Minister for his statement. During the  Committee for Finance and Personnel&rsquo;s initial scrutiny of SEUPB, an issue arose  regarding the distribution of EU funding. Will the Minister comment on what new  measures will be put in place to ensure that there is equitable distribution of  new funds across Northern    Ireland? Will he also comment on the  increased role for SEUPB in programme delivery, which has resulted in a  reduction in the number of intermediary funding bodies? Will the more  centralised approach to implementation run the risk of losing the involvement  by communities from the bottom up?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  The Member has considerable knowledge of the subject. He did not quite say  whether equitable distribution was to be on the basis of location or  communities: I suspect that he means the latter. It has been recognised that  there has been a perceived under-representation of the Protestant community. I  raised that issue at the meeting, and I was strongly supported by the Minister  for Social Development.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Around 44% of funding under Peace I went to the Protestant  community. That was increased to 47% in Peace II, in no small part because it  was possible in Peace II to draw down money for capacity building.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">12.15 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, over time, the figures have improved. Peace III  is likely to have a more strategic focus, so I trust that that trend will  continue. However, I am reminded of the joke about the lottery: in order to win  the lottery, it is necessary to buy a ticket. In this case, in order to receive  funding, it is necessary to submit an application. All Members must encourage  people in the Protestant community to submit applications to ensure equity.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Under Peace III, a smaller amount of money is available  than under Peace II. The amount of that money that can be used for  administrative purposes is also restricted; that figure had been 10%, and it is  now 6%, which means that there is only one quarter of the amount of funding  available for administration than previously. We must examine methods of  delivery and take steps to reduce levels of bureaucracy, although that will  reduce the useful bottom-up approach. However, the local community will be  involved as much as possible.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  Historically, INTERREG funding has been perceived in many quarters as assisting  border areas in particular. Can the Minister tell the House how INTERREG IVa, which  will include Scotland, might  benefit communities and bodies in the north-east and in my constituency of East  Antrim, which have natural linkages with Scotland?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  The inclusion of the west of Scotland  in INTERREG IVa is a new development, which I welcome. My colleague the Member  for East Londonderry clearly welcomes this  move, as he indicated during my statement.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Changes in INTERREG IVa mean that maritime borders will now  be included. That border, of course, exists between parts of Scotland and the Republic  of Ireland, because there is no border  between Northern Ireland and  Scotland.  However, any scheme must involve the three regions &mdash; Northern   Ireland, the Republic of Ireland  and Scotland &mdash; and not  simply Northern Ireland and Scotland, which  would not meet the criteria. However, the scheme would allow us to encourage  tourism and cultural links among the three regions. The Scots have never been  hesitant about availing of funding, and I am sure that we will learn from them  during the process.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  note the Minister&rsquo;s earlier answer. Does the Minister agree that the  &ldquo;perception&rdquo; that the Protestant community receives fewer benefits from Peace  funding is, indeed, a mere perception and that the funding proportions in Peace  II were close to actual community proportions? Does he also agree that any  shortfall in funding for Protestant communities has been objectively and  independently assessed as being related to relative disadvantage in Catholic  areas and that SEUPB has worked constructively, and continues to do so, to tackle any under-capacity to avail of  funding in Protestant communities?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  I am not sure that I accept the Member&rsquo;s statistical review.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I indicated that the uptake in Peace I was 44%, whereas the  community division is around the 54% mark, which probably indicates that the  Catholic community received in the region of 56%. That means that it received  funding above its weight. There are two issues: first, because the criteria  included the TSN factor, that clearly would have been one of the issues at  play; and secondly, as I said to colleagues, no small part of it is the fact  that there were more applications from the Roman Catholic community than from  the Protestant community. However, I was happy to see that between Peace I and Peace II, the statistics indicate that  there was a move to a more equitable division. I hope that that continues. If  all of us encourage those applications to come in, I believe that we can  improve on those statistics.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister for Social Development accepted the statistics  and the perceptions and indicated that this is not unique to European funding  and that she has encountered it in other areas. She is doing particular work on  capacity building to ensure that there is more of an uptake from the Protestant  community.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I welcome the community-relations focus of Peace III. However,  will the Minister recognise that there should perhaps be a stronger emphasis on  cross-border work under the reconciling communities priority rather than under  the shared society headline, which should be more Northern Ireland focused? Will he  also recognise that the issue in the Protestant side of the community is that  of capacity building, and will he agree that allocations should be on the basis  of quality of project and need rather than rigorous communal allocation?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, with reference to INTERREG and the strong economic  focus of this stage of the scheme, does the Minister foresee any dangers &mdash; when  the Peace money dries up and we have to rely purely on structural funds &mdash; of  INTERREG being broadened to deal with the social as well as the economic  aspects?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  In relation to the first part of the Member&rsquo;s question, projects can, of  course, be put forward for any form of reconciliation, and they will be scored  on their merits. I agree with his second point: there is an open and  transparent system that judges the merits of each of the applications and it is  on that basis that the scoring takes place and the determination of appropriate  projects is assessed.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">At the same time, unless there were significant  discrimination, one would not intervene to make any changes. It is moving in  the right way; it is about capacity  building, as the Member suggests. The Minister for Social Development  has recognised the need in that area and is  building up programmes to improve capacity in Protestant areas. However,  I return to my original principle: there is  still a job for elected representatives to encourage that community and, where they see a deficit in  capacity, to attempt to consider ways of filling that.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There is one other factor to consider. There is a cultural  reticence, to some extent, that prevents some in the Protestant community from  making applications. There are a number of factors that must be overcome, but  chief among them is capacity building.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement and also declare an interest as a member of  North Down local strategic partnership. Will the Minister comment on the share  of the Peace III resources that will be available for administrative activity  and how that compares with Peace II?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  As I indicated earlier, the amount of funding available under Peace III is  reduced, and therefore the amount available for administration is reduced. It  had been 10% under Peace II; with a larger overall figure, it is now 6%. That  means that we really need to tighten down on administration. I am one of those  who believes that that is no bad thing. The purpose of those funds is to get them where they can be most used  in the community rather than building up the bureaucracy. I welcome the fact  that we are forced by necessity to allocate less to administration.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s comments and proposed actions to encourage a fairer  distribution of funding across both communities. Another group of people who  have been under-represented in the past are  the innocent victims of terrorist violence. What steps are being taken  to encourage uptake and to increase awareness among victims&rsquo; groups?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  Again, this is an issue that both the Minister for Social Development and I  raised at the meeting with Mr Cowen. It has  been agreed that SEUPB will make contact as soon as we have a Victims&rsquo;  Commissioner. SEUPB will look at the programme that the Victims&rsquo; Commissioner  is developing and attempt to work along with that office in delivering projects  to benefit both victims and survivors.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Savage</strong>:  The Minister advised us that the programmes were approved by the European Comm&shy;ission  on 6 November. When will we know which applications have been approved?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>: The next stage is for the Executive, at our meeting on 18  December, to look at the criteria and, if those are agreed, to roll out the  programmes very quickly thereafter.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I welcome the meeting that has taken place and the tone of the report and of  the Minister&rsquo;s comments. I want to ask three very quick questions.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I very much welcome the decision to provide funding for victims and survivors. What is the likely  budget line for that? Given that the opportunity for funding is to be launched soon, is the Minister aware that the Victims&rsquo; Commissioner will be appointed  during December? The commitment of SEUPB to work with the Victims&rsquo;  Commissioner can thus be achieved.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, can the Minister confirm how border partnership  groups will continue to be involved in the INTERREG programme? They have been  essential in building up capacity and understanding around the border.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Thirdly, I acknowledge that there has been under-application  by the Protestant community heretofore to the various Peace programmes. The  much more balanced application rate is welcome. However, will the Minister  reassure me that there is no intention that any European funding be targeted  exclusively at any one community, be it Catholic or Protestant? It is very  important that no EU programme &mdash; or any Government initiative, for that matter  &mdash; should be targeted exclusively at one community.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  I understand that the indicative allocation for victims and survivors is &euro;25  million. As far as the Victims&rsquo; Commissioner is concerned, the Member has asked  me something that is beyond my pay grade. However, as I understand it, every  effort is being made to resolve that issue. The First Minister and deputy First  Minister have given a date by which they intend to make an announcement.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member points out rightly that there is no requirement  to have any ring-fencing for any section of the community. The basis on which  allocations are made is the merit of the applications. We do need to point out  that, even though Protestants are statistically under-represented, at 47%, there is still a very significant  uptake. Some 7,000 projects have been funded under Peace II thus far, and all  sections of the community have benefited from that. There is still that  statistical imbalance, but it is becoming more slender.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">12.30 pm</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McQuillan</strong>:  I welcome the potential that Scotland&rsquo;s  involvement in the INTERREG IVa programme will bring. Will the Minister tell  the House what contact the SEUPB has had with the Scottish Executive about that  involvement?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  Brian Cowen, the relevant Minister from the Republic, and I will want to make  contact with our Scottish counterparts. At official level, contact will, of  course, have already been made, and in the European Community, considerable discussion will have begun and will be ongoing. I  believe that Northern Ireland  will benefit from the inclusion of Scotland in the project, and I look  forward to seeing the programmes that will be implemented as a result. I know  that some links exist between the north coast and Scotland, and the project might be  a suitable vehicle, if that is not a pun, through which those can benefit.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: I  welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement. Will he confirm that, unlike in previous  rounds, all EU structural funds are fully  additional to Northern Ireland? Will he perhaps explain the implications of that?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  With the exception of the Peace funding, which I believe had to be fought for,  there had not been true additionality.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">When making allocations to Northern Ireland, the Treasury took  into account other structural funds such as INTERREG &mdash; those funds are now  truly additional. That clearly means that Northern Ireland benefits, given  the extent of the funds that come to it through those programmes.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>: I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement, especially the constructive  tone that he lent to it.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">John Hume said that the  European Union was one of the finest  models of conflict resolution in human history. I note that the Minister  said that the programme will:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;carry forward the work of its two predecessors with a  continued focus on promoting reconciliation and a shared society.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I know that it may be  above the Minister&rsquo;s pay grade to speak for the Office of the First  Minister and deputy First Minister, but there does not seem to be much evidence  of that office&rsquo;s embracing the concept of a shared society. Will the Minister  reassure the Assembly that in so far as he  can, he will encourage the programme  to continue with its good work on reconciliation and the development of a  shared society?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  I have no reluctance &mdash; and I am pretty sure  that neither the First Minister nor the deputy First Minister has any  reluctance &mdash; in encouraging reconciliation in Northern Ireland where it is  needed, including, indeed, reconciliation beyond our borders. I do not think  that it would be proper to characterise either the First Minister or the deputy  First Minister as being reluctant to act on that matter or of dragging their  feet on it.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his  statement. Given that he has already said that a smaller amount of money will  be available under Peace III compared to what was available under Peace II, is  there a plan to ensure that funding will be available in the future for those  projects that are currently funded by Peace II and whose funding will end in  June 2008? I am referring specifically to those projects that are delivered in the  community and voluntary sectors.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  We need to be clear that Peace funding was never intended to be a long-term  arrange&shy;ment; by its nature, it was special and temporary.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, a growing emphasis was placed on the  sustainability of projects that were given life by funding. I hope that that,  to a large extent, will be the case. There is still some life left in Peace II,  and I trust that all of the projects that were started under it can be  sustained. However, as the emphasis of Peace III moves to a more strategic  level, and funding is for reconciliation,  it is unlikely that there will be continued funding for projects that  were born under Peace II.</p>

		    <p class="Q3Motion">That the Road Transport Licensing (Fees) (Amendment)  Regulations (Northern    Ireland) 2007 (S.R. 2007/461) be approved.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The purpose of the motion is to increase current road  freight and passenger licensing fees to recoup fully the cost of processing  applications for road transport licences. Specifically, the fee for a road  service licence will increase from &pound;3&middot;25 to &pound;6&middot;50 a month, or part of a month,  and the fee for a road freight operator&rsquo;s licence will increase from &pound;7 to &pound;30  a complete year. A road freight vehicle licence will increase from &pound;4 to &pound;5 a  month, or part thereof.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The fees for road-freight and passenger-operator licensing  have remained unchanged since 1997, and a sizeable increase is necessary to  keep the accounts in financial balance. The current fees do not recover all  associated costs, and significant deficits have begun to accrue since 2004.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Fee increases were not put in place earlier for several  reasons, including the intention to undertake a fundamental review of freight  licensing and anticipated new charges for  criminal-record checks. When it became clear that neither issue would be  resolved in the short term, it was decided that the fee increases could be  delayed no longer. However, Members will be aware that the Executive Committee has approved the drafting of new  legislation which, when passed, will introduce reforms to the licensing of the  freight industry. Those reforms will not only improve road safety and enforce&shy;ment, they will enable the cost of licensing to  be spread more fairly across the whole industry. Until then, however,  the Department still needs to recover the costs; hence the proposed fee  increase.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Using a partial regulatory impact assessment, the  Department consulted on the fee increases, and that consultation ran from November 2006 to January 2007. There were  over 2,500 consultees, but fewer than 20 responses were received. Following the  consultation, the fee increases were  discussed in detail at meetings with the main trade representatives, and there was general acceptance that the  full costs must be recovered.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, the loss on freight and passenger licensing  has been met in recent years by the Depart&shy;ment of the Environment and,  ultimately, the taxpayer. That cannot be sustained, as Government accounting  rules require that the Department recover annually the cost of freight and  passenger licensing. That is why I propose that, today, this statutory rule be  affirmed.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question, put and agreed to.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
		    <p class="Q3Motion">That the Road Transport Licensing (Fees) (Amendment)  Regulations (Northern    Ireland) 2007 (S.R. 2007/461) be approved.</p>
		    <p class="H4StageHeading"><a name="3"></a>Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill: Legislative  Consent Motion<span style="font-size:10.5pt; font-weight:normal; "> </span></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Although no time limit is set for the debate, the Business  Committee has agreed that Members&rsquo;  contributions &mdash; other than the Minister&rsquo;s &mdash; should be limited to 5  minutes.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mr McGimpsey)</strong>: I beg to move</p>
		    <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly endorses the principle of the extension to  Northern Ireland of the provisions of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill  dealing with nuisance or disturbance on Health and Social Services premises  which are contained in clause 107 of, and  schedule 18 to, that Bill as introduced in the House of Commons.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill was introduced in  Westminster on  26 June 2007. One section of the Bill deals with nuisance and disturbance in  hospitals in Northern    Ireland. Although, with the Secretary of  State&rsquo;s consent, I could have introduced legislation  in the form of an Assembly Bill, I did not wish to miss the opportunity  presented by the Westminster Bill to make  legislation available at the earliest possible date to assist healthcare  workers.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Health and social  services bodies in Northern    Ireland frequently  experience low-level nuisance or disturbances that cause annoyance to  staff and patients alike. For example, some visitors make undue levels of noise  in hospital wards and waiting rooms and persistently demand the attention of  staff for no medical or other legitimate reason. Such incidents can cause  significant problems, such as low staff morale, absenteeism and low level of  staff retention.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Health and social services staff currently have no power to  remove persons who create a nuisance from hospital premises without the  assistance of the police. The new  legislation will change that. It provides for the creation of a new  offence of refusing to leave hospital premises having caused &ldquo;a nuisance or  disturbance&rdquo; to staff. Secondly, it empowers certain authorised staff, or the  police, to remove from the premises those who create a nuisance or disturbance.  The removal should be undertaken with as little confrontation as possible, and reasonable force should be used only as a last  resort.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The new offence will not apply to patients or to any other  person on the premises:</p>
		    <p class="Q1Quote">&ldquo;for the purpose of obtaining medical advice, treatment or  care&rdquo;.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Neither will it apply to anyone who has a  &ldquo;reasonable excuse&rdquo; for causing nuisance or  disturbance or refusing to leave the premises. For example, the news of  a bereavement, or behaviour caused by concern for a relative, may constitute a reasonable excuse. Authorised staff  will not be permitted to remove a person who requires &ldquo;medical advice,  treatment or care&rdquo;, and that will preserve the rights of individuals to receive  medical treatment.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department will issue guidance on the exercise of the  power of removal. In particular, it will stipulate the type of behaviours that  may be caught by the new offence and the procedures to be observed before a  person is removed. The legislation is restricted to hospital premises only. To  widen the scope of the offence to include a broad range of health and social  services service-provider settings would have proved impractical at this stage.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">If a person is prosecuted and found guilty of an offence,  he or she could receive:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;a fine not exceeding level 3 on the standard scale.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That figure currently stands at &pound;1,000.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am fully aware of the unacceptable number of verbal and physical attacks that are carried out  each year on healthcare staff in  hospitals and in wider community settings.  The new provisions, however, are not intended to deal with such attacks.  My Department is working on proposals to introduce new robust legislation that  will make it a specific offence to carry out such attacks on staff. I will  bring those new proposals to the Health Committee and to the Executive in due  course.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The provisions of the Criminal Justice and Immi&shy;gration Bill are intended to deal with low-level  nuisance and behaviour that causes disturbance in hospitals in Northern Ireland.  Their introduction will empower health and  social services staff to take immediate action to remove those who  create a nuisance or disturbance on the premises. They will act as a deterrent  to those who engage in such behaviour. I ask Members to support the motion.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">12.45 pm</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mrs I Robinson)</strong>:  Over recent years, attacks and assaults on staff working for the emergency  services have increased.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">They range across all the emergency services, from assaults  on doctors, nurses and other front-line hospital staff, particularly in accident and emergency departments, to  attacks on health and social care staff in primary care settings and in the  community, to the emergency services, particularly Ambulance Service and Fire  and Rescue Service staff going about their work, often in trying and difficult  circumstances. All sides of the Assembly agree that such appalling attacks must  end. A comprehensive range of measures will be required to tackle the problem.  Legislation is only one of those measures; nonetheless, it is very important.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Today&rsquo;s motion, which endorses the extension of certain  provisions in the Criminal Justice and Immi&shy;gration Bill to Northern Ireland,  is a welcome move in the right direction, and the Committee for Health, Social  Services and Public Safety fully endorses it. On 22 May, during a debate on  assaults on emergency workers, the Minister gave a commitment that this Bill  would be extended to Northern    Ireland. In September, departmental  officials came before the Committee to explain the provisions in the Bill. They  explained that the Bill will not deal with violent incidents; those must  continue to be dealt with by ordinary criminal law. However, it will deal with  low-level offences, such as where individuals create a nuisance or disturbance  in a hospital setting. If that type of  behaviour is not stopped, it can often lead to more serious disorder or  violence. Unfortunately, the Bill will only apply to health and social care  premises. It will not cover doctors on call, for example, or health and social  care staff working in the community.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee wholeheartedly welcomes the provisions as a  small but significant step in the right direction.  However, we have one concern. The Bill will give power to certain health  and social care employees to remove from  premises any person creating a nuisance or disturbance. The Committee  fully recognises the need for such action to protect staff and patients, but it  wants an assurance that those who are given that power will receive rigorous  and appropriate training. They must be able not only to handle people who are  abusive and aggressive, but to distinguish between someone who is being  threatening or abusive and someone who is agitated or behaving strangely due to  a medical or mental-health condition and who perhaps needs urgent medical or  other attention.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">During the debate on 22 May, the Minister acknowledged that  Northern Ireland  needed a single comprehensive piece of legislation:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;to protect all emergency workers and promote a  culture of zero tolerance towards violence and abuse directed at staff.&rdquo; &mdash; <span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; ">[Official  Report, Vol 22, p182, col 1].</span></span></p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">He also referred to the  Emergency Workers (Scotland) Act 2005. I ask the Minister what progress has  been made over the past six months on developing the proposed consolidated  legislation for Northern Ireland,  similar to that which was introduced in Scotland. When will it be brought  before the Assembly? I support the motion.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat. The provisions in the Criminal Justice and Immigration  Bill relate to nuisance and disturbance. Although this is a reserved matter, it  is a welcome development for staff to be given the authority to remove people  who are creating low-level nuisance. As the Minister said, this relates to  visitors making undue noise and persistent demands on people&rsquo;s attention  without any clear medical reason.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill is a clear  demonstration of the Department&rsquo;s and the Assembly&rsquo;s commitment to  hospital staff. My only regret is that, as the Chairperson of the Health  Committee said, it has not been extended to doctors and other on-call  healthcare professionals. Perhaps we can look at that in the future, because  our support is about recognising the value that we place on all healthcare  workers.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill, as outlined,  will not affect anyone who has what the Minister described as a &ldquo;reasonable excuse&rdquo;  &mdash; for instance, anyone who has just received news of a bereavement or anyone  with certain medical or mental-health difficulties. That is to be welcomed.  Currently, security staff do not have the power to remove anyone who is abusive  or who is causing serious nuisance and disturbance, and they are often left  feeling helpless when such situations arise.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Although I support the motion, I have a couple of caveats.  I am concerned about any potential there might be for the person who is being  removed to suffer any shock or harm. The  Minister mentioned &ldquo;reasonable force&rdquo;, and I would like him to define  that for the House. Will the staff who are using reasonable force be made more  vulnerable? I suppose that that is a catch-22 question. Ultimately, staff will have  to be properly trained, and the training must be constantly monitored and evaluated. I assume that the Bill has been  screened, but I must ask whether it has the potential to affect anyone&rsquo;s  civil or human rights.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that the legislation will lessen the abuse and  attacks that staff, regrettably, have to endure. It will have the potential to  act as a good deterrent; I have no doubt about that. Furthermore, it will  demonstrate that the Assembly places value on all staff and healthcare workers,  as well as on patients and their visitors. As the Chairperson of the Health  Committee said, the Committee supported the zero tolerance policy towards  violence in May, and I am encouraged to see these additional measures afoot. With those caveats, I support the Bill.  Go raibh maith agat.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr Robert  Coulter</strong>: I support the motion, and I am glad that the Health Minister has  brought it before the House. This issue has occupied my attention for some  time, and I have campaigned long and hard. It is completely unsustainable for  any democratic society to allow attacks on health workers, especially in the  accident and emergency departments. I am glad that there are specific  definitive statements set aside to pinpoint the areas in which a criminal  charge can be brought against someone who indulges himself or herself &mdash; under  the influence of alcohol or drugs, or for whatever reason &mdash; on those who are  trying to assist them to regain their health.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, we have to look beyond the hospitals and the  accident and emergency departments. In these days when the health system is  developing and evolving and many health workers are out in the community, we constantly hear stories of those who have gone to  homes to help people and who have been abused verbally and physically by  those whom they have gone to help, or by members of their family. The Bill  should reflect all these things and cover all emergencies in that way.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We are also appalled when we read of attacks on ambulance  workers or on any aspect of the emergency services. The powers must be there to  deal with those who think that it is entertainment to attack ambulance workers  or their vehicles. I trust that the Bill will not be delayed, and that it will  go forward quickly so that healthcare workers can be encouraged and motivated  in the knowledge that this House supports them in the defence of their  principles and their safety.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  The Alliance Party supports the Bill, just as other Members and parties have  done. However, it is important that Members see the motion in its proper  context and recognise that it is a limited element in addressing the broader  problem: the threats to health workers  across the spectrum and in a range of locations.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Obviously, the Minister is restricted today by the terms of  the Bill that was drafted in Westminster  and is up for discussion there. As an Assembly we have a much broader agenda,  and it is important that we recognise that the terms of this piece of  legislation are relatively restricted.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">First of all, it deals effectively with non-criminal behaviour.  While causing a disturbance or nuisance in hospital will not be a criminal  offence, refusal to leave under direction will be. In that sense the Bill  parallels a lot of the antisocial behaviour legislation that has been passed in  the United Kingdom  in recent years.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Like other Members I have concerns over gaps in the  legislation. There are major problems with attacks on healthcare workers  outside formal health-sector buildings, notably ambulance staff, paramedics,  and doctors on call. There is also a parallel with other public-sector workers  &mdash; for example, those who work for the Fire  and Rescue Service. When criminal offences are committed against those who are doing an important job for  the public good of society, it is important that those offences be treated as  aggravated offences, subject to stiffer sentences when the culprits are caught  and brought to justice through the courts. That type of approach would  recognise the serious nature of those offences, in that they are not just  offences against the individuals who carry out the work, but a threat to the  public safety and all of society.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Healthcare workers, like Fire and Rescue Service workers,  must feel confident going into situations where they are required to give  assistance to people who are suffering and in need of urgent medical, or other,  assistance. That needs to be addressed through legislation in this Assembly, because the UK legislation is not  sufficiently broad. I am puzzled as to why that type of legislation is not being put forward on a UK-wide basis,  but, as it is not, it is incumbent upon this Assembly to take action, because  the community at large feels very strongly about this issue.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Another gap in the  legislation is the issue of potential patients themselves causing  problems. The Minister has referred to that. There is a need to ensure that  people who are in need of medical assistance receive it, but we must be equally  conscious that a lot of the problems of nuisance and disturbance come from  patients, or potential patients. I have in mind the situation on a Friday or  Saturday night when a lot of accident and emergency facilities are attended by  people who are under the influence of drink and drugs. That has sometimes  caused major difficulties. We must take that kind of scenario into account and  provide the necessary protection for the staff, who are doing an important job.  Other people using the facilities are also under threat, and it is important  that we consider all of society in the legislation.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Recognising that we can only do what is contained within  the UK Bill at this stage, the Alliance Party is happy to go along with the  motion today, while urging the Minister to take broader action to address the  wider range of concerns.</p>
		    <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Speaker in the Chair).</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  On behalf of the SDLP, I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s proposal. It is both balanced  and reasonable, and should have the support of all Members of the Assembly.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As Dr Farry pointed out, we are dealing with non-criminal  behaviour that manifests itself in low-level nuisance and misbehaviour. This  provision is very limited, but nonetheless to be welcomed by nursing staff and  anyone engaged with working in a hospital setting. I note that the Bill is  confined to hospital buildings, which is perfectly reasonable in the circumstances  that the Minister has highlighted.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In a professional, legal capacity I have come across many  instances of misbehaviour by patients &mdash; and non-patients &mdash; in hospital  buildings.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is a disturbing trend in the Health Service, and it must  be addressed at a broader level by the House.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">1.00 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In a sense, the  Minister is using a mechanism to deal with this type of mischief, to  remedy it and to give the power of removal to hospital authorities. However, it  falls short of what is necessary in a broad range of misbehaviours that affect  Health Service staff across many disciplines.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Justice and policing powers have not been devolved to the  Assembly and, if nothing else, this provision highlights  that gap. The sooner policing and justice powers are devolved to the Assembly,  the sooner we can address the wide range of outstanding issues that affect our  constituents, whether they are workers or people using hospital services.  People in our society are very concerned about nuisance or disturbances in  Health Services premises.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am sure that the Minister feels frustrated about not  being able to address those issues today. The sooner policing and justice  powers are devolved, the sooner we can address them.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I appeal to all Members of the House to work constructively  towards an early return of policing and justice powers to the House. My party  supports the Minister&rsquo;s proposition.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  I thank the Members who have contributed to  the debate. It should be seen as part of an ongoing strategy for zero tolerance in dealing with verbal and  physical attacks and assaults on health and social services staff, not only in  hospitals but wider afield.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Several measures have  already been implemented, including the setting up of a zero-tolerance  strategic group and a publicity campaign. Every trust is required to have  policies in place to deal with violence against staff. We have used advertising  posters and have carried out a leafleting campaign. Over 10,000 personal alarms  have <span style="letter-spacing:-.25pt; ">been issued, a pilot scheme in the  accident and emergency</span> department of the Belfast City   Hospital is operating in  conjunction with the police, and a senior director in each trust has explicit  responsibility for staff safety. We can take those steps thanks to the  opportunity afforded by the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The next stage is proposals for new legislation that will  make it a specific offence to assault any member of the healthcare profession  while he or she is on duty, and we are working on those. Those measures will be  specific to individuals and employees, but  not to premises.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I take Mrs Robinson&rsquo;s  point about low-level nuisance leading to higher levels of nuisance  activity. However, specific guidance will be issued next year as part of the process, so that it will be clear whom hospital  authorities are entitled to evict from Health Service premises and whom they are not. Anyone attending hospital for  medical treatment &mdash; patients or others on the premises to obtain medical  advice or treatment of care &mdash; will be exempt from eviction, because of the  point made by Mrs Robinson, and the point made by Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n about the right  to healthcare treatment. That is part of the thinking behind the measures.  Those rights will not be impeded because of a particular medical condition,  which may cause an individual to appear to act as a nuisance, but whose  behavior is indicative of a deeper medical complaint that requires treatment.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">That is part of a process and strategy that we will  continue to pursue because the number of assaults is rising. In 2006-07, there  were just over 6,000 assaults, and that is completely unacceptable.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Sadly, it is necessary  to bring forward such legislation to  deal with something that should be a given in society: that we look  after those who care for us. However, we must do so. It is not a minimal  response, but, it is, as Mr Maginness described it, a reasonable one, and it is  part of a general strategy to deal with the unacceptable level of violence that is directed towards staff.  Therefore, I ask all Members to support the motion.</p>

		    <p class="H4StageHeading">Health Service Reform</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to one hour and 30 minutes for  the debate. The proposer of the motion will have 10 minutes to propose and 10  minutes to make a winding-up speech. All other Members who speak will have five  minutes.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
		    <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly calls on the Minister of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety to bring forward a health and social services reform  Bill, as a matter of urgency, for consideration by the Assembly.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am delighted to  propose the motion. The DUP cares passionately  about the Health Service, as, I hope, do the other parties in the House.  There was consultation on the draft Health  and Social Services (Reform) (Northern Ireland) Order 2007 from January to April 2007, and, until  8 May, its proposals were widely supported.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In recent times, there has been much discussion about the  Budget allocation for health and whether, in respect of its share of overall  resources, half the cake is sufficient. I am somewhat alarmed by the impression  created by the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety&rsquo;s commitment to reaching his Department&rsquo;s  efficiency targets. I hope and trust that those targets will be reached and  that the efficiency savings, which are  important, will result in an improved Health Service.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In the Democratic Unionist Party, we mean much more when we  speak of efficiencies. Merely meeting efficiency  targets may get us through the next couple of years; however, the position of the Health Service will be no  better in three years&rsquo; time, come the next compre&shy;hensive spending review, when  the massive proportion of the block grant sought by the Department of Health,  Social Services and Public Safety will have rocketed even further. That is why  fundamental change to the operation of the Province&rsquo;s Health Service is  essential.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">This is not about point scoring; it is about getting the  best Health Service for the moneys that are put in. We cannot afford to keep  plugging away with the same old methods, content that health will receive  double-digit increases in Budget after Budget. We cannot have half the cake  now, Minister McGimpsey, and two thirds of it in the future.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Overhauling the way in  which we commission services is vital.  Key to the reforms is the replacement of the four existing health boards  with a single authority, and the establishment of locally based commissioning  groups comprising general practitioners and other local health professionals.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The formation of the single health authority is much more  than a simple matter of rationalisation. The most important consequences of that will concern performance  management and the financial management of health services across the Province.  Until the authority is in place, we will underachieve; we will not realise the  maximum outcomes for the resources that we invest.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister says that he does not want to rush; he wants  to consult with stakeholders. Perhaps he should consult his own party and Assembly group. The Minster&rsquo;s party was  most vociferous in support of reforms &mdash; it was certainly supportive of such  reforms until 8 May 2007, when the Minister took office.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In 2005, when the further consultation document on the  review of public administration (RPA) suggested back&shy;tracking from a single  authority, the Minister&rsquo;s party leader, Reg  Empey, in that party&rsquo;s submission, was quite adamant in stating:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;We view the current proposals as a recipe to continue  the existence of the current health boards without an improvement in service.  The Ulster Unionist Party has proposed the formation of a single Hospital  Authority at the regional level with the creation of primary health care groups&hellip;we cannot agree to the current proposals  as we view them as a retrograde step which, if implemented, would stymie the  development of a&hellip; health service for the 21st century.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Less than one year ago,  his party&rsquo;s health spokes&shy;person, Robert Coulter, said:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The failure to create a single Northern Ireland  hospitals&rsquo; authority is one of many glaring missed opportunities in the RPA  model.&rdquo; &mdash; <span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; ">[Official Report, Bound Volume 21, p63, col 1]</span></span>.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, on 15 November, on &lsquo;Hearts and Minds&rsquo;, UUP Health  Committee member John McCallister described his party spokesman&rsquo;s cherished  single health authority as the &ldquo;mother of all quangos&rdquo;.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Why the sudden change in opinion since the Minster came into office? Where do other members of the  Ulster Unionist Party stand? Are they with their party leader and their  party spokesman, or are they with Michael McGimpsey?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">No doubt, the Minister will continue to prevaricate, and claim that he needs more time. However, few  people in Northern    Ireland buy his excuses. The reforms have  already been the subject of consultation twice. Too much time has already been  lost. The current health structures have  been in place for 35 years, yet, bizarrely, the Minister has argued that  that is all the more reason to take his time.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Undoubtedly, some people are resistant to change. The House  can only hope that the Minister is not one of  them. Northern Ireland  cannot afford a Health Service that operates in that way and is still in  the mindset of the early 1970s.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We must increase productivity, because it is 11% worse than  that in England.  Doctors, nurses and all the other front  line staff work tirelessly. There is little more scope to increase the  work that they do. They are not working 11%  less hard than their colleagues in England. I have no doubt  that even to suggest that would make them fairly angry. Therefore, the problem  must be the way in which the system works. A new system of commissioning is  needed, with incentives to increase performance. Health professionals view the  Minister&rsquo;s delay as a blow to the completion of the reform that has been  ongoing for more than five years.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There are now only five  trusts. I welcome that reduc&shy;tion, with the proviso that commissioning  structures should be put in place to reflect the needs of patients in a  bottom-up &mdash; rather than a top-down &mdash; manner.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Belfast Health and  Social Care Trust is the largest such  body in the United Kingdom,  and one of the largest in Europe, with  22,000 staff. It spends &pound;3 million every day.  An organisation that large makes the establishment of a regional  authority a necessity.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">1.15 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">One of the targets in  the draft Programme for Govern&shy;ment is to reduce by 50% the number of  unplanned hospital admissions by 2011. That  can be achieved only by investing in better care in the community,  primary-care intervention and self-care. Commissioning bodies should be  facilitators in this, comprising GPs, dentists, pharmacists, optometrists, lay  people, allied health professionals and  nurses, all working together to com&shy;mission services for patients in  their areas of expertise.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The single health authority was to be the commiss&shy;ioning  organiser, maintaining the local care groups and commissioning regional services &mdash; a single bureaucracy that would support local groups and reduce  duplication. Its performance-management role would be the key to holding  local commissioning groups and trusts to account &mdash; something previously sadly  lacking in the National Health Service in Northern Ireland. Doctors and  nurses are constantly being  quality-assessed for their competence to practice. However, nothing ever seemed to be in place to  suff&shy;iciently assess management structures.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Many staff nearing retirement saw the overhaul of  structures as a chance to plan for early retirement, allowing flexibility in  the service in order to keep the number of compulsory redundancies to a  minimum. Some have already gone, but others are now being told that the change  has been delayed for at least one year. That is not the greatest  morale-booster.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">People in the boards  are working in stressful conditions, and  vacancies are not being filled. That could be forgiven with the April  2008 deadline fast approaching and a target to work towards. What impact will  the delay until at least 2009 have on the vacancy controls? What reforms will  be implemented to ensure that there are few compulsory redundancies?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There was a lot of  scepticism in the medical profession about these reforms, and it took a  long time to bring them on board, particularly the doctors. The delay is a  major let-down; one needs only to read this morning&rsquo;s newspapers to see that.  The legislative process must commence. Members do not necessarily have to agree  on everything at this stage &mdash; it is unlikely that we will &mdash; but let us get the  process moving by introducing the Bill and having the debates. The Minister  wants to talk to stakeholders &mdash; let us use  the time now to do that. The Minister should not waste valuable months,  and maybe even years, consulting before finally introducing a Bill, only for Members to have to go away and consult  again.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The UUP tabled a motion criticising the legislation that is  passing before this House. There is no reason not to have a health reform Bill.  The excuses for delay from the half-the-cake Minister are, unfortunately, only  half-baked.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs O&rsquo;Neill</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I speak in favour of the motion, and I  agree with most of the comments made by Mrs Robinson regarding fundamental  change in the Health Service&rsquo;s being essential. It is important to get the best  service with the resources that we have.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The review of public  administration has been ongoing since 2002, when the Office of the First  Minister and deputy First Minister (OFMDFM) launched the initial consultation  on its terms of reference. The premise of the review was to reduce bureaucracy,  create savings and restructure the public  sector. Regarding the changes to the Health Service, five new health  trusts have already been created, which is a welcome reduction from the  overburdened 18 health trusts. However, in order to complement those changes,  we need the introduction of the health and social care authority, the  establishment of local commissioning groups, and the one-patient client  council.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The main driver for change in what was to be the new  healthcare environment was to be a revolution in commissioning. The  introduction of those structures is vital to counterbalance the powers of the  newly estab&shy;lished trusts. We now find ourselves in limbo in that regard.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister has stated that he wants to take his time to  fully consider the impact of pushing forward with  those changes, and that he wants to get the changes right. I agree with  him in that respect &mdash; they must be right; we do not want to see change for the  sake of change, with no benefit to the  Health Service. However, a  prioritisation of those issues by the Minister is required.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The failure to push on  with change is leaving the Health Service  in disarray. Morale in the Health Service is low, and many rumours are  circulating regarding what is happening to people&rsquo;s jobs, to commissioning  powers, and regarding the retention and recruitment of staff.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That is all  detrimental to good working environments. It would be remiss of Members, as  elected representatives, to ignore the comments of health professionals  who are directly involved and who are concerned at the decision being deferred  for at least a year.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I have been lobbied by  GPs who have been appointed to local commissioning groups. One GP  described the current situation as a hiatus in the development of those groups.  GPs say that the groups sit monthly and are wasting public money: they are  starting to become disheartened and feel  like withdrawing from the groups, as they do not want to support a sham.  Apparently, the local commissioning groups nominally share respons&shy;ibilities for decisions on commissioning that are  actually made by the boards.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">From those comments, it is clear that the support gained from doctors and other health  professionals over the past 18 months, and the impetus in taking forward  the proposed RPA changes, are in danger of being lost. Further delay in RPA  reforms will impact negatively on the savings that they are designed to  achieve.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It has been suggested that some services are already being  removed or withheld; for example, according to one trust area, cognitive  behavioural therapy has been suspended due to the present uncertainty. I am  sure that the Minister will agree that that is not in keeping with his commitment to make mental-health services a  priority.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The current situation is frustrating and confusing for all involved. I know that the Minister must take  difficult decisions, but I urge him to take them as a priority. We want  a Health Service that caters for the needs of all and that is efficient and  accountable for the benefit of all the people of the North. I support the  motion.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr Robert  Coulter</strong>: I am glad that the motion has been tabled. Anyone looking at the  monolith of the Health Service will agree that reform is necessary. I am glad  that the Chairperson of the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety, who tabled the motion, has  noticed that the Ulster Unionist Party has called for this kind of reform for  quite some time.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">My question is: what kind of single health authority do we  want? The proposal is for a health and social services authority that will  replace the four health boards. Such an  organisation has been asked for, through legislation, for some time. It  would have an annual budget of &pound;140 million and 1,800 staff. Members should  look at that proposal and see it for what it is: a glorified quango. I am sure  that those who propose the motion do not wish to advance &ldquo;quangoland&rdquo; in Northern Ireland  any further. We have far too many quangos, and we do not want a super-quango  that will drain &pound;140 million from the health budget every year and carry a  burden of 1,800 staff.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Royal College of Nursing has supported the Minister&rsquo;s  stance and believes that the direct rule proposals now being adopted by the DUP  are flawed because they fail to provide for accountability. The health and  social services super-quango is to have 11 senior executives on salaries that  will be well in excess of &pound;100,000. The monstrous and unaccountable health and  social services authority was the creature of direct rule Ministers. Why is the  DUP adopting this further drain on the Health Service budget?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The recent draft Programme for Government made us all sit  up and ask where we had heard it all before. An Ulster Unionist Minister is  crying for more money for the Health Service; but what was presented as new was an amalgam of Bills generated by the Civil  Service machine under direct rule Ministers and rehashed and represented  to us.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In other spheres, a sensible solution would be called for. The one thing that I am afraid of is that,  under political pressure, and because  he belongs to one particular party, the Health Minister would bring  forward something not carefully thought through.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I think back many  years, to the time when we looked for a new hospital in Ballymena. Under  political pressure, the location of the new hospital was changed from Ballymena  and it was built in Antrim. We were told that that was the right hospital in the right place. Looking back over the past few  years, some may have commented that it would have been better had time  been taken to think the project through properly, in which case the hospital  would not have been located in Antrim, but  in or near Ballymena, where it would have better served the area to the  north-east of our Province.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The trade union UNISON has said that that model, which some are attempting to rush through the  Assembly, was in direct contradiction to the structures-and-reform model  that was developed locally in the Hayes Report, and the RPA process. UNISON  went further, and stated that the draft Order was established without specific  consultation or an equality assessment, and replicated the dysfunctional  elements of English Health Service delivery, including the purchaser/provider  split, and the retention of the trust model.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Unionists correctly said that they believed that  legislation should be drafted in response to the consult&shy;ation and introduced  as an Act of the Assembly for consideration in the Chamber, and by the  Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety, as per the normal  legislative process.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Health Service is not a toy to be played with among  political parties; it is for the patients, whom we should put first, rather  than our political ideals.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Hanna</strong>: I  had tabled an amendment to the motion, and I am sorry that it was not accepted.  I am not sure why that was, because a much  more constructive debate is necessary.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I do not believe that there is any Member &mdash; not the  Minister, the Chairperson, or any members of the Committee for Health, Social  Services and Public Safety &mdash; who does not subscribe to the idea of radical  reform of health and personal social services.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">First, I shall deal with the proposal for a single health  authority. In common with other Members, I have some reservations and concerns  about delays, the detrimental impact on staff morale, and the potential loss of  savings. The new health and social care authority must commission services on a  regional basis. Unfortunately, five minutes does not give me time to go into the  other recommendations, but they are equally important.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Thanks to the findings of the Appleby Report and the  Wanless Report, it has been well established that the Northern Ireland  health spend is higher than in GB, although the differential is eroding. Professor  Appleby also makes it clear that the differential for Northern Ireland&rsquo;s needs  &mdash; on indicators agreed in the Department of Finance and Personnel &mdash; has  increased from 7% to 14%, and that the funding gap based on need rather than  raw population is thought to be around &pound;300 million. By 2011, that gap will  increase to &pound;600 million.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Those realities must be recognised by the Assembly. That funding shortfall will not go away. Despite  bickering among Members and parties, the shortfall remains, and if we are  serious about looking after the health of the people of Northern Ireland,  we must decide how we will address that. There are things that we can do: we can encourage people to take responsibility for  their own health; we can examine the  issue of repeat prescriptions; and we  can educate doctors to save money by prescribing generic drugs and  reducing prescriptions.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Members will know that  70% of the health spend goes on staff pay, and through the RPA, we are  considering a reduction in staff, partly  through wastage, and through the reduction  of bureaucracy and administrative duplication. The Bamford Review has made a strong economic case based on  early intervention and increased action to  promote good mental and physical health, particularly through early intervention,  parenting and early-years support.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">1.30 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The National Health Service celebrates its sixtieth  anniversary in July 2008. Its founder, Aneurin Bevan, described it as &ldquo;pure  socialism&rdquo;. I prefer to say that the most socialist initiative that a democratic  Government ever took is also the most politically popular. It is the hallmark  of a decent society that it has an excellent and  equitable healthcare system. The founding principle of the National  Health Service was that it must be free at the point of need, even though  healthcare demands are unimaginably different and complex compared with  anything that was envisaged 60 years ago.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There must be greater efficiency, effectiveness, innovation  and value for money in the deployment of healthcare,  and the SDLP fully backs those demands. My party accepts that the growth of a dynamic and innovative economy is a priority. However, it must also be  accepted that to have a physically  and mentally healthy population is the best investment than can be made  in any society. People are society&rsquo;s biggest  asset. The 10% productivity gap between Northern Ireland and GB in the  delivery of health services can and must be closed.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  Like other parties, the Alliance Party supports  the motion. However, Members must recognise that the motion has been  tabled in the wider context of a row between the DUP and the Ulster Unionists  over the health budget.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Members must also be  conscious that Health Service reform is not, by any means, the only area  in which the Executive have been dragging  their feet with the review of public administration. The feet-dragging  that has occurred over the health and social care authority runs parallel to  that which the Minister of Education and her Department have been doing over  the education and skills authority. Therefore, rather than focus on the failure of one particular Minster, Members must  recognise that there has been broader failure in the Executive to deal  with the difficult choices that must be made in governing Northern Ireland.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Members must also be conscious that there is now a  democratically elected Assembly for Northern Ireland. With it, the  context changes radically. It leads much more easily to the creation of  Northern Ireland-wide single authorities to deliver the outcomes of policy decisions  that are taken by Ministers and MLAs. There is  a strong case for having a single health and social care authority for Northern Ireland,  which has a population of 1&middot;8 million people. A health authority for that size  of population is not unusual in many other regions on these islands.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Many Members are conscious of inconsistencies in the health and social care that is offered across Northern    Ireland. Although that is a matter for the trusts, boards, or whoever  their successors are, a single health authority for Northern Ireland can only assist in the process  to establish consistency in the service across Northern Ireland.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Budgetary considerations  for a single health authority are also relevant to the debate. Members  must be conscious of the fact that the health sector is under tremendous  funding pressures. For example, Northern Ireland has enhanced need per capita  compared with elsewhere on these islands; a greater number of the population is in worse health; drugs are becoming  more expensive; the cost of healthcare technology is rising; and people  are living longer, which, although that is to be welcomed, creates its own  financial pressures.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Northern Ireland also has growing demand for measures such  as free personal care for the elderly &mdash; a matter that is close to the heart of  my colleague from Strangford, Mr McCarthy. It is important that such issues are  put on the agenda. At present, Northern    Ireland suffers from the opportunity costs of not  dealing with fundamental reform in the health system.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">My party has considerable sympathy with the Minister&rsquo;s call  for more funds. Despite the fact that the health sector gets the lion&rsquo;s share  of funds, enhanced need in Northern Ireland  means that it is falling behind the rate of growth in the rest of the UK. The  Assembly must reflect on and tackle those statistics.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>:  Does the Member accept that the health sector gets 51% of all new moneys?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  fully accept that point. Equally, that amount  of money is not sufficient to meet the gap between health funding in Northern Ireland and that in the rest of the UK.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  Will the Member accept that it is immoral to do the same thing, over and over  again? Moreover, if there are efficiency savings to be made &mdash; and increased  productivity &mdash; that allow moneys to be  released, that should be done. We should not continue to do the same old  thing, time and time again. The Appleby Report highlighted the fact that there  are efficiencies to be made. Surely major efficiencies can be made, even by simply establishing a single  authority?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member has an additional minute for taking two interventions.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  do not agree with the honourable lady that  it is immoral. Nevertheless, I agree with the remainder of her point. We  cannot stick with the status quo; we must have change in Northern Ireland.  By the same token, there are areas of the health sector that require urgent  investment. The Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, to his  credit, set out a comprehensive list of bids under the comprehensive spending  review. Virtually none of those bids was met.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There are matters that the Assembly has endorsed &mdash; for  example: free personal care for the elderly; free prescriptions; increased funding for mental health; and the recommendations of the Bamford Review. We are  losing out on those issues, because we have not addressed the reforms.  However, we still need an uplift in the health budget to meet those additional  costs, something that we cannot even remotely consider at present.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Although the honourable  lady is correct in saying that we  must have greater reforms in the Health Service and greater  efficiencies, the Minister is equally right in saying that we are losing out on  money and that the funding gap with the rest of the UK is getting wider and  wider. It is important that we do not polarise the debate and that we recognise  that we need to move forward on both those strands in order to provide a Health  Service that is fit for purpose.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  Will the Member accept that &pound;2 billion was provided for the health budget in  2000-01? In 2007-08, &pound;4 billion will be provided for the health budget. Will he  agree that we have seen double the benefits to the Health Service because of  the doubling of that budget?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  The Member is correct about the figures. Health budgets across the UK have risen  at the same rate. Northern Ireland  is no different to any other part of the UK. We need to find greater  efficiencies and to release that money to reinvest in other facilities.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Will the Member bring his comments to a close?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  Thank you, Mr Speaker.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>:  The people of Northern Ireland  had every reason to expect that the  establishment of devolved Government  at Stormont would deliver a more efficient and better Health Service for Northern Ireland. We have  had 40 years of terrorism and civil upheaval that has left us with an  infrastructure that needs to be renewed. We are left with an economy that has  suffered greatly as our traditional industries have declined. We have had years  of direct rule by Ministers who have not faced up to their responsibilities as  they might have done. We have had four decades of wasted opportunity, economic  inertia and instability.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We have seen many plans,  investigations and reviews set in motion. However, the truth is that we  have seen a great deal of prevarication,  with important and critical decisions being deferred to another day in  the hope that the problems would go away or be dealt with by someone else. It  is now time to deal with the problems and to stop waiting for other people to  solve them. It is time to get to work to build the better Northern Ireland  that we promised our constituents when we sought election to the Assembly.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">When it comes to dividing  and apportioning financial resources to the Departments, we know that  those resources are limited. The cake that is to be divided out is a certain size, and no amount of discussion  will avoid the necessity of taking hard decisions. The only way in which  to increase the size of the cake is to grow a dynamic, innovative economy. In  that endeavour, we need to examine every aspect of the way in which we do  things to ensure that, in every area of public life, we are making the best of  our resources.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We need to ensure that, in every division of our economy,  we have highly efficient and effective public services that deliver value for  every pound that is spent and that make the  best use of the revenue provided, and of  our existing assets. We must all accept that collective decisions will be made that challenge individual  Ministers and Departments. It is vital to ensure that pressures are  placed equally on all Departments and that they all accept that they have a  responsibility to work for the common good.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There is a  responsibility on all Ministers to ensure that their Departments are challenged and stretched to make their  part of the overall organisation more streamlined, more effective and less expensive. The fact that something is  better does not always mean that it has to cost more money. We must examine every aspect of our endeavours to ensure  that they are the best that they can be.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The health budget of &pound;3&middot;8 billion represents 48% of the  entire block grant for the Province. Indications are that, in the next three  years, health and social services will receive 51% of all new moneys. We spend  more per capita of the population on health than the rest of the United Kingdom,  yet our output is much poorer. I have worked  most of my adult life in the Health Service, and my experience has given  me a belief that as much money as possible should be spent on the people who  need help and on those who are in the front line in providing that help.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We must do away with expensive quangos. We need centres of  excellence and increased productivity. We need to make massive efficiencies in  the cost of drugs. We must look particularly at the level of staff in administrative areas of the Department of Health,  Social Services and Public Safety (DHSSPS), and there must be joined-up  practice across the various trusts.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The levels of sickness and the cause of low morale among  staff must be examined. Outpatient waiting lists must be reduced, and there  should be charges for those who miss appointments without offering a reason or  any notice of their intentions. Salaries and wages must be considered, and an  equitable system developed in which nurses, in particular, receive a fair wage.  We must also consider closely those who earn  large salaries, including doctors, to  ensure that there is fair distribution all round.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We desperately need to  reduce waste and bureaucracy. Those who work in DHSSPS know that those  changes are necessary. Above all, the four health boards must be replaced by  one streamlined cost-effective authority that could establish locally based  commissioning and enhanced responses to local needs.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The UUP&rsquo;s response to the RPA consultation in February 2004  said that Northern Ireland  has the most over-administered Health  Service in the United    Kingdom. In 2005, when it seemed as though Professor Appleby was less than enthusiastic, Sir Reg Empey reminded us  that:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The Ulster Unionist  Party has proposed the formation of a single authority at the regional  level with the creation of primary health care groups.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Ulster Unionist  Party&rsquo;s 2005 manifesto said that:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;&hellip;there&rsquo;s too much bureaucracy and too little  flexibility.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;To reduce bureaucracy</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">We would replace Northern Ireland&rsquo;s 4 health boards  with 1 health authority.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">That reflected the 2001 manifesto, in which it was said that co-operatives, with control of their own  budgets, should be formed to deliver primary care locally, and that  acute care should be managed through a single Northern Ireland authority.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Why then has the Minister refused to act on the advice and intentions of his own party and its  manifesto? It is time for the Minister to get on with his job and stop  his whinging &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member&rsquo;s time is almost up.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>: &mdash;  and provide a better Health Service for the people of Northern Ireland.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. On 9 October of this year, the  Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety announced that the  structures for health and social care trusts and the Ambulance Service would  not change until April 2009. The reasons given were the need to ensure that we get it right, and, in particular, to ensure  that any new structures and changes will deliver the best outcome for  people &mdash; and, above all else, meet local needs.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I doubt that any Member would argue against that. We all  want to ensure that any change will result in better outcomes for staff,  patients and carers. We are all committed to reforming and improving services  for people who seek health, some of whom are among the most vulnerable in our  society.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Improving services for staff, patients and carers is a  priority for everyone, and the need to augment the out&shy;dated structures and services that should be germane to achieving effectiveness and raising public  confidence in our health and social care system is now a matter of  concern.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">That having been said, the rationale behind the motion is  about having the drive and the ability to see those changes through and to end  the uncertainty that has become prevalent throughout the health and social care  system.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Most, if not all, of us have been recipients of health and social care to some degree or another. We all  expect that care to be effective,  and we expect delivery. However, the delay in establishing a single  healthcare authority has unsettled many in  our health and social care system.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Let us reflect on some of the main themes of the proposed  restructuring. The first is a new health and social care authority to replace  the existing four health and social services boards. The second is to establish  seven primary-care-led commissioning groups in the local authority, which will  involve local health and social care professionals. It will also involve lay  representatives in planning services at community level and in partnership with  communities. The third is the abolition of certain agencies and the transfer of  their functions, staff, assets and liabilities to other health and social care  bodies.</p>

		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety  has met, and will continue to meet, staff-side representatives from the unions  and some of the colleges. There are concerns about the length of time in which  reforms were to occur. People in the system are fatigued, and burnt-out by  reviews and the prospect of more of the same. That has had an impact on Health Service staff. Despite that, they have  continued to provide services and care with compassion and  professionalism of the highest standard.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion calls for the Minister of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety to introduce a health and social services reform  Bill as a matter of urgency. He should also try to ensure that reform takes  place. We must make sure that the issue is not ducked. Local communities must  be able to play a meaningful role, such as taking part in local commissioning  groups. Some of those groups have argued that they have been considered as  add-ons, rather than being integral to the health agenda.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We must all acknowledge  and embrace the challenges that reform will bring. The review of public  administ&shy;ration, the Executive&rsquo;s Agenda for Change strategy and the need for better investment in mental-health  services must be time-bound, and our approach must be based on the  realisation that our Health Service is 35 years old and is becoming archaic.  The Assembly must see movement; otherwise, the anticipated savings that can be  accrued from reform will begin to dwindle. We will also lose experienced and  highly-trained staff, which will have a long-term impact on the health system.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I support the motion on the basis that if a health and  social services reform Bill is introduced, we can scrutinise it line-by-line,  and end the wait for overdue reform, restructuring and implementation. As  elected representatives mandated by the people, we all agree that the lack of  investment under direct rule has had an impact.  We have a responsibility to bring about changes that ensure equality for all citizens, regardless of post&shy;code.  Go raibh maith agat.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>: I welcome the opportunity to participate in this debate, and I  congratulate my colleagues on securing the  debate on such an important issue. We have clearly shown how we all support the guiding principles of the  National Health Service, how each and every one of us wants to see a better  Health Service for all of the people of Northern Ireland, and how we all  admire the dedication to duty of our health professionals.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Earlier, we heard about  some of the physical dangers that they have to face in the line of their  duty. Yet, all of their efforts are being  hampered by systemic problems that  stifle the NHS in Northern    Ireland. We have already heard from  the Chairperson of the Health Committee how spending on health and social care  in Northern Ireland will more than double from &pound;2 billion in 2001 to over &pound;4 billion in the current Budget period.  However, nobody could say that  productivity in the Health Service in  Northern Ireland  has doubled over that period, proving the point made in the Appleby  Report that it is the use of resources rather than the amount of those  resources that is important.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is worth reminding  the House of some of the grave inefficiencies in the Health Service in Northern Ireland  that were highlighted by Professor John  Appleby during the course of his work. He found that the unit cost of  hospital procedures, hospital throughput, consultant productivity, the average  length of stay in hospital and spending per  head on prescriptions were all significantly worse in Northern Ireland than in England. Even  if we were as efficient as England  &mdash; hardly a model of efficiency in health provision itself &mdash; immense differences  could be achieved. More patients could be seen in less time, and massive  savings could be made for front-line services.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Reform that targets  those inefficiencies and improves the way in which the Health Service  does its business is long overdue. That is why we all supported the  consultation on the draft health and social services (reform) (Northern Ireland)  Order 2007. One would have thought that this issue would have been at the top  of the new Minister&rsquo;s agenda. During a debate last week, the Member for North  Down Brian Wilson compared the Health Service in Northern Ireland to an oil tanker.  However, if we are to change direction we must start turning the wheel. Since  assuming office, the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety has  shown no desire to address seriously the radical reform of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  Health Service that is required. If anything, he has shown himself to be a  roadblock to reform.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Instead of tackling the issue head-on, he is heading in the  opposite direction. Instead of doing what would receive widespread support in  the House and further afield, he has  illustrated a desire to head in the opposite direction, exemplified by his freeze on the RPA reforms in  health. The creation of a single health authority and local commissioning boards has been widely recognised as being an  essential element in a more efficient and effective health service. I only wish  that the Minister would show as much passion  about tackling inefficiencies in the Health Service as he does about  whingeing and crying for more money.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As other Members have said, the Ulster Unionist Party was  in favour and supportive of the reforms. Around a year ago, the UUP&rsquo;s health  spokesman, Rev Coulter, said that the failure to create a single authority was  one of the many glaring missed opportunities in the restructuring model. One  might ask what has happened to the UUP&rsquo;s  2005 election manifesto pledge:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;To reduce bureaucracy</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">We would replace Northern Ireland&rsquo;s 4 health boards  with 1 health authority.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">It seems that ditching election manifestos is now  at epidemic proportions in the UUP.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There is a consequence  for not carrying forward those reforms. Dr Brian Patterson, chairman of  the BMA (British Medical Association) Northern Ireland Council, recently said:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The health boards are required to soldier on for at  least another 18 months, but are they fit for purpose? They have lost many core  staff to the new trusts or left the Health Service entirely. Those who are left  are demoralised and paralysed to an extent by uncertainty.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The BMA&rsquo;s criticism was shown to be spot on when  that sense of paralysis and poor morale resulted in the resignation of David  Sissling as chief executive designate of the HSSA (Health and Social Services  Authority). A man whose capture was a coup for Northern Ireland has been lost to  our Health Service, and our patients and health professionals will prove to be  losers for that.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As if demoralisation and paralysis were not bad enough, the state of stasis comes at a cost. Key  manage&shy;ment staff that have been appointed to the HSSA at an estimated  cost of &pound;500,000 are still in post. Rather than costing money to create the  HSSA, it is costing much more not to go ahead with it. Foot-dragging is costing  us a fortune. I urge the Minister to listen to what has been said in the  Chamber today and to listen to people in the Health Service, and health  professionals in bodies such as the BMA, who are urging him to move forward and  get on with his job and do what he knows he has to do.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Some strange and bizarre claims have been made today. Since Mr Hamilton is so  good with election manifestos, will he consider reading his own party&rsquo;s  manifesto, as well as ours? The DUP&rsquo;s 2005 manifesto states:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Northern    Ireland has suffered from relative  underfunding for decades. More than 20%  extra spending per capita on health care is required to achieve the same  level of service as England.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is strange that the DUP has made such a turnaround. The  DUP&rsquo;s 2007 manifesto states that:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;the Health Service  in Northern Ireland has  suffered from long-term under-funding relative to the rest of the UK.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The problem with the DUP&rsquo;s finance and personnel spokesman,  Mr Hamilton, contributing to the debate on health is that he is fixated with  the money; that aspect is all that he knows. It is strange that in the House of  Commons on 5 April 2005, a month before the general election, Mrs Robinson  criticised the direct rule health budget increase of 9% as insufficient. Why is  a 1&middot;2% increase sufficient now?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  Does the Member accept that the allocation in the draft Budget to health  includes not only that increase, but much, much more for health?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>: The increase will give the Minister of Health &pound;16 million to  develop new activities in the Health Service this year. Mrs Robinson quoted  some figures on how much the Health Service spends each day and mentioned the Belfast trust; &pound;16  million would not run the Health Service for two days.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Easton keeps bringing up the old chestnut that 48% of  the draft Budget is to go on health provision. However, the Department&rsquo;s  portfolio covers health, social services and public safety &mdash; everything from  doctors and nurses to the Fire and Rescue Service.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:<span class="Italic"> </span><span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; ">It was  &pound;2 billion before that.</span></span></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  You are on record as saying that that is not enough.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  And it is &pound;4 billion now.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. The Member has the Floor.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  The DUP has clearly distinguished between  direct rule Ministers&rsquo; policies, which it criticised, and those of the  proposed strategic health and social services authority. Its proposals differ  little from those advocated under direct rule. However, the DUP suddenly wants  to run with the direct rule Ministers&rsquo; proposals. Even Mr Hamilton said in his contribution  that England  was not a great model of financial efficiency to follow, so why does he wish to  impose the same system here?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Labour Government in Britain have increased bureaucracy  in the NHS enormously. In England,  the average number of managers grew from 21,400 in 1997 to 30,900 in 2002.  Central-function staff numbers there have increased from just under 61,000 to  more than 72,000 in the same period. Most of the extra money that the  Government have pumped into the NHS &mdash; money that is in no way matched in  Northern Ireland &mdash; has gone on bureaucracy, consultants and administration.  Experts consider &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I will, if the Member is quick.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  I may have misunderstood the Member, but does  he suggest that to pump more money into  additional staff and management is the right direction in which to go?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: The Member, because he has taken two interventions, may speak  for an extra minute.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Thank you, Mr Speaker.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I propose that we get the model right, because there is no  point in our jumping headlong into something. As Dr Coulter has pointed out, it  has already cost &pound;140 million to create the strategic health and social  services authority.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>: <span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; ">You supported the</span></span></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Your party supported a 20% rise in its 2005 election manifesto, but it does not  &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. The Member has the Floor.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  The Member&rsquo;s party supported a 20% rise in its 2005 election manifesto, but it  does not seem to trouble her much to go back on that promise.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The way in which to  handle the situation is to establish a  plan for where our Health Service is headed. Everyone agrees that it  needs to be reformed, and everyone agrees that that reform project is huge. I  have every confidence that the Minister will deliver on a reform agenda. I know  that the Chairperson of the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public  Safety likes to engage in party political point scoring, but there is too big a  job at hand for her to be doing that. The Committee should be working with &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I have already given way to Mrs Robinson once, Mr Speaker. She is not as  generous with her time when she is speaking.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>: <span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; ">Nobody asked me to give way.</span></span></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Basil McCrea asked you to give way, and you refused.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We must get Health  Service reform right. The Minister is right to take his time and consult  with people so that we might get the model that we want. Our view of healthcare  is very different from that of the DUP. Mrs Robinson may think that the best  way in which to deliver healthcare is to have one hospital in Belfast and have everyone drive to it &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member&rsquo;s time is almost up.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Thank you, Mr Speaker.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  I welcome this important debate on the reform of the Health Service. We must  not allow political point scoring to distract us from that debate, because, as  elected representatives, we are all aware of the demands that are placed on the  Health Service, day and daily. We are also aware of the support that the Health  Service needs in order for it to deliver.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to state an important fact about need. The Appleby Report pointed out that, although a  differential did exist between here and GB, based on need, of 7%, that  differential has now risen to 14%. That is an inescapable fact whether it  occurs in the Department of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety, the Department for Social Development, the  Department of Finance and Personnel, or wherever.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We all know that health professionals, carers and the service users have highlighted how they find the  uncert&shy;ainty that surrounds proposed Health Service structures confusing  and worrying.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We know that some of those problems have been inherited  from the period of direct rule, but we know also that, as an Assembly, we must  move on and deal with those issues, and establish plans and timetables as  quickly as possible.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">2.00 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Important issues must be tackled, including the future of  primary care and mental-health plans, the care of the elderly, and, not least,  the morale of health workers. Morale is very low due to growing pressures, and  because of delays in implementing the Agenda for Change programme.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I draw Members&rsquo; attention to the situation in the Western  Health and Social Care Trust area, where 99% of workers have gone through the  job-matching process, yet 32% of them have still not received their pay award.  In the Northern Health and Social Care Trust area, 20% of workers have still to  receive their pay award, which is backdated to 2003. It is a disgrace that, at  Christmas 2007, key workers still have not received their payments.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I share the view that the Health Service is failing to  satisfy the public because of some inefficiencies and the seemingly endless  bureaucracy that many users encounter. Those matters must be addressed. As the  motion states, reform of the Health Service must be &ldquo;a matter of urgency&rdquo; for  the Assembly.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to turn to PFIs because, as we know, 10 new  hospitals are in the pipeline under that process, and some of the tenders are  at an advanced stage. The Enniskillen hospital is the pathfinder PFI project,  and that is moving forward. We cannot afford to make mistakes, because we have  seen them made elsewhere with PFI projects. Currently, there is not a  Department-led, coherent approach to the  handling of PFI initiatives.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  Will the Member agree that it would be most unfortunate if members of the  Health Committee were to initiate a process in an attempt to stop progress on  the hospital for the south-west, which is to be built at Enniskillen?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  It would be most unfortunate were anyone to  try to delay progress on that hospital. However, in reality, it is too late for delays. Progress is being made,  but an inconsistent approach to such big undertakings has been adopted by the  Department. That could prove very costly. For example, in the Western Health  and Social Care Trust area, people and  services are included in PFI tenders, and that has led to concerns about  jobs and working conditions. In the Belfast Health and Social Care Trust area,  there is an entirely different approach whereby people and services are not  included in the tenders.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There are important issues in respect of jobs and  conditions, and people know what has happened in England, where some PFI projects have been disastrous  and where private operators have been able to make savings by cutting design  standards and by reducing bed numbers.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">All 10 of the new hospitals that are planned under PFI  arrangements are crucial. The Department of Health must ensure that all the  trusts adopt a common approach in order to avoid the mistakes that have been  made elsewhere.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Robinson</strong>:  I pay tribute to Health Service staff, who carry out their duties in a  professional and diligent way &mdash; sometimes at personal risk, as we have heard.  Everyone in Northern Ireland  should be grateful that such dedicated people work in the NHS.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In the DUP&rsquo;s 2007  manifesto, we committed ourselves to improving the Health Service in the  Province. We knew that that would involve tackling the problems of  understaffing, trolley waits, health promotion, illness prevention, addressing  the needs of our longer-living population, services for the disabled, and, most  of all, effective use of the available resources.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Health Minister seems to be unwilling to accept those  aims, despite having almost half of the entire Northern Ireland Budget to  spend.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">If more money were to be made available to the Minister,  which Department does he suggest should take a cut in budget? Every Department  faces financial challenges, and all Ministers are addressing problems in  prioritising resources. All of them accept that there has to be a greater return for every &pound;1 spent. For health, that will involve looking at innovative ways of  carrying out treatments; greatly reducing the number of read&shy;missions;  tackling hospital-acquired infections such as MRSA; and adopting a more  community-based approach to care.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The best way to start the improvements that we all want in  the NHS is by ensuring that there are enough well-trained, highly motivated  staff with high morale to carry out patient  care. As someone who, from personal experience, understands the need for  a motivated workforce, I believe that we must address the current low morale of  NHS staff. I am frequently told about that by NHS staff and it must be the  starting point for all reforms of health provision.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We acknowledge that all areas of public-sector funding in Northern Ireland  have suffered; the Appleby Report confirmed that. Therefore it is essential  that every &pound;1 spent on the NHS produces the  greatest possible benefit for the population. One way of achieving that is  to move towards a Health Service delivery system that focuses on prevention rather than cure. The Minister should  not be afraid of examining models in countries that have preventative rather than curative health service provision models for ideas on how our healthcare  model can be reformed and adapted.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I could give the Minister a long list of suggestions, but  he may not want to hear them, and I have only a few minutes to speak. I ask him  to examine the area of neurology urgently. Northern Ireland has a chronic  shortage of neurologists, which needs to be addressed urgently because it  affects those with long-term &mdash; and lifelong &mdash; health requirements who therefore  have greater need of medical support and expertise.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am sure that the Assembly understands that any reforms  proposed will be implemented in the mid- to long term. However, it is important  that the Assembly hear the Minister&rsquo;s  vision for reform urgently. I support the motion.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I congratulate my colleagues on tabling the motion. The issue is close to the  hearts of many inside and outside the  Chamber who want to hear what will happen to the Department of Health,  Social Services and Public Safety.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I contacted the Minister recently about a constituent of  mine who suffered what could only be described as a nightmare hospital visit  that lasted three days when it should have  lasted one. She was left alone and frightened as she awaited treatment.  The Minister, in his reply to me, agreed that that was unacceptable.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Many cases have been  publicised that detail, in precise and awful terms, the horrible  experiences suffered by people due to glaring failures in our Health Service.  In my constituency, patients bring blankets with them to keep warm while  awaiting their appointments and tests in the outpatients&rsquo; department of the Ulster Hospital.  That cannot be tolerated.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I could tell many such stories; perhaps others could top  them. However, no one here is under any illusion about the state of the  healthcare system. Our system, despite  having a talented workforce, doctors and surgeons, does not, sadly,  provide what people need.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Northern    Ireland has the largest spend per head on healthcare, yet there are no real dividends from  it. No one in the Chamber would argue  against the case for reform; however, some will try to distract us from  the fact that they are not pulling their weight or doing their job.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The issue is not  complex: there must be urgent reform.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister has been given half the money in the draft  Budget, and it is the job of the Assembly to hold him accountable for spending  it. The 51&middot;5% represents &pound;454 million of new  money. A Member earlier mentioned the  figure of &pound;16 million: the actual figure is &pound;454 million.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion calls for actions instead of mere words, and it reminds the Minister that it is his job to  introduce a reform Bill urgently and that it is the job of those elected  to the Assembly to consider it. I was brought up on the simple phrase: if you  are going to do something, do it right. I understand the Department&rsquo;s desire to  introduce a Bill that will change the system and have a positive effect on  people&rsquo;s lives.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, this reform was planned long before devolution  day. My colleague Simon Hamilton has already mentioned the fact that the  consultation and the start of this planned reform was in place as far back as  2005. At that time, the then, and current, leader of the Ulster Unionist Party  stated that he wanted to see change. If he wants to see change, I suggest that  now is the time to implement change. Initially, the Ulster Unionist Party fully  supported change, yet as soon as a UUP Minister is in place, it is backtracking  and saying that more time is needed. If anything, the need for change is even  more urgent.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Why is the Bamford Report at number 17 in the Health  Service&rsquo;s list of priorities? Mental health is important, and additional moneys  have been allocated, but why is the Bamford Report not receiving &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Will the Member detail some of the earlier health bids, or will he accept that  those earlier bids concerned inescapables, which is why mental-health provision  is priority number 17?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I am not sure whether I thank the Member for his intervention, but I will  respond to his comment. Mental-health  provision is not an inescapable. We as a party put in an additional &pound;450  million, and the bids must be addressed by that extra money. Why is that money  not being used?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I live in the real world, not in a world of rainbows and  pots of gold. I would like to visit a world where time has slowed down and  where excessive research is conducted that  has no effect on people. There should be no delay; we want Health Service reform straight away.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The British Medical  Association has issued warnings and pleas to help the Department of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety to realise that this situation cannot  continue indefinitely.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>:  Does the Member agree that, if the Minister restructured his budget bid more  sensibly, he might be able to manage his resources?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member is allowed an additional minute for taking two interventions.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>: I thank the Member for his constructive comment; he is  correct.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Medical professionals are crying out for a change in the  system that will enable them to utilise their skills and to do what they long to do &mdash; help people. Members also want to help people. It is the Minister&rsquo;s  responsibility to implement change and urgently issue a health and  social services reform Bill before the system implodes and all the people of  the Province suffer. I urge the Minister to tidy up his house and to put things  in order. He must do this in a real-world timescale and not in the twilight  zone in which some people seem to live.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Not so long ago, the Ulster Unionist Party was complaining  about a lack of legislative movement, only to discover that its own Minister is  holding back what could possibly be one of the Province&rsquo;s most important  reforms. The situation would be laughable if it did not impact so seriously on  the lives of our most vulnerable people. The Minister must introduce a motion  for change, because we need reform, not empty words. He has the money &mdash; &pound;450  million in additional money &mdash; and we ask him to do his job and allow Members to  examine the Bill and so do our jobs. This is not a mere matter of numbers and  data.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  It is a matter of real life and death for some people.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Health, Social Services and Public  Safety (Mr McGimpsey)</strong>: I shall do  my best to respond to the points that Members have made.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am very clear about what I want from our health and  social care system. It is what everyone wants: the best standard of treatment  and care for all, delivered by motivated and highly skilled staff. Since I took  up post in May 2007, I have been struck by two things: the dedication and  commitment of our healthcare staff; and the vital need to transform the system  within which they work.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Five years ago, the review of public administration was  hailed as one of the most radical reforms to public  services in Northern Ireland  in 30 years. The key aim of the RPA was to create a modern, accountable and effective system of public administration that  would deliver high-quality public  services to our citizens. Local government, education and, of course,  healthcare structures were all set to be transformed for the better under the  RPA.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Five years later, Members are entitled to ask what has  changed. The education system has four education and library boards, with plans  to replace them and establish one education authority. Local government still  comprises 26 councils, with as yet no apparent agreement on the final number of  councils, which is a key feature of the work  in which I am engaged.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">What about health? The RPA&rsquo;s main proposals for health  included: the establishment of a single health authority to replace the four  boards and take on some Department and agency functions; a reduction in the  number of health trusts; the establishment of one patient and client council to  replace the five health and social care councils, and the creation of seven  local commissioning groups tied to the proposed seven local councils, in line  with the coterminosity that was regarded as important.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">2.15 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">To date, and in sharp contrast to the lack of progress in  other areas, the Department has been pushing ahead with the RPA reforms. In  April this year, the number of trusts was reduced from 19 to six: five health  and social care trusts and the Ambulance Service. Most staff are now working in  the new organisations, and the trusts employ more than 50,000 of the 70,000  people who are employed in the health sector. I have informed staff of my  decision that the current trust structures should remain largely as they are.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, the proposals for the establishment of a huge  regional health authority caused me the greatest concern. The authority was to  have 1,800 staff, a budget of well over &pound;100 million and was set to become  another large quango. As Minister, I want to examine further whether another  administrative body, on top of the Department, trusts, and so forth, is  required. In addition to the obvious question of the affordability of such a  huge organisation, I want to be satisfied that any new structures will deliver  my objectives and are robust enough to deal with current demands and future challenges.  To do otherwise would be to fail the people of Northern Ireland.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The authority, as proposed under direct rule, would be  similar to the Health Service Executive in the Republic of Ireland,  which has been the subject of much controversy and criticism due to its lack of  accountability. One of the main objectives that the RPA was expected to deliver  is democratic accountability, but where is the democratic accountability in an  organisation that has no local representation? The direct rule proposal stipulated  that the new authority would not have local representation.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Other characteristics of the RPA include community  responsiveness, equality, human rights and quality of services. Under the  proposals, the current four health boards and four health and social care  councils would be replaced by one patient and client council. Where is the  accountability? Can one large organisation speak for patients from all over Northern Ireland?  Surely it would be better to reinforce and strengthen the existing health boards  and councils.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I remain to be convinced that the excellent work being  carried out on behalf of patients by the existing health councils would be  improved by establishing one large body,  and therefore I want to examine that matter further. I was also concerned to hear that several agencies were  to be abolished and their functions transferred to the new authority.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I was particularly concerned about the proposal to get rid  of the Health Promotion Agency, whose work is the envy of similar agencies  across the UK.  It works to publicise the main departmental objectives of reducing the misuse  of drugs and alcohol and the spread of sexually-transmitted infections. As the  Health Service moves towards a focus on prevention, the public-health messages  so successfully delivered by the Health Promotion Agency, particularly to young  people, have never been more important.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Much has been made of my decision not to plough ahead with  the direct rule proposal. Many people have said that the Health Service will  suffer and that the waiting lists are already returning to the bad old days of  five years ago. That is simply not true. Waiting times for operations and  appointments at outpatient clinics have dropped dramatically. People who need  surgery no longer wait for years.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Look at the facts: in April 2006, 74,000 patients waited  for over 26 weeks for outpatient assessment; today there are none. Some 6,500  patients waited for longer than 26 weeks for surgery; today there are none. Since April this year, the number of people who  wait for more than 13 weeks for a  first outpatient appointment has fallen  from 22,000 to 5,100, and it continues to fall. The figures speak for themselves. That is a huge  achievement and proves that the Health Service is transforming, and  staff and patients are reaping the benefits.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There are three key elements of the system that I want to  see in place. First, performance management is crucial. The system must ensure  the delivery of targets and objectives. Secondly, strong financial management  will ensure that we live within our means and get the maximum return on our  investment in health and social care. Thirdly, commissioning is crucial. By  that I mean the process of planning and resourcing services to ensure that they  meet the needs of the population and ensure value for money.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">To those functions I have added democratisation &mdash; in other  words, examining ways in which to give local people and councillors a strong  voice in the system. I am exploring the possibilities for enhancing the role of  local government in the delivery of health and social care. I am also exploring  ways of more collaborative working with district councils to help to address  health inequalities. I am talking to as many  people as possible, including representatives from trade unions, the  British Medical Association and local commissioning groups. Those discussions have been very fruitful and  underline the importance of taking the time to get it right.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There are some concerns  about the delay, particularly in  relation to commissioning. I believe in local commis&shy;sioning, but I am  still considering how many local commissioning  groups there should be, what their most effective boundaries should be and their make-up. There are seven local commissioning groups coterminous  with seven local councils, but I am  unsure whether there will be seven local councils. I am exploring other  options &mdash; for example, if there are 11 or 15 local councils, how will that  affect the numbers of commissioning groups and their boundaries?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Since April 2007, local commissioning groups have been  working with boards to develop care plans and priorities. The chairs of the  local commissioning groups have said that they are willing to continue working  with me and the boards. They are grateful for the time being given to help them  to develop in their roles. I expect reforms to be implemented by April 2009,  but that is not the date for reaching my decision: I hope to make an  announcement on that soon. As I have already stated, that does not mean that  reform grinds to a halt. My Department &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  I will give way in a minute. My Department is leading the way in delivering  savings as a result of the review of public administration, with plans to  remove almost 1,700 staff and to deliver more than &pound;53 million of savings. Can  the same be said of other Departments?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>: I thank the Minister for giving way. Perhaps he could indicate  the time factor involved once he has made his decision on the structures of a  single authority. How long will it take for primary legislation to be enacted?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  The decision will be made soon, and I anticipate its implementation by April  2009. We all know the timetabling for legislation: it goes through the  Executive, then through the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public  Safety and then through the Chamber.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I will issue challenging RPA savings targets to each health  and social care organisation shortly. I will insist that each body provides me  with plans on how savings will be achieved. That will not be easy. It will mean  removing one in every four managers, one in every four back-office staff, and  10% of the remaining administrative support staff. Those savings will deliver  resources to secure front-line services over the CSR (Comprehensive Spending  Review) period and dramatically improve productivity to health, social services  and public safety.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Shannon said &ldquo;we as a party&rdquo; have given the Health  Service &pound;455 million. I thought that it involved more than simply one party. It  is interesting that we have a four-party mandatory coalition, yet &ldquo;we as a  party&rdquo; have given &pound;455 million. Against that, we have &pound;700 million of  inescapable costs. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.] </span>Mr Speaker, if I  may be allowed to continue. Therefore, on the current account of the Health  Service, we are running a proposed deficit of &pound;250 million under the draft  Budget.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">All the wagging of heads  in the world will not change this: there is &pound;700 million of inescapable  costs and &ldquo;we as a party&rdquo; put in &pound;455  million to cover it. That leaves a gap  of &pound;250 million. That is where the importance of CSR comes in, because CSR and the 3% will provide an  antic&shy;ipated &pound;343 million, which leaves us only &pound;97 million for resources.  Some &pound;16 million will be made available in year one, and all the talking in the  world &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  Nonsense.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>: Shouting &ldquo;nonsense&rdquo; will not change those figures.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Those savings will deliver resources that secure front-line services over the CSR period and  dramatically improve productivity in health and social services. Do not  be in any doubt of my desire and commitment to transform our Health Service. I  will achieve the necessary efficiency savings and plough them back into  front-line services. That will not be easy. I do not have to remind Members  that Northern Ireland has  greater need and less funding than England. In fact, we are  underfunded by &pound;300 million, and that total will double in three years if the  draft Budget allocation is agreed. That is not acceptable.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">A great deal is being asked of Health Service staff, and  they continue to respond to every challenge. I ask them to be patient while I  take time to consider the future structures. We have a rare opportunity to make  a major alteration to our structures, and that will not happen again for many  years. It is vital to get it right and ensure that we have a model that will  continue to transform our Health Service and respond to new challenges in the  years ahead.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Campbell</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. I received a ruling from the Business Office  at 1.45 pm today regarding your decision about my question for oral answer by  the Minister for Social Development. You will be pleased, Mr Speaker, to know  that I do not intend to attempt to question your ruling. However my  understanding from the Business Office is that the Department knew about my  question&rsquo;s being on the Notice Paper on 21 November, and the court case took place last Friday, yet I was not informed that  the question was being withdrawn until 1.45 pm today. Mr Speaker, can you establish for me when the Department was  aware that there would be a likelihood of my question&rsquo;s being invalid,  and why I was not informed at that time?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I thank the Member for his point of order. I am happy to come back with a full  response to the Member at a later sitting.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As we are approaching  Question Time, I suggest that the Assembly takes its ease until 2.30 pm.  This debate will resume at 4.00 pm, when Mr Thomas Buchanan will make his  winding-up speech on the motion.</p>

		    <p class="H3SectionHeading">Health, Social Services And Public Safety</p>
		    <p class="H4StageHeading">Satellite Cancer Unit: Altnagelvin Area   Hospital</p>
		    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">1. <strong>Mr McClarty </strong>asked the Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety to make a statement on the  provision of a satellite cancer unit to be located in Altnagelvin  Area Hospital,  which would serve the population of the North    West.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=AQO1044/08> (AQO  1044)</a></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mr McGimpsey)</strong>: It is important  to note that Altnagelvin Hospital is one of five cancer units in Northern Ireland  that provides a full range of cancer services to the population, from screening  and diagnosis to specialist oncology therapies. The other units are at the Ulster Hospital,  Antrim Hospital,  Craigavon Hospital  and the cancer centre at Belfast   City Hospital.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, radiotherapy  for the population of Northern Ireland is provided at the cancer centre in Belfast, which was  developed to meet needs until 2015. An initial assessment of projected cancer  incidence and demographics conducted by the Department suggests that a  combination of radiotherapy services in Belfast  and Altnagelvin would best meet the needs of the population beyond 2015. Any  future development of radiotherapy services will, of course, be subject to a  full economic appraisal.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McClarty</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his reply. Will the Minister continue to hold  discussions in the future with his counterpart in the Republic of Ireland  to explore what mutual benefits could be developed if further investment were  made in cancer services at Altnagelvin? Does he agree that it is a scandal that  the provision of additional oncologists and radiotherapy capacity, which would improve survival rates for  a range of cancers, will not be possible, thanks to the draft Budget  currently proposed and backed by the DUP?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>: My first responsibility is to provide for the people of Northern Ireland, and, because the number of  patients is rising all the time, need will have outgrown the cancer centre at Belfast City Hospital  by 2015. Therefore, we need to make further provision, and we need to plan that  this year in order to be ready. The best option for the people of Northern  Ireland appears to be Altnagelvin, so there is a conversation to be had with  the Republic about selling cross-border services for those in need.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There are 8,500 new cancers diagnosed every year, and the  demand for services is rising as our elderly population rises &mdash; the cohort age  group of people over 65 years of age is growing all the time.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I made a clear bid within my budget proposals for additional oncology and radiotherapy, and that  remains. I would very much regret not being able to meet that need, due  to the reasons I have just given the House.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  Can the Minister state what other plans  exist for co-operation between health Departments, North and South? Can  the Minister also indicate when the new provision will be introduced in the  north-west?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  I am giving a situation report, not an announcement about new provision in  Altnagelvin. There is some work still to be done, and I am merely stating the  situation at the moment.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As for North/South co-operation, there is a joint suicide  strategy, joint pandemic flu planning &mdash; because flu knows no boundaries &mdash; and  joint child protection, which is another  important area for discussion and co-operation.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat. The Minister has already outlined some of the measures  that he is planning, but what assurance can he give the House on equity and equality for the provision of all  cancer services for the people of the north-west? Is he also planning to  develop all-island approaches for cancer services for the population of the  north-west through the work of the North/South Ministerial Council,  particularly for Altnagelvin, Letterkenny and further afield?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  With regard to the provision of cancer services, as I said in my earlier reply  to Mr McClarty&rsquo;s question, my first responsibility is to the people of Northern Ireland.  However, we will co-operate where mutual benefits can be accrued, North and  South, and that includes health. Cancer is a key area, and the need for cancer  services is growing in the South as well as in Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We want to ensure that  no part of the population faces greater disadvantages in gaining access  to diagnosis, treatment and management of cancers, and that is the case. Most  of the population can access cancer services in Northern Ireland within the  60-minute rule.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">New Hospital Provision</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">2. <strong>Mr  Neeson </strong>asked the Minister of Health, Social <span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt; ">Services and Public Safety to confirm that the announce&shy;ments</span> about the provision of a new acute hospital for the south-west by 2012 and a  new local hospital for Omagh in 2013 are identical to those announced under  direct rule.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO1039/08>(AQO 1039/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  All my formal announcements have confirmed  the plans to develop a new acute hospital for the south-west, located to  the north of Enniskillen, <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt; ">and to develop a  new enhanced local hospital in Omagh.</span> I have also made it clear that the  new enhanced local hospital complex in Omagh will provide a range of services,  including a healthcare centre, inpatient mental-health services and a 24/7  urgent care and treatment centre.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Neeson</strong>:  Can the Minister outline the timescale for the completion of those projects?  Can he assure the House that he will try to maximise the benefits on a <span style="letter-spacing:-.05pt; ">shared facility that can be used on a  cross-border basis?</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  The anticipated completion date for the hospital in Enniskillen is 2011; for  the hospital in Omagh, it is 2012. My first responsibility is to provide for  the people in Northern    Ireland, and I am willing, keen and anxious  to consider and enhance that provision through co-operation on a North/South  and east-west basis. We have healthy relationships within the United Kingdom and within the island of Ireland,  and that benefits our people.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong><span style="letter-spacing:-.2pt; ">Mr Adams</span></strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. On the issue of  capital investment in future hospital provision, the Minister was quoted in the  media last week as suggesting that a commitment to build a new women and  children&rsquo;s hospital on the RVH (Royal Victoria Hospital) site might be put in  jeopardy. Does the Minister acknowledge that his reported remarks have caused widespread concern, and will he now  clarify that he has no intention of subverting the commitment to proceed  as planned with the building of the new women and children&rsquo;s hospital on the  RVH site?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  I made the point that there was some conjecture about the new women and  children&rsquo;s hospital on the RVH site &mdash; something that is badly needed and that  was promised when the Jubilee Maternity Hospital was closed at Belfast City  Hospital. Many Members campaigned and argued that the Jubilee Maternity   Hospital should not have  closed until the new women and children&rsquo;s hospital on the RVH site was opened,  but to no avail.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is now 2007, and that hospital facility is not within  the three-year period of this comprehensive spending review: it falls within  the next three-year CSR period. However, I made the point that the Budget  constraints are so tight that, if I had the new hospital today, the Department  could not afford to staff it because of the revenue consequences of capital  build. Members will see, in the inescapable costs, the revenue consequences of  capital; that was exactly the point that I made.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bresland</strong>:  Will the Minister assure the House that the  new enhanced local hospital in Omagh will have a 24-hour doctor-led  urgent care and treatment centre?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  I am happy to give the Member that assurance. At the time, I said that I was  looking at three elements in relation the new hospital in Omagh. One element was 24/7 urgent care and treatment,  which I confirm today.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Another element was to review the emergency ambulance  service, and the third was to commission a feasibility study into a midwife-led  maternity unit. That study should report back to me in the next few weeks. Therefore, I can give all three of those  assurances on the new local hospital for Omagh.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Increased Healthcare Spending</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">3. <strong>Mr B McCrea </strong>asked the Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety to make a statement on the  need for increased healthcare spending in Northern Ireland; and to outline the comparison between healthcare spending  in Northern Ireland and England, on key areas, including children&rsquo;s issues and  mental health.&nbsp; <a name=AQO1016/08>(AQO 1016/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  In 2005, the Appleby Report concluded that it was necessary for Northern Ireland to spend approximately 7% more  than England  in order for it to provide the same standard of care. Draft figures from an  update to that work suggest that the need differential now stands at about 14%.  Need is 10% higher for National Health Service-type services, and up to 36%  higher for social services functions. To tackle that gap and match the 3&middot;7%  growth rate in England  would mean that an additional &pound;600 million to spend would be required by  2010-11.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Without that money, we will continue to provide second-rate  services for children and mentally ill people. To be crystal clear, if the  draft Budget remains unchanged, the gap with England will not be addressed but  will widen.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Does the Minister agree that the gap between expenditure in England and Northern   Ireland that was identified in the draft Budget is  clearly unacceptable, and that there is considerable need in Northern Ireland  that must be addressed? Does he also agree that, rather than engaging in  personal attacks, it would be useful if all MLAs and Executive members were to work together to tackle those pressing  problems, which affect so many of us?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  I certainly subscribe to the idea of cradle-to-the-grave free-for-all-citizens  and taxpayer-funded healthcare as one of the state&rsquo;s key principles. <span style="letter-spacing:-.25pt; ">Many exercises have been undertaken to ascertain  whethe</span>r that aim is sustainable, and the conclusions have invariably been that our Health Service is  sustainable on an investment basis.  The Appleby Report recommended a real-terms investment of 4&middot;3% during  the 2005-12 comprehensive spending review period. Clearly, we are falling well  behind that. Consequently, there is a 25% greater mental-health need, and  funding is 25% less than that in England &mdash; a clear differential. Our  spend on children is the lowest in the UK  &mdash; we are 35% behind England,  and 44% behind Scotland.  The proportion of our population that is aged over 65 is growing at the fastest  rate in the UK, and that  means that need is growing quicker here than it is in other parts of the United Kingdom.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Hanna</strong>:  Given the spending shortfall in child mental-health services, and the fact that  5% of our children have a clinically recognised mental-health condition, how will the Minister address that  crying need?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  Mrs Hanna is a member of the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public  Safety, so she is well aware that that need is difficult to address. After  inescapables &mdash; what I cannot avoid paying for &mdash; and providing for conditions  such as killer diseases, my number-one bid is for mental-health provision. That  bid was roughly four times the size of my allocation. Those are the sort of  difficulties with which I have been presented. Much has been made of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s per capita spend compared  with that for the rest of the UK.  In fact, in 2006-07, we spent 9% more per  capita than was spent in England.  That over&shy;spend is now down to 6% ,  so, while the gap is narrowing, the need is growing, and the allocation  gap will double from &pound;300 million at present to &pound;600 million in three years&rsquo;  time. Therefore, the question remains as to whether Northern Ireland, as a society, can  sustain the Health Service.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>: Does the Minister agree that his political grandstanding on  health spending in the draft Budget serves only to make healthcare staff and  members of the public lose confidence in the Health Service and in his ability  as a Minister, despite his being allocated 51% of all moneys for Northern  Ireland and having the largest-ever Northern Ireland health budget?</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>: Last week, I began consulting staff in the acute sector. I did  not hear that view expressed by any staff then &mdash;<span class="Italic"> [Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I will continue, Mr  Speaker, if I am allowed to speak. Thank you.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Health Service spending is not about percentages: it is  about the people of Northern    Ireland; it is about patients; and about  maintaining the National Health Service&rsquo;s cradle-to-grave healthcare, which is  free for all our people. We appear to be saying that people here can have that  service, but it will not be as good as it is in the rest of the United Kingdom.  That is unacceptable.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We are &pound;300 million  behind England  &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. The Minister has the Floor.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  &mdash; under the draft Budget, and that will double over the next three years. That  is unacceptable.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Maternity Unit: Omagh Area</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">4. <strong>Mr McElduff </strong>asked the Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public  Safety to consider the establishment of a free-standing midwife-led  maternity unit for the Omagh area. <a name=AQO1049/08>(AQO  1049/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>: I recently asked the Western Health and Social Services Board  to explore the possibility of providing a stand-alone community midwifery unit  for Omagh. The board will provide me with a report of its findings by the end  of the year. I will fully consider those findings in reaching my decision.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for undertaking  that work with the Western Health and Social Services Board. I must emphasise  that, because of the long distances that people in County Tyrone  must travel to the nearest acute hospital with maternity provision, mothers  have given birth to babies en route to hospital. Will the Minister assure the  House that he will demonstrate a personal interest in arriving at creative  solutions for maternity provision that will meet the needs of the people of County Tyrone?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  As for personal assurance, one of my first visits was to Omagh because of  concerns about services there and about the provision of an enhanced local  hospital. As I said in response to a question from Mr Bresland, I gave  assurances about ambulances, a doctor-led 24/7 urgent care and treatment  centre, and a consultation on a midwifery unit. That consultation will conclude  shortly, and, when I receive the reports, I will come back to the House as  quickly as I can. The key criteria are a safe and  effective tier of choice for women and the provision of safe and  effective emergency transfer arrangements when necessary. As I said, I will immediately  report to the House on the results of the consultation.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  The Minister must think that if he repeats something often enough people might  believe it. The issues are efficiencies and productivity. A draft Budget  allocation of &pound;4 billion &mdash;<span class="Italic"> [interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. The Member has the Floor.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>: Four billion pounds is a significant amount. I wonder what the  Minister wants to take away from other Departments to increase his  allocation. Will the Minister comment on the 2002 Ulster Unionist Party  manifesto, which pledged extending choice for pregnant women through  midwife-led maternity units? Never mind Omagh &mdash; what has he done about other  midwife-led units across the Province?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  Mrs Robinson said &ldquo;Never mind Omagh.&rdquo; The people of Omagh have a different view  about that and about their area. Six months ago, when I had the honour of taking on this job, the Omagh consult&shy;ation was  one of my first undertakings.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The midwife-led maternity unit at Downpatrick is at an  advanced stage of development, and there are opportunities for other such  units. We must ensure that maternity services are sustainable, and we must take  into account the views of all stakeholders and the impact on other services.  However, the criteria that I mentioned to Mr McElduff seem to offer  opportunities for such a unit, provided that it is safe and effective for  mothers and infants.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I hope that the consultation goes well. A midwife-led maternity unit in Omagh  is essential, and I am sure, as the Minister stated, that the people of Omagh  are not in the &ldquo;never mind Omagh&rdquo; camp. Perhaps Mrs Robinson&rsquo;s view is also  &ldquo;never mind Downpatrick&rdquo; &mdash; it is certainly not mine.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Does the Minister agree that further investment in  maternity services is required across Northern Ireland, and that the draft  Budget &mdash; as proposed and backed by the DUP &mdash; will do nothing to help in that  area? Is that not a disgrace?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  I think that &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. The Minister has the Floor.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  As I explained earlier, with &pound;700 million of inescapables and &pound;450 million  coming in, we operate a proposed current-account deficit of &pound;250 million.  Despite calls from sedentary positions, it is difficult to move forward on that  basis.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Regarding consultancy-led maternity services, we operate  the one-hour rule. However, as I said, that means units being influenced by  their ability to access anaesthetic,  paediatric and theatre services. The number of births is also a factor.  There is a role for midwife-led maternity units, but we must wait to see the  report on the feasibility study for Omagh.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Mobile Cervical Cancer Unit</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">5. <strong>Mr S  Wilson </strong>asked the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety to  make a statement on an incident which took place on 12 November 2007, in the  Markets area of Belfast,  in relation to a mobile cervical cancer unit.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO1018/08>(AQO  1018/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  It is totally unacceptable that anyone who is working to save lives and to  provide a public service should be subjected to any form of abuse. That is why  I launched a campaign in June 2007 to spell out clearly the message of a  zero-tolerance approach to attacks, abuse or threatening behaviour against  healthcare staff.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Today, I have already  sought the Assembly&rsquo;s endorse&shy;<span style="letter-spacing:-.35pt; ">ment</span> of the extension to Northern Ireland of the provisions  of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill that deal with nuisance or  disturbance on hospital premises.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  The Minister is aware that, on 12 November  2007, in his own constituency, a bus bringing workers into the Markets  area to screen women for cervical cancer was ordered to leave by a supposed  community worker, who is paid through public funds. The Markets is an area that  has a low uptake of screening services, and the bus had to leave with very few  of the women having had the opportunity to avail of the screening.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The person who ordered the bus out was associated with Sinn  F&eacute;in, and was paid from public money by the Department for Social Development &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I ask the Member to ask his question.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  Will the Minister indicate whether he has had any discussions with Sinn F&eacute;in  regarding that issue? Has he had any discussions with the Minister for Social Development about the funding of the  Markets Community Association, which pays those wages? Furthermore, will  the Minister assure Members that nurses will not be intimidated out of areas by  people simply because they are not liked?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  I fundamentally agree with the principles of what Mr Wilson has said. That  incident was deplorable and disgraceful. Without getting into the details &mdash; because it is currently under  investigation by the Belfast Health and Social Care Trust &mdash; the  conclusion of the leading nurse was that it was best to leave the area because a small crowd had started to gather.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That small group, and the alleged involvement of that  worker, did their community a disservice because, after breast cancer, cervical  cancer is the single most common cancer for women worldwide. It respects no  race or creed, and that is the same in the Markets as it is in any other part  of Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The workers were there to provide a vital service. The keys to tackling cancer are screening, early  detection, early treatment, and early intervention. Those women in the  Markets were denied that by the actions of that small group. We will persist in  providing that service because the people in that area deserve it.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>: I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s last comments, which confirmed that  his Department will persist in providing  those services to people living in the Markets area of Belfast and other communities in the North.  My colleague Mrs Hanna the MLA for South Belfast  wrote to the Minister within 24 hours of the incident.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I ask the Minister two questions. Does he agree that  incidents of this nature must be subjected to the full rigours of the law? Does  he agree that, in the event that the circumstances of the incident are  confirmed, any person involved in causing that incident should have his or her  employment status reviewed and, where appropriate, terminated, to send a  message to the victim in this case, and to the people of the Markets and to  those in other communities who are not yet free from that sort of behaviour,  that that sort of action will not be tolerated by any Minister, Member or  citizen in the North?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  Like Mrs Hanna, I represent that constituency. I completely agree with Mr  Attwood&rsquo;s remarks, both in principle and in practice. The individuals  responsible should be subject to the full rigours of the law and I agree with  him in respect of their employment status. It is absolutely reprehensible,  given the sort of risks that women run with respect to cervical cancer which  kills 80 women each year in Northern Ireland, to deny them treatment. It is disgraceful.  I agree exactly with the Member.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cobain</strong>:  All Members join with the Minister in condemning the attacks on healthcare  workers in the Markets. The Minister has already alluded to his zero tolerance  strategy. Will he tell the House what other steps he will take to thwart  further attacks on health&shy;care workers?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  Today, we received endorsement for the extension to Northern Ireland of the provisions  of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill, which deals with incidents inside  hospitals. My Department is also working up legislation to make it an offence  to create nuisance or disturbance on Health Service premises and interfere with  Health Service workers. That legislation will be effective in this area.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, the incident represents a threat so serious that  it is more a matter for the police than for the Health Service. As Mr Attwood  has pointed out, the full rigour of the law is required in such incidents,  which go beyond verbal abuse and which have a very serious undertone.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Brook Clinic: Public Funding</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">6. <strong>Mr  McCausland </strong>asked the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety  what public funding has been provided to the Brook Clinic in Belfast, in each year since 2000.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO1094/08>(AQO 1094/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  Health and social services boards have provided funding to Brook Clinic since  2000. My Department has also provided  funding to it. The statistics are too detailed to read out: a copy of  the information has been placed in the Library.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCausland</strong>:  Does the Minister agree that the Brook Clinic promotes views that are at  variance with those of many in Ulster  in Protestant and Roman Catholic communities?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Does he acknowledge that the organisation Love for Life  promotes values that are in keeping with those of many people in Ulster, and  that it carries out valuable work to promote the well-being of young people,  especially in schools? Will he therefore indicate when he proposes to meet Love  for Life to hear the organi&shy;sation&rsquo;s request for core funding?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  I am not in a position to comment on Love for Life at the moment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The question was about the Brook Clinic, which since 1992  has provided a free confidential service for teenagers in Belfast. Its service includes contraceptive information, advice and supplies, after-sex  contraception, pregnancy testing,  counselling, help and advice. It does not give advice on, or make  referrals for, abortion. That is important.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We have a strategy for sexual health. The aspects that I  have talked about reinforce the need to reduce the number of sexually  transmitted infections, now running at 2,900 per annum; delay sexual activity  among the young; reduce teenage births &mdash; last year there were 1,427 teenage  births; and provide swift access to genito-urinary medicine (GUM) clinics.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is a need for work in that area. If Love for Life is  offering support, I am prepared to consider that sort of proposal.</p>

	      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="7"></a>Regional Development</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Belfast  Sewer Project/Project Alpha/Project Omega</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">1. <strong>Mrs Long </strong>asked the Minister for Regional Development to confirm that the  announcement of the Belfast sewer project &mdash; project alpha and project omega &mdash;  contained in the draft investment strategy 2008-18, are identical to the  schemes already existing in the Investment Strategy launched by direct rule  Ministers in December 2005.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=AQO1063/08> (AQO  1063/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development (Mr Murphy)</strong>: A LeasCheann Comhairle. I have been  advised by Northern Ireland Water that project alpha and project omega for the  Belfast sewer project, referred to in the draft investment strategy 2008-2018, are the same as those announced by direct rule  Ministers in the investment strategy in December 2005. That is due to  the size and complexity of the projects, which span a number of years and represent a significant investment aimed  at improving water and sewerage infrastructure.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Belfast  sewer project commenced in May 2005, and will not be completed until the end of  2009. It will upgrade Belfast&rsquo;s  Victorian sewer system at a cost of &pound;130 million, and includes the construction  of a large-diameter tunnel. Projects alpha and omega are public-private  partnership projects, which commenced in June 2006 and May 2007 respectively.  Although the bulk of the construction work will be completed by 2009, both  projects have a 25-year concession. The projects aim to deliver a number of  newer, upgraded water and waste-water treatment works at a total cost of &pound;232  million.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>: I  thank the Minister for the clarification. No  one would argue that the projects are either short-term or unnecessary.  However, I commend the Depart&shy;ment on its  ability to recycle, because the announcements have already been made at  other times in other places, and it appears that they have been dressed up  again for the current round of budgeting.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Previously, the Minister has &mdash; rightly &mdash; identified that  installing bigger pipes is not the only answer to the problem of flooding in  urban areas. What progress is being made on  the sustainable urban-drainage project to deal with new development and  retrofitting in older properties?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>:  In relation to the commentary in the first part of the Member&rsquo;s question, the  Executive&rsquo;s announcement of the investment strategy in respect of the Belfast sewer project  refers to its completion, which is an acknowledgement that the project has  already started. We must continue to invest in it, and I presume that the  Member would have had a more substantial case for disquiet had the Department  not announced that it would spend the money to complete the project, as with  others.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In relation to the second part of the Member&rsquo;s question,  the studies are ongoing to provide the most effective, and retrofitted,  drainage system possible for newbuilds.  Those studies will take some time to complete, and weather conditions  this year have exacerbated flooding problems, particularly in the Member&rsquo;s  constituency of East Belfast.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The overall health warning is that no system can compete  with the type of downfall that we had in June in  Belfast, Omagh  and other areas of the North. None&shy;theless, the studies continue to  endeavour to make the drainage system as effective as it can possibly be.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burns</strong>:  Will the Minister ensure that the planned systems will be upgraded in  accordance with the most recent EU directives?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>: We are always guided by EU directives, and where we are found  to fall foul of them, infraction costs  inevitably follow. The EU directives are uppermost in the thinking of  all Departments when deciding how an issue is approached. I assure the Member  that EU directives will continue to dictate how the Department for Regional  Development conducts all such business.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Narrow   Water Bridge  Project</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">2. <strong>Mr P J  Bradley </strong>asked the Minister for Regional Development to advise what progress  has been made on the Narrow Water bridge project following the North/South  Ministerial Council sectoral meeting of 14 September 2007.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=AQO1125/08> (AQO 1125/08</a>)</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>: A  LeasCheann Comhairle. At the third meeting of the North/South Ministerial  Council in transport sectoral format, held on 14 September 2007, the council  noted the Irish Government&rsquo;s proposal for the construction  of a bridge at Narrow Water linking County  Louth with County Down.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Irish Government  have granted funding to Louth County  Council to undertake preliminary technical work on the proposal. The  matter will be kept under review and the results of the technical work will be  examined when they become available.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P J Bradley</strong>: I thank the Minister for his answer. At present, the Narrow  Water bridge project is the major local talking point in South Down, the Cooley  peninsula and further afield. Mr Deputy Speaker, I know that you encourage  short questions and answers. Therefore, I ask the Minister whether he is fully  committed to the proposed Louth-Down link at Narrow Water. In the interests of  saving time, a one-word answer from the Minister will be sufficient. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>: Had the Member asked a short question, there may have been a  short answer. I want to correct certain information that the Member publicised  locally, to the effect that matters in relation to a bridge at Narrow Water  were advanced and that it would only take the Department for Regional  Development to agree to it for the project to be delivered. That is completely  inaccurate. Louth County Council&rsquo;s study into the technical aspects of the  project has only just begun. When a proposition of support for the project is  put to the Department, I will happily give an answer. Such a proposition has  not yet been made.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Does the Minister agree that a far more worthy project than a bridge at Narrow  Water is that of a southern relief road? Like my colleague the Member for Newry  and Armagh, I hope that the Minister&rsquo;s answer  to a proposition for a bridge at Narrow Water is no. In order to develop  tourism and trade and, in particular, to promote the growth of Warrenpoint as a  major port on the eastern seaboard of the island of Ireland, does the Minister  agree that the southern relief road is essential?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>: I  believe that the Member has fallen into the  trap that, regrettably, many of his local colleagues and lobby groups  have also fallen into, which is to consider those as competing projects. I do  not consider them as such. Both are worthy projects and are being advanced.  Studies are being conducted into both.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">At present, the study into the southern relief road is  being conducted by the Roads Service in the North. That is not complete. The study into a bridge at Narrow Water is  being conducted by Louth County Council. That is not complete either. Rather  than view them as competing projects &mdash; both of which are important to the  people of the area and of the east coast in general &mdash; the Member would do well  to wait until the study that is being carried out into each of those projects  is completed and the benefits to the people of South Down, Louth and the east  coast of Ireland can be determined.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr W Clarke</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Can the Minister elaborate on what  the Department is doing to improve links between County Louth  and South Down in general?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  Nothing. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>:  At present, all that one can do is buy a boat. As I said during my previous  answer, Louth County Council has been tasked with the study into a bridge at  Narrow Water. The Executive have dealt with the Irish Government through the  transport sectoral meetings of the  North/South Ministerial Council, which will keep us up to date with the  study.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Roads Service is  conducting the study into a southern relief road at Newry. I have asked  both groups to engage with each other in order to ensure that there is maximum  exchange of information between them. When those studies are complete, the  issues will return to North/South Ministerial Council&rsquo;s agenda. I hope that  progress can then be made.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Translink SmartPasses</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">3. <strong>Mr  Cobain </strong>asked the Minister for Regional Development to outline the actions  his Department is undertaking, or considering, to ensure that the highest  proportion possible of those eligible, possess Translink SmartPasses.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=AQO1057/08> (AQO 1057/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">15. <strong>Mr F  McCann </strong>asked the Minister for Regional Development, in light of the  proposed extension of the SmartPass to the over 60s, what steps his Department  has taken to promote the uptake of the scheme.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO1117/08>(AQO  1117/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>:  With your permission, Mr Deputy Speaker, I  would like to answer question 3 and question 15 together.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department for  Regional Development has developed an application process that it  believes is simple and convenient for customers. It is advertised in local and  regional newspapers and continues to be advertised on buses, trains and in  stations. During the past two financial years, expenditure on advertising was  approximately &pound;85,000. The Department works closely with bodies that represent  groups of people who are eligible for concessionary travel.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As a consequence of those measures, the uptake of  SmartPasses is currently estimated to be in excess of 75%. That compares with a rate of about 63% in Britain.  Steps have not yet been taken to promote the uptake of the scheme for people  who are aged 60 years and over. Should the decision in the draft Budget to  extend free travel to those people be confirmed, the Department will discuss  with relevant groups the best steps to encourage uptake, including the issue of  additional targeted publicity.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cobain</strong>:  The Minister will be aware that the Committee for Regional Development has  concerns about social exclusion in rural areas of the Province.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister tell the House what his plans are to  ensure that people who are socially excluded &mdash; particularly, pensioners in  rural areas &mdash; can actually use their SmartPasses?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>: The Member will know, as Chairperson of the Committee for  Regional Development, that the Department made a bid for a range of moneys to  be made available to expand the concessionary scheme as broadly as possible; to  take some of the people with disabilities from the half-fare concessionary  scheme to a full-fare concessionary schemes and to target areas where uptake of  the scheme is least.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member is right to highlight rural areas. We made a bid  to extend concessionary fares to include travel  on services that are provided by rural community transport partnerships.  Unfortunately, we have not been successful, in the current round of the Budget,  in those bids. We will continue to press our case and to ensure that people  avail of the SmartPass scheme. We will bid, in further rounds of the Budget, to  ensure that people who are accessing rural transport can also avail of the  SmartPass scheme.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Neeson</strong>: Will the Minister agree that it is ridiculous that Translink  SmartCards, which can be used in the Greater Belfast area, cannot be used on  train services in areas covered by Translink Metro buses?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>:  That particular problem has not been raised  with me, previously. Last week, I had a discussion with the Committee  for Regional Development about the idea of purchasing tickets for single  journeys, or return journeys, using SmartCards. I will gladly raise that issue  with Translink. The purpose of any scheme where concessionary fares are  introduced is, as the Committee&rsquo;s Chairperson has said, to tackle social  exclusion.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If those concessionary fares are introduced &mdash; and the transport providers have some systems that  mitigate against that &mdash; we want to resolve those issues as, otherwise,  the purpose of introducing the cards in the  first place is defeated. I will happily go to Translink to deal with  that issue.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  Is it true that the Minister does not intend to roll out the SmartPasses to  60-year-olds until December 2008, even  though money has been allocated in his departmental budget for that  purpose?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>:  There is no intention to roll out the scheme in December 2008. We intend to  roll out the scheme in the summer or early autumn &mdash; not in December. Obviously,  the Budget has not yet been agreed. While the draft Budget indicates that we  have been successful in our bid to lower the age at which people become  eligible for concessionary fares from 65 to 60, that has yet to be confirmed by  the final budgetary decisions in January 2008. After that, an equality impact  assessment will be needed to ensure the way in which the scheme will be rolled  out, and to access those groups that will need to avail of it. The technical  facilities will have to be changed to ensure that those passes can be produced  and that we are aware of all those people who are entitled to them. That  process will take a couple of months.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If the final decisions on the Budget go along the lines  that we hope that they will, it is intended that the scheme will be rolled out  for the summertime or the early autumn, and not in December 2008.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Bus-Replacement Scheme</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">4. <strong>Mr McKay </strong>asked the Minister for Regional Development to provide details of the  Translink bus-replacement scheme.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO1120/08>(AQO  1120/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>: A LeasCheann Comhairle. The current bus-replacement policy is  aimed at delivering the target age limits for Translink&rsquo;s bus fleet as set out  in the regional transportation strategy. The targets are that the average  vehicle age should be no more than eight years, with no bus being more than 18  years old, and no coach being more than 12 years old. The overall policy  objective is to achieve a modern, comfortable and reliable bus fleet that encourages  people to use public transport for their  journeys instead of private cars.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We have had some success in stopping the long-term downward  trend in the number of people who travel by bus. I am pleased to report that  the number of bus passengers in Belfast  has increased by almost 14% over the past two years.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McKay</strong>:  Will the Minister tell the House how many more replacement buses are due to be  purchased by his Department?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>: A  LeasCheann Comhairle. Translink expects to buy 240 replacement buses during  2007-08 and 2008-09; 69 replacement buses in 2009-10; and 90 replacements buses  in 2010-11. The total cost of those is estimated at almost &pound;62 million. The  2007 draft Budget will allow the  bus-replacement programme to be rolled out as planned.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>:  Will the Minister outline his views on the potential  of hybrid and green technologies as alternative fuels for the Translink  bus fleet?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>:  That type of fuel has been used in some of the Department for Regional  Development&rsquo;s vehicles. We are investigating the matter and will continue to  investigate it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Programme for  Government sets out the Execu&shy;tive&rsquo;s objective of reducing our carbon  footprint, and we want to investigate each and every opportunity to do that. We  will therefore continue to investigate the uses of such fuel in Translink  fleets as well.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: Does the Minister consider it acceptable that, as a result of  the bus-replacement programme, some pupils travel on buses that have essential  safety features, such as seat belts, while others do not?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>:  Our intention is to bring all school bus fleets up to a high standard, but the  necessary changes cannot be introduced overnight. There has been substantial  investment in the bus fleet, which brought a large number of buses up to the  required standard. As I said in response to an earlier question, that  investment will continue. A substantial investment of, I think, &pound;62 million has  been allocated in the draft Budget, so there will continue to be investment in  procurement to replace the older buses in the Translink fleet. That will bring  all buses up to the standard to which the Member referred.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, I presume that  the Member will understand that, since the first bus fleets were  introduced only this year, the entire fleet  of Translink buses cannot be brought up to the required standard  overnight. A substantial capital investment  is required and will have to be budgeted for over several years. If this  year&rsquo;s draft Budget is approved, there  will, fortunately, be a substantial improve&shy;ment in the coming years.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Adverse Winter Weather</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">5. <strong>Mr Adams </strong>asked the Minister for Regional Development for an update on the ability of  the Roads Service to deal with adverse winter weather conditions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=AQO1122/08> (AQO 1122/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>:  Roads Service recognises the scale of the challenge, but it is prepared to deal  with adverse winter weather conditions. Every night from now until the middle of next April, more than 270  people will be on standby to salt  main roads, and approximately 50,000  tonnes of salt is stored in depots across the North.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Adams</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Go raibh maith agat, a Aire. I thank  the Minister for his answer. At the weekend, six people tragically lost their  lives on the roads, and adverse weather conditions may have played a role in  some of those accidents. I am sure that our  thoughts and prayers are with the bereaved families.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As the Minister will be aware, almost half the West Belfast  constituency is rural, and the roads in that area are increasingly being used  by commuters travelling to and from Belfast.  Will the Minister confirm that the Roads Service will be deployed to ensure  that gritting and sandboxes are available to keep those roads &mdash; along with  other roads in built-up areas of Lagmore, Twinbrook and Poleglass &mdash; clear and  safe, despite any adverse weather conditions?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>: I  thank the Member for his question, and I agree  with him. I once again extend my sympathies to the bereaved families.  The exact causes of the tragic accidents over the weekend are not yet known,  but they are dreadful tragedies for the families involved. The Minister of the  Environment, who has a keen interest in road safety, and I will ensure that  everything possible is done to reduce the  number of such tragedies.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We are aware that quite a few of the roads in West Belfast have become routes for people commuting to  work in the city, particularly since work began on the Westlink. The gritting  schedule is based on the number of vehicles travelling on any given road; it is  not based just on the size of the road or the fact that it is a rural road. We  will ensure that, as far as possible, 80% of roads are covered by the gritting  schedule. As a matter of interest, raising that figure to 90% would double the  costs. The gritting schedule gives priority to the most heavily travelled routes. Roads Service is conscious that, as a  result of work on the Westlink, many routes in and around West   Belfast and other parts of the city are experiencing more traffic  flow. We will ensure that such roads are kept up to standard.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Robinson</strong>:  The Minister will be aware of the tragic deaths over the weekend. Can he  guarantee that the Frosses Road  will receive special attention during the winter months due to the volume of  traffic on it and the sadly high number of fatalities there?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>: As with all the other road tragedies this weekend, the tragedy  on the Frosses Road  was a huge blow for the families involved. A number of accidents have occurred  on that stretch of road over the years.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member will be  aware that it is an 18-mile stretch of road. The cause of an accident on  any given part of that stretch is another matter entirely, and it is much too  early to speculate on the reason for the accident at the weekend. The Member  will know that there are plans to upgrade and improve stretches of the Frosses Road. In  the interim, we will look to road safety, which will involve the winter  gritting schedule. We are aware that there is heavy traffic on that road, and  all steps will be taken to improve safety there until the upgrade goes ahead.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Savage</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his answer. Would not the money that his Department has  spent on consultancy fees in the past year have been better spent on road safety and on the expansion of the roads  system, especially coming into what is predicted to be a severe winter,  and bearing in mind that he has a budget of just &pound;50 million?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>:  There are several issues to consider in answer to that question. Any spending  on consultancy fees was done as part of spending plans that direct rule  Ministers approved last year, and I want an opportunity to examine that  spending. It is simplistic, however, to say that if money were taken from one  place, it could be put to better use in another. The money that is available  allows Roads Service to cover 80% of the roads across the North &mdash; all classes  of roads. If that budget were to be increased to cover 90% of the roads, the  cost would double. Cost alone is not a reason for not doing that work, but the  Member knows that we are working to a finite budget, and resources must be  prioritised as best we can.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am happy to examine how money is spent across the  Department, and I am sure that other Ministers will do the same for next year  in order to see where improvements and efficiencies can be made.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Public Lighting in Rural Areas</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">6. <strong>Mrs D  Kelly </strong>asked the Minister for Regional Development to detail his plans for  the extension of public lighting in rural areas.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO1132/08>(AQO 1132/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>:  Roads Service last relaxed the policy provision  of road lighting in rural areas in 2002, to take into further consideration public buildings with significant night-time use. The demand for more rural lighting  must be balanced against the environmental and financial costs of  providing and maintaining additional public lighting. There are no plans for a  further review of rural public lighting criteria at this time.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I am sure that the Minister will agree that all policies should be  rural-proofed. Will he give an undertaking to the House that he will examine  that set of criteria, which were last reviewed in 2002, and update it with a view to improving conditions for  people who live in rural areas?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>:  The Member is right to say that rural proofing  should play a part in our decisions. The criteria that are used when  considering the provision of street lighting in rural areas are the density of  housing in a community, including public buildings with significant night-time  use, and road safety, where street lighting would  contribute to a reduction in the number of night-time accidents. As with  all policies, the Department is happy to examine them as we go along, and, as  the Member said, the criteria were last reviewed in 2002.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There are circumstances  in which people might criticise the overuse of street lighting in rural  areas, in that it detracts from the rural character. All those factors must be  taken into consideration. However, I have outlined the main criteria. If the  Member wishes to re-examine those criteria,  I will be happy to take her points on board.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>: I  welcome the Minister&rsquo;s comments on street lighting in rural areas. One of the  effects of increased street lighting is what is known as light pollution. What  is his Department doing to reduce light pollution?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>:  As I said in my answer to Mrs Kelly&rsquo;s question, we must consider the rural  character, and that is another reason for doing so. In order to minimise the  effect of light pollution, Roads Service makes use of more efficient lantern  systems and lamp types, which offer better control of downward lamp output and  are designed to reduce the amount of light that goes up into the night sky. Roads  Service also aims to lessen levels of light pollution by not over-lighting  roads. Designs for all street-lighting schemes are carried out to the  appropriate category for each situation and in compliance with the latest  guidance from the Institute   of Lighting    Engineers  for the reduction of light pollution.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Strangford Ferry</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">7. <strong>Mr  Shannon </strong>asked the Minister for Regional Development to detail his  Department&rsquo;s expenditure on the Strangford ferry, and the income that was  generated by the ferry, in each of the past 3 years.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO1004/08>(AQO 1004/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>:  Roads Service advises me that the cost of operating the Strangford Lough ferry  service was &pound;1,529,896 in 2004-05; &pound;1,549,921 in 2005-06; and &pound;1,783,498 in  2006-07.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The income generated during each of the three financial years was &pound;898,155, &pound;910,715 and  &pound;1,016,727 respectively. I will supply those figures to the Member in  writing if he wishes.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his response. Will the Minister recognise the  important link that the ferry provides for Strangford and Portaferry in the  premier borough of Northern    Ireland &mdash; Ards? We are linked with the  borough of Down, of course.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Is the Minister aware of the tourism potential for the  Strangford ferry, and for Northern    Ireland as a whole, and of the importance of  continuing to subsidise it in order to realise that potential?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>: I  do recognise that, and even people from  outside the Strangford constituency will recognise the importance of the Strangford ferry and the  contribution that it makes to travel in an isolated rural area of the  peninsula. I also recognise the ferry&rsquo;s contribution to tourism.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The service recovered 55% of its costs in the last  financial year, which is regarded as fairly good for this type of operation.  That shows the level of subsidy that it enjoys, and it is because of its  importance that it enjoys that level of  subsidy. If one were trying to run such a service to make money, one would fall short. The level of funds  that are returned against the costs of operating the ferry shows the importance to which the Department and the  Executive attach to that transport link.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Maskey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Although the Strangford  constituency is some distance from my constituency of West   Belfast, I recognise the importance of the tourism potential. As  someone who has used the ferry on many occasions, I may have a conflict of  interest, but will the Minister tell the House whether there will be a review  of its fare structures?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>: I  welcome the Member&rsquo;s interest; I thought that Belfast people did not get out of the city  very much. The fares for the ferry service were last revised in 2004, and a  review of the fares is under way.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Cherrymount    Link Road</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">8. <strong>Mr  Elliott </strong>asked the Minister for Regional Development what plans he has to  reconsider the proposed access arrangements from St. Michael&rsquo;s College,  Enniskillen, to the college playing fields, which will be affected by the  proposals for the new Cherrymount link road. <a name=AQO1060/08>(AQO  1060/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>: A  LeasCheann Comhairle. I recently met representatives from St Michael&rsquo;s College,  and my Department&rsquo;s Roads Service is in  consultation with it about the provision of a footbridge from the  college to its playing fields. The proposed location will provide access to the football pitches from St  Michael&rsquo;s and will also facilitate the needs of schoolchildren attending  two other schools, St Joseph&rsquo;s  College and St Fanchea&rsquo;s College, as well as providing access for the general  public.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  I thank the Minister for that assurance. What plans does the Minister have to  extend the Cherrymount link road, from its proposed route onto the Tempo Road, onto  the A4 Belfast Road?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>:  It is expected that the statutory procedures that are associated with the  Cherrymount link road scheme will be published next month, and that will bring  the procurement of that transport link to the next stage.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Road Speeds</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">9. <strong>Mr A  Maskey </strong>asked the Minister for Regional Development what progress his  Department is making to ensure that road  speeds are limited in new residential developments.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO1121/08>(AQO 1121/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>:  The guidelines for the design of road layouts and new residential developments  in the North are contained in the supplementary planning guidance, &lsquo;Creating  Places: Achieving Quality in Residential Developments&rsquo;. The guidance was  published jointly by Planning Service and Roads Service in 2000, and it is  intended to help developers to achieve high quality and greater sustainability  in the design of all new residential developments. &lsquo;Creating Places&rsquo; requires that traffic-calming measures  are designed in the layout of residential roads to reduce vehicle speeds  to a targeted maximum of 20 miles an hour.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for that  reply but, given the renewed carnage on the roads over the past few days &mdash;  which a number of Members, including the Minister, have addressed &mdash; will the  Minister give an assurance that he will work with the Minister of the  Environment to ensure that a programme is rolled out in all residential areas  to ensure that there will be a significant reduction in speed where necessary?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>: I  assure the Member that I have already met the Minister of the Environment  formally to discuss road safety.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member is quite right. Without going into the causes of the most recent accidents, driving at  excessive speed without regard to conditions is a major factor in  collisions. I have met the Minister of the Environment and the PSNI, because  there is a joint responsibility for dealing with prevention, advertising and  educating people about the danger on our roads. We must also assess what  assistance Roads Service can offer. My Department will continue that work with  the aim of reducing the incidence of road fatalities.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Translink Trains: Dual-Destination Signage</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">10. <strong>Mrs M  Bradley </strong>asked the Minister for Regional Development  when he expects Translink trains operating on the Belfast to  Derry/Londonderry line to carry dual-destination signage similar to that used  on the Maiden City Flyer Goldline service.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=AQO1131/08> (AQO  1131/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. My answer will be brief. NI  railways will implement dual-destination signage on internal and external display screens on new CAF (Construcciones y Auxiliar de  Ferrocarriles) Class 3000 trains on the Belfast  to Derry line by the end of December 2007.</p>

	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Affordable Housing</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">1. <strong>Mr Ford </strong>asked  the Minister for Social Development to report on the implications for the  provision of affordable housing arising out of the draft Budget 2008-2011.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=AQO1077/08> (AQO 1077/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Fuel Poverty</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">6. <strong>Mrs M  Bradley </strong>asked the Minister for Social Development for an assessment of how  the Executive&rsquo;s draft budget will provide the resources to combat fuel poverty  in Northern Ireland. <a name=AQO1086/08>(AQO 1086/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development (Ms Ritchie)</strong>: In the light of the similarities between  questions 1 and 6, and if the Deputy Speaker is content, I will answer  them together.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Under the proposed allocations in the draft Budget, my  Department faces a shortfall in funding of between &pound;100 million and &pound;150 million across all social-housing  programmes over the next three years. Existing commitments that will be carried  forward into next year mean that the proposed capital allocations may not allow  for any new starts next year.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The housing budget faces a significant shortfall in  capital, and the Executive&rsquo;s commitment to provide 10,000 new starts over the  next five years may not be achievable.  However, I am busily exploring the levering-in of private finance,  including through land sales. It is vital that, if I sell land, I can retain  the receipts for the house-building programme.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have commissioned Baroness Ford to investigate levering  in private finance, and she will report to me later this month. However, I must  make the House aware that that will take two or three years to become fact,  and, therefore, many problems and challenges remain. The one thing that I  learnt from my visit to London last week was that public-sector housing requires  public-sector investment.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  Will the Minister explain how the Executive&rsquo;s draft Budget will provide the  resources to combat fuel poverty in Northern Ireland?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  Despite my Department&rsquo;s success in reducing fuel poverty and improving energy  efficiency in thousands of homes, the budgets for the warm homes and fuel  poverty schemes may, unfortunately, have to be reduced. That will directly  affect the most vulnerable in society, such as children and elderly people. I  am determined to champion the needs of the vulnerable and those living in  poverty. I will continue to seek additional resources, and I need the support  of all my ministerial colleagues to achieve  that. The warm homes scheme has been highly successful and I want to be  able to continue to fund it, but I need everyone&rsquo;s support to do so.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That is why I need a full return on capital receipts and I  must be able, with my ministerial colleagues, Mrs  Foster and Mr Murphy, to pursue the implementation of article 40 of The  Planning (Northern Ireland)  Order 1991, which deals with  private-developer contributions. To  tackle long waiting lists and the high level of home&shy;lessness,  mixed-tenure housing, with a 20% social-housing provision, must be introduced  to private developments.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  never mind giving way to a lady, even if we  were called in the wrong order. Also, I must emphasise that I am not  related to Baroness Ford.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The House will be concerned at the Minister&rsquo;s suggestion  that there is a shortfall of at least &pound;100 million in her capital budget. She  talked about the importance of retaining asset sales. Has she received any  assurance from the Minister of Finance and Personnel or the Executive  collectively that asset sales from surplus  land held by her Department, in particular, will be retained for use in  the social housing budget and warm homes scheme?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  I am actively pursuing that issue with the Minister of Finance and Personnel. I  need to retain the full receipts in order to construct the social housing building programme that the people of Northern Ireland  require over the next three years. I want to meet the needs of the  people, and I want to champion the needs of those who are deprived and  disadvantaged. Above all, I want to meet the needs of all those who are on the  housing waiting list.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I will continue to  pursue the matter with the Minister of Finance and Personnel. Suffice it  to say that it has been factored into the investment strategy for Northern Ireland  as a priority. I have also raised the matter with the Committee for Social  Development, which I hope will flag it up as an important issue when it  responds to the Committee for Finance and Personnel and the Minister of Finance  and Personnel.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. One of the Minister&rsquo;s colleagues  stated that due to the way in which the Minister has arranged her budget, she  will not be in a position to build a single social house in 2008. How does that  tie in with her stated objective of placing  social and affordable housing as her number one priority? Furthermore,  how does it tie in with her stated objective of building 10,000 new social  homes over the next five years?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">With hindsight, does the Minister agree that her myopic  budgetary bids aimed at alleviating the social housing crisis were devoid of a  plan A, never mind a plan B, and that they have done nothing to help solve the  problem and, in fact, have only worsened it?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  There seems to be great confusion over the matter. I reiterate that the housing  budget faces a shortfall in capital. It is the Executive&rsquo;s &mdash; that is, the  Cabinet&rsquo;s &mdash; commitment to provide 10,000 new social homes over the next five  years. That may not be achievable. However, I am honouring the fact that social housing must be the number one priority,  because there is a clearly defined identified need among the greater  public in Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Housing was also  identified as a number one priority in a recent &lsquo;Belfast Telegraph&rsquo;  poll, along with the issue of health. Therefore, I must address that. As the  issue is so important, I am investigating other areas in which to lever in private  finance, hence the revision of Planning Policy Statement 12 relating to  mixed-tenure housing, which will mean a policy change. That is why I have commissioned Baroness Ford to carry out  financial modelling exercises on the need to investigate all the issues  to do with housing associations and land assets.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">This is a problem for the Assembly and for all of my  ministerial colleagues. I am seeking the support of all of them to achieve the budget that the people of Northern Ireland deserve in order that the social housing develop&shy;ment  programme may be provided.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I read some comments last week relating to the Department  for Social Development and the budget, and there is definitely some confusion.  It was stated that I could do something with the Department&rsquo;s land assets and  that I had plenty of money in the budget. Then it was stated that I do not have  plenty of money in the budget. Let us be real and let us get together and  champion the people who need houses in the social-rented sector.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>:  Will the Minister confirm that the issues in her budget relate to capital  spend? What steps has she taken to realise capitalisation of assets in her  Department? If all those assets were capitalised, would they meet her required  budget, or would she also need capitalisation from other Departments?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  I would welcome the support of Mr Craig and his colleagues on the Committee for  Social Development in my quest to obtain the proper and adequate budget to deliver a social-housing development  programme. It is important that I receive a guarantee that, if and when I sell  land, I will get a full return on the receipts. Above all else, I want to  deliver the social-housing development programme, and I need the support of my  ministerial colleagues to do that. The housing crisis is so great that there  are 36,000 people on waiting lists and 21,000 homeless people, and the onus is  on all Members to deliver that programme.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Dunclug Action Plan</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">2. <strong>Mr Storey </strong>asked the Minister for Social  Develop&shy;ment to provide an update on the Dunclug action plan.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO1071/08>(AQO 1071/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  I visited the Dunclug estate on 26 September, and I had a constructive meeting  on 12 November with Declan O&rsquo;Loan, Daith&iacute; McKay and Mervyn Storey about the  Dunclug area. There has been significant progress in the implementation of the  22 actions contained in the Dunclug action plan: eight have been delivered;  five are on track for delivery; and the final nine will be delivered with some  delays. I have asked officials to seek to overcome the delays, keep me abreast  of progress, involve me directly and, if necessary, overcome any issues leading  to delays. I have also placed a full update on the implementation of the  Dunclug action plan in the Assembly Library. I assure Members &mdash; particularly  those who represent the constituency of North Antrim &mdash; that when I visited the Dunclug  estate, I was fully persuaded of the need for social and economic improvements  to improve the life opportunities of the  people who reside in the estate.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>: I  thank the Minister for her dependence on the four-party mandatory coalition  that she has continually referred to today. It seems as though the SDLP has  undergone a sea change from wanting to opt out of the Executive to wanting to  be included in it. However, that is the nature of the politics in which the  SDLP engages.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Please ask a question.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  Ask a question.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>: Without any prompting from the Member for North   Belfast, I will ask the Minister a question. I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s input and her interest in  Dunclug, but can she assure me that she will not accept the delay in the  implementation of the action plan? There is a start  date of November 2008, but the Housing Executive has dragged its feet on  that. Furthermore, some matters &mdash; on which  we are awaiting delivery &mdash; could urgently be taken to the board of the  Northern Ireland Housing Executive. I am  sad to say that the action plan bears little satisfaction in the Dunclug area because of those delays.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  I thank Mr Storey for his support on this matter. As I told the three North  Antrim MLAs with whom I met in November, I have impressed on the Housing  Executive that I want to see an early start date to the work at the Dunclug  estate, because I was appalled to see the degradation and deprivation that  exists there. It is unacceptable that people should have to live in such  conditions.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  thank the Minister for her answer and for the support that she has given to the  scheme through her visit to Dunclug, her recent meeting with MLAs and the  follow-up I meetings that I know she has held. Does she agree that there are  many good and hard-working residents in Dunclug who are only trying to do the  best for their families? Does she also agree that it is important that  confidence be given to those people so that  they will remain in the estate and contribute to the social solution of  its many problems?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  I agree with my colleague Mr O&rsquo;Loan. On my visit to the Dunclug estate on 26  September, I could only be impressed by the contribution, determin&shy;ation, zeal  and commitment of those people who had an earnest desire to have the area  improved.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I can only concur with their viewpoint and hope that the  Housing Executive, along with other agencies, will be able to deliver what is  required.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have also been pursuing the Chief Constable on that  particular matter, and an additional police officer has now been appointed. I  asked the police to pursue the issue of part-time community officers, and I was  told just today that the business plan for that has now been cleared. I have asked the Chief Constable to include that  as a matter of urgency in his budget priorities.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">All the issues in housing estates can be tackled as long as I have the support of all my ministerial  colleagues in the Executive on Budget priorities and an adequate budget  allocation. I have never wavered from that standpoint, because I believe  earnestly that there must be ministerial collectiveness in tackling deprivation  and disadvantage.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs McGill</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.  Is the Minister satisfied with the performance of the Housing Executive  in implementing the action plan to date?  Will she also provide a guaranteed timescale for the full implementation  of the action plan? Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  I have told the Housing Executive on many occasions, before and after my visit  on 26 September, and before and after my meeting with MLAs in November, that I  wanted urgent action and the implementation of its particular aspects of the strategy  as quickly as possible.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am aware that the demolition of Flaxton House is part of the first phase of the estate strategy,  and interviews have commenced with the nine remaining residents about  rehousing. I have urged my officials in the Housing Executive to ensure that  those interviews are expedited as quickly as possible to ensure that those  residents are rehoused in circumstances suitable for them and their families;  then demolition can take place. So, at long last, the residents of Dunclug can  see things happening that will make their lives better.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Communication with MP for West   Belfast</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">3. <strong>Mr A  Maskey </strong>asked the Minister for Social Development to outline what  communication she has had with the MP for West Belfast  since she came into office.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO1143/08>(AQO  1143/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>: In addition to the opportunities provided by debate and through  questions in the House, my records show that the MP for West   Belfast has raised two constituency matters with me since I took  office. We have exchanged letters, spoken by telephone and met on two occasions  on those issues. Indeed, my next meeting with the MP for West   Belfast is scheduled for tomorrow.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>: I thank the Minister for her response. Will she confirm that  the MP for West Belfast first wrote to her regarding her decision on the site  of the old Andersonstown RUC barracks on 26 July, and that over a three-month period she gave no written  response, except to confirm that the  Carvill Group had withdrawn its application and that the Department gave  no proper consideration to gift-aiding the site to the local community for  community, social or public use? Will she advise the Assembly of the reasons  why she, as Minister, has dismissed that  option, despite the precedent having been set already with former  barracks sites at Fort Jericho, Henry Taggart and the Springfield Road?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  I note that the Member of Parliament for West Belfast  is not in his place at the moment and has another Member from that constituency  asking the question.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My records indicate that Mr Adams formally raised two  constituency issues with me. He wrote to me on 26 July, 10 August and 26  September regarding the Andersonstown police station site. I spoke to him by  telephone on 7 August, and met with him on 8 August in Cloonagh House. We met  again on 3 September, and I wrote to him on 3 October. He tabled a question in relation to that issue on 5 November, to which I  provided a written response. As I  outlined then, I am not gift-aiding the site, because the objective of  its redevelopment remains to shape and attract investment and add value to West  Belfast and its community while ensuring sustainability without looking to the  public purse.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I also recognise that the community in the vicinity of the former Andersonstown barracks site has  concerns that it will wish to voice;  its views are extremely important in considering the way forward. My  Department has been in contact with local community and public representatives  to see how best that can be achieved.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Maskey referred to other sites in West   Belfast, but he is slightly  misrepresenting the situation in respect of gift aid.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCausland</strong>: The MP for Belfast West does not take his seat at Westminster, nor does he  play an active role in the Assembly. The greater Shankill area is a significant  part of the West Belfast constituency. Does the Minister agree that the unionist people of the  greater Shankill area do not look to  Mr Adams as their political representative? Will she, therefore, commit  herself to taking all adequate and appropriate measures to engage with the unionist political representatives of the  Shankill area in making decisions for that constituency?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  I will be delighted to engage with Mr McCausland and his colleagues on that  issue.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I note the Minister&rsquo;s response in relation to Mr Adams. I find it bizarre that  question 3 was asked by another Member from West Belfast  rather than by Mr Adams himself. The Minister has spoon-fed Mr Adams about the situation in West   Belfast.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is another pressing matter in West   Belfast: does the Minister propose to deal with the crisis in  Ballymurphy? I know that the Minister is interested in the situation and has  tried to help. Is there anything else that  the Minister can do about that tragic situation?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  In relation to the Ballymurphy feud, I have  decided to extend funding to enable the continuance of intervention  measures in the area. That incorporates support for developing community  capacity, health, education and community-safety measures. The additional  &pound;120,000 brings my Department&rsquo;s total financial  contribution to almost &pound;400,000 since February 2006. My Department will be represented on the project board set  up to develop the extended schools initiative, which was announced by the  Minister of Education over a week ago. I have written to the Minister of  Education and the Minister of Heath, Social Services and Public Safety on the  issue.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, I have had discussions with the Gaelic Athletic Association about its contribution to  community development in marginalised communities. I was, therefore,  pleased to announce that the GAA is to fund two  community-focused posts that will centre its activities in the  Ballymurphy area. I understand that the GAA is also exploring the possibility  of developing a sports facility in the area. I welcome all those developments,  and I congratulate all involved.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Speaker has ruled that question  4 in the name of Mr Gregory Campbell may not be put on the grounds that  the matter is sub judice.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Bass Ireland  Brewery Site</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">5. <strong>Mr Attwood </strong>asked the Minister for  Social Develop&shy;ment whether her Department had an interest in the former  Bass Ireland Brewery site; and to detail the capacity of her Department to  purchase part or all of the site, and any plans for the Glenmona, Brewery, and  other Glen Road  lands.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO1083/08>(AQO 1083/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  The Member for West Belfast Mr Attwood has written two separate letters to me  on the issue, and I am looking into it. My  Department&rsquo;s ability to purchase the site in whole or in part is  influenced by budgetary constraints and the  task of prioritising resources targeted at neighbourhood renewal areas  of the city. I stress, yet again, that I am seeking the support of ministerial  colleagues to achieve an enhanced budget to tackle deprivation and  disadvantage, as well as exploring all possible avenues of levering in private  finance.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I met Mr Attwood and a  delegation of local represent&shy;atives earlier this year to discuss the  potential of the Glenmona site.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My officials and the Housing Executive have been working  with the diocese of Down and Connor. My Department has supported a change to  the current zoning arrangements in order to facilitate a mixed-use development  that will incorporate mixed-tenure housing, and I am hopeful that my Department  will work in partnership with the diocese on  the development and implementation  of an agreed master plan for the site.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As for other Department-owned land in the vicinity, the  Department is seeking to sustainably develop the site of the former  Andersonstown police station.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I thank the Minister for, as she put it, giving voice to the community  immediately adjacent to the Andersonstown barracks site. There must be an intensive, dedicated consultation process and,  whatever else happens in the lower  Andersonstown area concerning commercial development, the community&rsquo;s  needs in relation to the Andersonstown barracks site must have primacy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have two questions for the Minister. Given that the Glen Road lands, incorporating Hannahstown,  Glenmona and the Bass brewery, comprise the single biggest land bank  that is open to development in Belfast, will the Minister ask her officials to  consider how the brewery site might be integrated with other nearby sites? Will  she also ascertain whether her Department  has the means to purchase any of that site for social development?  Whatever happens, will she ensure that a situation does not arise whereby there  is a bidding war for the 20-acre site on the  Glen Road,  so that the public interest does not go to the wall?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  I thank my colleague Mr Attwood for his  supplementary questions, and I agree that an intensive, dedicated  consultation process with the residents in close proximity to the Andersonstown  police station site is required. I intend for such a consultation process to  take place. In this instance, those people&rsquo;s views are paramount.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Northern Ireland Housing Executive supports the  development of social housing on the Bass Ireland brewery site as part of a  mixed-use scheme. The InBev brewery site would, of course, be of interest to my  Department for the provision of social housing.  However, in addition to my pursuit of private-sector finance, my major  problem is that I require the support of my ministerial colleagues in order to  lever in an adequate budget, and I must be guaranteed that I will be able to  retain the full capital receipts from the project.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I fully recognise the significance of the Glenmona lands  for west Belfast, and I have had discussions with Mr Attwood about the site&rsquo;s  potential for development and, subsequently, my officials met Mr Attwood and  representatives from the diocese of Down and Connor. I am concerned by this  matter, and I will ask my officials to reconsider, because every aspect  must be investi&shy;gated to ensure that the needs of west Belfast residents come first.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Maskey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I am someone who resides in west Belfast, close to the  Andersonstown barracks &mdash; unlike the person who asked the question. Does the  Minister acknowledge that some of the areas  that were mentioned in the question have not even been put up for sale?  Perhaps if the Member who submitted the question had attended some of the  relevant meetings, he would have found out about that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">This matter is important because the combined potential  site will be bigger than the Titanic Quarter. Therefore, a good mixed-use  project that offers social housing and employment must be developed. I agree  that other Departments could be involved, and I know that the MP for the area,  Gerry Adams, has organised a meeting with stakeholders in the near future. Does  the Minister agree that a co-ordinated approach is required and that a master  plan not only for the Glenmona site but for the whole area would be useful?</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">4.00 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>: The Member for West Belfast Mr Attwood is the only Member who has written to me on that issue. As I  said, the Northern Ireland Housing Executive supports the development of social  housing on that site as part of a mixed-use scheme. My officials and I look  forward to further examining that issue.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Mr Gallagher is not in the Chamber to ask question 7, so I call Mr  Cobain.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Fuel Poverty</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">8. <strong>Mr Cobain </strong>asked the Minister for Social  Develop&shy;ment to give an assessment of progress regarding the achievement  of eradicating fuel poverty by 2016.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=AQO1081/08> (AQO  1081/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  Much has been achieved on alleviating fuel  poverty. For example, 97% of properties in Northern<span style="letter-spacing:0pt; "> </span>Ireland  now have some form of central heating. Research published by my  Department last month in the report &lsquo;Fuel Poverty, Climate and Mortality in  Northern Ireland 1980-2006&rsquo; also indicated that there has been a considerable  drop in the number of deaths linked to cold weather in recent years.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, with fuel prices likely to remain high for some  time, it will be extremely difficult to achieve the current fuel poverty  targets. Add to that the capital budget proposed in the draft investment  strategy, and the fuel poverty targets could be impossible to achieve. However,  I assure Mr Cobain and the House that I am determined to act as a champion for  those who are elderly or vulnerable by continuing to seek additional resources,  and I would appreciate the support of all my ministerial colleagues in  achieving that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Fuel poverty is  measured as a percentage of a person&rsquo;s net  income, and it is difficult when that has to be measured against fuel  prices, which have risen exponentially in recent months.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: That ends Question Time.</p>
	      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="9"></a>Private Members&rsquo; Business</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Health Service Reform</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Debate resumed on motion:</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly calls on the Minister of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety to bring forward a Health and Social Services Reform  Bill, as a matter of urgency, for consideration by the Assembly.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Buchanan</strong>: In 2002 the then Minister for Health, Mr Shaun Woodward, set  out his plans for the restruc&shy;turing of health and social care services in Northern Ireland.  At that time, Mr Woodward said:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;the current organisation of health and social  services in Northern Ireland  is too cumbersome, too bureaucratic, and inefficient.&rdquo; <span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; ">[Interruption.]</span></span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Buchanan</strong>:  It produced inequalities and unacceptable delays in treatment. He began a rapid  programme of reform and modernisation. I met him several times, and, although I  never agreed with his continuation of his predecessor&rsquo;s plans for service  delivery in the south-west quarter of Northern Ireland, which are still  fundamentally flawed, I commend him on his vision and enthusiasm for the  modernisation of the entire health structure across the Province.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The new structures were specifically designed to address  efficiency and quality by having a smaller number  of organisations and a more effective, accountable framework. The  establishment of a single health and social services authority to produce  regional standards and targets would ensure  greater equality and improved consistency in service provision across Northern Ireland.  It was envisaged that those structures would be in place by April 2008.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, it is a matter of grave concern to health professionals, the British Medical Association and  those who care about a Health Service that is professionally led and  patient centred, that Mr Woodward&rsquo;s vision is lost on the current Health  Minister, who has neither the vision nor the will to complete the reform.  Rather, he has chosen to delay the entire process, and the services are ebbing back to the dark days of five years  ago, when we had the longest waiting lists in Europe.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Such actions by any Minister are indefensible. This motion  is before the House that we might impress upon the Minister not only his  neglect of duty, but the detrimental consequences that the delay in introducing  a health and social services reform Bill are having on service delivery.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Services are already being removed or withheld as a result  of the delay. For example, as was mentioned earlier, according to one health  trust, the provision of cognitive behavioural therapy is being suspended due to  the uncertainty and is virtually non-existent. How is that in keeping with the  Minister&rsquo;s pledge to make mental-health services a priority?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">After meeting the Minister on Thursday 11 October 2007, the  chairperson of the BMA in Northern    Ireland, Dr Brian Patterson, said:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;We were exceedingly alarmed when we first learned of  the Minister&rsquo;s decision to delay the changes to the NHS proposed under the  Review of Public Administration. However, we are even more concerned because  after our meeting today we believe that another 18 months at least may well pass  before much needed reforms are put in place.</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">We were very  disappointed that the Minister was unable to identify for us his specific problems with the RPA  process, bearing in mind that this  review received public consultation twice over the past few years.</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">We advised Minister  McGimpsey and his officials that the stalling in setting up of the  commissioning process has serious ramifications for the future of patient  care.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">What were those ramifications? An article in the &lsquo;Belfast Telegraph&rsquo; on Friday 23 November 2007  quoted Mr Andrew Dougal, chief executive of the Northern Ireland Chest, Heart and Stroke Association,  voicing his concern that David  Sissling&rsquo;s resignation from Northern Ireland&rsquo;s stalled new health  authority could spell:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;a black day for the future of the Health Service&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The article went on to say that:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The HSSA was planned as part of sweeping reforms of  how the Health Service is run and was at a well-advanced stage when the  minister called a halt.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Dougal is reported as  having said that Mr Sissling&rsquo;s departure is:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;likely to mean going back to the old way of doing  things, which is not in the best interests of patients or the Health Service&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Medical professionals  and Members who contributed to the debate expressed grave concerns about  the detrimental consequences that the Minister&rsquo;s decision to delay the  implementation of RPA will have. I want to touch on some of those concerns.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Buchanan</strong>: Certainly not; I do not have much time.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Chairperson of the  Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety, Mrs Robinson &mdash;  whose untiring work on behalf of the Health  Service I commend &mdash; pointed out that fundamental change is essential for  the delivery of efficient services in Northern Ireland.  She referred to the underachievement in the Health Service and said that  too much time was being lost due to the delay  in creating one authority. She also highlighted the lack of Health Service productivity in Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members of Sinn F&eacute;in  expressed their concern at the continuing delays in reform; the effect  that delays in establishing a single  authority and commissioning groups &mdash; the main drivers for change &mdash; will  have; and the need for the Minister to embrace the challenges that reform presents. It appears that the Minister is  unwilling to take on those reforms.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Robert Coulter agreed that reforms are necessary, but  back-pedalled on comments by his party leader since Mr McGimpsey took  responsibility for health. I have to ask whether that is good for the Health  Service of Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Carmel Hanna and Tommy Gallagher expressed their concern at the delay and said that reform  was urgent. They also made a noteworthy point that an excellent Health  Service is the hallmark of any decent society. I ask the Minister to take that  on board.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Stephen Farry gets everything wrong, and he got it wrong  today. He said that this was a row between two parties. Irrespective of who the  Health Minister is, the DUP is consistent in its commitment to ensure that patient  care comes first. I wish that all parties in the Chamber were as consistent.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Alex Easton outlined measures that the Minister could take  to enable him to get on with the job of providing a more streamlined and  effective Health Service. Simon Hamilton urged the Minister to be responsible and to do the job rather than being a  constant roadblock to the delivery of proper healthcare services in Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">John McCallister sought to quote from the DUP manifesto,  but failed to realise that the underfunding has been addressed in the draft  Budget, with the Health Service receiving 48% of the block grant and 51% or  more of the overall spend.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That sees the health budget double in size, but very little  in return.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Buchanan</strong>:  No; my time is almost up. The Member has had his opportunity to speak.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">George Robinson and Jim Shannon both made the relevant  points that for every pound spent, a greater return  is required. However, we currently see no dividends from increases in the health budget; therefore,  the Minister must tidy up his own house and start to deliver.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister stated the vital need to transform and reform the system, only to make every excuse in  the book for delay. That is causing  mayhem in the health system.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, I commend the Minister for adopting the DUP  manifesto slogan of &ldquo;Getting it right&rdquo;. Obviously, the Ulster Unionist Party is beginning to learn something. He  stated that current structures have been in place since 1972, and it takes time  to get it right. I asked him whether the passage of 35 years was not a reason  for moving forward quickly. He also stated  that the establish&shy;ment of local commissioning groups had been delayed because the number of councils had not been  confirmed. There is no reason why the  process should not commence and then the commissioning groups be  rearranged in order to fit in with the number of councils.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister and his colleagues, who welcomed the new  health and social care authority, now call it the &ldquo;mother of all quangos&rdquo;. That  will not be the type of body to which the Minister simply appoints. It will be  composed of professional people, who will go through a recruitment process and  be appointed on merit. The Minister cannot seek to micromanage every aspect of the Health Service across the Province, and he  would be very foolish to try to do  so. In manifesto after manifesto, the UUP has supported those reforms.  It is time for the Minister to get on with implementing those reforms. It is  time that he began to deliver a proper Health Service for the people of Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly calls  on the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety to bring  forward a Health and Social Services Reform  Bill, as a matter of urgency, for consideration by the Assembly.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Motion made:</p>

	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Midnight Soccer in West Belfast</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  I am glad to have this opportunity to speak about a project in West Belfast. Midnight soccer is a community football  project for young people that was originally set up in north Belfast but has  grown to so that midnight soccer leagues have been organised in nine different  areas across the North of Ireland, four of them in Belfast. To date, more than  1,000 young people have participated in the locally based leagues, whose  winners then go forward to the midnight soccer finals, which are to be held in Dundalk. The project initially received funding from the  then Sports Council, the Big Lottery Fund and the Youth Justice Agency.  Recently, Sport Relief has provided funds to ensure its expansion.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Midnight soccer is about much more than young people simply  playing football. It encourages personal development and team-building among  participants, and it provides opportunities for them to realise their  potential. Some projects, although not all, provide opportunities for  participants to avail themselves of accredited coaching training. Midnight  soccer provides an alternative for young people, who may instead have spent  late evenings at weekends on the street, perhaps even becoming involved in  antisocial activity.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Several such projects currently operate in West Belfast, but, as with all positive activities, we  could do much more. Some of the projects are partly funded by Belfast City  Council and Lisburn City Council, but others, which receive no funding, are  almost totally dependent on volunteers. All  the projects take hundreds of young people off the streets on Friday  nights and encourage them to take part in a sport that is healthy and  beneficial, both to themselves and to the wider community.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the Colin area of West Belfast, which I represent,  midnight soccer is a success story that is overlooked by those who continually  portray the negative aspects of a small  number of young people rather than celebrate the positive achievements  of the majority.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The organisers of the projects in our area undertook research,  for which participants in midnight soccer were interviewed. Sixty two per cent of the young people involved  were not members of a youth club, nor had they previously taken part in  any youth club activity. That is evidence that midnight soccer engages with  those young people who are difficult to reach, or who do not engage with other  community-based projects. The research showed that 77% of the young people  interviewed said that they would have been on the streets drinking alcohol, and  21% said that they would have been misusing drugs on the streets, if they had  not been coming to the project every Friday evening.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">4.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Midnight soccer  provides a facility whereby a young person has a choice not to walk the  streets, vulnerable to alcohol and drug abuse or antisocial activity &mdash;  activities that Members know only too well can have devastating long-term  effects on both the young person and members of the local community.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The organisers of many  of the midnight soccer projects must  be commended for giving up their Friday evenings. In particular, I  commend those groups and individuals who do so in a voluntary capacity.  Participants in the West Belfast midnight  football projects are mostly male. There is an effort to get young females  involved in soccer, or a similar sport of their choice. Midnight soccer is one  of the most successful projects that there is in West   Belfast; the positive impact on the wider community cannot be  overemphasised, and there is a real need to expand the service. I hope that  funding will be available to that end.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I will conclude by congratulating a local team, Sally Gardens  A, who recently won the Colin tournament. I wish them, and the three other  teams from Colin, the best of luck in the national finals in Dundalk  on 15 December. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>: I welcome the debate, and congratulate Ms McCann on bringing  the matter to the Chamber.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">To begin with, I will reiterate some of the statistics that  Jennifer McCann outlined, and add to them in terms of the success of the  project. The evidence of the survey undertaken by Lisburn City Council and  other representative groups in West Belfast  confirms that 83% of those involved in the midnight soccer scheme say that they  would otherwise be walking the streets. Not many projects have that level of  uptake from people who would otherwise not be involved in any other youth activity, although I will name other  examples later. As the figures also confirm, 62% of those who are  involved in the scheme suggested that they would not or had not been involved  in one of the local youth clubs. That level  of uptake by people who might other&shy;wise be involved in drugs, drink or  antisocial activity is a measure of how successful the scheme has been.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Those involved in the  midnight soccer scheme would acknowledge that there are a vast array of  other youth providers in West Belfast who  provide a high level of support to young people who might not otherwise be  involved in creative activities, particularly in critical instances and around  difficult issues. There are too many to name, but there are two that I want to  name in the context of this debate, the first of which is Corpus Christi Youth Club. As questions to the Minister  indicated a short while ago, Ballymurphy has been the centre of  difficulties and turbulence over the last 18 months. Many organisations have  provided stability in that area, but one of the main providers of youth  facilities has been Corpus Christi Youth Club, which has kept its doors open to  all parts of the Ballymurphy community, despite the tensions and difficulties  that have existed between some elements of that community.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">On the opposite side,  there is Gleann Amateur Boxing Club  &mdash; a boxing club in upper Lenadoon, which I have no doubt that the Maskey  family are aware of. Despite being open for only the last six-and-a-half years,  and despite having limited funds, the club has nonetheless provided boxing and  other facilities to over 100 young people in upper Lenadoon and the Glen Road area. The  club has had disproportionate success in  boxing compet&shy;itions &mdash; which I highlight particularly because the  Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure is present, and there are ongoing discussions about attempts to provide more  stable funding and capital investment in respect of the club.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, the Corpus Christi Youth Centre, the Gleann Amateur Boxing Club, the midnight street soccer  league and interventions by many other youth organisations in West Belfast direct young people on a much more constructive and positive path. All that must be  acknow&shy;ledged and welcomed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That said, however, there is clearly a need for much wider approaches to be taken to deal with young  people who are involved in wrongdoing. Although that leads us somewhat  beyond the issue that has been brought to the Floor, all the organisations that  provide youth facilities would concur that, unless such activity by young  people is dealt with in a wider environment, the good work that is being  undertaken by those projects will end up  being frustrated. That is why new strategies are needed whereby those  who are persistent and habitual offenders are penalised properly for their  criminal activities.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It must be acknowledged  that many of the children who are involved in those schemes come from  backgrounds where there are learning  difficulties, addiction problems, broken homes and &mdash; as was indicated in  a earlier question to the Minister &mdash; mental-health problems. It must be  acknowledged that, as the Children&rsquo;s Commis&shy;sioner recently outlined, the  percentage of spending on personal and social services for young people in the  North is barely 14%. In England  and Wales,  it is 24%. Clearly, there are funding issues about support and protection for young people, especially those who  come from vulnerable backgrounds. The debate confirms that &mdash;  particularly in West Belfast, where economic and social indicators are so poor  &mdash; investment in appropriate leisure and school facilities is needed so that the  young people who attend Corpus Christi Youth Centre, the Gleann Amateur Boxing  Club or the midnight street soccer league have other opportunities to direct  their energy towards more positive outcomes.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, I welcome the debate and recognise what the  midnight street soccer league has achieved in West Belfast and in other parts of the city and the  countryside &mdash; as Jennifer McCann has outlined &mdash; and that there are many other good projects that also deserve  recognition. However, structural  issues about general youth provision must  be dealt with if the midnight street soccer league&rsquo;s good work is to be  built on and exploited.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. At the outset, I want to place on  record the fact that my colleagues and I are in no doubt about the work of many  groups in the community and voluntary sector that provide excellent services  for children and young people up to the age  of around 22 or 23. Without those groups, there would be thousands more  young people on the streets every day.  Therefore, having taken on board Mr Attwood&rsquo;s comments, I want to take  the opportunity to commend those groups for the excellent services that they  provide.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The focus of the Adjournment debate, however, is on the  midnight street soccer league. I congratulate Jennifer McCann for ensuring that  the subject was brought to the Floor of the House. I welcome the Minister to  the debate. It is helpful when a Minister listens to Members&rsquo; comments and  provides feedback. The Minister will be aware of the positive work that the  midnight street soccer league does. Indeed, it is not so much &ldquo;midnight&rdquo;  soccer, because some of the groups have been so inundated with young people who  want to be involved that they have had to drop their start times in order to  accommodate them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I recall that, shortly after Mr Poots became Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure, he was interviewed on television to highlight the  positive work that is being done in north Belfast.  As one colleague to another, I believe that he needs some extra coaching on his  football skills. However, he is aware of that good work, and I hope that he  does not show any red cards in his role as Minister.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The majority of debates in the Assembly seem to arise out  of the Members&rsquo; needs to highlight issues in their  communities, whether injustice; a lack of facilities; a lack of  resources; or lengthy waiting lists. I do not propose changing that because we  are in the mouth of Christmas. There are realities that must come to the fore  around the issue of midnight soccer, which is one of the good news stories.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As Jennifer McCann has  said, more than 1,000 young people take part in midnight soccer every  week. That means that over 1,000 young people are off the streets and taking  part in a positive, worthwhile project. It means that 1,000 young people are  taking part in sport which will help to ensure that they have a good start to a  healthy lifestyle. Everyone will agree that sport can play a positive role in  our communities, and has an important role  to play in addressing many social issues. Statistics in England, as  well as here, have shown that it can help to reduce crime and antisocial  behaviour.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  Does the Member agree that, on many occasions, when such groups get off the  ground and start to do excellent work, even  the minimal funding that they receive becomes a target for Departments,  Councils and other funding agencies? It is seen as an easy way to gather money  in for their coffers at a time of cuts in funding.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Does the Member also agree that many sectors&mdash; such as youth  clubs and outreach youth workers &mdash; have come together on an area-wide basis to  tackle antisocial activity, and that one of the ways they do that is through  midnight soccer and other forms of sport and external activity?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  I concur absolutely with all that the Member has said. Undoubtedly, he looked  over Jennifer McCann&rsquo;s shoulder and saw that my next point &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  I could play football too.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  I think that you should start playing football. Since we are talking about a  healthy lifestyle, perhaps we should all play football again. As I said  earlier, midnight soccer has a positive aspect, and an impact at community  level, for the family unit, and for the individual. I take this opportunity to  commend the sports lottery fund, because we must give credit where credit is  due. I take on board the point that Mr McCann made.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The sports lottery fund,  individuals in the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure &mdash; prior to  the Minister&rsquo;s taking up office &mdash; and people in the Big Lottery Fund have, with  the help of others, played a positive role. They had the foresight to see that  it could work in constituencies. Members always talk about providing activities  for children and young people. However, we never ask what those children and  young people want. Midnight soccer is probably one of the few examples of  people in authority, statutory agencies and the local community getting  together to provide what is needed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, I am concerned  about funding, and I return to Fra McCann&rsquo;s point. I have several times  raised the concern that moneys are being lost from the Minister&rsquo;s Department,  and from organisations that are closely associated  with the Minister, to fund the Olympic Games. That has a negative impact  on ensuring that midnight soccer, and sports facilities in general, move  forward.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A project that was  headed up by the Lenadoon Forum, in my constituency of West   Belfast, went through all of the hoops and jumped all of the  barriers. The project got through every stage except the final one, at which point they should have received their letter of  offer, when the carpet was pulled  from under them. The reason given to them was that money was being lost  to the Olympic Games. Therefore, we need to examine the matter</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The main focus of that  project was to upgrade facilities and to ensure that they were the best.  I do not detract from the good and positive work that is done, mostly by  volunteers. The project leaders envisaged bringing the facility into the  twenty-first century to ensure that more young people would become involved and  healthy, and that, eventually, they would get them off the streets and turn  those young people into model citizens of tomorrow. Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure (Mr Poots)</strong>: I welcome the debate on the issue of  midnight soccer in West Belfast. At the  outset, it is appropriate to consider midnight soccer in its wider context.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I made a statement in the House on 9 October on the  introduction of a draft Northern    Ireland strategy for sport and physical recreation 2007-17. On that occasion, I sought  to set out the role of sport in society, tracing participation in sport and  physical recreation at all levels, from  grass-roots community level to achievement at the highest level. In my  statement, I also sought to highlight the value of sport. Taking part in sport  is fun, fulfilling and is of value in its own right.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">4.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Equally, sport has the potential to deliver other significant benefits. It can play a vital role in  improving public health; contribute to our children&rsquo;s improved academic  performance and self-esteem; and Members have outlined how young people were  participating in something positive when they may have otherwise been involved  in drug-taking or underage drinking.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Sport can be a valuable  tool in promoting neighbour&shy;hood renewal. Ms Ramsey was right when she  said that I had visited north Belfast.  In fact, I visited the Waterworks on my first official day in office. I met  some of the young lads who were taking part in midnight street soccer. They  thoroughly enjoyed participating in a sport that they found fulfilling.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Obviously, sport can touch on TSN issues, social  deprivation and a range of areas; and the Department and the Committee for  Culture, Arts and Leisure have often put forward that argument. This debate  will help to highlight the value of sport at  street level, and midnight street soccer is an excellent example of how  to bring sport to people who are vulnerable and most in need.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I applaud the midnight street soccer project for its innovative and flexible approach, which brings  positive activity to many young people at the time when they are most  susceptible to negative influences. It is important  to recognise the foresight of the North Belfast Play Forum, which  introduced this concept to Belfast  in such a structured manner. Midnight street soccer is more than simply a  football project. It incorporates the midnight street soccer championships,  aimed at young people between 14 to 17  years of age, and offers five-a-side football in the heart of the  community from 9.00 pm to midnight on Saturday nights.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It has introduced the midnight street soccer football club,  which offers opportunities for young people from diverse backgrounds and  communities to participate in leagues, competitions and education programmes.  Young people are also provided with opportunities to acquire the skills and  qualifications to become football coaches through the midnight street soccer  coach education programme. That approach delivers partici&shy;pation, team-building  and aspiration, and also provides opportunities for the transfer of coaching  skills. Thus, it offers personal development and the potential for long-term  community benefit.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Midnight street soccer has established itself in a relatively short period and is quickly becoming a  model of best practice in demonstrating the positive impact of sport in addressing social issues. It is currently  available at Avoniel Leisure Centre  in east Belfast; Brook Activity Centre in the Lisburn City Council area;  Brownlow Campus Sports Trust in Craigavon;  Cregagh Community Centre,  Castlereagh; Paisley Park on the Shankill Road; Olympia Leisure Centre  in south Belfast; Shantallow MUGA in Londonderry;  the Waterworks Sports Facility in north Belfast; and the Valley Leisure  Centre in Newtownabbey.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although it is still in its infancy, the project in West Belfast has shown encouraging signs. The benefits  emerging from it include the provision of opportunities for young people who  would not traditionally take part in sport. Those opportunities are available  to young people who live in communities that are vulnerable to antisocial  behaviour, and the project provides a basis for  the development of effective partnerships with local community and voluntary organisations and sports  clubs.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">So far, midnight soccer has provided important  opportunities for local people to gain training and progress into employment.  It supports the effective use of council and community facilities at a time  when they would otherwise be disused. I encourage the maximum usage of  facilities, and I trust that, in future, we will engage more closely with the  Department of Education to ensure that the many good facilities that exist can  be fully used &mdash; and perhaps enhanced as a consequence of that increased usage.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is an important development in the context of the new  draft strategy, which places priority on increasing participation in sport and  physical recreation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Midnight soccer will help to deliver that objective, not  just for those who currently take part; it will also create the habit of  involvement that can be handed down to succeeding generations.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I concur with those who have expressed concerns about  funding. We have lost funding as a result of the diversion of resources to the London Olympics in 2012, and we  must examine ways to address that matter. We have sought more funding through  the comprehensive spending review and have been successful to an extent.  However, the Department would always welcome more financial support so that it  can carry out good initiatives such as midnight soccer.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I warmly welcome the support of the House for the midnight  soccer initiative in West Belfast. It is a  fine example of how local needs can be addressed through the medium of sport  and physical recreation. I hope that the project will go from strength to  strength and encourage other innovative approaches to further promote  participation and involvement.</p>
