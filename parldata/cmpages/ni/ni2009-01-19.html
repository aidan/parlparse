	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The Assembly met at 12.00 noon (Mr Speaker in the  Chair).</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Members observed two minutes&rsquo; silence.</p>
	      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="1"></a>Assembly Business</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I will take the point of order from the Member.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I wish to make two points of order.  The first relates to the debate on the Financial Assistance Bill that took  place last Tuesday, 13 January. During the debate, Mr Declan O&rsquo;Loan made  remarks about my colleague Mitchel McLaughlin&rsquo;s role at a meeting of the  Committee for Finance and Personnel that had taken place the previous week.  Will the Speaker check the Hansard reports of that Committee meeting and of  Tuesday&rsquo;s debate to determine the accuracy of those remarks?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My second point of order relates to the education debate on  13 January, during which Mr Mervyn Storey made remarks about my party colleague  Caitr&iacute;ona Ruane. He said that she had &ldquo;put on her educational balaclava.&rdquo; I  consider those remarks to be unparliamentary, and I ask the Speaker to check  the Hansard report of that debate.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I thank the Member for her points of order. On the first point, I will review  the Hansard reports and come back to her.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">On the second point of order, I have studied the Hansard  report of the debate on the closure of rural schools on Tuesday 13 January. Yet  again, I find myself reminding Members of the standards that are expected  during any debate in the House. Members should know by now that direct,  unsubstantiated allegations of criminal behaviour against another Member are  highly unparliamentary.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The comments that were made directly about the Minister of  Education fell short of the moderate or good temper that is expected in the  House and were, at least, very discourteous. However, I do not consider that  they crossed the line into unparliamentary language. I have repeatedly warned  Members, and I do so again, to take care about what they say about each other  to ensure that they do not cross that line. I say that to every Member of the  House, because debates can become heated, and sometimes things are said that,  on reflection, should not have been said. I again remind Members on all sides  of the House to be mindful of their language.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  Further to that point of order, Mr Speaker, will you clarify how you came to  the conclusion that any of my remarks could have implied criminal behaviour?  Where did you get that assessment of the issues that I raised or the statement  that I made, which I have no difficulty with and will repeat? I find the sensitivity  of the Members opposite astounding, bearing in mind their past and what they  were engaged in for 40 years. All of a sudden they have become very sensitive  about allegations and things that are said in this House.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I did not accuse the Member of making allegations of criminal behaviour. I was  making a general point to Members concerning what they say and do in the House.  I was not accusing the Member of accusing another Member of criminal behaviour.</p>
	      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="2"></a>Ministerial Statement</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">North/South Ministerial Council</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Education Sectoral Format</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I have received notice from the Minister of Education that she wishes to make a  statement about the outcome of the North/South Ministerial Council meeting in  education sectoral format.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education (Ms Ruane)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat. With your permission, Mr  Speaker, I wish to make a statement regarding the meeting of the North/South  Ministerial Council (NSMC) in education sectoral format, which was held in the Mont Clare Hotel, Dublin,  on 10 December 2008. I represented the Executive as Minister of Education,  along with junior Minister Jeffrey Donaldson. The Irish Government were  represented by Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, Minister for Education and Science. This  statement has been agreed with Jeffrey Donaldson and is made on behalf of us  both.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A Cheann Comhairle, ba mhian liom r&aacute;iteas a thabhairt  maidir le cruinni&uacute; de chuid na Comhairle Aireachta Thuaidh/Theas i bhform&aacute;id na  hearn&aacute;la oideachais. Tion&oacute;ladh an cruinni&uacute; sa Mont Clare Hotel, Baile &Aacute;tha Cliath ar 10 Nollaig  2008.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I will summarise the main points from the meeting, ranging  across all the agreed areas of education co-operation. The North/South  Ministerial Council endorsed proposals for future work on education underachievement,  which will focus initially on interventions to support parents and families in  helping their children with education and on challenges facing children from  the most disadvantaged backgrounds.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Tabharfaidh m&eacute; achoimre ar na pr&iacute;omhphoint&iacute; a ndearnadh pl&eacute;  orthu ag an chruinni&uacute;, thar na r&eacute;ims&iacute; comhaontaithe ar fad maidir le comhoibri&uacute;  san earn&aacute;il oideachais.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Council noted the positive report from the successful  first joint conference on numeracy, which I attended. The areas identified in  the report for further development, including possible collaboration in the  areas of mathematics in initial teacher education, are under consideration by  the two Departments.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We welcomed the establishment by the Department of  Education of a task force on Traveller education, jointly chaired by Irish  Traveller Catherine Joyce and Dr Robbie McVeigh, which will bring together a  wide range of stakeholders across the island; the proposal to hold a  North/South conference on best practice in Traveller education in March 2009;  and the proposal to hold a peer learning event in March 2009 on the subject of  school attendance.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">On the issue of teacher qualifications and teachers&rsquo;  superannuation, the Council noted the collaborative work on the portability of  teachers&rsquo; pensions; the seminars for student teachers to provide information on  the Irish language qualification requirements for teaching in Southern schools;  the communication and co-operation between the inspectorates of both  Departments of Education in relation to the professional development of  inspectors; and the collaborative work on leadership development issues and the  joint research project on how best to attract and develop new school leaders.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Thug an Chomhairle d&aacute; haire an tuarasc&aacute;il dhearfach  d&rsquo;&eacute;irigh as an ch&eacute;ad chomhdh&aacute;il ar uimhearthacht ar &eacute;irigh go hiontach l&eacute;i agus  a raibh mise i l&aacute;thair aici. T&aacute; breithni&uacute; &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh ag an d&aacute; Roinn maidir leis  na r&eacute;ims&iacute; a sainaithn&iacute;odh sa tuarasc&aacute;il a raibh tuilleadh forbartha de dh&iacute;th  orthu, lena n-&aacute;ir&iacute;tear comhoibri&uacute; f&eacute;ideartha i r&eacute;imse na matamaitice in  oideachas tosaigh na m&uacute;inteoir&iacute;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We also welcomed the findings of a study on the North/South  student teacher exchange programme, which has been a great success in  developing greater knowledge of each other&rsquo;s education system and curriculum.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I now turn to special education needs. The Council noted  the further progress that has been made in the past six months on the services  provided by the all-island Middletown Centre for Autism, including the  development of the centre&rsquo;s training schedule for the current academic year. We  also noted the completion of the centre&rsquo;s detailed consultation with parents  and other interested parties on how its services can be best provided.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We noted the main conclusions and findings of the  consultation exercise, which will be published on the centre&rsquo;s website. Some  90% of those who responded agreed with the centre&rsquo;s residential approach. We  noted that the centre is developing, with key partners, the important processes  and criteria for referral to, and attendance at, the centre. In addition, we  noted that a planning application had been made for the main rebuilding and  refurbishment programme, and welcomed the completion of the refurbishment of  the office accommodation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Chuir muid f&aacute;ilte roimh thortha&iacute; an staid&eacute;ir a rinneadh ar  an chl&aacute;r malartaithe &aacute;bhar m&uacute;inteora Thuaidh/Theas, ar &eacute;irigh go hiontach leis  maidir le n&iacute;os m&oacute; eolas a fhorbairt ar ch&oacute;ras oideachais ar churaclam an d&aacute;  limist&eacute;ar.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Council also welcomed plans by the two Education  Departments to organise jointly an autistic spectrum disorders conference in  November 2009.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I now turn to school, youth and teacher exchanges. The  Council welcomed the ongoing commitment to cross-border school, youth and  teacher exchanges as a means of fostering mutual understanding and exploiting  opportunities for mutual benefit. We also welcomed the work programme for the  North/South Exchange Consortium, which will support the work of the two  Departments in developing a joint approach for the management and funding of  educational exchanges. The Council will consider at a future meeting a report  on progress achieved.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mar fhocal scoir, shocraigh muid gur ch&oacute;ir an ch&eacute;ad  chruinni&uacute; den Chomhairle Aireachta Thuaidh/Theas i bhform&aacute;id na hearn&aacute;la  oideachais a thion&oacute;l in Aibre&aacute;n/Bealtaine 2009.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In closing, we agreed that the next meeting of the  North/South Ministerial Council in education sectoral format should take place  in April/May 2009. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education (Mr Storey)</strong>: As Chairperson of the  Committee, I want to ask the Minister about her references in today&rsquo;s statement  to the Middletown Centre for Autism. The Committee for Education heard directly  from Gary Cooper, chief executive of the centre, and his senior colleagues, at  its meeting on 8 October 2008. We received a detailed written response to  follow-up questions from Mr Cooper and the Department on 12 November and 14  November 2008.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister said in her statement that the Council noted  the further progress that has been made in the past six months on the services  provided at Middletown.  However, one of the Committee&rsquo;s major concerns was: why the delay in providing  the key assessment and learning support services for children and young people  until spring 2010?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It was announced in 2002 that the Middletown centre provided those services.  With estimated annual running costs of &pound;3&middot;5 million, and several million pounds  being pumped into the centre over the past seven years, I will ask again: why  will the centre not be fully operational to provide its key services for yet  another year? I note the Department&rsquo;s written response to the Committee for  Education last November, which said:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;it is regrettable that the centre has been subject to  delay&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In her reply to my question, can the Minister inform the  House precisely how much public money &mdash; resource and capital &mdash; has been spent  to date on the Middletown project, and when will we really see delivery on an  issue that has been dragged on for far too long?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: Go raibh maith agat as an cheist sin. Thank you for that  question.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The decision to establish the Middletown Centre for Autism  jointly was endorsed by the North/South Ministerial Council at its education  sectoral meeting on 11 April 2002.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">12.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The project was initially delayed because the vendors were  unable to sell until April 2004. The property was then purchased in June 2004.  Following the purchase, the project was delayed while the Department of  Education carried out an extensive revised economic appraisal, which was  approved by the Department of Finance and Personnel in July 2006.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I take no responsibility for that delay; it happened under  a direct rule Minister. Members know that I believe that the centre is a very  important project. One of the first visits that I made as a Minister &mdash; with  deputy First Minister, Martin McGuinness &mdash; was to the centre. I am very  impressed with the centre&rsquo;s work.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The two Education Departments, along with the integrated  design team, have been progressing matters pertaining to the rebuilding and  refurbishment programme. The centre has provided training courses since  December 2007 and a research function since the summer of 2008. The assessment  services cannot come on stream until the completion of the building programme  in spring 2010.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, next year will see the modelling of the two-day  education assessment service for children and young people with autistic  spectrum disorder. The centre is developing a three-year corporate plan and a  business plan, which will be made available once approved. All Members are  aware of the importance of providing services for children on the autistic  spectrum. The Middletown Centre is a centre of excellence.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Funding for the purchase and running costs of the  Middletown Centre has been provided on a 50:50 basis by the Department of  Education in the North of Ireland and the Department of Education and Science  in the South of Ireland. The Department of Education spent &pound;1&middot;5 million on the  purchase of the property. The running costs of the centre are estimated at  approximately &pound;3&middot;5 million per annum and are shared equally between the two  Departments.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The refurbishment costs are being considered by my  Department and the Department of Finance and Personnel (DFP) as part of an  updated economic appraisal. The Department of Health and Children in the South  also funds half the therapy and day costs. I hope that no Member believes that  funding should not be provided for children who deserve to attend the centre.  In fact, I know that Members will join me in wishing the centre all the best in  the wonderful work that it is doing. The amount of money involved is relatively  modest, given the services provided in what is a very exciting project.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Maskey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agaibh, a Cheann Comhairle agus a Aire. My West   Belfast constituency contains many children from the Travelling  community. What provisions are available for children from the Travelling  community, including Roma? Sometimes many of those children are left to their  own devices for far too long.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I welcome the Member&rsquo;s focus on Traveller and Roma children, who  are among some of the most disadvantaged children throughout the island of Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The common funding formula resulted in schools receiving  &pound;983 per Traveller child for 2008-09. In the same year, earmarked funding of  &pound;364,000 was provided to education and library boards for the education of  Traveller children. Therefore, a total of more than &pound;1 million was provided as  additional funding for the education of Traveller children in the North of  Ireland, 92% of whom do not have formal qualifications. That is a staggering  number of young people from any ethnic group, and a figure about which I am  very much concerned.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My Department recognises the need to build a more co-ordinated  approach to Traveller education; therefore, the creation of a centralised  service is a high priority. I have established a task force on Traveller  education that brings together representatives from statutory and non-statutory  bodies from all of Ireland.  They will help the Department to develop an action plan that will be a catalyst  for real and lasting change in the education of children from the Traveller  community. The task force will build on current engagement with the voluntary  sector in order to explore how the statutory sector and organisations that  support the Travelling community can work together in an effort to ensure  better educational outcomes.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As I said in my statement, a North/South conference on good  practice in Traveller education is scheduled for 11 March 2009. That will be  aimed primarily at educationalists. Relevant non-governmental organisations will  also participate. The conference will raise awareness among principals and  teachers of a range of good practice, and encourage the associated changes in  schools.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Updated guidance, in the form of a school circular, will be  provided to schools in 2009 on the education of children from the Travelling  community. After it has been considered by the Task Force on Traveller  Education, the circular will be issued to schools for consultation. As I said,  Catherine Joyce, who is an Irish Traveller, co-chairs that task force with Dr  Robbie McVeigh.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am also aware that Roma children are enrolled in some  schools in the North. Although there is no census information on those  children, from next year there will be a &ldquo;Roma&rdquo; category in the annual school  census, which means that we will be able to obtain a more accurate picture of  where they are enrolled. Many Roma children have never been to school, and  those who are enrolled in schools have attendance and significant attainment  problems.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Roma children also have language requirements, for which my  Department is already providing funding, because they are classed as having  English as an additional language (EAL). We are also planning additional  funding for the incoming year, in recognition of the barriers to learning that  Roma children face, which are similar to those that Irish Traveller children  face. That means that schools with such children will obtain additional funding  under two separate categories &mdash; Roma children will be classed as both EAL  children and children from the Travelling community. In the past, Roma children  were not entitled to free school meals, and all Members will agree that no  children should go hungry in our classrooms. Therefore, we have put in place  interim arrangements to ensure that Roma children get a meal during the school  day.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Before I ask my question, is it in order to raise a point of order?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  No, it is not. However, the Member can raise it when questions to the Minister  on her statement have finished.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I will do that, Mr Speaker.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We are in a strange situation in which the Minister&rsquo;s  answers to questions are longer than her statement. One might be forgiven for  thinking that the Minister had a little bit of prior information about the  questions.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister cited the developments on educational  underachievement in the Republic   of Ireland, which has a  comprehensive education system. Is she aware of an Irish Government report that  states that one in 10 children still leave school without basic reading and  writing skills, which rises to one in three children from disadvantaged  communities? Given those statistics from the South, will the Minister agree  that academic selection is a red herring that has nothing to do with tackling  educational underachievement? Will she also admit that her efforts in the past  18 months have been a waste of time, because they have failed to address the  real issues that our communities face?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: Educational underachievement is unacceptable, wherever it occurs  on this island. One reason why I place educational underachievement at the top  of my agenda for North/South Ministerial Council meetings is that I want to see  all children on this island get access to the best possible education. We must  ensure that we do not leave any child behind and that every child gets a fair  chance. If children do not get a fair chance in Mayo, Galway, Cork,  Derry, Donegal or Belfast,  we must do something about that. Children get one chance in life, and we must  ensure that every barrier to opportunities for children is removed. I would  appreciate if the Member listened to my answer to his question.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">With regard to the use of academic selection, if any Member  thinks that it is acceptable that 12,000 young people leave school without  GCSEs in English and maths or Irish and maths, I do not share that view. I will  not be a Minister who presides over educational apartheid. If Members are happy  that 92% of the Travelling community leave school without any formal  qualifications, let it be on their consciences, because it will not be on mine.  My party and I will take every possible step to ensure that the best possible  education system is in place for Traveller children, Roma children and all  children who face barriers. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I was asked whether I thought that I had wasted my time &mdash;  absolutely not.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The debate that we have been having in recent months has  been crucial. Thankfully, there is no more 11-plus &mdash; it is gone. I hope that we  can reach agreement on the matter, and I will do everything that I can in order  to ensure that we can reach agreement in the House. However, if we cannot do  so, I will issue guidance. I will not stand idly by and watch while our  children are failed. We should not compare educational underachievement in the  South with that in the North. We should celebrate children who achieve and  ensure that those who are not achieving have the opportunity &mdash; that they richly  deserve &mdash; to do so. We have failed generations of young people, and that cannot  continue.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I heard an echo of the former  Taoiseach Jack Lynch when the Minister said that she would &ldquo;not stand idly by&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an r&aacute;iteas at&aacute; d&eacute;anta ag an Aire inniu,  agus gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas l&eacute;i as. Ach mar sin f&eacute;in, t&aacute; ceist n&oacute; dh&oacute; agam di. Ba  mhaith liom a fhiafra&iacute; den Aire an bhfuil aon dul chun cinn d&eacute;anta aici maidir  le c&uacute;rsa&iacute; a chur ar f&aacute;il i gcol&aacute;iste oili&uacute;na anseo sa Tuaisceart do oili&uacute;int  in-seirbh&iacute;se m&uacute;inteoir&iacute; agus do oili&uacute;int &aacute;bhar oid&iacute; sa ch&aacute;il&iacute;ocht Gaeilge at&aacute;  riachtanach i gcol&aacute;ist&iacute; sa Deisceart.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Minister for her statement, which I welcome.  Has she made any progress in providing in-service and initial teacher-training  courses for the Irish-language qualification that is necessary in the South?  Has she made any provision for such courses in a training college in the North  of Ireland?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: Go raibh maith agat as an cheist sin. As the Member knows, a  review of Irish-medium education is taking place, and there have been major  consultations on it. I am sure that the Member&rsquo;s party has made a submission to  the review, and, if it has not, I urge it to do so. All the submissions will be  studied carefully, and we will introduce a programme for every aspect of  Irish-medium education.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>: I  thank the Minister for her statement. To follow on from Dominic Bradley&rsquo;s  comments about teachers&rsquo; qualifications, a seminar will be held to provide  information on the requirements for the Irish-language qualification. Did the  Minister get any sense that, in the South, those requirements may eventually be  relaxed slightly rather than done away with?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: Go raibh maith agat as an cheist sin. As the Member knows,  teachers from here who wish to teach in the primary sector in the South but who  do not hold the requisite Irish-language qualification &mdash; an scr&uacute;d&uacute; le haghaidh  c&aacute;il&iacute;ochta sa Ghaeilge &mdash; are granted provisional recognition as teachers by the  Department of Education and Science, and they are allowed five years in which  to acquire the qualification. On attainment of that qualification, they are  then recognised in the South of Ireland as being fully qualified. Provisionally  recognised teachers are placed on the appropriate point of the salary scale,  and they are entitled to qualification allowances.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the case of post-primary schools, the Irish-language  requirement applies only to teachers who are employed in Gaeltacht schools &mdash;  where every subject is taught through the medium of Irish &mdash; and to teachers who  teach any subject through the medium of Irish. I am sure that Members will  understand that in the South of Ireland, the Irish language is taught in the  same way as the English language and that many different subjects are taught  through the medium of Irish. It is a key part of the curriculum, and children  learn in a bilingual way from the moment that they start school.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We have done everything that we can to ensure that no one  is disadvantaged, but we must respect the native language of a country at the  same time.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCausland</strong>:  In the Minister&rsquo;s statement, she said that she would treat children from the  Travelling community as children for whom English is an additional language.  What was the basis for that decision? What research has been carried out on the  competence of children from the Travelling community in the English language  and in the language that is traditionally associated with that community,  which, I think, is either Cant or Shelta?</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">12.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: Plenty of research has been done on the subject of  English-language education for Traveller children. The Member will be aware  that the Travelling community was a key focus of a recent Equality Commission  conference. Report after report has shown the serious disadvantage that the  Travelling community experiences. Education in the cultural traditions and  language &mdash; Cant &mdash; of Traveller children is now a part of the curriculum in  order to avoid the racism that the Travelling community faces in Ireland, North  and South. I take the matter very seriously.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McKay</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement, and I  especially welcome the work that is being done on educational underachievement.  What were the main outcomes of the discussions that took place at the most  recent North/South Ministerial Council meeting in education sectoral format?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: Go raibh maith agat as an cheist sin, a Dhaith&iacute;. Appropriately,  the most recent North/South Ministerial Council meeting in the education  sectoral format was held in Dublin on 10 December 2008 &mdash; International Human  Rights Day. At that meeting, Ministers endorsed proposals for future work on  educational underachievement. That work will focus initially on interventions  to support parents and families from disadvantaged backgrounds in helping their  children to face educational challenges.</p>
	      <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr McClarty] in the Chair)</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We noted the positive report from the successful first  joint conference on numeracy, which I attended, along with Se&aacute;n Haughey TD from  the South of Ireland. The areas that were identified for further development in  the report included possible collaboration on mathematics and initial teacher  education. The two Departments are considering those issues, but it was useful  that that conference focused solely on numeracy and mathematics. It brought  together some of the best minds on the island, North and South, to develop  strategies to deal with poor numeracy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We welcomed the establishment of the Task Force on  Traveller Education. A follow-up conference on best practice in Traveller  education will take place in March 2009, and a proposal has been made to hold a  peer learning event in the same month. Some good work has been done on  leadership. We all know that school leadership and the role of principals is  very important, and we are putting a huge amount of energy into implementing  the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) recommend&shy;ations  on school leadership and on how to tackle some of the issues.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: I  wish to return to the subject of educational underachievement. We know that it  is an important issue, particularly in Protestant working&ndash;class areas; however,  the biggest barrier may be educational aspiration. In discussing the matter  with her counterparts in Dublin, or even looking to GB for an example, does the  Minister now recognise that, where geographical criteria are used for  admissions to schools, the evidence backs up the fact that parents who have  more money can buy houses that are closer to the most popular schools, and  children from disadvantaged areas lose out more than they would under a system  of academic selection?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: First, I am glad that the subject of educational  underachievement is now firmly on the agenda. When I came into this post many  months ago, people were talking about a world-class education system, without  focusing on educational underachievement. Thankfully, how to deal with that is  now on the agenda. Thankfully, the 11-plus is gone. I welcome the fact that we  are now considering how our children will transfer from primary education to  post-primary education.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have brought proposals to the Executive, and I have made  no secret in the House of my views on academic selection. I say to those who  are concerned about a postcode lottery, let us look at the lottery that  currently exists. In the past, I gave Members statistics on children from areas  such as &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  The Malone Road.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: The Malone Road  or Hillsborough, for example. Those areas would be viewed as affluent, and they  would not appear at the top of the Noble index or be considered under new  targeting social need. I also gave Members statistics for the Shankill Road, the  New Lodge and other parts of the North.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Those statistics are very worrying. I welcome Mr Ross&rsquo;s  question about how we will ensure that the new proposals do not recreate the  postcode lottery that currently exists. That can be achieved in a couple of  ways. We should keep families and communities together, which is a good way to  build strong communities and to make sure that children are not bypassing local  schools.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members will be aware that in the proposals that I brought  forward, a very small number of free school meals is provided in the grammar  school sector, and a much higher 19% in the secondary sector. Therefore,  because I have listened to what Members said, my proposals look at social  justice criteria in order that the number of children getting free school meals  is spread fairly right across the school system, thereby avoiding a situation  in which some schools have 34% and 58% of children getting free school meals,  and some schools have 0%.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Despite the Minister&rsquo;s update on progress at Middletown, is it not the fact that it is  unlikely that children will be at the centre before 2010, and that given her  High Court humiliation over contracts, that deadline may be put even further  back?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">What has been the staffing cost at Middletown since 2005? It hardly takes  hundreds of thousands of pounds to put a programme together. However, that is  all that seems to have been achieved at Middletown  so far. Given all the consultations that the Minister alleges that she has had  &ndash; and there are concerns about the centre, the numbers attending and its  location &ndash; has she made any concrete arrangements for health cover?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, is the Minister willing for her Middletown folly to be the subject of a full  debate in the Chamber?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: It worries me when I hear constant criticism of a centre that  will be for our most vulnerable children. It worries me greatly, and I am very  disappointed that some Members are trying to diminish the centre. This is a key  centre of excellence for our children &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  How many?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: Excuse me; there is no need to interrupt. I did not interrupt  you.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The centre will provide key services for some of our most  vulnerable children. I am very surprised to hear that the Member may have  concerns about location. The Member comes from the constituency of South Down.  Surely, it is his role to ensure that services are located not just in the Belfast area. I hope that  the Member will read the Bain Report on the issue of decentralisation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The qualification must be made that some people think that  there is a problem with the centre&rsquo;s location. I believe that the location is  very good; the centre is strategically located so that children can travel to  it from all parts of the North and the South. It is very good that we have that  centre in the North of Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  What about the funding?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I have already provided the funding figures. The four key  services to be provided by the centre are a learning support service, an  educational assessment service, a training and advisory service, and an autism  research and information centre. The centre will be multi-disciplinary and  operate in support of local services, but will not offer a primary referral  service.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">This may be news to the Member, but the centre has already  begun to deliver training courses. Approximately 360 education professionals  have been trained. A planned training schedule of almost 30 training sessions,  delivering training to education professionals and allied professionals,  statutory and voluntary, is in place for 2009. Research has commenced on data  collection for internal analysis by the centre and a review of literature on  diet and its impact on autism. That was one of a number of research issues that  were identified during the centre&rsquo;s public consultation. The education  assessment and learning support services will come on stream when building  works are complete, which is expected to be in the spring of 2010.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">With regard to the North/South dimension, the Southern  Government&rsquo;s Department of Health and Children and Department of Education and  Science are funding the centre. Unfortunately, in the North, only the  Department of Education is providing funding.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I refer the Minister to the final section of her report to the Assembly, which  deals with school, youth and teacher exchanges. I am concerned about that  section because, as she is aware, a proposal was made during the first mandate  to create a trust in which the work of the British Council, the Youth Council  and L&eacute;argas would be integrated in order to maximise North/South educational  exchanges.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Since the current Minister took up her position, an  economic appraisal and a review of that proposal have been carried out, but the  Minister has not come to the Assembly to explain what is happening with that  proposal. Where is the review that arose from the economic appraisal? Is the  Minister concerned that a good model for joined-up educational exchanges on  this island &mdash; the proposal for a trust &mdash; is in jeopardy and that a lesser model  will be put in place?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: As the Member knows, an unprecedented amount of North/South work  has been carried out at all levels. I outlined the amount of work that is going  on, and I will continue to do North/South work, as I do British-Irish work.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">During the North/South Ministerial Council meeting, we welcomed  the work programme for the North/South Exchange Consortium, which will support  the work of the two Departments in developing a joint approach for the future  management and funding of educational exchanges. At a future meeting, the NSMC  will consider a report on the progress that has been achieved.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I call Mr Francie Brolly.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>:  Thank you. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Mr Francie Brolly.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brolly</strong>:  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat. Does the Minister agree that teachers who move either  way between North and South should be able to transfer their pension benefits?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I agree that teachers should be able to transfer their pension  benefits. It must be ensured that there is maximum North/South mobility, and it  is in everyone&rsquo;s interest that that happens. That has been on the agenda, and  we are waiting for a report on the obstacles to mobility and how we ensure that  across all sectors &mdash; not only the education sector &mdash; there are no barriers to  teachers moving from North to South or from South to North.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I call Mr Francie &mdash; watch my lips &mdash; Molloy.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat. I thank the Minister for her statement, particularly for  the detail that she provided on the autism centre and the work that has been  done there.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">What process has been put in place to assist teachers to  attain the qualification for teaching Irish in the South of Ireland?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: Go raibh maith agat as an cheist sin. As I said in an answer to  an earlier question, a review of Irish-medium education has been completed, and  an extensive consultation has taken place. The Department will study all the  proposals in detail and will then introduce its final proposals.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I call Mr Tom Elliott.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  Thank you. I am just glad that I am not called Francie Elliott.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister&rsquo;s statement mentioned the seminars for student  teachers to provide information on Irish-language qualification requirements. I  also noted Mr Lunn&rsquo;s half-hearted request for a relaxation of that measure. Is  it not time that the Minister tried to impress on, and strongly lobby, her  Southern counterparts that it is time to abandon that outdated policy and  practice and to develop a policy that is much more reflective of a shared future  and positive co-operation?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I am not sure that I understand the Member&rsquo;s question. Is the  Member suggesting that the practice of speaking Irish be abandoned, or that  children in the South of Ireland should not be entitled to their rights? I  welcome the fact that children in the South of Ireland and, increasingly, in  the North of Ireland who do not go to an Irish-medium primary school can learn  Irish in primary school. As Members know, I put in place an optional primary  languages programme for Irish and Spanish, because children learn languages far  too late in the North.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">12.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the South, thankfully, children learn two different  languages from the moment they enter primary school. It is a pity that children  here do not learn languages earlier. However, I have remedied that to some  degree. The Irish language is the native language of Ireland; it is a beautiful  language. I take seriously my duties under the Good Friday Agreement and  European legislation.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. The Assembly is striving to achieve a  more lively debate at Question Time. Will you bring to the Speaker&rsquo;s attention  the suggestion that we adopt the same rules for questions on a Minister&rsquo;s  statement? After all, they are also questions. To facilitate a more interactive  engagement with the Minister who makes the statement, Members should not read  prepared questions.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I thank the Member for his point of order. I will report it to the  Speaker and he will respond at a later date.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. A particularly good example of what Mr  McCrea referred to occurred during the Minister&rsquo;s reply. I asked a useful  question &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.] </span>Such is the nature of SDLP  Members&rsquo; questions. However, in response to my question, the Minister repeated  part of her report verbatim.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  On a point of order; the Member is supposed to be raising a point of order.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  This is a point of order &mdash; the Minister repeated, verbatim, the second last  paragraph of her statement. Therefore, further to what Mr McCrea has said, I  ask the Speaker to consider whether it is in order for a Minister who is not in  a position to answer a question to concede the point and to provide a written answer  to the Member who asked it. It is not acceptable that, in reply to a question,  a Minister should read out her statement a second time. What is the point of  asking questions if that is the standard of reply?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I thank the Member for his point of order. He has made his point  well, not only in his own opinion, but in the opinion of others. The point will  be brought to the Speaker, who will respond in due course.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Nonetheless, it is a convention of the House that if  several questions are put to the Minister by a Member, the Minister may choose  to answer one, two, all, or only a few of the questions put.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  On a point of order. I thank you for your clarification of that convention, Mr  Deputy Speaker. However, the point is that the reading out, verbatim, of a  statement already before Members is not answering the question. The purpose of  these proceedings is the furnishing of answers to questions.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>:  As previously stated, the Speaker will respond at a later date.</p>

	      <p class="B3BodyText">In June 2008, the Committee on Procedures brought before  the Assembly its &lsquo;Report on Committee Systems and Structures&rsquo;. That report was  approved by the Assembly and included a recommendation on joint Committees. The  Committee has been working on a Standing Order to give effect to the  recommendation and the result is the motion Members have before them. It covers  the current provision in Standing Orders for overlap of Committee business. As  currently written, Standing Orders allow for one way in which Committees may  deal with overlap of business. The amendment to Standing Orders provides for  three ways in which that may be done.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to outline some of the processes used in developing  the motion to amend, which is for approval by the Assembly today.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In accordance with the provisions and principles of the  proposed motion to amend, the Committee held in-depth discussions over a  significant number of meetings. The Committee on Procedures takes its remit  seriously, and it examined each of the three proposed options against a number  of operational and procedural criteria. Those include what permissions, if any,  are required to establish chairing arrangements; arranging meeting rooms;  membership of Committees and proportionality; quorums; and criteria for voting  and decision-making.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">After making initial policy decisions on those and other  matters, the Committee drew up the first draft of the motion to amend, which  was subsequently amended several times as the Committee sought to improve its  clarity and readability. Before tabling the amendment, the Committee also  consulted with &mdash; and took the opinion of &mdash; the Chairpersons&rsquo; Liaison Group, and  it also worked closely with the Speaker and the Business Committee. Therefore,  the Committee has put substantial effort into ensuring that the proposed  amendment is as good as it can be, and for that I thank the Committee for its  time and commitment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The proposed amendment has four parts, and I will explain  each in turn. Proposed new Standing Order 64 is a gateway provision that allows  Committees three options when dealing with matters of joint concern. One  Committee can take the lead &mdash; as per the provision in current Standing Order 64  &mdash; or it can act jointly through one of two new provisions.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Proposed new Standing Order 64 specifically sets out not to  create a hierarchy, but to allow maximum choice. Committees do not have to use  one option above the others, and the options are not mutually exclusive,  meaning that it may be appropriate to begin by using one option and then to  move to another. The whole idea is to allow for maximum choice and the greatest  flexibility, but once a route or option has been chosen, the relevant  Committees must abide by the rules that govern that option.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Proposed new Standing Order 64A is a reworked version of  the current Standing Order 64, which deals with the overlap of Committee  business. It is important to point out that the essential principles and  provisions in the current version will not be altered by the amend&shy;ment.  However, the Committee has made some editorial and grammatical amendments, such  as replacing the words &ldquo;affected committees&rdquo; with &ldquo;relevant committees.&rdquo;  Another editorial change is the replacement of the term &ldquo;A committee taking the  lead&rdquo; with:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The committee to which the matter falls for  disposal&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Those editorial changes address any concerns that one  Committee may have a superior or lead position over another. The Committee on  Procedures has also taken the opportunity to remove some duplicate and surplus  wording and believes that this amendment is clear and, more importantly, can be  read and understood more easily by Members, staff and the public.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The next part of the proposed amendment is proposed new  Standing Order 64B &mdash; &ldquo;Matters of Joint Concern: Committees Sitting  Concurrently&rdquo;. The provisions in that are new and allow two or more Committees  to meet together and operate as one Committee, with the procedures applicable  to Committees also being applicable to the concurrent sittings. The text of the  proposed amendment in proposed new Standing Order 64B(2) gives some examples of  how such procedures would apply, such as producing &ldquo;a single set of minutes&rdquo;.  The list is not definitive and is provided as an example and to help to avoid  confusion. Other procedures and powers such as those that are contained under  section 44(1) of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 and that deal with the powers  for Committees to call for persons and papers also apply, and no permission,  other than the agreement of the relevant Committees, is required to enact that  option.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Provision has been made that the Chairpersons of the  relevant Committees can agree between them that one will act as Chairperson and  the other as Deputy Chairperson, or that they can agree to rotate the post  between them. In making that decision, the Chairpersons are asked to be guided  by &mdash; but not strictly held to &mdash; the provision that it is preferable that the  Chairperson is not of the same party as the Minister. That provision is set out  in Standing Order 48(5), which deals with Statutory Committees, and suggests  that it is preferable but not mandatory that the Chairpersons are not of the  same party as the Minister.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If there is no agreement on who will chair the concurrent  meeting, the matter will be referred to the Business Committee, which will  decide the issue. The Committee on Procedures does not envisage that happening  very often and expects that the Chairpersons will be reasonable on that issue.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Standing Orders on Committees do not allow a Member to  be a Chairperson of two Committees, but that provision has not been enacted for  concurrent meetings. The proposed amendments to Standing Order 64 would not  work were that provision to be enacted.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Standing Order 64B(5) lists a number of provisions. Members  will note that this Standing Order is introduced by the phrase &ldquo;For the  avoidance of doubt&rdquo;. That is stated because those provisions are all self-evident  and arise from the fact that the same procedures will apply to concurrent  meetings as apply to a single Committee meeting. The provisions are included to  emphasise that point and to ensure that there is no doubt about issues such as  the quorum and voting.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that I have explained the proposed Standing Order  64B. It may be useful for Members to recall that, during a survey, a majority  of MLAs indicated that they were very supportive of such a provision. That  support was based on an understanding that concurrent sittings would provide  better scrutiny. An example may help to make things clearer. The Budget process  and the Programme for Government are closely linked and interwoven, yet they  are scrutinised separately by the relevant Committees. The proposed provision  would allow for joint &mdash; and, hopefully, even better &mdash; scrutiny.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Another example could involve a hypothetical Bill on  matters relating to children. Such a Bill might cut across two or more  Committees, which, in the interests of efficiency, may decide to take evidence  together. It is up to the relevant Committees to decide to meet concurrently &mdash;  if they do not want to do so, they cannot be forced.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The final draft amendment, Standing Order 64C, allows for  the establishment of ad hoc joint Committees. It has been included to allow,  specifically, for issues that may cut across three or more Committees. If three  or four &mdash; or even more &mdash; Committees are involved in an issue, they may not find  it physically possible to meet concurrently due to a lack of suitable meeting  space or the unavailability of members. In other cases, it may be considered  more effective to set up an ad hoc joint Committee because the issue may be of  such importance, may need such in-depth consideration or will take a long time  to complete.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">An ad hoc joint Committee would operate in exactly the same  way as an ad hoc Committee that might be established under Standing Order 53,  with the following two exceptions. First, the relevant Committees would have to  agree that an ad hoc Committee is required. The relevant Committees would then  make a request to the Business Committee, which would bring a motion for the  creation of an ad hoc joint Committee to the Assembly for approval.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, ensuring proportionality of membership was very  important for members of the Committee on Procedures, and the proposed  amendment provides for the Business Committee to establish the membership of  the ad hoc joint Committee and ensure its proportionality by drawing on the  membership of the relevant Committees. That will result in the expertise and  knowledge of each Committee being brought to the ad hoc joint Committee.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The ad hoc joint Committee would appoint its own  Chairperson and deputy Chairperson. Otherwise, as I said earlier, the same  rules and procedures as those in Standing Order 53 would apply. As Members are  already familiar with Standing Order 53, I see no reason to go into detail on  it now.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I shall illustrate the provision and principles in draft  Standing Order 64C by the following example. Imagine the possibility of  establishing a national park for Northern Ireland. Such a matter would  fall for scrutiny across many Committees. However, the establishment of an ad  hoc joint Committee would allow for fuller and better scrutiny of the matter  than if it were divided among the different Committees.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I trust that I have outlined the rationale behind the  motion to amend. I look forward to hearing what my colleagues will say in  relation to the matter.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCartney</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Sinn F&eacute;in supports the motion. I  acknowledge the work of the Chairperson in steering the Committee through this  particular piece of work.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I also acknowledge the work of the Committee Clerk and her  staff in taking the Committee through the issue, as outlined by the  Chairperson. We feel that it is an appropriate change to Standing Orders, which  will allow for more efficient and appropriate scrutiny. Rather than have two or  three Committees undertake the same work, it will allow them to work in a joint  fashion. With that in mind, we support the motion. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">1.00 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  also support the motion, and I thank and congratulate the Chairperson of the  Committee for the manner in which he has conducted the discussion of the issue.  Equally, I thank and congratulate the Committee Clerk, who has served the  Committee very well in this matter.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">This is a useful addition to the scrutiny procedures of the  Assembly. Once the measures are put in place, I hope that they will be used,  particularly in the case of joint Committee working. That will prove to serve  the interests of the Assembly well.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  I do not wish to add to what has been said. I thank Members for their support.  I believe that this will be a very useful amendment to our Standing Orders, and  I commend it to the House. I also wish to record my appreciation, as  Chairperson, to the Committee Clerk and to those who have assisted the  Committee.</p>

	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Reducing the Number of &nbsp;Government Departments</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to one hour and 30  minutes for the debate. The proposer of the motion will have 10 minutes to  propose and 10 minutes to make a winding-up speech. All other Members who wish  to speak will have five minutes. One amendment has been selected and published  on the Marshalled List. The proposer of the amendment will have 10 minutes to  propose and five minutes to make a winding-up speech.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly recognises the importance of ensuring that  the maximum amount of public spending is directed at front line services; and  calls on the First Minister and deputy First Minister to bring forward  proposals to reduce the number of Government Departments.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I declare an interest as a member of the Assembly and  Executive Review Committee, which has taken an interest in the subject in the  past.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">This is one of the most important issues that the Assembly  will debate during this term; the ongoing need for efficiencies in government  and a particular need, in this case, for a reduced number of Government  Departments. I do not want to dwell on how we got to where we currently are;  everyone knows that the creation of 10 Departments was a carve up between the  then biggest parties, the UUP and the SDLP, who were basically out to serve  their own interests. The legislation permitted up to 10 Departments to be put in  place, and they took full advantage of that by putting those 10 Departments in  place.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The DUP has consistently supported the reduction of that  number, and now that the roles are reversed and we are the biggest party, we  are consistent in our support for that reduction. That stems partly from the  fact that there is an utterly disproportionate number of Government Departments  in Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We have a population of just over 1&middot;7 million; yet we have  11 Government Departments. Scotland  has a much bigger population &mdash; around 5 million &mdash; and it has reduced its number  of Government Departments from nine to six. I do not think that anyone would  say that Scotland  is not a country that is governed well; in many cases we use it and some of its  procedures as examples of best practice within devolution. We should take  lessons from that. In many ways, I think that the argument is made by making  that point alone.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Another devolved region can do what we do, but with  significantly fewer Government Departments. I think that that makes the case,  and there is almost no need to elaborate further.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There are two principal reasons to look at a reduction in  the number of Government Departments. The first concerns resources, and now is  absolutely the right time to consider that. These are difficult economic times,  and there are pressures on every budget. As many resources as possible must be  released for front line services. Any sane and rational person can see that the  duplication required in order to sustain 11 Government Departments is  unnecessary; only six or seven Departments are necessary. Such a move could  release significant savings for the public purse.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I am supportive, in principle, of what the Member has said, but the Office of  the First Minister and deputy First Minister (OFMDFM) has the responsibility  for this matter. Will that Department reduce its number of junior Ministers?  Will it reduce its number of ministerial advisers? Will it reduce its number of  civil servants? If OFMDFM is going to do all that, when will it start?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  Hopefully, it will start after the Member votes for the motion. Then, OFMDFM  can get stuck into the issues that he raised.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I am voting for the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I am very glad to hear that. I noticed the Member&rsquo;s comments in the &lsquo;Irish  Times&rsquo; this morning, which, in supporting the motion, represented an olive  branch. However, that is contrary to the views of some of his colleagues &mdash; I  will perhaps come to that later.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Releasing precious resources for front line services could  easily be achieved by reducing the number of Government Departments. However,  this is not simply about resources; there is also the important aspect of  creating a more effective system of government in Northern Ireland. In my travels, I  have found widespread support for that from various sectors, and it is an issue  that I come across on a regular basis.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have spoken with members of the community and voluntary  sectors who point to issues such as women&rsquo;s groups having to deal with three or  four different Departments on certain matters. They also point to the  difficulties that community and voluntary groups have faced in respect of  regeneration. That point has been echoed in discussions that I have had with  the Northern Ireland Independent Retail Trade Association, which provided the  example of a group in Belfast, which included traders, that had to work with  seven Government Departments &mdash; and, probably, the council &mdash; to deliver a single  project. That is utterly unacceptable; the cross-checking and auditing that  that requires is just not appropriate in this day and age.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Business Alliance strongly supports the need to reduce  the overall size and structure of the government in Northern Ireland. Perhaps I am  condemning myself, but in &lsquo;The Irish News&rsquo; today, an editorial stated:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;There can be no real doubt that we have many more  MLAs and ministers than can be completely justified in a fairly small  jurisdiction.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Indeed, even the Alliance Party has regularly gone  on record as supporting the reduction of the number of Government Departments.  There is widespread support for that measure politically, and within key areas  such as the business, community and voluntary sectors. The need for a reduction  in Government Departments is echoed repeatedly by those who are experiencing  the bitter reality of having to deal with so many Government Departments; there  is too much support for this motion to be ignored.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have noticed some criticism of the motion, and I am  surprised by some of it. Principally, that criticism has emanated, I am sorry  to say, from the Ulster Unionist Party. Over the weekend, comments that I made  elsewhere managed to raise the ire of Reg Empey. I now know what Denis Healey  meant when he said that he had been savaged by a dead sheep. I do not regard  Reg Empey&rsquo;s opposition as very Conservative; it is, perhaps, more the policy of  a wide boy liberalista.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  For the record, as it may temper the debate, the Ulster Unionist Party will be  supporting the motion. We fully support efforts to streamline government and to  make things more efficient. That has been a manifesto commitment, and we are  happy to support the motion. The Member does not need to go on about not having  our support; he has it.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  Wonders will never cease. I did not realise just how effective the power of my  argument was. I thank the Member for his support.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I notice that some of Mr Basil McCrea&rsquo;s colleagues are not  present. I hope that his message gets back to them. I noted that at the  weekend, his party leader made some disturbing comments that were critical of  the motion. Mind you, it is not the first time that the Member has diverged  from the views of his party leader.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am glad that the Ulster Unionist Party now adheres to  what, I would have thought, were its instinctive principles; not, of course,  those that it demonstrated during the late 1990s, but its instinctive  principles for smaller and more effective government. I welcome that. Indeed, I  recall that the Ulster Unionist Party started the process of the review of  public administration back in 2000. There was much fanfare at its party  conference at that time, which I recall because I was there that day. I was  surprised to hear Councillor Empey say yesterday that, as with most  reorganisations, it will cost millions of pounds and will take at least three  years to settle down. He did not seem to have that view in 2000 when the review  of public administration was proposed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Criticism has also come from the perspective that reduction  of the number of Government Departments will harm inclusiveness somehow and  will be a power grab by the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in. Nothing could be further from  the truth. The motion&rsquo;s objective is to reduce the number of Government  Departments in order to deliver effective and efficient government for Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  people, who have craved that.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I will give way if the Member bears in mind that my time is limited.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I am grateful to the Member for giving way. When Mr Hamilton talks about  reducing the number of Departments, does he accept that that can be effective  only if the number of civil servants is reduced? How many civil servants is he  prepared to make redundant?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I am on record as saying that the public service&rsquo;s objective is to deliver  services; it is not a job-creation agency. The motion&rsquo;s objective is to deliver  better services. I have said from the outset that better services are the  absolute objective. How they are to be achieved is a matter for the review to  determine.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There are notions that reducing the number of Departments  represents a power grab and will be detrimental to inclusiveness. No one is  owed a position. A person must get support from the public in order to get a  position in Government. It is important to bear in mind that inclusiveness may  not be a requisite of any system of government that might exist in the future.  Certain criticism that has emanated from different quarters on that matter shows  that some people are still more interested in accumulating power for themselves  than in the better exercise of that power.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, the motion &mdash; which is backed up, of course, by  the Programme for Government&rsquo;s commitment to review the number of Government  Departments &mdash; is sensible and has sound objectives. I hope that it will gain  widespread support in the Chamber, as it has in the business sector and in the  community and voluntary sector. I urge Members to trot through the Aye Lobby  with me to vote in favour of the motion, which will be well received in the  community.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>: I  beg to move the following amendment: Leave out all after &ldquo;services;&rdquo; and insert</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;notes that the Assembly and Executive Review Committee  (AERC) has unanimously agreed that issues around efficiency and the number of  Government Departments would be part of its programme of work and asks that the  AERC addresses such issues; agrees to establish a new Assembly standing  committee to focus on controlling the cost of government; calls on the First  Minister and deputy First Minister to review and report on the administrative  savings to be achieved from the various measures and proposals associated with  the review of public administration; and to bring forward proposals to the  Executive and the AERC to streamline management and reduce overheads of  Government Departments including options for more shared services and policy  support, reducing tiers of bureaucracy, reconfiguring Departments and reducing  their number.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The amendment retains the premise of Mr Hamilton&rsquo;s motion,  namely:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;That this Assembly recognises the importance of  ensuring that the maximum amount of public spending is directed at front line  services;&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Everyone wants to achieve that. To that end, the  Assembly must constantly control and curb the costs of government in order to  ensure that it does not consume money, resources, and dedicated time and talent  that could be much better deployed on front line services. For that reason, the  SDLP considers Mr Hamilton&rsquo;s motion to be limited in what it asks the Assembly  and the First Minister and the deputy First Minister to do.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The motion simply asks the First Minister and the deputy  First Minister to do something that is already in their power. It is entirely  within the competence of their office to come to the Assembly and to propose a  redistribution of the functions of Departments, including a reduction in their  number. Therefore, an Assembly motion that gives the First Minister and the  deputy First Minister such a power, competence or right is not required. To  simply call them to bring forward their proposals is, perhaps, a criticism of  the First Minister and the deputy First Minister for not having done so  already, given the time that they have been in office.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I want to pick up on the Member&rsquo;s point briefly. Is it not the case that  legislation dictates that the matter is OFMDFM&rsquo;s responsibility and that it  alone should take action? The sooner it starts to do so, the better.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>:  That reinforces my point. That responsibility is among the statutory powers and  functions of the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">1.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">OFMDFM has the power not just to reduce these things but to  make proposals that the Assembly can then determine on a cross-community basis.  There is, therefore, no need for a motion from the Assembly to do that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, the Assembly should not say that the cost of  government is simply a matter for the First Minister and the deputy First  Minister or the Executive. Our amendment seeks to point out that there are  wider and deeper roles, responsibilities and issues concerning the cost of  government than just the number of Departments. Therefore, if we are serious  about dealing with the cost of government, we should be tackling it at all levels  and on all fronts. That is what our amendment does.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The amendment addresses the issues that are the  responsibility of the First Minister and the deputy First Minister and points  out those issues that are the responsibility of the Assembly and the Executive.  It also points out that the Assembly and Executive Review Committee has already  unanimously agreed to look at issues of efficiency, including the possible  reduction in the number of Government Departments. When that Committee has  already signalled that it wants to do that, it is important that we give it the  necessary encouragement to do so, and, at the same time, to encourage the First  Minister and the deputy First Minister to bring their ideas and proposals about  a possible reorganisation of Government Departments to the Executive Committee  and the Assembly and Executive Review Committee.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Our amendment is not saying that there should be no  reduction in the number of Government Departments. Rather, it is asking: what  is the right context in which to explore that issue alongside other issues  concerning the cost of government?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Paisley Jnr</strong>:  Does the Member accept that we are beyond the time of looking at these issues  and that it is time for action? The benefit of our motion is that it allows the  Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister to give impetus to an  ideal to which everyone signed up in the Programme for Government. Let us get  on with delivering that rather than merely doing more talking about it.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>: I  thank the Member for making that point, which seems to suggest that the motion  is a criticism of the First Minister and the deputy First Minister for not  having moved on this issue before now. Although it was in the Programme for  Government, various manifestos and all sorts of other statements, they still  have not moved on the issue. Therefore, when the Member says that it is time  for action rather than merely looking at the issue, I take that to be a  criticism of the First Minister and the deputy First Minister.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly needs to ensure that it is not merely calling  on Ministers to make moves that will, on a one-off basis, hopefully contain  some of the inbuilt costs of government. We, as an Assembly, need to ensure  that we will permanently interrogate and confront the cost of government. That  is why our amendment proposes that the Assembly should have a new Standing  Committee, modelled on the Public Accounts Committee (PAC), which will  permanently interrogate the cost of government and be able to call in and  challenge representatives of various Departments on the amount of money that  they are spending on their own administration and overheads.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is the Assembly&rsquo;s job constantly to scrutinise  Government and to ensure that money is going to front line services and not  being consumed by the system. It would be a dereliction of duty if the Assembly  displayed a lack of interest in the cost of Government, did not use its  scrutiny role and merely questioned Ministers on the matter now and again.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Public Accounts Committee has shown through the good  work that it has done that it can call in Departments in ways that individual  departmental Committees cannot always do. However, although the Public Accounts  Committee does very good work, it tends often to deal with secondary and tertiary  government budget-holders and rarely the Departments themselves. The Public  Accounts Committee rarely challenges Departments in a significant and strategic  way on what they are spending, internally and centrally, on the cost of  government. That is a missing element of the Assembly&rsquo;s scrutiny. Therefore,  our motion calls on the Assembly to address that by agreeing to set up a  permanent Standing Committee to scrutinise the cost of government. We are  serious about carrying out that scrutiny permanently, and not on just a one-off  basis.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Maskey</strong>:  The Member acknowledged the good work of the PAC, but is the scrutiny of  Departments not the job of the scrutiny Committees?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>:  In some ways, it is the job of the scrutiny Committees, but I believe that the  scrutiny Committees cannot do that job adequately. Even though the PAC strays  into other Committees&rsquo; areas of responsibility, its work effectively  complements the scrutiny carried out by departmental Committees. Similarly, an  additional element of scrutiny is needed to tackle the cost of government, such  as Departments&rsquo; central costs, buried administrative costs and overheads and  what Departments spend on themselves.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That new Committee could work well &mdash; as the PAC does &mdash; on  the basis of the intelligence and insights of the Audit Office, and it could  seriously and permanently challenge the cost of government. The Assembly must  take such steps if it wants to make a difference and be permanently vigilant on  those issues.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The debate is not only about the number of Departments. We  must consider the question of the assumed overheads that are built into the  establishment of each Department. Our various Departments &mdash; whether at the  current number or a reduced number &mdash; should not have separate establishments  for policy, financial management and personnel reasons. We need to consider  shared services and shared support across government, or between groups of  Departments, in order to rationalise the system and reduce costs.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, we must examine the savings that the review of  public administration is supposed to achieve. The First Minister and deputy  First Minister have not yet provided, on behalf of the Executive, an updated review  or report on the position of those projected and presumed savings. Many members  of many parties believe that some of the review&rsquo;s changes might not only  increase costs for a period of years but lead to permanently increased costs.  Therefore, we must consider how we expect savings to create part of the context  in which the Assembly and Executive Review Committee, the Executive and the  Assembly will consider wider issues.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Hamilton believes that the number of Departments causes  confusion, because different groups in the economic sector and the community  and voluntary sector say that they have to deal with too many Departments. A  reduction in the number of Departments will not automatically guarantee a  solution. Moreover, when we had fewer Departments, many of those groups dealt  with several Departments or even different divisions in the same Department.  They complained that there was no coherence or consistency between different  divisions and that contradiction and confusion existed. Therefore, although a  reduction in the number of Departments might achieve other gains, it will not  necessarily remove that problem completely. We must revise and address that  issue.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We must ensure that people have a one-stop-shop experience  when applying for Government funding on cross-cutting issues. Rather than  melodeon government into one Department, there is a case for revisiting the  concept of cross-cutting funds, such as the Executive programme fund, through  which people could apply to a central fund rather than busk around several  different Departments. However, the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in abolished that fund and  created the difficulty whereby people have to approach more than one  Department.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Assembly and Executive Review Committee (Mr Spratt)</strong>: The proposer of  the motion and the Member who tabled the amendment both acknowledge that the  Assembly and Executive Review Committee has a locus on this subject. I will  explain the Committee&rsquo;s role. The Committee was established by the Northern Ireland  (St Andrews Agreement) Act 2006, section 11 of which is entitled:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Committee to review functioning of Assembly and  Executive Committee&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Therefore, the clue is in the title.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee has a work programme that lasts until 2015,  by which time it is required to report on the operation of the provisions of  Parts III and IV of the Northern Ireland Act 1998. The St Andrews Agreement Act  states explicitly that the Committee should make its report to the Secretary of  State, the Assembly and the Executive. Part III of the Northern Ireland Act  1998 deals with &ldquo;Executive Authorities&rdquo;. Sections 16 to 30 are relevant, and,  in particular, section 21 deals with &ldquo;Northern Ireland departments&rdquo;.  Therefore, the Assembly and Executive Review Committee undoubtedly has the  power and authority to determine the correct number of Northern Ireland  Departments.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Moreover, the Committee has been active on the issue. In  May 2007, my predecessor, the Rt Hon Jeffrey Donaldson MP, and Raymond  McCartney, who continues to serve as Deputy Chairperson, met the then First  Minister, and the deputy First Minister, to discuss their intention to  establish an efficiency review panel.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Ministers gave a commitment to consult with the  Committee on that matter.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I thank the Member for the helpful explanation. On a point of clarification, is  the Committee in receipt of a letter from the Office of the First Minister and  deputy First Minister seeking to delegate authority to the Committee on this  matter? I thought that that authority rested, in legislation, with OFMDFM, but  I understand that perhaps that office is attempting to delegate the authority  to the Committee of which the Member is Chairperson. Has the Committee received  correspondence?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Assembly and Executive Review Committee</strong>: Any correspondence received  has been placed before the Committee. I was about to say that there have been  subsequent exchanges of correspondence, and the Committee looks forward to  receiving formal proposals, including details of the terms of reference. Should  those proposals emerge, it is only right and proper that the Committee is given  its place, and is fully involved in, and consulted on, the development and  implementation of those proposals.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I assure the House that the Assembly and Executive Review  Committee takes its responsibilities very seriously indeed, and I &mdash; and, I  imagine, the other members of the Committee &mdash; will be paying close attention  throughout this debate, and will have due regard to what Members, from all  sides of the Assembly, have to say on the matter.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I wish to make it clear from the  outset that Sinn F&eacute;in Members will abstain from the vote on both the motion and  the amendment. The reason for that is that a review that seeks to reduce the  number of Departments predetermines the outcome. My party is not opposed to a  review, or, indeed, the result of any such review, be it a call to reduce, or  to maintain, the current number of Departments. However, that process must be gone  through. Jimmy Spratt has outlined the authority with which the Assembly and  Executive Review Committee will consider the matter at some stage soon.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The issue at hand does not just concern the way the  Government look and operate. That is relevant, but it is also concerned with  fairness &mdash; as Members have mentioned &mdash; with making sure that we get things  right, and with value for money. I am sure that most people will argue that we  need to protect front line services, but that should not be done at the cost of  everything else. Bringing forward a proposal to reduce the number of  Departments, which considers only front line services, is premature.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is a need to take account of a number of issues in  relation to the economy, some of which were raised by Mitchel McLaughlin last  week on the BBC&rsquo;s &lsquo;Hearts and Minds&rsquo; programme. This is a very small country &mdash;  one island. We need to consider matters from an all-island perspective. Peter Weir is laughing &mdash; I am sure that he is not  surprised that I mentioned that. We must consider an all-island approach to  health, energy, the economy, and so on, as a way of achieving good government.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As a former party spokesperson on health, I was sad to hear  of families, both North and South of the border, who could not find a hospital  bed for a child &mdash; the child had to be put on a plane and sent to England. It  does not make sense for a country of this size to operate two massive health  budgets. Despite that, there is still a big gap in need.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Equally, we must consider the provision of energy on an  all-island basis.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Will the Member provide some clarification on that point? Surely the level of  public service is much higher in Northern Ireland  in comparison with the Republic   of Ireland. Will the  Member not join with others in the House in seeking to reduce the number of  junior Ministers, of ministerial aides, and, if necessary, the number of civil  servants that are not utilised properly? Surely we must find ways of using  resources that are more in line with other parts of this island.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  I thank the Member for providing me with an extra minute. I take it that a part  of his argument is that there would also be a reduction in the number of MLAs &mdash;  sometimes that does seem a tempting prospect.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">1.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A review is needed to consider how we do business better,  but a review with a predetermined outcome is certainly not needed. Members will  expect me to talk about an all-island approach to health, the economy, energy  and much more besides.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It was mentioned that the Good Friday Agreement and St  Andrews Agreement contain an agreement to review and examine efficiencies and  value for money. Mention is made of the ability to scrutinise the functions of  Departments. My understanding is that that meant that the review would consider  the ability to scrutinise structures. However, if a review is to take place,  everything must be considered.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We also need to consider that the review of public  administration (RPA) is an ongoing programme of work, as is the work that will  come through the Assembly and Executive Review Committee. I accept the points  that Mark Durkan made in relation to  the ability of Committee members to scrutinise. As a Committee member trying to  scrutinise a budget, I have found it very difficult. Anything that will enhance  my ability to scrutinise a Minister and a Department is to be welcomed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to talk about the way that we do business. I think  that Simon Hamilton raised the issue  of communities having access to different Departments, which is very true. We  debated a White Paper about the relationship between Government and the  community and voluntary sector. That also needs to be factored in.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am aware that my time is up. At this stage, it is  premature to agree to reduce the number of Departments and their functions  without having a review first. We will, therefore, abstain from voting on the  motion and the amendment. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I preface my remarks by saying that I and my party are strong supporters of  more efficient and cost-effective government. However, today&rsquo;s motion makes two  propositions that are not necessarily linked. One calls for public spending on  front line services to be maximised, and the other calls for a reduction in the  number of Government Departments.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It would be perfectly possible to have fewer, and bigger,  Departments and still employ the same number of civil servants to deliver  services. The only real reduction in numbers would be among the comparatively  few senior staff at the top of each Department. The actual monetary savings  that would be achieved by reducing the number of Departments might be quite  small when considered as part of the overall expenditure of Government.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The majority of civil servants who provide the services of  the Departments would still have to continue to provide those services &mdash;  unless, of course, the services were cut. I presume that the proposers of the  motion do not advocate that services should be cut and large numbers of civil  servants sacked, because the motion states that the maximum amount of spending  should be directed at front line services.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  The number of permanent secretaries is commensurate with the number of  Departments. At present, the salaries of those individuals amount to something  like &pound;1&middot;3 million. Reducing the number of Departments to six or seven could  save &pound;500,000 in that respect. That is not a massive amount of money, but it is  not insubstantial either. I am sure that plenty of Ministers in the Executive  would happily take that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Does the Member recall that, when his party was in the  predominant position in the Assembly, questions were asked about the cost of  the Departments? At that time, it cost approximately &pound;19 million to run a  Department. Reducing the number of Departments by three, four or five would realise  substantial savings for the Northern    Ireland block grant.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I am grateful to the Member for his intervention. In financial terms, the case  is not yet proved on the amount of real savings that would be made. Would we  simply be reducing the number of Departments, or would we ultimately be  reducing the number of jobs and the number of people who hold those posts? That  debate is needed.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Does the Member accept that there are already targets for increased efficiency  in Departments &mdash; a 3% real-terms reduction, and a 5% reduction in  administration costs &mdash; and that many of the savings that Members have mentioned  are already planned?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I accept the Member&rsquo;s point, which was well made. That must be taken into  consideration as we examine these matters.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is an apparent contradiction that demonstrates the  woolly thinking behind the motion. Some people might consider the motion as  simply a headline grabber, or an example of grandstanding by the party that  proposed it, because tomorrow the Assembly will debate the early stage of  creating a policing and justice Department. It seems a bit rich for Members to  talk of saving money today, when tomorrow we will begin a process that will  create more costs.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  No. I am sorry, but I have given way at least twice. The motion is superficial  in respect of how it treats a complex subject that directly impacts on many  thousands of civil servants&rsquo; jobs. The matter deserves mature and intelligent  discussion.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In itself, reducing the number of Departments would not  downsize government bureaucracy by an appreciable degree. There would be  several fewer permanent secretaries, but that is where the savings would end.  The problem with the size of government bureaucracy is more complex and,  therefore, it requires a more thoughtful analysis than simply cutting the  number of Departments.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Unfortunately, Northern Ireland, in common with most  political units, suffers from a lack of economies of scale, and a great deal of  Departments&rsquo; work is concerned with supplying services to the public in areas  such as health, social services, education, or roads; in providing support for  farmers; or in managing the skilling of the working population. Those are all  public services, and, in a modern country, the public expect them to be  provided. In our case, they must be provided for a population of 1&middot;7 million  people.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although the Scottish Parliament has only seven  Departments, and the Welsh Assembly, which, like Northern Ireland&rsquo;s, is run on  a small scale, has 10, the key question that must be answered is: how effective  have the departmental structures been in delivering services?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">For those reasons, and having clearly outlined its  reservations, the Ulster Unionist Party will support the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  support the motion. As Members know, the Alliance Party has a wide agenda for  reforming the institutions and the system of government in Northern Ireland,  whether that be the system of designations in the voting system, moving from a  mandatory to a voluntary coalition, or making better use of North/South  institutions in order to deliver tangible benefits for the people of Northern  Ireland. The size and the nature of government in Northern Ireland is included  in those considerations, and it goes without saying that the matter of the  number of Departments must be considered as a critical part of that agenda for  change.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The DUP motion sends a clear message of intent in that  regard, and there is merit in the Assembly signing up to it. The SDLP amendment  is worthy; however, the suggestions in it could be met within the Assembly&rsquo;s  existing structures. Indeed, elements of the amendment may be  counterproductive, because they might trample upon existing authorities and cut  across the roles of Committees, so we must be wary.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Without doubt, reducing the number of Departments would  produce a degree of financial saving, and no one could argue with that.  However, at times, the scale of that saving is overstated, and the savings that  the DUP envisages would not, as many people wish, release enough money to  rebalance public services and modernise the economy. Nevertheless, it is worth  making a start.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Alliance Party believes that the real prize from  reviewing the number of Departments lies in being able to deliver more  effective joined-up government.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The lines that divide our Departments are arbitrary. The  Department for Employment and Learning (DEL), for instance, is responsible for  the needs of the unemployed, but the Department for Social Development (DSD)  looks after a large part of the benefit system. Likewise, both the Department  of Education and the Department for Employment and Learning have  responsibilities for functions within education.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A number of Departments have roles relating to the economy.  The Department of Enterprise,  Trade and Investment (DETI) plays quite a small role in that area: it has  responsibility for tourism, and, in that regard, interfaces with the Department  of Culture, Arts and Leisure (DCAL).</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The most acute example of the failure to deliver joined-up  government relates to planning. At the macro level, the Department for Regional  Development (DRD) is responsible for strategic planning and the Department of  the Environment (DOE) for the implementation of planning. DOE has the lead in  the consideration of individual planning applications, and, alongside that  Department, Roads Service and Northern Ireland Water, under the remit of DRD,  play a consultative role. Those overlaps create obstacles. The Department for  Social Development comes into the picture for matters relating to urban  regeneration. Therefore, three Departments have a role to play in planning.  That is baffling for individuals in Northern Ireland &mdash; and even more so  for businesses that are trying to deliver results.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly has set out a strong, rhetorical message of  the need to reform the public sector and to make it more user-friendly. We are  seeing some progress in that regard, but more is required. A review of the  nature and number of our Departments is key to that, and it is important that  the Government are able to provide a robust response to that message &mdash;  particularly in view of the economic downturn. In that global context, the role  of the Northern Ireland Administration is limited, but the speed and responsiveness  of the Government to those in society who are trying to create wealth and  provide jobs can make a difference. That is why we need to look at our  Government.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly and Executive Review Committee plays an  important role. The Alliance Party is not represented on that Committee, but we  recognise and respect its function. The past year has seen the establishment of  the performance and efficiency delivery unit, which is within the remit of the  Department of Finance and Personnel (DFP). It has an important role in cutting  across government to try to find and drive efficiencies. The Department of  Finance and Personnel plays an important central role with regard to  departmental budgets. Its Committee, on which I sit, could play an expanded  role in looking at such issues as shared services and the delivery of more  efficient outcomes across Departments.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly has a broad agenda, but it is important that  it sends out a strong message: let us get working on the number and nature of  our Departments.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Maskey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. The debating of the motion is akin  to putting the cart before the horse in some respects. As Car&aacute;l N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n  said, a number of questions have to be answered before we can support the  motion or the amendment. For instance, Members must ask themselves whether all  the Departments are fit for purpose and whether they are delivering value for  money. Are they delivering what they set out to deliver? Have the citizens of  the North got confidence in the number of Departments and the services that  they are providing for the people? Those questions need to be answered.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The number of Departments and the structure of our  Government were established under the Good Friday Agreement. The Good Friday  Agreement and the St Andrews Agreement provided ways and mechanisms of ensuring  an efficient Government, and that included the number of Government  Departments, among other things. It is important, therefore, to state that the  Good Friday Agreement caters for a review of the arrangements in relation to  efficiency and to equality, which are at the core of what we have done.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The number of Departments was set out and endorsed by all  parties in the first Assembly.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">1.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  appreciate that the Member is keen to defend the Good Friday Agreement where  possible. However, does he accept that the agreement referred to, and  permitted, a maximum number of Departments but did not specify that there  should be 10?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Maskey</strong>:  That is exactly right, and other parties were in the ascendancy at the time of  the Good Friday Agreement. All parties in the Chamber agreed that there should  be 10 Departments. That number was so high because many people, particularly in  the community that I represent, did not think that any Government could work  for them. However, Sinn F&eacute;in never says never when it comes to considering the  number of Departments, particularly from the perspective of making  efficiencies.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As Car&aacute;l pointed out, however, front line services should  not be diminished. That is already happening, and every citizen of the North  wants those services to be maintained. Even considering cutting front line  services has a knock-on effect on every individual, and that is wrong.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I listened to Mark  Durkan talk about the role of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) as he moved  the amendment to the motion. The PAC and the Audit Office will continue to  produce good reports. The PAC determines how much money has been misspent or  what mistakes Departments have made. The Committee has done much good work and  will continue to do so. It brings the Departments to book and ensures that they  deliver effective services for everyone.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mark has left  the Chamber, but I must make a point about his amendment, which calls on the  Assembly:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;to establish a new Assembly standing committee to  focus on controlling the cost of government&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I asked Mr Durkan for a point of information  because the role of the existing Standing Committees is to scrutinise the  Departments. Is Mark Durkan telling  the House that the role of the Committees has diminished and that they cannot  do their job, or is he saying that he has failed in his job as Chairperson of  one of the Committees? We, as MLAs who were elected to represent every citizen,  must ensure that we continue scrutinising the Departments to make certain that  they deliver front line services, provide value for money and are fit for  purpose.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The remit panels will examine that issue, and, therefore,  Sinn F&eacute;in supports neither the motion nor the amendment. We cannot do so until  we study the outworkings of the RPA, because it provides accountability. The  review is still being implemented, and local councils are still working through  how it will affect them and their systems. It is important to ensure that all  levels of government, including local government, deliver for all of us. Go  raibh m&iacute;le maith agat</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: It  is no great surprise that I support the motion. It is important for the  Assembly to get back to basics. The Assembly&rsquo;s role is not simply to provide  additional structures for the convenience of MLAs, but to ensure the front line  delivery of services to the public. As such, we should root out unnecessary  layers and levels of bureaucracy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I share Simon  Hamilton&rsquo;s disappointment at some of the remarks made by leading members of the  Ulster Unionist Party at the weekend, although I was heartened by the words of  Basil McCrea. The almost schizophrenic attitude of the Ulster Unionist Party is  interesting; indeed it ranges from a denial that it was in any way &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I am grateful to the Member for giving way. His reference to schizophrenia is  particularly relevant.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I ask the Minister &mdash; sorry, I ask the overlooked Member who  may yet become a Minister &mdash; whether he, as one of the proposers of the motion,  is not surprised that no response is forthcoming from OFMDFM because of the  lack of agreement therein? Would it not have been better to seek such agreement  before tabling the motion?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  thank the Member for the promotion that he tried to thrust on me. With respect  to the Member, it is clear that the motion is directed to the Assembly as a  whole. Some of the criticism that has been made of OFMDFM was simply unilateral  action being taken by OFMDFM. I suspect that the Member &mdash; and the SDLP &mdash; will  be howling with outrage at the prospect of that being imposed on them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The attitude of the Ulster Unionist Party is schizophrenic;  that party has gone from a denial that it was in any way opposed to this to the  enthusiastic support of Mr McCrea, which I welcome. It is in sharp contrast to  his party leader&rsquo;s headline of:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;DUP under fire for proposal to cut departments&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Mr Kennedy has managed to find a middle way between  those two positions: a degree of reluctant support. A fourth position on the  number of Departments was revealed at the weekend, when one of the Ulster  Unionist Party&rsquo;s Back Bench Members said that there should be a minister for  tourism. That would involve the creation of an additional Department.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Given the attitudes of the Ulster Unionist Party and the  SDLP &mdash; and I pay tribute to Mr McCrea, whose fingerprints are clean on the  issue &mdash; it is not surprising that they are ambivalent on the issue, as they are  the Frankenstein that has created the monster. Prior to the Assembly&rsquo;s  existence &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  Frankenstein was the monster.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: No,  actually &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am sorry if that is beyond the Member&rsquo;s literary  knowledge. He will find that Frankenstein was the creator of the monster. The  monster was something separate. Indeed, if the Member checks with Mary Shelley  and the original &lsquo;Prometheus Unbound&rsquo;, he will find that Frankenstein was,  indeed, the monster.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have no doubt that the move from six Ministries  pre-devolution to the current 11 was the result of a late-night political  carve-up at the end of 1998. To be fair, if there is some degree of retreat  from that position to an acceptance that there should be a reduction in the  number of Departments, then that &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: No;  my time is short, and I have already taken one intervention.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The issue of policing and justice &mdash; which we will return to  tomorrow &mdash; is not to do with the creation of a new function; it is about the  transfer of what is effectively a Department within the Northern Ireland  Office. We will not be adding to the bureaucracy &mdash; and it will be an initial  position anyway, as the legislation restricts the number of Departments. On  that basis, therefore, there would have to be a reduction of at least one in  the number of Departments.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Much has been made about the economic advantages of  delivering front line services. I want to pick up on Mr Farry&rsquo;s eloquent point  about the effectiveness of Government. I cannot think of any other jurisdiction  on these islands where higher education is hived off from the rest of education;  where employment and training issues seem to be divorced from enterprise and  industry; where tourism seems to fall into different categories; and where the  strategy for planning across Northern Ireland lies with the Department for  Regional Development, yet area plans lie with the Department of the  Environment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As another example, planning policy statement (PPS) 14 was  inflicted on us under direct rule, and it dealt with rural planning. Planning  is largely dealt with by the DOE and rural policy is largely dealt with by the  Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (DARD), yet, until the court  ruling, PPS 14 was being dealt with by the Department for Regional Development.  A mess has been created, and if we can at least take a step back and ensure  that we get the matter sorted out by moving towards a reduction in the number  of Departments &mdash; as has happened in Scotland &mdash; we will ensure that the burden  is shifted away from administration and bureaucracy to front line services,  which is something that all Members should unite behind. I support the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Any reference to Frankenstein&rsquo;s monster and the next Member to  speak is purely coincidental. I call Mr Basil McCrea. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Mr Deputy Speaker, I am sure that I am entitled to an extra minute for the  mirth and merriment that you have brought to the Chamber. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I hear from stage left an intervention from Ian Paisley  Jnr. One of the earliest and most entertaining parts of my political career was  hearing the SDLP mug Ian Paisley Jnr with a statement about how useless junior  Ministers were. The SDLP then revealed that that statement had been made by Ian  Paisley Jnr about a previous junior Minister, and not himself. It is  interesting. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span> Yes, it was rather  entertaining.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It all returns to the issue that the leader of the Ulster  Unionist Party, Sir Reg Empey, raised: just because Departments are amalgamated  does not mean that they are any more efficient or that savings are made. He  eloquently referred to the old DOE &mdash; the Department of everything. If every  function is put in one place, the result is a lack of focus, inefficiency and a  failure to deliver. Therefore, it is important that we get the matter right.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If we are looking for ways in which to remove duplication,  I can think of one obvious place that could benefit from some cost-cutting &mdash;  the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister. Why do we need two  First Ministers and two junior Ministers? Why do we need a plethora of  &ldquo;minreps&rdquo;? We did not need them before. Those people have the authority to make  cuts; they have the responsibility &mdash; not to mention the moral responsibility &mdash;  for making cuts. I look forward to seeing immediate activity in that area.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Some discussion has taken place on why we ended up with 10  Ministers during the debate. The proposer of the motion said that he was not  going to talk about that matter but then proceeded to do so. The issue at the  time was about trying to ensure some form of inclusivity and a four-party  mandatory coalition. However, it is now fairly obvious that there is no  four-party mandatory coalition &mdash; there is a two-party voluntary coalition. If  we are talking about political carve-ups, they have been between the DUP and  Sinn F&eacute;in.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am somewhat surprised by the timing of the debate,  although perhaps I should not be. Could it be, as Mr Kennedy suggested, that  this debate is taking place today because tomorrow we will discuss a report on  the devolution of policing and justice matters, which will lead to an increase  in costs and in the number of Ministers? Is today&rsquo;s debate a form of shadow  boxing that is designed to distract us from the blame game? If Members are  serious about reducing the cost of government, the Ulster Unionist Party and I  are four-square behind them.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  Can the Member explain how having an additional Department to administer on  policing and justice matters will cost more money? The Northern Ireland Office  currently exercises justice functions, and the people of Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK pay their  taxes to support those functions, as they do every other function. The money  for justice will simply be transferred to the Assembly. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span> Where is the additional expense in our having a Department of justice?  Responsibility will merely switch from the Northern Ireland Office to the  Northern Ireland Civil Service.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  That is one of the best nomination speeches that I have heard in a long time.  Dr Farry will run the justice Ministry without any money. If he were on the  Policing Board, he would understand that certain challenges are involved and  that no reorganisation ever comes cheap.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, the real issue is one of respect. If the real  purpose behind having 10 ministerial colleagues around the one table is to  enable them to have shared discussions for the benefit of Northern Ireland &mdash;  something that should be done in these particularly trying circumstances &mdash;those  people should be treated with respect and be included. If that is not the case,  and it appears that no respect or manners are being shown and no consultation  is being undertaken, there is no point in carrying on with a sham. We should  just reduce the number of ministerial posts and let those two parties fight it  out among themselves. We can then have a proper election and get people into  this Chamber who actually want to run the country.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr McDonnell</strong>:  I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate. I declare at the outset  that my party and I are all in favour of cost-effective service delivery by  Government. It is essential that there be such delivery. However, I am not  convinced that it will save us much money if we chop a Department or two, get  rid of a Minister or two and bolt the remains, with all the associated  expenses, on to another Department.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">2.00 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A Member stated earlier that more money might be saved,  through various means, in the Office of the First and deputy First Minister.  Certainly, the number of special advisers there is scandalous. However, before  the motion is taken seriously, we need to know how much would be saved. To my  mind, that amount would be relatively small and insignificant compared with the  amount of waste that exists in various Departments.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Many people regard the motion as little more than a DUP  manoeuvre towards effective DUP-majority rule and towards what the previous  Member to speak referred to as the removal of respect.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr McDonnell</strong>:  I will give way in a moment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">This system of governance was set up in order to accord  respect to the mandate of every Member in the Chamber, and it has a little bit  to run to achieve that. My party and I were keen that, in a previous  disposition, at a time when the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in may not have been in their  current positions of strength, the mandates of their Members were accorded full  and total respect.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>:  Will the Member concede that even when the Democratic Unionist Party was not  the largest party, it had a policy to reduce the number of Departments?  Therefore, to make the accusation that the motion is about a DUP carve-up  ignores the fact that the party has held that position for the past 10 years.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr McDonnell</strong>:  I thank the Member for his comment. I am not so much reflecting the past 10 years  as some elements of the review of public administration. That involves a  definite and clear-cut carve-up, sometimes driven by the DUP on its own, and  sometimes driven by the DUP in co-operation with Sinn F&eacute;in. Despite those  parties&rsquo; differences, they can collude when necessary to serve each other.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Parties in this and in previous mandates set out some years  ago to be inclusive and to create honest and honourable involvement for all  those who are prepared bring their mandate here and to put it to work. That is  essential, and to undermine that without adopting a comprehensive and  integrated approach renders the motion gimmicky and a bit of a fig leaf. The  motion avoids the real issues of making cost savings.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Other Members mentioned tomorrow&rsquo;s debate on policing and  justice. I ask myself what the implications will be for justice if the motion  is passed and implemented. Will the justice Ministry be just another junior job  bolted on to the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister? That  is one of the implications that can be extrapolated from the motion. What are  the implications for the scrutiny role of Committees? Will it mean that the  Assembly will want to get rid of some of its Committees in order to reduce  scrutiny?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I repeat: I believe that changes are desirable.  Cost-effectiveness is desirable. Members must continually consider how business  is done. The necessity for change and cost-effectiveness is always with us, but  I do not believe that the motion is the way to achieve that. The way to do it  is to, as far as possible, create a consensus by working up through the  Committees in a manner to which everyone can adhere.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">For me, the main effort is still in creating access.  Devolution is a relatively tender infant here, and we have a little way more to  go with it. The great thing about devolution is that it created access for the  public that never existed under direct rule. That inclusion and that access  remain important in the short term.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The motion is riddled with contradictions. I am concerned seriously  about how the review of public administration is proceeding. We were told that  it would cut bureaucracy and ensure that savings were directed to the front  line &mdash; language similar to that was used. Direct rule Ministers said that  savings of up to &pound;200 million a year could be achieved through the review of  public administration.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It would be timely for the Office of the First Minister and  deputy First Minister to report on the projected savings from the review of  public administration, because it is very easy to stand here and pull a rabbit  out of a hat by suggesting that a bag of money could be saved.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Will the Member bring his remarks to a close?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr McDonnell</strong>:  The savings that will be made by reducing the number of Departments must be  costed, and there are all sorts of wider implications.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Thank you for not making any references to Frankenstein, Mr Deputy Speaker. I  apologise for being absent from the Chamber for part of the debate.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A Government must be run efficiently and money must be  directed to front line services &mdash; no one can argue against that. However, as  with every operation, front line services must be managed efficiently and  properly. We expect that from all our Government Departments and Government  Ministers. The difficulty that I have with the motion is that it reaches a  conclusion, instead of seeking the establishment of a review or following  through on commitments that were made in the Good Friday Agreement, the  Programme for Government or the St Andrews Agreement, in which political  parties were tasked with examining the issue.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We must examine the issue from a fresh point of view,  instead of starting a review and saying that it will reduce the number of  Departments, which will make our government more efficient. I listened to the  debate, and everyone has different views on how much money will be saved by  reducing the number of Departments. The wages of a Minister, a permanent  secretary and a few other staff will be saved, but how much will be saved after  that, and, after that money has filtered back through government, would it be  worthwhile?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The important issue is the reason that we have our current  system. Our society was emerging from conflict, and we had to restore  confidence in the political system. That is why there are 10 Departments and  why the major political parties were each given a role in Government. Everyone  was given a stake in the Executive and given the opportunity to be part of the  decision-making process so that no one could feel excluded. No review of the  mechanisms that were established by the Good Friday Agreement can be conducted  without examining that. A review cannot just be concerned with efficiency &mdash; it  must be about respecting the rights of everyone involved in this project. The Ulster  Unionist Party and the SDLP expressed concern that the motion is part of a  hidden agenda to exclude them from government. Therefore, any review process  must ensure that the views of those parties, and those of the other major  parties, are listened to and acted upon.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although most of the content in the SDLP amendment is fair  enough, it also pre-empts the outcome of a review before it has even started.  The amendment refers to:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;reconfiguring Departments and reducing their number.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That is why we cannot support the amendment and  will abstain when it is put to the House.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The other line in the amendment that concerns me is:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;establish a new Assembly standing committee to focus  on controlling the cost of government.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">It is the role of the statutory Committees to  monitor and examine the budgets and roles of their respective Departments to  ensure that they are being run efficiently. Why establish another Committee to  examine the roles of Departments when there are already Committees to do that  job? That proposal is not worthwhile. Establishing a Committee every time there  is a problem will not resolve anything.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My party has no difficulty in entering a review that  examines the number of Departments in the Executive, and we have no difficulty  in examining efficiency savings, either in Departments or across the Executive.  However, we want to ensure that the core elements in any review are, as Members  mentioned, respect and a better exercise of power. Any review must also  recognise that our Executive were established at a time when our society was  emerging from conflict. We must ensure that the stakeholders in the Assembly  and our society have a place in the future of government here.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Based on those principles, we will enter into any review,  and we will not state its outcome beforehand. We will enter into it, and we  will let it bring back evidence that the Assembly and the Executive will take  heed of and vote on.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>:  Today&rsquo;s debate is important. As I mentioned during Dr McDonnell&rsquo;s speech, the  reduction in Departments has been a long-term policy of the Democratic Unionist  Party, and, for many years, our party&rsquo;s was the lone voice calling for it. It  has been one of our party&rsquo;s manifesto pledges, so it is encouraging that, in  recent years, other parties have come on board with our line of thinking.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the support for the motion, albeit tentative in  some quarters. However, it is disappointing that Sinn F&eacute;in is taking a neutral  stance on the issue. Perhaps it would have been more beneficial had that party  tabled an amendment to the motion, rather than abstaining from the vote.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Kennedy said that there cannot be any agreement on the  matter, but the Programme for Government contains a commitment that the  Executive will review the number of Departments by 2011. My colleague Mr Spratt  also mentioned the Assembly and Executive Review Committee&rsquo;s role in the  matter.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In addressing the motion, it is important that we remember  where we came from. There were six Departments during the direct rule years,  but, as many Members said, in December 1998, the pro-Agreement parties agreed  to the establishment of the Office of the First Minister and deputy First  Minister and to the increase in the number of Departments to 10, as well as  agreeing to the staff who come with them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Notably, the reason for almost doubling the number of  Departments was not to ensure efficient delivery for the people of Northern  Ireland, but rather, as Paul Maskey and Mr O&rsquo;Dowd conceded, to ensure that all  the pro-Agreement parties would be rewarded by gaining ministerial office and  to ensure that from the outset of devolution, Sinn F&eacute;in had a position at the  Executive table. Those political considerations also explain the reason for the  inflated number of Assembly Members, which was to ensure that the small  pro-Agreement parties, such as the Women&rsquo;s Coalition, the PUP and the Alliance  Party, would all be represented in the Chamber.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although the House cannot introduce legislation to  streamline the number of Assembly Members, it has the ability to reduce the number  of Departments. Indeed, it has been mentioned that the Scottish Government &mdash; as  it is now known &mdash; did likewise.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As a member of the Committee for the Environment, I have  been involved in the review of public adminis&shy;tration, which a Member for North Belfast mentioned, through which the number of  local councils is being reduced from 26 to 11. The main focus and thrust behind  that move is to increase efficiency and delivery and to reduce the amount of  waste in local councils. Given that we have decided that local government needs  to be slimmed down, it would naturally follow that we would get our house in  order by following the same logic. Some powers are being transferred from  Departments here to local government, and although there will not be a new Department,  we aspire to the devolution of policing and justice powers to the Assembly at  some time in the future. Perhaps there is never a better time for us to begin  the process of reorganising Departments, given that there is a maximum number  of Departments that we can legally have.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As we heard earlier, representatives in the business sector  made a similar call for a reduction in the number of Departments. At this  difficult economic time, they are calling for a single Department to deal with  the economy &mdash; a Department for economic development, perhaps &mdash; that would take  in parts of DETI, DEL and other areas. It is important that we  listen to the experts and decide what would make it easier for them to assist  economic growth, particularly during this difficult economic time.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The call for the creation of such a Department is not being  made just for financial reasons. One of the first motions that I tabled in the  Assembly related to numeracy and literacy, and although it was a motion that  concerned the Department of Education, it was equally important to young people  over the age of 18. When I was a member of the Committee for Employment and  Learning, we were continually being told about the huge numbers of  school-leavers who lacked the basic reading and writing skills that are  required to get on in life. We were also being told about the challenges that  faced further education colleges and employers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Minister Empey spoke about school-leavers having those  skills, and Minister Ruane talked about lifelong learning opportunities. That  is perhaps one of the clearest examples of where we do not need two separate  Departments. Again, if we look at examples in Scotland, particularly in  education, it has a Department for Education and Lifelong Learning.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I concur with the Member&rsquo;s comments about education. Who would the Member like  to see in that role? Would it be Reg Empey, in which case we could perhaps get  a response to issues that are important to us all?</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">2.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: I  thank the Member for his intervention; most of us would not care who the  Minister was, as long as it was not the one we have now. Education is a clear  example of where it would be desirable to have one single Department. Earlier  on, we heard how planning is split across DRD, DOE and even DSD, when it comes  to urban renewal; we should look at those examples.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is not just about making sense of which Department does  what; it is about making economic sense. We have heard before that the money  that we could save on bureaucracy and staff costs could be put into direct  services. The people whom I represent want resources to be put into hospitals,  schools and roads rather than additional and unnecessary Departments.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The motion is very good. It is very positive, and I support  it.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  Some common themes arose across all the contributions to the debate. No one had  any argument with more efficient and effective government. My colleague Mark Durkan made it very clear that powers existed  in OFMDFM. He questioned whether the motion was a criticism of that Department,  given that it had those powers and that although it had signalled its intent to  establish an efficiency panel, it had yet to do so. In the same way, many  decisions went unmade for several months, well before the logjam that was  created by the impasse between Sinn F&eacute;in and the DUP.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The public, and others, should be in no doubt as to the  SDLP&rsquo;s intent. Front line services should be protected and enhanced, and our  amendment sets down proposals for the way in which services could be shared across  all Departments, resulting in much better performance. Given that some  Ministers and Departments are already experiencing difficulty in the  performance of their current responsibilities and duties, one wonders how they  would cope with further responsibilities.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Much has been said about the fact that there were six  Departments under direct rule. Is anyone here going to say that direct rule was  good for the people of Northern    Ireland?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  Does the Member accept that under direct rule, local councils had more powers  than they do under the current Administration? It will not help councils to be  told that they will be asked to take responsibility for cutting grass and  emptying drains away from DRD.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I accept Mr Elliott&rsquo;s point entirely. He is quite right; there has been a power  grab to the centre, and particularly to the Office of the First Minister and  deputy First Minister.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Other Members remarked that in a previous life, there were  those who objected most forcefully to the creation of junior Minister posts.  However, once they were in position, they then created their own special  adviser posts. We only have to look at the debacle that occurred this time last  year, when the victims&rsquo; commissioners were appointed. Mr Hamilton&rsquo;s contention  that &pound;500,000 could be saved by reducing the number of permanent secretaries  rings hollow when it was his party, along with Sinn F&eacute;in, that appointed four  victims&rsquo; commissioners, which cost an extra &pound;250,000.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The motion ignores, as have certain newspaper editorials  and other interests, such as the Business Alliance, the fact that the reason  that the Good Friday Agreement set out a plan for an inclusive government was  because our society was coming out of 40 years of conflict after having suffered  many years of discriminatory practices and abuses of power by Stormont.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I am at a loss to understand the point that the Member has made. Despite the  criticisms that have been levelled at business groups, it is their experience,  day in, day out, that the number of Departments that we have cannot effectively  deliver what they want, or what they believe is best for Northern Ireland.  Are the Member and her party now taking a potshot at business and the community  and voluntary sector? Is she saying that they do not know what they are talking  about?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I do not accept that at all; that was not my point. My point is that we already  have Ministers who are not performing correctly.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>:  Does the Member accept that those business organisations &mdash; representatives of  which some Members have met &mdash; have confirmed that they are concerned about  savings being made from the proposed reduction in the number of Departments and  about savings being made from the sorts of measures proposed in our amendment?  Therefore, it is not simply about one issue.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I accept Mr Durkan&rsquo;s point. Is it not also the case that this is a Sinn F&eacute;in  and DUP smokescreen to hide their failure to meet and to lead during the  economic crisis of the past four or five months? The logjam caused by their  failure to meet was the impetus for the urgent Executive meetings that were  held weekly thereafter. Those meetings have now stopped. This debate is really  no more than smoke and mirrors.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The First Minister, in his new year message, said:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;After St Andrews the  North South Ministerial Council may be politically benign, but is it really the  most effective use of our time and resources?&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP reiterates today that the North/South Ministerial  Council is non-negotiable. Unlike some other parties, the SDLP will not stand  idly by and watch the Council&rsquo;s remit be reduced, while the British-Irish  Council&rsquo;s remit is extended. The Council deals with a number of issues  meaningful for the delivery, on an all-Ireland basis, for all the people, not  only of Northern Ireland, or  the North of Ireland, but of the island   of Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP is clear about the DUP&rsquo;s political motivation and  its manifesto pledge to reduce Departments. What we are seeing is a back-door  approach into majority rule by stealth. Other parties have fallen fast asleep  and cannot see what the DUP&rsquo;s real agenda is. I ask the Ulster Unionists to  accept our amendment, which goes much further than the original motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I ask the Member to bring her remarks to a close, please.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  Our amendment calls for pragmatic changes that will improve government.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Paisley Jnr</strong>:  This is a very important debate. The public will be perplexed when they hear some  of the comments that Members uttered here today. Those Members are saying that  they want more largesse, more government, more expenditure, more permanent  secretaries and more civil servants. They want more, more, more.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">During this credit crunch, all the parties have claimed that  they want to see less government and less public expenditure on wasteful  elements of government. They also say that they want a Government that is  efficient, lean, agile and able. However, some parties want to burden the  Government with more.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Day and daily, the public say that our system of government  is too complex and too bureaucratic, which makes it far too difficult to get  planning decisions &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">They say that the complexity of government makes it far too  difficult to get all manner of decisions taken, including decisions on housing. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Paisley Jnr</strong>:  The public say that it is far too difficult to get all manner of decisions  through government because of bureaucracy. However, for what does the SDLP ask?  It asks for more government and for government to be slowed down. The SDLP  wants the DUP to accept an amendment to its motion that will add at least two  years to the Assembly&rsquo;s process of reform.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am glad that, in the Assembly today, there is a voice of  reason. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.] </span>A voice of reason that says let  us make the Assembly work in a more efficient, more able, and more  cost-effective manner than is currently the case.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Most people will be amazed by the SDLP&rsquo;s decision to show two  faces in this debate. Margaret Ritchie told the Executive that she was prepared  to support the Programme for Government that called for this review, that  called for change and that supported a lean government. Her party&rsquo;s leader and  his sidekicks, however, have stood up and demanded that there be more  government and, with that, more expenditure. That is amazing. The public will  be absolutely amazed at the exhibition that the SDLP has made of itself today.  Mr Durkan had his chance to change things when he was in the Office of the  First Minister and deputy First Minister, but he failed, and he failed  miserably. He failed to deliver those changes.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We then hear the cries from the SDLP that this is a power  grab by the Democratic Unionist Party. I do not want to read a lecture to the  SDLP about how the d&rsquo;Hondt process works, but I fail to see how it is a power  grab when our party will have fewer Ministers at the end of it. The public will  be amazed that yet again &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Paisley Jnr</strong>:  Sit down, Mark. You are not getting  in, son. You had your chance and you were wick then, so you will not get  another chance on my time. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am glad that the Ulster Unionist Party has supported our  motion. Danny Kennedy said that only a small amount of money would be saved.  The case has to be made and proved, but it takes little to see that some  benefit would result from reducing the cost of salaries of permanent  secretaries by not renewing those salaries. That would save at least &pound;1&middot;3 million,  and the cost of establishing and running a Department &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. The Member has consistently advised that he will not give  way, so please stop interrupting.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Paisley Jnr</strong>:  I cut at least 10 minutes from my speech so that you can have the benefit of  getting home early today, Dolores, so at least allow me to make my speech.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It would cost around &pound;20 million to establish a new  Department in Northern    Ireland. If that money were saved, it could  be spent on front line services. Our calculations show that amalgamating three  of the current Departments with other Departments would save up to &pound;80 million.  That money should be spent on front line services. We have heard much about the  need for public housing, and I sympathise and agree with that. Let us get the  money out of wasteful bureaucracy and into front line services.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The business community has made a clear demand for those  changes. The Business Alliance made it clear that, in the Programme for  Government:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;service delivery could be enhanced through bold  redesign&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">of government. The DUP supports that. The Institute  of Directors (IOD) said that the challenge for 2009 is:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;the review of central government departments cannot  be immune from rationalisation and reform, and must be pursued vigorously.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The DUP is prepared to pursue that vigorously. It has  tabled the motion, and it has demanded action on the issue. It is incumbent on  the parties that talk the talk of bold, effective and efficient government to  walk the walk through the aisles with us today. I support the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: As Question Time begins at 2.30 pm, I suggest that the House take  its ease until that time. The debate will continue after Question Time, when  the Question will be put on the amendment.</p>

	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I again remind Members of a change in the arrangements for Question Time.  Members wishing to ask a supplementary question should rise in their places as  the Minister finishes responding to a lead or supplementary question.</p>
	      <p class="H3SectionHeading">Education</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Post-Primary Transfer</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">1. <strong>Mr  Moutray </strong>asked the Minister of Education when she expects to announce her  final proposals on post-primary transfer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name= AQO1677/09>(AQO  1677/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education (Ms Ruane)</strong>: I m&iacute; Bealtaine, tharraing m&eacute; molta&iacute; comhthoili&uacute;la  anuas a bhain le socruithe nua don aistri&uacute; iarbhunscoile; bh&iacute; na molta&iacute; seo  bunaithe ar dh&iacute;osp&oacute;ireachta&iacute; forleathana leis na p&aacute;irtithe leasmhara ar fad san  earn&aacute;il oideachais.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I brought forward consensual proposals in May 2008 for new  post-primary transfer arrangements, which were based on extensive discussions  with the full range of education stakeholders. My proposals are designed to  address inequalities associated with the existing arrangements. The case for  change is compelling.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">At present, one in four children in the non-grammar sector  is entitled to free school meals. In the grammar sector, that ratio is one in  17. In addition, due to the size and nature of the grammar sector persisting  amidst a major decline in pupil numbers, the pressures and burdens of  sustainability are suffered exclusively by non-grammar schools. The maintenance  of the number of grammar places against a backdrop of demographic decline has  meant that pupil numbers have fallen in only the non-grammar sector. That means  that children from disadvantaged socio-economic groups face not only an  admissions process that gives them disproportionately low prospects of  obtaining a grammar school place, but means that they are significantly  over-represented in non-grammar post-primary schools.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The case for change is also underlined by the extent of  educational underachievement and how that relates to educational disadvantage.  For example, 70% of children &mdash; 14,391 children &mdash; not entitled to free school  meals left school with at least five GCSEs at grades A* to C, yet only 38% of  school-leavers entitled to free school meals had the same level of achievement.  Some 92% of Travellers have no GCSEs, compared with 4% of all school-leavers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We must move away from a system in which children&rsquo;s prospects  are so heavily influenced by the relative affluence of the area in which they  live. For example, 73% of the children who transferred from primary schools in  Holywood did so to a grammar school. In Hillsborough, that figure was 72%; on  the Malone Road  it was 95%; and in Stranmillis it was 85%. However, in Twinbrook and Poleglass,  that figure was 34%. It was 22% in Rathcoole, 26% in the Shankill area and 20%  in the New Lodge.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have sought Executive engagement with my proposals, and I  made a formal bid to have them included in legislation. In the absence of  substantive consideration by the Executive of my proposals, I have sought  individual discussions with each Executive Minister. In many cases, however, I  have not had a response. I remain ready and willing to bring a policy  memorandum to the Executive when they are in a position to discuss it.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Moutray</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her answer. She has now been Minister of the Crown for  education in Northern    Ireland for some 18 months.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Moutray</strong>:  Is it her intention to bring forward proposals that incorporate the current  legal reality regarding academic selection?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: Yes, I have been Minister of Education for many months now, and  I have to say that it has been a very important job. This is a key time in  education. It is wonderful to be at the helm of education when so much change  for the better is happening.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We have an outdated education system that needs to be  changed and I am determined that we continue with the change that has already  begun. Thankfully, we have had the last 11-plus. There will be no more 11-plus  here in the North of Ireland, and that is good news for all our children, none  of whom should be sitting an exam at the tender age of 10 or 11, with future  pathways decided on the basis of two one-hour tests.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Where are the Members in representing the children whom the  system is failing? Where are they in representing the 12,000 young people whom  our system is failing? Are they content to allow to continue a system that  fails a huge number of our young people? Well, I am not.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There will be change, and I look forward to working with  all Members in effecting that change.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Is the Minister of Education aware that, because of her failure to introduce  any constructive proposals, she is the most unpopular politician in Northern Ireland?  Furthermore, is she aware that the people of Northern Ireland long for a return  to the good old days of Martin McGuinness? Has there been some  misunderstanding? Will the Minister explain to the people of Northern Ireland  why she has failed not only her people but all our people?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I do not know where the Member has been, because I have  introduced proposals. I have introduced compromise proposals for the phased ending  of academic selection, and I look forward to Members supporting those  proposals. In the absence of those proposals being supported, I will issue  guidance on admissions criteria, but I would prefer us to reach agreement.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I look forward to Members representing their constituents  and working with me to deal with educational underachievement. I am not  prepared to preside over educational apartheid or academic rejection.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Popularity was not my rationale for entering politics. My  rationale in being the Minister of Education for the North of Ireland is to  bring about the change that is so badly needed. I urge Members to talk to the  people on the ground and the young people who have been failed by the current  system. I have talked to them, and it is not acceptable for us to fail the  number of children whom we are currently failing.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Ba mhaith liom a fhiafra&iacute; den  Aire an bhfuil plean eile aici seachas an ceann a nocht s&iacute; cheana f&eacute;in don  idirthr&eacute;imhse, b&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir ceann a bheadh bunaithe ar an ph&aacute;ip&eacute;ar a chuir na  ceannasaithe Eaglaise i gcionn a ch&eacute;ile, a mbeadh, b&rsquo;fh&eacute;dir, taca&iacute;ocht n&iacute;os  forleithne aige. Chuideodh sin le c&oacute;ras neamhrialta a sheachaint.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Does the Minister have an alternative transitional proposal  beyond the one that has already been revealed, perhaps a proposal based on the  paper that was published by the Church leaders? Such a proposal would gain more  widespread support and would help to avoid the development of an unregulated  system of academic selection. Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: Go raibh maith agat. As I have done in the past, I pay tribute  to the Church leaders for the work that they have done. As Members will know, I  met representatives from all the Churches in the North of Ireland. I also met  representatives from all the different education sectors, and the vast majority  of those people want change.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have introduced compromise proposals, on which I look  forward to reaching agreement. I have always said that I am willing to listen  to suggestions, and if those suggestions improve my proposals, I will certainly  take them on board.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Change is needed for all our children, and we must progress  our education system into the twenty-first century. I look forward to the support  of the SDLP when I present those proposals.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Education for Children from the &nbsp;Travelling Community</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">2. <strong>Mr  Molloy </strong>asked the Minister of Education what action she is taking to ensure  that children from the Travelling community receive a fair and equal education.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name= AQO1816/09>(AQO 1816/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: Le fada an l&aacute; anois, t&aacute; leithcheal &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh ar an Lucht Si&uacute;il  sna r&eacute;ims&iacute; oideachais, sl&aacute;inte, tit&iacute;ochta agus fosta&iacute;ochta. T&aacute; siad ar cheann  de na gr&uacute;pa&iacute; is m&oacute; at&aacute; faoi mh&iacute;bhunt&aacute;iste sa Tuaisceart.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">For too long, the Traveller community has suffered  discrimination in education, health, housing and employment, and it is one of  the most disadvantaged groups throughout the island of Ireland.  The vast majority of Travellers in the North have no formal educational qualifications,  and 92% have no GCSEs or equivalent qualifications. Indeed, in 2006, it was  reported that nine out of 10 Traveller children had not achieved the required  literacy levels.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am driving a number of key actions to ensure better  educational access and outcomes for Irish Traveller children and Roma children.  At the centre of my vision for the future is the work of the task force on  Traveller education, which I established in September 2008. That task force is  jointly chaired by an Irish Traveller, Catherine Joyce, and Dr Robbie McVeigh.  The task force is bringing together representatives from statutory and  non-statutory bodies from all of Ireland to make recommendations on  Traveller education, which will be underpinned by the United Nations Convention  on the Rights of the Child.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In March 2009, we will be holding a joint North/South  conference on Traveller education, during which we will share good practice in Ireland and  further afield. That will further inform the task force in developing its recommendations.  We are also working to progress data collection for Irish Traveller children  and Roma children, particularly in the areas of attainment and attendance. That  will enable us to set benchmarks, measure progress, and identify areas that  require more work.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am also taking action to ensure that Roma children &mdash; who,  as members of a historically nomadic group, face the double barriers of  language and discrimination &mdash; receive a fair and equal education. Additional  funding is being provided to schools based on the current reported number of  Roma children. We cannot have a situation in which children go hungry in our  schools.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>: I  thank the Minister for her reply. In areas where a high number of Traveller  children are attending school, will she consider providing extra classroom  assistance or support for teachers to ensure that those children get the  opportunity of education?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: Tr&iacute;d an bhfoirmle comhaontaithe fuair scoileanna &pound;983 de  mhaoini&uacute; breise do gach p&aacute;iste den Lucht Si&uacute;il sa bhliain 2008-09.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Through the common funding formula, schools received &pound;980  of additional funding per Traveller child for the year 2008-09. Those funds are  provided to schools because of the Traveller children who are attending them;  therefore, it is very important that schools use the funds to work for the  needs of those children. Each school decides how best to use that money.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department is holding a series of working groups to  consider the money that schools receive through the common funding formula for  each Traveller child. We want to provide more guidance on what schools should  spend their Traveller factor funds on. The working group consists of  departmental staff, representatives from the education and library boards and  principals from two primary and two post-primary schools.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A total of &pound;364,000 earmarked funding was provided to the  boards for the education of Traveller children in the year 2008-09. Therefore,  a total of over &pound;1 million is provided as additional funding for the education  of Traveller children. A total of 822 Traveller children were in schools as of  October 2007, and Members will know that we have put classroom assistants into  every P1 and P2 class right across the North of Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>: I  note that the Minister of the Crown for education on this occasion is not  wearing her educational balaclava, so I am delighted that she is in the House  to answer the question.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">On the matter of fair and equal education, were the  Minister successful with her current transfer proposals, would it not be the  case that she would turn every child into a Traveller child? We would have a  situation in which our children would be denied choice and opportunity, and the  problem that she is trying to address in the Travelling community would be exacerbated.  We would have more problems in our educational system, but the Minister fails  to recognise or deal with that.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. Before I ask the Minister to respond, I must inform the Member that &mdash; as  I made absolutely clear this morning &mdash; he should not use that language in the  Chamber.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I am going to ignore the first part of the question.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In relation to the second part of the question, the Member  &mdash; and all Members &mdash; will know that I put children first in all areas of my work  and that children are at the centre of my concerns. I find it insulting when  people talk about &ldquo;our children&rdquo;, meaning one set of children. I am the  Minister of Education for all children. I take my duties very seriously, which  includes my responsibility for the 14,000 young people who are failing, whether  they are from the Protestant community, the Catholic community, or are ethnic  minority children. Therefore, I do not discriminate against any children. What  I do is put a system in place that ensures that children with special needs get  the money and resources that they deserve, whether they are from the Falls or  the Shankill, the Waterside or the Bogside, from Newry, Down, Tyrone or another  part of the North of Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I ask Members to join with me. The Member asks whether we  will input the same amount that we have given to Traveller children &mdash; work with  me, give me more money and I will be happy to put it into our education system.  I would love to see the Education Department getting more money.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members will be aware that I have targeted funding on the  basis of need. I am reviewing the common funding formula so that we can put  more money into working-class areas where there are Protestant children,  Catholic children and children from all ethnic minorities.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  It is good to share a constituency with the most unpopular politician in Northern Ireland.  The Minister obviously feels that the Travelling community has been  disadvantaged. Who does she think has caused that disadvantage, and will she  identify those responsible for it?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I am sorry, could you repeat the question?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  She is not even listening to us.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Will the Minister identify those whom she feels are responsible &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Start again.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Will the Minister identify those responsible for the disadvantage that she  feels exists against the Travelling community: will she identify the people  whom she thinks have caused that disadvantage?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: First, we will let the electorate of South Down decide who is  popular. Given the votes that my party gets, we will let the electorate decide  that matter.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Regarding the discrimination against our Traveller  population, what we have is systemic discrimination that is multi-layered. We  have discrimination because they are &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCrea</strong>:  What does that mean?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: Basil may not know what that means, but it means that we have an  education system that disadvantages huge sections of our population; not just  Travellers, but because Travellers face extra barriers, they, along with other  sectors in our society &mdash; our ethnic minority children, children facing violence  in the home or outside the home, whether it be sexual or physical violence &mdash;  have extra barriers to overcome. We are trying to put support in place for the  different sections of our population that face barriers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It has been documented &mdash; and I urge the Member to read the  Equality Commission&rsquo;s report &mdash; that the Travelling community has the highest  number of children leaving school without formal qualifications: 92%. That  means that only 8% are leaving school with formal qualifications. I hope that  the Member joins with me in working to bring about improved outcomes.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Academic Selection</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">3. <strong>Mr  Simpson </strong>asked the Minister of Education to detail the legal restrictions  she would face in unilaterally seeking to remove academic selection.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name= AQO1676/09>(AQO 1676/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: N&iacute; f&eacute;idir le duine ar bith roghn&uacute; acad&uacute;il a cheal&uacute; n&aacute; a fhorchur  ar bhonn aontaobhach, agus d&aacute; bhr&iacute; sin n&iacute;l aon cheist ann.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">No one can unilaterally impose or remove academic  selection, and, therefore, the question does not arise. I have brought  proposals to the Executive for the phased abolition of academic selection.  Those proposals include a transitional period of three years during which  schools can admit a proportion of their intake on the basis of academic  selection.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My proposals address a number of inequalities that are  evident in the existing arrangements, particularly the role that disadvantage  plays in constraining the life chances of children as they make the transition  from primary education to post-primary education. As I have said, it is a  damning statistic that while one in four children in our non-grammar schools is  entitled to free school meals, the ratio in grammar schools is one in 17.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We need to bring about change that is badly needed, and I  am determined to do so. I want to reach agreement, but in the absence of  agreement, I will issue guidance.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Simpson</strong>:  The Minister of the Crown for education in Northern Ireland has already  conceded in an answer to a question for written answer that it is legally  permissible for schools that wish to do so to utilise academic selection in the  event of there being no agreement. She has also stated that she was aware of  the current legal reality regarding academic selection from day one of her  tenure. Does the Minister intend to bang her head against a brick wall in an  attempt to get round the legislation or will she get on with her job?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I am getting on with my job. The 11-plus is gone.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  In light of what the Minister has said, does she expect to see an end to  academic selection within the lifetime of the current Assembly, and is there &mdash;  or does she perceive there to be &mdash; any legal impediment to the continuation of  academic selection by whatever means?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I am not going to repeat the proposals that I have introduced &mdash;  the Member knows what they are. I hope that we can reach agreement on those  proposals &mdash; if we do, it will be in the interests of all children; if we do  not, I will issue guidance.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>:  What are the legal restrictions on schools that seek to select their own  intake, by means of an examination or otherwise?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I have made it very clear that I want us to reach agreement. If  we reach agreement, those schools that want to carry out independent tests &mdash;  breakaway schools &mdash; will not be able to do so, unless they become private  schools. If we do not reach agreement, I will issue guidance. I have outlined  on many occasions that there is a danger in breakaway schools operating  independent tests; the Department works to equality and disability legislation,  and it will not fund independent tests or any appeals to those tests. I urge  everyone &mdash; political parties and all the education sectors &mdash; to move forward  and to put children at the centre.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>:  Although not wishing to advocate the retention of the present system, will the  Minster agree that an unregulated system is probably worse than the current  system? I ask that question on behalf of my constituents, and not on behalf of  the Crown, Mrs Windsor or anyone else.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I welcome the fact that the SDLP is opposed to academic selection,  and I look forward to its support for my proposals. The worst-case scenario is  the current system; I have no plans to bring back the 11-plus, and I hope that  the SDLP does not &mdash; perhaps, at some point, one of its Members will clarify  that. As I have said, I want, and look forward to, agreement. If we do not  reach agreement, I will issue guidance, and that guidance will be very  carefully managed.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Education (Pupil Records and Reporting) Regulations  (NI) 2009</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">4. <strong>Ms N&iacute;  Chuil&iacute;n </strong>asked the Minister of Education what are the policy objectives of  the Education (Pupil Records and Reporting) Regulations (NI) 2009.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name= AQO1820/09>(AQO 1820/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: T&aacute; s&eacute; t&aacute;bhachtach againn mar thuismitheoir&iacute; fios a bheith againn  conas at&aacute; ag &eacute;ir&iacute; len&aacute;r gcuid p&aacute;ist&iacute; ar scoil.

	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that parents know how their children are  doing at school. The objective of the draft regulations is to ensure that  parents receive meaningful and relevant information about their child at the  appropriate points during their education. We must make sure that parents have  the information that they need in order to know not just how their child is  doing at school, but how they can help support learning at home. If children  are to do well and reach their full potential, they need the help of their  teachers and parental support.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have listened to the feedback from parents, teachers and  principals on last year&rsquo;s pupil profile pilot, which was useful in helping me  to decide which elements to retain and which to improve. As much of that report  was positively received, I will be making very few changes to the detail of what  should be covered in the annual school report. I am, however, proposing to go  back to calling it an annual report to parents &mdash; tuairisc bhliant&uacute;il do  thuismitheoir&iacute; &mdash; and to making sure that there is the flexibility for schools  to add any extra information that they think that parents will find useful.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Parents, teachers and young people are being consulted on  the proposals. In view of the feedback from the pilot programme, my proposals  do not require schools to use a standard format for reporting; however, the  format that was trialled last summer will continue to be made available for the  many schools that have found it beneficial.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her answer. Under the draft regulations, how will the  annual reports to parents differ from those that they currently receive?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: Go raibh maith as an cheist sin. Beidh nasc idir an tuairisc  agus an curaclam don ch&eacute;ad uair riamh.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">For the first time, the draft regulations will bring  reporting requirements fully in line with the revised curriculum. All Members  of the House have been concerned about raising literacy and numeracy standards.  The regulations will allow reporting to reflect the clear focus that I expect  teachers to place on standards in literacy and numeracy, as well as providing  parents with information about how their daughters and sons are doing in other  areas of the revised curriculum.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If a school has traditionally reported class assessment  outcomes to parents, it will continue to do so. The draft regulations propose  common coverage of reporting, so that no matter what schools children attend,  all parents will get the same breadth of information about how their children  are doing. Good practice must be built on.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  In the Minister&rsquo;s response to an earlier supplementary question, she referred  to a money shortage in the Department. Recently, she announced the end of the  pupil-profile initiative. Surely when she took that decision, she calculated  how much money her Department had spent on the initiative. Will she tell the  Assembly how much money the pupil-profile initiative has cost her Department?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: There is a presumption in the question that the Department has  wasted money. No money has been wasted. The approach to annual reporting to  parents has not changed significantly.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In 2007-08, 2008-09 and the current financial year to date,  the cost of training and support of teachers on reporting to parents via a  standardised pupil-profile format has been &pound;180,000. I am sure that all Members  understand the importance of reporting to parents, which was emphasised during  all the pilots and consultations that were carried out. Are Members suggesting  that teachers should not report to parents? The Department has listened to  educationalists and parents. It has decided that instead of &ldquo;pupil profiles&rdquo;,  they will now be called &ldquo;annual reports to parents&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCausland</strong>:  A 2008 document on the revised curriculum, which was published with a foreword  by the Minister, states that the future lies with pupil profiles. Will the  Minister, therefore, acknowledge that she got it wrong? Will she acknowledge  that she changed her mind? Will she also tell the House the actual full cost of  developing the pupil-profile system and of the work that was done to support  and train teachers &mdash; which has been mentioned already &mdash; in the now-redundant  system?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: It seems that the DUP has moved from its position of being  anti-pupil profiles to being pro-pupil profiles. I adhere to my statutory duties,  one of which is to conduct consultation. The leaflet to which the Member refers  was published before the policy&rsquo;s launch.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Review of Special Educational &nbsp;Needs and Inclusion</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">5. <strong>Mr  Boylan </strong>asked the Minister of Education for an update on the review of special  educational needs and inclusion, which commenced in April 2006.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name= AQO1824/09><a name= AQO1824/09>(AQO 1824/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: T&aacute; riachtanas speisialta oideachas&uacute;il de chine&aacute;l &eacute;igin ar ch&oacute;ir  a bheith 18% de na p&aacute;ist&iacute; in&aacute;r scoileanna.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Almost 18% of schoolchildren have some form of special  educational need (SEN). Much has been achieved under the current SEN framework.  However, the review was undertaken in order to consider the bureaucracy of  current arrangements; the inconsistencies and delays in assessment and  provision; the year-on-year increase in the number of statements; the growing  number of children with special needs in mainstream schools; and the clear need  for strategic use of resources.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Change is not needed for change&rsquo;s sake; it is needed for  children&rsquo;s sake. The review aims to ensure that every child and young person  who faces a barrier to learning is given a fair and equal chance. It must be  ensured that all children are provided with appropriate support as early as  possible in order to help them to achieve their full potential.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In developing policy proposals, there has been much early  engagement with a wide range of groups and individuals in order to obtain  stakeholders&rsquo; views. Publication of those policy proposals is, therefore, much  anticipated by everyone who has been involved. Draft policy proposals were  first referred to my Executive colleagues on 1 July 2008. A formal request for  agreement to proceed to public consultation was issued to the Executive on 28  November 2008. When agreement on the policy proposals has been given, the  Department will be in a position to move quickly to issue the proposals for  public consultation.</p>

	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Student Loans</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">1. <strong>Mr  McFarland </strong>asked the Minister for Employment and Learning whether the recent  reductions in the Bank of England interest rate are being reflected in the rate  of interest charged by the Student Loans Company.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name= AQO1700/09>(AQO 1700/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning (Sir Reg Empey)</strong>: Interest applied to income  contingent repayment (ICR) student loans is based on either the annual March  retail price index or the highest base rate of a group of specified banks,  including the Bank of England, plus 1%. The lower of those options is selected.  As a result of the reduction in the base rate to 2% in December 2008, the base  rate plus 1% was lower than the March 2008 retail price index, which was 3&middot;8%.  The Student Loans Company, therefore, reduced the interest rate payable from  3&middot;8% to 3%. Following the further reduction in the base rate to 1&middot;5% earlier  this month, the interest rate payable on ICR student loans has now been reduced  from 3% to 2&middot;5%.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McFarland</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his answer. I am sure that he agrees that a lower  interest rate on student loans is a good news story. Can he tell the House how  he proposes to get that message across to potential students?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I thank the Member for his very helpful  suggestion, because there is a lack of information and knowledge. The Student  Loans Company is the body that services, provides and administers student loans  throughout the UK.  I will consult the Department and write to the Member when the issue has been  examined.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The rate applied to student loans does not immediately  affect the amount that a person might repay at any point in time, because HM  Revenue and Customs takes 9% of people&rsquo;s income above the threshold level. The  reduction in the interest rate means that there is less to repay, but it does  not have an immediate impact on the level of payment.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  Can the Minister confirm that some people have been put off from applying for a  student loan because of the interest rate? Is the Minister aware that many  parents are left to assist in the repayment of student loans? Indeed, that may  be especially the case this year, due to the economic downturn. Is any  consideration being given to students who are trying to repay loans through  their parents?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: Not every person who is eligible for a loan takes  one. Indeed, the last statistics that I saw indicated that about 20% of people  eligible for a loan did not take one out. It is not an interest rate that is  applied to student loans, so much as a charge that is applied to the account.  Since its inception, it has traditionally been lower than the level that would  be offered by a bank.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There are many people around the Chamber who have sympathy  with parents becoming involved in the repayment of student loans. Parental  involvement continues to happen. However, as the Member knows, we are looking  at the whole question of student finance this year, and we will take all of  these things into account. Early indications are that the number of students  taking up positions in our universities continues to rise.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Butler</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Is the Minister aware that the  graduate salary threshold of &pound;15,000 for the repayment of student loans is too  low? There is quite a bit of evidence to suggest that graduate salaries are  more likely to be between &pound;18,000 and &pound;23,000. Given that students have to  repay 9% of their salary when it reaches &pound;15,000, can the Minister give an  undertaking that he will look at the issue and introduce a higher threshold  that better reflects graduate salaries?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: This scheme is administered by HM Revenue and  Customs throughout the UK.  HM Revenue and Customs is not prepared to regionalise the scheme; it is not  prepared to treat Northern Ireland,  Wales, Scotland and England separately. There would  have to be an agreement between the four Administrations before the threshold  could be changed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am prepared to write to my colleagues in the other  Administrations to point out the difficulties that the Member has highlighted,  and I will inform the House when I receive a response.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  The threshold for qualification for maintenance grants, which is based on  parental income, is linked to the salary threshold and to the huge problem of  student debt. Does the Minister agree that the Assembly could, perhaps, examine  that matter? Will he consider raising the eligibility threshold for maintenance  grants?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: The Member will be aware that Northern Ireland has retained a differential on  maintenance grants, and we pay &pound;500 per annum more than anywhere else in the UK. Indeed, in  the comprehensive spending review that was announced in 2008, we decided to  protect that differential because Northern Ireland has achieved greater  participation among students from disadvantaged backgrounds than any other  region. We must review the matter continually and include it in the student  finance review. At this stage, my policy is to maintain the differential  between Northern Ireland and  the rest of the UK.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Funding</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">2. <strong>Mr A  Maginness </strong>asked the Minister for Employment and Learning to provide details  of additional funding for new PhDs and research and development, as a response  to the economic situation; if his Department is seeking funds to create a new Innovation  Fund and if there is any North/South element to the recent announcement of a  new Innovation Fund in the Republic of Ireland.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name= AQO1808/09>(AQO  1808/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: In 2008, my Department announced several new  university-based research initiatives, which represent an investment of more  than &pound;63 million over the next three years in local academic research bases.  That includes funding for an additional 100 PhDs in each of the next three  years in areas of economic relevance.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Those initiatives are partly supported by &pound;31&middot;3 million  from the new funding for innovation stream, which is co-funded by the Irish  Government. The new Innovation Fund - Ireland, to which the Member referred,  is part of a framework for sustainable economic renewal that was launched in  November 2008. Although the details in the framework have still to be  developed, &lsquo;Building Ireland&rsquo;s Smart Economy: a Framework for Sustainable  Economic Renewal&rsquo; states:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;to the extent that it is appropriate, and by  agreement with the Northern Ireland Executive, all of the policies, programmes  and initiatives in this Action Plan will take full account of the mutual  benefits available through North-South co-operation.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his comprehensive answer. Does he agree that, as soon  as we escape the recession &mdash; God knows when that will be &mdash; we will require as  many graduates and PhD students and as much investment in higher learning as  possible in order to outperform other parts of Europe? Does he agree that we  should invest even more money in that area?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: The Member is talking to the converted. He will be  aware that the Department made several announcements under the funding for  innovation scheme, and he will remember that an initial series of schemes was  announced in autumn 2008. Furthermore, he will be aware that we have added  further packages to the package that the Minister of Finance and Personnel  announced on 15 December 2008. Therefore, we have radically increased spending,  and I have reprioritised the Department&rsquo;s plans in order to allocate money to  that area.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member referred to the new Innovation Fund - Ireland. We do  not yet know the full scope or details of that scheme, but I assure the Member  that the Department will consider extremely closely and favourably any  opportunities to strengthen the research base here or in co-operation with the  Republic. I agree with the Member&rsquo;s assertion that, on the rebound from the  economic crisis, we will need as many highly qualified people as possible to  lead us out of the recession.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  What consideration has the ever-popular Minister for Employment and Learning  given to increasing levels of R&amp;D spending in universities as a means of  fighting this dreadful recession?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: The Member will be aware that Gordon Brown  announced a couple of years ago &mdash; before devolution was established &mdash; that he  was considering an innovation fund. He will also know that when the  comprehensive spending review process began after devolution was  re-established, one of my main targets was to try to attract as much as  possible of the money from that fund into the Department. We succeeded in attracting  in excess of &pound;40 million &mdash; roughly half of the total amount. That was one of my  main targets for the simple reason that an innovation fund is one of the ways  in which we can improve our research and skills base. The Member will be aware  that, through the comprehensive spending review, the Department got money for  another 100 places per annum over the next three years. All of those places  have been taken up in the universities, which is very positive.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My Department will keep the pressure on to increase the  money available for providing those places, and, in answer to a previous  Member, I said that the Department has already re-prioritised some of its  spending lines in order to make money available for research and development.  People must understand that the research and development spend in Northern Ireland is  still well below not only national levels, but international levels, which is  more important. Therefore, there is work still to be done.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Belfast   Metropolitan College:  Senior Concessions</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">3. <strong>Ms Lo </strong>asked  the Minister for Employment and Learning what plans he has to review the policy  on senior concessions for further education courses in Belfast Metropolitan   College, to include those  over the age of 60.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name= AQO1814/09><a name= AQO1814/09>(AQO  1814/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: At present, all college directors are collectively  examining their fee structures, taking account of the current economic climate,  and in light of the current part-time enrolment pattern throughout the further  education sector. In establishing their fees policies, colleges have to take  account of relevant legislation. They have to comply with Employment Equality  (Age) Regulations 2006, which came into operation in October 2006.  Unfortunately, those regulations mean that colleges are no longer able to offer  concessionary fees to learners solely on the basis of their age.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In advance of the start of the 2008/09 academic year, my  Department worked closely with colleges to identify additional means-tested  criteria that they could apply. As a result, all colleges can now offer fee concessions  to learners who are in receipt of rates relief, in addition to concessions that  are available to those in receipt of a range of benefits, including pension  credits.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his response. I have received correspondence from a  number of constituents in south Belfast  aged between 60 and 65 who have been engaged in a range of community-based  programmes. They are now being asked to pay the full fees, and are being  discouraged from the opportunities of further education, and from attempting to  address social isolation. Can there be flexibility for those who have been  engaged in a range of programmes to continue with those without having to pay  the full fees?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: The Member will have heard of the law of  unintended consequences, and if ever there was an unintended consequence, this  is it. I do not think that there is a Member in the Chamber who has not written  to me at some time in the past 18 months regarding this issue, and it is not a  place in which we want to be. However, the legal advice that the Department has  received &mdash; outlining a view that is shared by the Equality Commission &mdash; puts us  in a position in which, if colleges give concessionary fees purely on the basis  of age, they are contravening the directive. The Department is examining that,  and trying to broaden the applicable criteria.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I wish we were not in this position, because it seems  bizarre that a piece of legislation that was designed to help primarily older  people has ended up hindering them. I take very seriously the point that the  Member has made about the non-academic aspects of the issue.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is a social aspect, and I have received letter after  letter about that. Another European directive is coming on this issue &mdash;  although one could probably say that at any time, because there is always  another European directive coming &mdash; which may provide an opportunity if we can  find to fix this problem.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have written to the First Minister and deputy First Minister  in the past few days asking if this issue can be taken up nationally and at  European level, because I am quite sure that those who designed the directive  and the subsequent legislation never intended this to happen. I do not want  that to happen. It was a mistake and it is a shame. In the short term, we are  trying to mitigate the circumstances as best we can.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCausland</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his answer. Does he have any information as to the  impact that that situation has had on the enrolment figures at the Belfast Metropolitan College  and at other colleges?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: A number of Members have asked that question. The  material for the last academic year has been analysed by the Department. The  final figures have not yet been produced for me, but that will not take long.  As soon as those are available, I will write to the Member with the details. I  hear anecdotal reports, but I do not yet have the finalised, analysed figures  to hand.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  The Minister will be aware that I have contacted him about how important this  issue is and the effect that it is having on constituents in South Down. Given  the Minister&rsquo;s earlier response about the amount of European directives, does  he agree that we need a better system in which the First Minister and the  deputy First Minister could scrutinise the directives, so that we do not end up  with anomalies that cause problems and hardship in our constituencies?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I share the Member&rsquo;s frustration. However, I  suspect that it goes further than that, because Governments are signing up to  those directives in Brussels.  The Council of Ministers takes the final decisions, or else takes joint  decisions with the European Parliament. The recent vote on the nitrates  directives was taken in that way.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">After people decide on those directives, they are left for  quite a long time. It can take years before those decisions filter through. By  the time they would reach the First Minister and the deputy First Minister, it  would be too late. They need to be dealt with at governmental level at Westminster, because, unfortunately, our representatives  in Brussels are  approving those directives. Under the previous arrangements, that could not  happen unless the Council of Ministers approved them. The British Ministers  agreed to that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The frustration that the Member expressed clearly applies  right across the board. I will ask the First Minister and the deputy First  Minister to investigate whether there is any way that the effects can be  mitigated while it is possible that another directive will come. However, that  will require positive input from the UK represent&shy;atives on the Council  of Ministers.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Review of Student Fees</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">4. <strong>Mr  Newton </strong>asked the Minister for Employment and Learning when he expects to  publish his report on the review of student fees.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name= AQO1676/09>(AQO 1679/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: The review of variable fees and student-support  arrangements is under way. Northern Ireland  is the first area of the United    Kingdom to undertake such a review. I will  ensure that the Committee for Employment and Learning is updated on a quarterly  basis and at key milestones during the progress of the review. I anticipate  issuing a document for public consultation in the autumn of this year.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Newton</strong>:  That was not the question that I asked. The question that I asked was when the  Minister expected to publish his report on the review of student fees. My  understanding is that that will not be until March 2010.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  Why did the Member ask the question if he knew the answer?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Newton</strong>:  That will all become clear. In December 2007, the Minister pleaded with the  Assembly to give him 12 months to complete his report. According to the Hansard  report, his actual words were:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;for the sake of a year.&rdquo; &mdash; <span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; ">[Official Report, Vol 26,  No 2, p88, col 1].</span></span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If I am correct that the report will not be published until  March 2010 at the earliest, was that not an irresponsible approach that misled  this House?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: If the Member cares to read the Hansard report, he  will know that I repeatedly said that we would conduct a review in academic  year 2008-09. That is precisely what we are doing &mdash; in fact, we announced that  review before Christmas.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A lot of work has been going on: a team has been  established; a chairperson has been appointed; people have been appointed to  sit on the group; and an Economic and Social Research Council fellow is in  position to consider the data.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member knows that we must have enough robust  statistical evidence to make a case, because if the review were to conclude  that we should replace or do away with student fees, we would be talking about  huge sums of money &mdash; approximately &pound;100 million. Therefore, if one is to  approach the Department of Finance and Personnel, or anybody else, with such a  bill, robust statistics &mdash; and not a lot of waffle &mdash; are required, and such  statistics can be obtained only by means of a sufficiently significant data  sample.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In answer to questions, letters and debates in the House, I  repeatedly said that the review would commence in the 2008-09 academic year,  and that is exactly what happened.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat. Further to the Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for  Employment and Learning&rsquo;s question, bearing in mind the figures highlighted by  the Minister for years 1 and 2, the fact that he must await figures for year 3  in order to bring a case to the Department of Finance and Personnel, and given  that Basil McCrea said that Sir Reg Empey is one of the most popular Ministers,  will he make a popular decision? Is he minded to go to his Executive colleagues  with proposals to do away with student fees?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: If I were minded to do that, why would I go to the  bother of instigating a review process in the first place? Perhaps the Member  will indicate in advance which of her party&rsquo;s Ministers would give me the  money, because, if the money must come from the total pot, it must come from  their pockets, as well as those of other Ministers. We have appointed an  independent review in good faith, and the Committee will be updated on its  progress at least quarterly, or when any other milestones are reached. There is  no point in appointing a review committee if one has already made up one&rsquo;s mind  about what to do.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  Perhaps the Minister should have said &ldquo;in a political lifetime&rdquo;, which seems to  be an acceptable timescale. Will the Minister confirm that student fees are  means-tested and that, consequently, the majority of Northern Ireland students do not  pay them?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: The Member is correct. My Department&rsquo;s policy of  maintaining a differential to the maintenance grant was introduced by my  predecessor Se&aacute;n Farren &mdash; or perhaps it was Mrs Hanna. We have consistently  done that, and currently pay the highest grant.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In conjunction with other university programmes funded by  the Department, the policy has been successful in assisting more people from  disadvantaged backgrounds to become students. It has been successful because we  have worked at it. In fact, in Northern    Ireland, the British Government&rsquo;s targets  for encouraging people from disadvantaged backgrounds to get involved in higher  education have long been exceeded, and that is something to be proud of.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Most, if not all, parties represented in the Chamber were  hostile to the idea of introducing fees, and, in the present circumstances, any  debt or bill that people must face represents a huge challenge. Nevertheless,  now that the review is under way and people are in place to examine the  situation, we must take all circumstances into account before reaching a  decision, and I hope that, when I receive the report, assuming that the  Executive is still meeting, there will be something for them to discuss.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>: I  can assure the Minister that I do not know the answer to my question.<span class="Italic"> [Laughter.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I agree with Mr Elliott&rsquo;s comments that the Minister has  been proactive on further and higher education. I am sure that the Minister  will agree that many good plans that are made today will be history by the time  the report is published. Is the Minister of a mind to monitor any potential  drop-off in the number of students from lower economic backgrounds? Will he  advocate access funds for those students to the colleges should the recession  bite even harder than it is currently biting?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: Yes.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Education and Training for People with Tourette&rsquo;s  Syndrome</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">5. <strong>Mr  McCarthy </strong>asked the Minister for Employment and Learning to detail the  education and training provision available for people with Tourette&rsquo;s syndrome,  and any future plans for such provision.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name= AQO1810/09>(AQO  1810/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: My Department encourages and supports access to  education and training for people with disabilities. Under current disability  legislation, colleges and training providers are required to make reasonable  adjustments to allow people with learning difficulties and/or disabilities to  access mainstream provision. The support available is comprehensive and  applicable to a wide range of impairments, including Tourette&rsquo;s syndrome.  Support arrangements in the Department&rsquo;s areas of responsibility are kept under  review and will be enhanced as necessary.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">To enhance the effectiveness of the Department&rsquo;s Training  for Success and ApprenticeshipsNI programmes, a group was established  comprising individuals who have expertise in dealing with young people with  disabilities. The Department is considering the group&rsquo;s report and will respond  in the next few weeks.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  What action has the Minister or his Department taken to raise awareness among  teachers and lecturers about Tourette&rsquo;s syndrome during their training?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: We have not distinguished between a wide range of  difficulties and learning challenges that people face, because we try and deal  with those on a case-by-case basis. We are fortunate in that a number of  freelance professional and non-professional support workers are recruited and  trained to assist students with disabilities. Access to the register is  available to all disabled students in the universities and university colleges,  and on identifying that a student has a particular need, we try to match him or  her with someone who has the appropriate expertise.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member will be aware that we try to cover a broad  spectrum &mdash; and rightly so. However, following the publication of the report on  autism, attention deficit /hyperactivity disorder and other issues, it is fair  to say that people asked whether those conditions should be included in the  continuous professional development &mdash; as well as the initial professional  development &mdash; of teachers and, perhaps, lecturers. I will consider that, but  through working with the Department of Health, Social Services and Public  Safety and other parts of the public sector, we try to match a student who has  such a condition with someone who has the relevant expertise. I am prepared to  look at individual cases of which the Member may be aware.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Construction Industry Job Losses</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">6. <strong>Mr  McLaughlin </strong>asked the Minister for Employment and Learning to detail his  Department&rsquo;s strategy for assisting anyone who loses their job in the  construction industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name= AQO1789/09>(AQO  1789/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: A comprehensive range of services is available  through my Department&rsquo;s jobs and benefits offices, jobcentres and contracted  providers, to help the unemployed &mdash; including those formerly employed in the  construction industry &mdash; find work. The services include mandatory work-focused  interviews, action planning for certain clients and measures designed to  improve the job prospects of those who have become unemployed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Immediate assistance is also available, where appropriate,  through the Steps to Work initiative. Participants who have been out of the  labour market for 13 weeks or more may avail of the step 2 provision of that  initiative. They may, for instance, undertake a new qualification provision or  retrain in a new occupational area. The participant may enter at an early  stage, at the adviser&rsquo;s discretion, if, for example, there is the prospect of a  job.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his comprehensive answer. Has he considered the role  of the community and voluntary sector, because, in many cases, it is that  sector that will have to provide support for those who become unemployed as a  result of the economic downturn?</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: The Member will be aware that the construction  industry has been particularly badly hit. He asked specifically about the role  of the voluntary sector. My Department has several provisions in place and is  asking the voluntary and community sector to help with the implementation of  its policies.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In recent weeks, I have visited several jobcentres, and the  current difficulty is that there are virtually no construction jobs on offer.  Therefore, we are telling the advisers there that even if an individual has  recently received training in construction and would not normally be eligible  for retraining for some time, they may have to exercise their discretion. If  there is a genuine prospect of a job, they may need to offer earlier training  in another discipline. If that involves other training providers who are  contractually obliged to help the Department, so be it, and the Department will  strongly support going down that track.</p>
	      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="7"></a>Enterprise,  Trade And Investment</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">1. <strong>Mrs D  Kelly </strong>asked the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment to outline  what work is being done to identify the specific export industry segments that  will be targeted for future growth; how those segments are determined; and what  links have been set up between the local economic agencies and the Republic of  Ireland&rsquo;s Expert Group on Future Skills Needs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name= AQO1724/09>(AQO  1724/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment (Mrs Foster)</strong>: The first part of the question deals with the  export potential of industry sectors. The sectors targeted for future growth  are outlined in Invest NI&rsquo;s corporate plan for 2008-2011. Invest Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  key objective is to help its clients to increase their growth and  profitability. It has a wide range of sector strategies to boost the export  potential of existing businesses. They include strategies for the development  of professional and business services, the food sector, digital media,  biobusiness and niche manufacturing.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The sector focus of Invest NI&rsquo;s inward investment marketing  and sales strategy is to attract higher-value-added activities in financial  services and information and communication technology. As has been clearly  demonstrated in the past six months, the business environment is ever-changing,  and the strategies are, therefore, subject to ongoing review and development.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The second part of the question was a request for  information on the links that have been set up between the local economic  agencies and the Republic   of Ireland&rsquo;s Expert Group  on Future Skills Needs, but that is a matter for the Department for Employment  and Learning.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her answer, and, given the circumstances that  currently pertain to the financial institutions, I particularly welcome the  review. Does the Minister agree that the capability and strategic positioning  of the Northern Ireland Skills Expert Group should be enhanced? That group  should work in partnership with the Republic&rsquo;s Expert Group on Future Skills  Needs. A mechanism is required to ensure greater co-ordination between the  Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment (DETI) and the further and  higher education sectors here.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: I agree with the Member. The Department for Employment and  Learning (DEL) keeps us informed about its work and its co-operation with the Expert  Group on Future Skills Needs. My understanding is that a successful all-island  skills conference, Building Better Skills Together, was held on 9 October 2008  in Londonderry, and DEL  hopes to build on that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member mentioned financial services. Although everyone  in the House acknowledges the particular difficulties in that sector, there are  also opportunities for Northern    Ireland there. We must be alive to those  opportunities, and my Department is aware of what it needs to do to attract new  businesses in that sector to Northern    Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I too thank the Minister for her response. As exports are vital to Northern Ireland, will the Minister tell the  House what further initiatives are being undertaken by Invest Northern Ireland to  strengthen the export potential of clients in its target sectors in the  Province?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment</strong>: Invest Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  concentration on the sectors that it identified in its corporate plan is  ever-increasing. In response to the current economic downturn, Invest Northern Ireland is  working with its clients and stakeholders to strengthen the export potential of  the target sectors. It is providing support for the development of a wide range  of key activities, including the development of centres of R&amp;D competence.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">During questions to the Minister for Employment and  Learning, Members heard that Northern    Ireland has fallen behind in its R&amp;D  spend. My Department is trying to correct that through its work with Invest NI.  In December 2008, we announced a new campaign to encourage more companies to  develop their research and development capabilities, and it was widely welcomed  by industry.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We are trying to strengthen the supply chain. As all  Members know, the failure of a company at the top of the chain creates  difficulties for companies further down. Unfortunately, that has been  happening, particularly in the manufacturing industry, and has had the greatest  impact in my constituency of Fermanagh and South Tyrone and in the constituency  of Mid Ulster.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We are also working with industry associations for which  relevant university and non-university co-operation in research and development  is vital. We are also examining the alignment of future skills provision with  business needs, and in doing so, we work with the Department for Employment and  Learning.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Savage</strong>:  Will the Minister explain how growing companies that are not client companies  of DETI can be identified as having export potential and therefore be  encouraged to export?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: The Department has been working in that area for the past six  months. When it launched its credit-crunch seminars for Invest NI clients, it  recognised that there was also a need to help other companies &mdash; particularly small  companies that were not Invest NI clients. Before Christmas, I attended, in  Omagh, the first of the credit-crunch seminars. The Department is now working  with Enterprise Northern Ireland,  local government and chambers of commerce in particular areas to develop and  help those small businesses that may find themselves in difficulty, especially  with cash-flow problems. That is a new and innovative move for Invest NI &mdash; it  has not been done before. I welcome the partnership approach that we have  developed with those companies. I hope that the take-up will be as good as that  for Invest NI companies, which was very successful.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Varney II</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">2. <strong>Dr Farry </strong>asked the Minister of Enterprise,  Trade and Investment for an update on her Department&rsquo;s consideration of the  Varney II recommendations.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name= AQO1826/09><a name= AQO1826/09>(AQO  1826/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: My Department submitted a detailed response to the Department  of Finance and Personnel on the recommend&shy;ations that are in Sir David Varney&rsquo;s  second report. In that response, I explained that my Department was taking action  already to address the issues that were the subject of the majority of Varney&rsquo;s  recommendations.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">One recommendation suggested that a review be conducted  into the role, structure and governance of Invest NI. That was one of the  factors that led me to establish the independent review of economic policy  relating to my Department and Invest NI. The overall aim of the review, which I  launched in the House on 1 December 2008, is to ensure that DETI and Invest  NI&rsquo;s policies, programmes and resources are targeted to help improve  private-sector productivity in Northern    Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have asked the review panel to report by summer 2009 on  how existing policies and programmes might be better tailored, and what, if  any, new policies are necessary.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  Given DFP&rsquo;s downgrading of the regional economic strategy, does the Minister  share my concern that the Varney II recommendations may be sidelined? Does she  agree that it is important for us to accelerate consideration of any reform  agenda in order that we can free up businesses to create jobs and wealth and  get the economy going again in the context of the downturn?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: I do not share the Member&rsquo;s concerns. Many of the  recommendations in Varney II have been taken on board already, particularly by  my Department. I mentioned already the ongoing review, which will report to me  by early summer. If the Member were to look at other suggestions in Varney II,  such as the take-up of R&amp;D tax credits, he would know that the Department  is running a very successful innovation voucher scheme. The Department has  already tried to improve the take-up of R&amp;D tax credits with that scheme,  which has been praised for its good work.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is important to take on board the MATRIX report  recommendations, which the Member will be aware of and which are key to the  future development of the economy of Northern Ireland. We should not  underest&shy;imate the recommendations in that report. I hope to have a discussion  with Executive colleagues on how we roll forward the MATRIX report in the near  future.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  I agree with the Minister about the importance of R&amp;D to our industry and  about any recovery that may come along.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Does the Minister agree that a reduction in corporation tax  is even more important, given the economic downturn and the credit crunch that  we are all experiencing?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment</strong>: Yes; obviously the  prospect of that would be very welcome to Northern Ireland &mdash; if we had it.  The Member will be aware that in response to the Varney II report, the Prime  Minister confirmed that fiscal dispensations, including a reduction in  corporation tax, would not be granted to Northern Ireland. If we keep on  looking myopically at that the issue of corporation tax without looking wider,  we will miss a trick.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We need to consider other issues. Obviously, we will still  pursue a reduction in corporation tax, but we must also look at the other tools  in our box and get on with the job of promoting Northern Ireland and its economy.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  The Minister will recall that the Programme for Government set a great number  of economically focused targets. Will she confirm whether the review will  consider those economic targets in the light of the changing economic circumstances  in which we find ourselves?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: The short answer is yes. I have specifically asked the review  team that is examining the development of policy in DETI and Invest NI to  consider the Programme for Government targets in the light of the economic  downturn. It is only reasonable and rational to do so.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member knows that the purpose of the review into Invest  NI and DETI policy is to deal with the medium to long term. It is not a  knee-jerk reaction to the current situation; rather it is about planning for  the future. As with everything that we in DETI do, we want to take short-term  measures to deal with the pressures that we are under on a daily basis &mdash; of  which there are many &mdash; and also to look to the future. In that way, we can have  a strong economy to deal with the challenges that arise when there is an  upturn.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Inward Investment Jobs</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">3. <strong>Mr  Paisley Jnr </strong>asked the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment how many  inward investment jobs have been created during the last quarter and whether  her Department is on target to meet the inward investment goals set out in the  Programme for Government.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name= AQO1845/09>(AQO  1845/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: The provisional data for those inward investment projects that  were approved between 1 April 2008 and 31 December 2008 indicate that 2,053 new  inward investment jobs have been promoted to date, with 759 of them being in  the last quarter of the period. That would suggest that the 2008-09 foreign  direct investment (FDI) jobs target is on track for achievement, albeit that  some projects have not yet been announced and might well now be delayed until  more favourable economic conditions arise.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, if we look at the longer term, moving into  2009-2010 and 2010-11, the pipeline for new projects is not favourable. It  shows a significant reduction in project numbers compared to the same point in  2007-08. That correlates to feedback received from the national business  survey, which shows a general deterioration in business confidence. As those  projects would have been due to be delivered over two to three years, that  forecast downturn is likely to have a negative impact on my Department&rsquo;s  ability to deliver some of its public service agreement targets within the timescales  envisaged. We are, of course, keeping progress under review.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Paisley Jnr</strong>:  I thank the Minister for that comprehensive answer. Everyone recognises that,  in the current economic circumstances, it is difficult to attract inward  investment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Given that tourism is a significant component of economic  growth, will the Minister identify any specific help that her Department is  giving to projects in my North Antrim  constituency that impact on tourism? In particular, will she reveal anything to  the House about investments to the Bushmills Inn, Bay View farm cottages or  Hilden Barn in Ballymoney? What other tourism projects in my constituency can  the Minister assist?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: I thank the Member for giving me notice that he wanted  responses on those particular establishments. If he, or any other Member, has  any questions on any particular tourism development, he should write to me  about it. He is absolutely right; tourism is one of our key drivers of the  economy, nowhere more so than in his constituency. Therefore, it is essential  that we look to the medium to long term to get the correct product for people  who want to visit here and to ensure that they have a good experience and want  to return.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Invest Northern Ireland has approved an offer of support of  &pound;480,000 for the expansion of the Bushmills Inn, and that project will lead to  the company being able to offer an additional 19 rooms. The company has also  recently completed the Invest NI tourism visa marketing programme. I had the  opportunity to visit the Bushmills Inn last year, and I commend the owners on  the tremendous work that they are doing.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Invest Northern Ireland has offered Bay View farm cottages  support totalling &pound;57,000 for the development of three five-star self-catering  cottages within walking distance of the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway, and that project will  help to alleviate the requirement for high-quality tourism accommodation along  the Antrim coast.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, in November 2008, Invest Northern Ireland  approved an offer of &pound;95,000 for the establishment of a self-catering facility  at Hilden Barn near Ballymoney. That is a &pound;600,000 project that will result in  four five-star units, creating 20 bed spaces.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr McDonnell</strong>:  I draw the Minister&rsquo;s attention to recent statements by the US president-elect, who will be inaugurated  tomorrow, that he intends to make renewable energy technology a key component  of future US  economic and job creation policies. I also draw the Minister&rsquo;s attention to the  recent statement from the Irish   Republic that &euro;500  million will be spent on renewable energy technologies. The Scottish Executive  also intend for Scotland  to a become world leader in renewable energy technologies.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Speech.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr McDonnell</strong>:  Well, I suggest that there is an obvious implication for us, Mr Speaker. I ask  the Minister, simply, if she intends to make any similar announcements, or is  there some way in which Northern    Ireland can get a role, or partnership, in  some of those significant developments?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: I thank the Member for his question. He knows that one of the  areas discussed in great detail in the MATRIX report is the green economy. It  is certainly an area in which I believe that Northern Ireland can expand; not  only through innovation at universities, but also through manufacturing. There  is quite a lot of capacity in manufacturing to help deal with those issues.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department takes all the renewable energy issues very seriously.  A strategic environmental assessment was recently commissioned on tidal energy  off the north coast. I believe that that will lead to competition for those  people who want to invest in tidal energy. Northern Ireland has some of the  best tidal energy in the world; therefore, it is wrong to say that the  Department is not taking the issue of renewable energy seriously. The Member  need only consider the current scoping process as part of the strategic energy  framework, which contains a lot in relation to renewable energy. I know that  the Member will contribute to the debate surrounding that.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  Has the Minister&rsquo;s Department got a particular focus on creating and sharing  inward investment jobs between regions to the west and to the east of the Bann  in order to bring about more balanced economic development? I am asking whether  the Minister and her Department are being proactive enough in explaining the  merits to inward investors of towns such as Omagh, Strabane and Enniskillen.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: I must say that I am surprised that the Member asks that  question, given that he knows where I come from. The Member also knows that the  terms of reference in relation to the review into DETI policies and Invest NI  specifically mention regional points that must be taken into account, questions  whether those points are being taken into account effectively enough, and what  must be done in respect of that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I believe &mdash; and I hope that he agrees &mdash; that the Department  is trying to reach out to all regions of Northern Ireland. My officials went  to Omagh, and I mentioned recently about working with Invest NI, the Chamber of  Commerce, and the Member&rsquo;s own council.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department wanted to roll out a discussion about the  credit-crunch events, not just in the area east of the Bann; that process  started west of the Bann. The Member knows that that was a very successful  seminar, and that it was not just about FDI. He knows &mdash; and I have already  stated in answer to the substantive question &mdash; that the FDI pipeline is not as  good as it was. Therefore, Northern    Ireland must look to its indigenous companies  and small businesses, because small businesses are the backbone; they represent  98% of what happens here. There must be a balanced approach. There must be  planning for the future, as well as consideration of what can be done in the  short term.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McFarland</strong>:  The Minister mentioned the likely substantial reduction in FDI. Will she share  with the House her detailed plan for growing local industries to take account  of that drawback?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: I have already indicated that the Department is working very  hard with Invest NI and its indigenous clients. I sometimes think that Members  believe that the only clients that Invest NI has are those that come from a  different country. That is not correct. More than half of Invest NI&rsquo;s budget is  spent with indigenous companies. Therefore, the Department will continue to  work with indigenous companies. I have already said that the Department wants  to exploit more research and development capability. More of what the MATRIX  report identified in relation to innovation must be exploited, and then taken  through to manufacturing.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is much that we can do to help the Northern Ireland  economy. It depresses me that Members see the glass as half empty rather than  half full. We should be positive about the Northern Ireland economy. We have  not lost 1,900 jobs, as the Republic   of Ireland recently did  with Dell &mdash; we may be in a bad situation, but others are in a much worse one.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Job Losses in 2009</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">4. <strong>Mr  Storey </strong>asked the Minister of Enterprise,  Trade and Investment what analysis her Department has carried out of the  potential scale of job losses during 2009 as a result of the current economic  downturn.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name= AQO1843/09>(AQO 1843/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment</strong>: Although Northern Ireland&rsquo;s unemployment rate between August  and October 2008 of 4&middot;3% was among the lowest of the UK regions, I am well aware that  the global economic slowdown continues to impact on the local labour market.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Many sectors are reporting job losses, particularly in  construction, real estate, manufacturing, and wholesale and retail trade. My  Department commissioned an economic forecast in November 2008, which indicated  that overall employment in Northern    Ireland could fall by 12,000 in 2009. That  forecast is being updated to reflect the ongoing economic downturn. However, we  must recognise that economic forecasting is a complex business at the best of  times &mdash; the more so in the exceptionally dynamic conditions that we now face.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  Jobs in my constituency have been secured at Stevenson and Company in  Cullybackey. The Minister is to be commended for her work on that and, on  behalf of the companies involved, I thank her for her help. That is a good news  story. However, the future has a degree of uncertainty.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We have a four-party mandatory coalition, and sometimes  there is a blame game in the House about who is responsible for certain issues.  What are the Executive doing to help the economy as we face the days of  challenge and the forecast downturn that the Minister mentioned?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: I join the Member in congratulating Dunbia on its takeover of  the Stevenson and Company plant, which is tremendously good news, particularly  for the pork processing industry.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Sometimes it is forgotten that, at a time when the economic  downturn was not foreseen as being so dramatic, the Executive put business at  the centre of their Programme for Government. We did that because we believed  that Northern Ireland  required a strong business community at its heart to prosper. From the  beginning, the Executive recognised that that was the way to go. My friend and  colleague the First Minister put a cap on industrial rates when he was Minister  of Finance and Personnel; the current Minister of Finance and Personnel  announced a small-business rates-relief scheme; the streamlined planning  process has worked effectively in the north-west and is being rolled out  throughout Northern Ireland by the Minister of the Environment; and the new  planning policy statement (PPS) 21 has replaced PPS 14, which helps the  construction industry.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My local divisional planning officer told me that 35% of  the applications that were being held under PPS 14 have been approved, which is  something that SDLP Members may want to take cognisance of when talking about  the new PPS 21. The Minister of the Environment is also taking planning reform  measures to the Executive, which we look forward to endorsing.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My Department has been examining practical measures to  help: we funded face-to-face advice with the citizens advice bureaux for people  who find themselves with multiple debts; we have worked with Invest NI through  the credit-crunch seminars and the &pound;5 million that was invested in the  accelerated support fund; and we recently announced the Kelvin transatlantic  telecommunications link, which is very good news that should not be  underestimated. Therefore, we are doing a lot to help businesses. I recognise  that businesses are struggling, but we are doing our best to help and will  continue to do so.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  Will the Minister consider recommending to the Executive that they consider a  similar scheme to that recently announced by Gordon Brown, in which businesses  are given a financial incentive to employ people who have been unemployed for  six months or more?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: That is a matter for the Minister for Employment and Learning.  He briefed the Executive on Thursday and said that measures are already in  place. In fact, the Prime Minister had been following some of the things that  were going on in that Minister&rsquo;s Department. Therefore, if the Member addresses  that issue directly to the Minister, he will be able to provide her with more  details about what is happening.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McClarty</strong>:  The Minister will be well aware of the number of job losses that have been  announced recently, none more so than in my constituency in recent weeks. There  is a real fear in the community that the situation will turn into a job-loss  tsunami. No one but a fool would hold the Minister responsible for those job  losses, because they are well outside her control. However, will the Minister  give us her best guess as to the number of job losses there could be before we  begin to experience an economic upturn?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: As I said in my substantive reply, the economic forecast in  November 2008 indicated that there would be 12,000 job losses this year.  However, I also said that economic forecasting is difficult in these dynamic  conditions &mdash; one has only to listen to the differences of opinion from the  economic commentators. For example, officials from the Ulster Bank are saying  very negative things about our economy, but officials from the Northern Bank,  Mike Smyth from the University of Ulster, and Alan Bridle just today, have been  saying more positive things about it. Therefore, opinions differ, depending on  the commentator. However, as Minister, it is difficult for me to try to take  the evidence base and make a best guess about where we are going, as, I am  sorry to say, the situation changes from week to week. That is why we are  looking to the medium-to-longer term and trying to deal with the short term in  the most effective way possible.</p>

	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">6. <strong>Ms Lo </strong>asked  the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment what plans she has to help  small businesses in the current global economic downturn.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name= AQO1831/09>(AQO 1831/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: With your permission, Mr Speaker, I will answer questions 5 and  6 together. In my capacity as chairperson of the Economic Development Forum  (EDF), I have established a subgroup to consider what additional measures could  be implemented to help businesses through the economic downturn. The subgroup  will present its findings to the EDF meeting on 12 February.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Invest Northern    Ireland has also developed a programme of  initiatives designed to enable its clients to tackle the impact of a sustained  economic downturn. At the end of September 2008, I launched Invest Northern Ireland&rsquo;s &pound;5  million accelerated-support fund, which can make fast-track advice and  assistance available to client companies to help them to respond to the effects  of the downturn.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Since the end of September 2008, we have held seven seminars  on the theme of navigating through challenging times, and they have attracted  more than 500 attendees and 440 client companies. Feedback to date has been  extremely positive, and a further event is scheduled for the end of this month.  As a follow-up to that, Invest NI is offering up to five days of free  consultancy support on a range of key business areas, and, to date, 88% of  clients have expressed an interest in that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">For businesses that are not Invest NI clients, a &ldquo;Beat the  credit crunch&rdquo; section has been added to the website nibusinessinfo.co.uk. That  provides practical tools and guides on key business activities such as managing  finances and securing extra sales. In partnership with Enterprise Northern Ireland,  district councils and the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, we  have also developed a further programme of business information seminars,  specifically focused on non-Invest NI clients.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Simpson</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her reply. Further to that question, will the Minister  outline what work is being done with key enterprise partners to assist the  wider business community?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: First, I commend the Member and his colleagues on Craigavon  Borough Council for taking the initiative in relation to the credit crunch.  That is very much to be welcomed, and it shows that local government has a  strong role to play in trying to help the community through these difficult  times. As I have indicated, Invest NI has brought together other economic  development partners to launch a series of seminars on the theme of navigating  through challenging times. As I said, the first seminar was held in Omagh and  they are now being rolled out throughout the country.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Invest NI believes that working in partnership will bring  us the most benefit. Working with organisations such as the Northern Ireland  Chamber of Commerce and Industry will allow us to access those companies that,  otherwise, we would not have been able to reach. I welcome the  partnership-working that is occurring, and I hope that it is a template for the  future.</p>

	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: I  thank the Minister for her comprehensive answer. I am pleased to learn about  the different initiatives to help our business community. What representations  has she made to the banks about loans to small businesses in Northern Ireland?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment</strong>: The Member may not be aware that I  recently attended a meeting of the First Minister, the deputy First Minister,  the Minister of Finance and Personnel and representatives from the four main  banks, at which issues concerning, in my particular case, those businesses that  were finding it difficult to gain access to credit were raised.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">One of the difficulties for small businesses in Northern Ireland  is that they cannot obtain the credit that they need, and they have cash-flow  difficulties. I raised those issues with the banks&rsquo; representatives directly.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member will know that the Secretary of State for  Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform has  announced various measures, one of which is the enterprise finance-guarantee  scheme, which will be available in Northern   Ireland, as well as in the rest of the UK. That scheme  represents a widening of the small-firms loan-guarantee scheme, which was  already in place in Northern    Ireland. Unfortunately, however, take-up of  that scheme was not as wide as it was on the mainland. We were concerned about  that, but it is to be hoped that the widening of the criteria, by way of the  enterprise finance-guarantee scheme, will allow others to take the scheme up in  a way in which they were unable to in the past.</p>
