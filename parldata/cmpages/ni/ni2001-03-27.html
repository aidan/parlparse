                </font></b><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr Speaker. As
                Chairperson of the Agriculture and Rural Development Committee,
                I want to put a question on record and ask about the matter
                which has now taken place at Westminster. It is thought that the
                Government have been acting illegally in killing healthy
                animals. If this is so, will it hinder the immediate payment of
                compensation for those animals? Will it lead to a blockage in
                the courts, with arguments as to whether the farmers wanted
                this, or can the matter be resolved in such a way that no
                compensation hold-ups will take place? This is a matter which
                must be put on record. I had a brief word with the Minister and
                informed her that I was doing this.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some of the matters to which the Member
                refers are not matters of order, but there is a matter of order
                in this. The Minister made remarks yesterday about some
                activities that will be taking place, and, to some extent, the
                Member’s question is whether those will be covered by legal
                authority.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second question is whether, if further
                legal authority is needed, it can be provided by this House or
                has to be provided by Westminster. I do not know the answer to
                his question on either front — either whether the statement
                that the Minister made yesterday is covered by legal authority
                or, if not, whether legal authority can be provided by early
                legislation in the Assembly or will require early legislation in
                another place. I shall have to make enquiries and take advice,
                and I will respond to the Member when the advice is clear.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have received notice from the Minister of
                Finance and Personnel that he wishes to make a statement on
                current issues relating to EU structural funds.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Finance and Personnel (Mr
                Durkan):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to make a statement about some
                important developments on the European structural funds. In this
                Building last Thursday, we were able to mark, with the European
                Commission and the Irish Government, the completion of the
                negotiations with the Commission on the new round of structural
                funds. On that occasion, the two member states and Commissioner
                Barnier formally recorded their agreements to the new Peace II
                programme and to the Northern Ireland Programme for Building
                Sustainable Prosperity. This was an important stage in a long
                and complex process, which began with the Good Friday Agreement.
                Following that agreement, the First Minister and the Deputy
                First Minister set out to ensure that the European Union
                acknowledged and gave practical support to the efforts to build
                a lasting peace in Ireland. In that endeavour they were given
                strong support and practical help from the two Governments, MEPs
                and many others.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The two programmes signed last week are the
                Programme for Building Sustainable Prosperity and Peace II. They
                both come under the umbrella of the community support framework,
                which was agreed by the Commission in December. Now that the
                programmes have been agreed, the next stage is the production of
                programme complements which will set out details of the types of
                projects that will be supported. The programme complements will
                be approved by the monitoring committees.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first of the operational programmes,
                formally known as the transitional Objective 1 programme, will
                be worth £862 million, including the match funding. It will
                focus on the key areas of economic growth and renewal,
                employment and social inclusion, and the environment and rural
                society.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Peace II programme, which is worth £366
                million — again including the match funding — will have the
                twin objectives of addressing the legacy of the conflict and
                taking the opportunities arising from peace.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The possibility of continuing support and
                assistance from the European Union was signalled through the
                conclusions of the European Council meetings at Cardiff and
                Vienna during 1998. At Berlin in March 1999, in the culmination
                of the spending settlement for the entire European budget for
                the forthcoming seven years, it was decided that Northern
                Ireland would receive support as an Objective 1 region in
                transition. In addition, Northern Ireland was given a unique and
                distinctive privilege in the form of a further special package
                of funding to continue and develop the work begun under the
                first EU Special Support Programme for Peace and Reconciliation
                in Northern Ireland and the border counties of Ireland. This was
                secured through the determined efforts of the First Minister and
                the Deputy First Minister in conjunction with the two
                Governments and supported by MEPs and many others. Therefore
                even the process of securing the new round of funding involved
                working together in Northern Ireland and on a North/South and
                East/West basis.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In their negotiations with the Commission and
                the Presidency in Brussels and Bonn, the First Minister and the
                Deputy First Minister sought assistance with a unique
                transition. The strong support from the European Union for the
                process and the Good Friday Agreement has been essential and
                unique. It allows us to see our place in the future European
                Union. David Trimble and Séamus Mallon argued that the context
                called for a new peace programme with some differences from the
                previous programme. This has been confirmed in the operational
                programmes that were agreed last week.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The strategic aim of the new Peace II
                programme is to reinforce progress towards a peaceful and stable
                society and to promote reconciliation. It will do that by
                promoting and supporting economic and social development with a
                special focus on those groups, sectors and areas that have been
                most affected by the conflict in our society. The aim of the new
                Programme for Building Sustainable Prosperity is to help to
                create the conditions for sustainable prosperity in a modern,
                competitive economy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since the Berlin Council we have made a good
                beginning on the transition. We can already point to the
                creation and continuation of the institutions and to the
                difference that the Executive are making through the ambitions
                in the Programme for Government. The new structural funds
                operational programmes that were agreed last week should be seen
                in that context.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Last February, when the Executive addressed
                the approach to Peace II, we committed ourselves to ensuring
                that the new programme would deliver progress on social
                inclusion — and with particular respect to the needs of
                children, women and young people — on North/South co-operation
                and, most important of all, on the maintenance and development
                of the local delivery mechanisms which were a unique and
                successful innovation under Peace I.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These commitments clearly can, and should,
                guide the use of this programme, and which is relevant to our
                wider Programme for Government. The Executive returned to those
                issues in detail in July and December 2000 when the approach to
                the Peace II operational programme and the transitional
                Objective 1 programme was confirmed. The direction of the new
                programmes is therefore based on careful consideration and
                discussion by the Executive.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In putting in place arrangements for the
                management and delivery of the new programmes we have also
                sought to ensure that we have built on the lessons that we
                learned from the last round of EU structural funds support. New
                monitoring committees have been appointed for each operational
                programme and for the community support framework. The
                membership of those committees reflects proposals drawn up by
                the social and economic partners in consultation with my
                Department and agreed by the Executive. The Executive have also
                retained and built on the unique combination and diversity of
                organisations involved in planning and managing the delivery of
                the new structural funds programmes, particularly Peace II.
                Thus, the combination of local partnerships operating at
                district council level, intermediary funding bodies and
                Government Departments, that have been used for Peace I, has
                been retained in the new peace programme. Additional roles have
                been specified for the special EU programmes body, in line with
                its statutory responsibilities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In implementing the new programme for
                building sustainable prosperity we will also seek to work in
                close partnership with local communities, business, trade
                unions, the voluntary and community sectors and our universities
                and colleges to help ensure that the activities funded are used
                to best effect.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In this context, I want to address directly
                the concern that, in some sense, the Peace II programme
                represents a step away from the successful approach to local
                delivery taken under Peace I. On the contrary, Peace II
                represents an extension and development of important steps we
                took as a community with Peace I. Within the context of the new
                institutions the partnership approach can — and, I believe,
                will — be extended with new dimensions to gain increasing
                influence on the way in which we do business. They will have a
                vision and impact that will last well beyond the horizons of the
                Peace II programme.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Peace I arrived during direct rule, and the
                opportunities for influencing the business of Government by
                local politicians, social partners or district councils were
                minimal. In the context of the new institutions, I see an
                opportunity for the partnership process to be widened and
                deepened at both regional and local level. That is the Executive’s
                vision for this aspect of the Peace II programme. Throughout
                this process we have sought to work with the European Commission
                and many in the community who have displayed an unfailing
                commitment to the exploration of the opportunities that European
                funding gives.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We were consistently determined to ensure
                that the principles of partnership and local delivery were
                developed. We do not want the partnership approach to be
                confined to European funding, nor do we want it to wither away
                when that source of income has ceased.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall now outline how we envisage the
                development of this programme at local and regional level. The
                new round of funding provides an opportunity to radically extend
                the role and influence of the partnership approach. At local
                level, the Executive have agreed that the new local strategy
                partnerships, which will take forward priority 3 of the Peace II
                programme, will be given the opportunity to develop a strategic
                approach at local level. Those local strategy partnerships will
                be encouraged to develop a wider perspective, including
                increased interaction with the regional Administration and
                between district council areas.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">10.45 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They will work with the Special EU Programmes
                Body on North/South co-operation. As set out in the operational
                programme, their remit includes new dimensions of work on the
                social economy and human resource development which represent a
                marked advance and a new opportunity for development of social
                cohesion at local level.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The new local partnerships being created for
                the new Peace&nbsp;II programme both acknowledge what has been
                achieved in the past and reflect what the Executive want to see
                achieved for the future. I am on record on several occasions as
                making it clear that I do not see the principles of local
                partnerships and partnership working as something that we can
                apply only to European funding and then throw away once that
                funding ends. Instead, I want to see partnership work becoming
                an integral part of how we, as a devolved Administration, ensure
                that local community voices are heard and influence priorities
                for spending at local level — not just from European funds but
                from other sources of public, and indeed private, finance.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The whole purpose of our approach is to
                increase the scope and significance of decision-making at local
                level. The principles underlying this new approach to
                partnership work have also been strongly endorsed by the
                European Commission during our negotiations on the new Peace
                programme. Both we and the Commission want to see a strong
                &quot;bottom-up&quot; approach to partnership work under
                Peace&nbsp;II, which will ensure that the final decisions on
                local priorities are taken by local communities operating at
                local level. However, to achieve that we must make some key
                changes to how the partnership model developed under
                Peace&nbsp;I operates under the new Peace&nbsp;II programme and
                beyond.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, we must ensure that district councils
                become involved in the operation of the local partnership model,
                not just through the participation of individual district
                councillors, but through the engagement of the district councils
                at a corporate level in the processes of partnership work, and
                particularly in supporting the preparation and agreement of the
                locally based strategies that will underpin the work of the new
                partnerships. The input of district councils will be
                particularly important, especially given their wider
                responsibilities — for example, for local economic development
                under the transitional Objective&nbsp;I programme.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, we must ensure that statutory
                agencies operating at local level become actively involved in
                partnership work — not in a controlling way, but in a way that
                will ensure that the broader strategic direction of the
                Department and its agencies take full account of the view and
                priorities of local communities operating at local level.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Neither of those changes involves a
                diminution of the influence of the community at local level. On
                the contrary, they will provide for that influence to be made
                more effective through a stronger partnership model. Some are
                concerned that by having a different structure from those which
                have gone before, the new partnerships will lose some of their
                strength. I do not believe this to be the case. The approach
                that we are taking includes an emphasis on reaching agreement on
                the details of arrangements for local partnerships at local
                level. We have agreed in the Peace&nbsp;II operational programme
                that there should be an equal partnership on a fifty-fifty basis
                between two strands — on one hand, government in the wider
                sense, and on the other, the social partners, the business
                sector, the trade unions, the voluntary and community sector and
                representatives of agriculture and rural society.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr Ian Paisley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you have that balance, is it not the case
                that the statutory bodies and those associated with them on the
                voluntary side will put the elected members of the councils into
                a minority position for all time?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will cover that and explain it fully during
                the rest of my remarks. When I spoke of a fifty-fifty balance, I
                referred clearly to government in the wider sense. That will be
                local government and central Government, or the agencies of
                central Government as they operate at local level.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The balance between them will be determined
                locally. Under the existing partnership model it is not the case
                that local councils form a majority of membership. Those
                proposals have been developed through working group
                arrangements.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The proposals for the various stages of
                developing the new local partnership model have been developed
                in consultation with representatives from local councils,
                existing district partnerships, intermediary funding bodies et
                cetera. Therefore, council numbers for the Government side are
                to be agreed locally between local government and the statutory
                agencies. That is welcomed by many in local government, because
                they believe it puts them in a stronger position to co-ordinate
                and liaise with the statutory agencies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to emphasise that I fully understand
                the concerns expressed by many in the voluntary sector about
                aspects of that approach. Under the Executive’s proposed
                approach, the scope for the voluntary and community sector, and
                for the other social partners, to influence what is evolving is
                strengthened, because the terms of reference for local strategy
                partnerships are wider. Therefore, through those partnerships,
                those participating from the social partner side will have
                important influence not only on the work on priority 3 by each
                local strategy partnership but also on the wider policy
                environment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am aware that the fifty-fifty arrangement
                has been taken to imply that each pillar of the social partners
                will have 12.5% of the membership. <i>[Interruption]</p>
                </i><b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order. It is not appropriate to get into the
                habit of intervening when Ministers are making statements. There
                will be an opportunity for questions afterwards. If Members wish
                to ask questions on the ministerial statement, they should
                advise me and I will try to accommodate them. I will note the
                Member’s name.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to make it clear that we have been at
                pains to note that membership should be decided at local level
                rather than be imposed. One size does not fit all. Just as local
                agreement will be needed on the composition of the Government
                strand of the partnership, I am confident that local agreement
                can be reached by the social partners on the composition of
                their strand. If, working on further guidelines, the social
                partners can agree on a particular formula to be applied at
                local level, we shall be happy to accommodate such agreement.
                That could then be reflected in the final guidelines for the
                local strategy partnerships and incorporated in the programme
                complement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Turning to the relationship between the local
                and regional dimensions of partnership, again I emphasise that
                the context is different. At the beginning of Peace I, regional
                partnership was non-existent. I pay tribute to the Northern
                Ireland Partnership Board, which came together at that time and
                played a crucial role in establishing and developing the
                district partnerships and in overseeing the unique process that
                that made possible.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We still need the commitment, expertise and
                enthusiasm of people from many sectors to move forward. However,
                many things are different now. The Assembly and the Executive
                are in place together with the North/South institutions and the
                Special EU Programmes Body. By placing co-operation on European
                matters right at the heart of the agreement’s institutions, we
                are emphasising how significant those issues are for us.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Consistent with the new structural funds
                regulations, the Executive have decided that the new regional
                partnership board should have a major role in encouraging the
                ongoing development of effective partnership working at local
                level. At regional level, its key contribution will be to
                support the development of strategies and action plans that work
                effectively with other sectors. Those include the Departments,
                other statutory agencies and the private, voluntary and
                community sectors.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive have decided that a new
                regional partnership board should be established not only to
                build on the good work of the Northern Ireland partnership board
                but also to take it wider and deeper. Just as the local strategy
                partnerships can work on a wider canvas and influence the
                planning of other activities in their areas, so the regional
                partnership board will have a wide remit to promote partnership
                working. It will work with local strategy partnerships to ensure
                that this development happens as effectively and as clearly as
                possible and to ensure that that way of working can be sustained
                beyond the period of Peace II and become a permanent strength of
                our Administration.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the scope of partnership working at
                regional and local level is now intended to be wider, it was
                clearly less appropriate for the interface between the
                partnerships and the regional administration to be located in
                any one Department. Since the chairperson for this new
                partnership board is from the Office of the First Minister and
                the Deputy First Minister, the board is at the heart of the new
                institutions. It is also intended that membership of the new
                regional partnership board will strongly reflect the
                perspective, experience and insight of the social partners
                engaged in the local strategy partnerships.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Special EU Programmes Body, which is the
                managing authority for Peace II, will be the secretariat to the
                new Northern Ireland regional partnership board. It will benefit
                from close working relationships with the local strategy
                partnerships in its wider responsibilities for other aspects of
                EU programmes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The preparation for the new round of funding
                has been a long process for all concerned. After the package of
                support was agreed at the Berlin Council in March 1999, the
                first main stage was the preparation of the structural funds
                plan, which was first submitted in November 1999 just before
                devolution took effect. Following consideration of the key
                issues by the Executive in February 2000, negotiations on the
                community support framework (CSF) began last March, and the CSF
                was approved by the European Commission in December. Those were
                all necessary stages in the process, and similar steps have been
                required in respect of structural funds assistance in all member
                states.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now that agreement has been reached on the
                operational programmes, we can look forward to completing the
                process and ensuring that the new programmes take effect as soon
                as possible. I have provided a timetable, along with Members’
                copies of this statement, to show what will happen next. Under
                the EU Regulations, the programme complements must be approved
                by the monitoring committees within three months of the approval
                of the operational programmes, and we will seek to complete that
                stage by the end of May. Those will include more detail on the
                measures making up the programmes and set out more fully the
                criteria for applications. When the programme complements have
                been approved, the way will be clear for applications to be
                invited, so that the first calls for projects can go out in
                June. The first payments from the new programmes will be
                available from September.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That timetable for the process sets the
                context within which the issue of gap funding has arisen. It
                should be clear to all by now from what I have been saying that
                the Executive are determined that there should be continuity and
                development between the Peace I programme and the Peace II
                programme. These are important changes, designed to ensure that
                the resources secure sustainable development and important
                emphases on aspects of economic development, which will make use
                of the opportunities provided by the new context of peace.
                However, the fundamental purposes of promoting peace and
                reconciliation and the inclusive and bottom-up nature of the
                programme remain very important. Sustaining the work that has
                gone before under Peace I is important. It is not the case that
                the peace programmes are about keeping organisations in business
                or simply maintaining employment. The touchstone has always been
                the contribution that the organisations and the projects could
                make to the objectives of the programme.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the 2000-01 financial year the
                Executive provided £9 million of gap funding — half for the
                peace programmes, and half for the mainstream programmes. In my
                statement to the Assembly on the follow-up to the December
                monitoring round, I announced a new approach to gap funding to
                apply for 2001-02. I want to update the Assembly on developments
                on that front.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.00 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since 12 February the Department of Finance
                and Personnel has discussed the issue fully with other
                Departments to ensure that the approach is known and understood.
                I have also written to the monitoring committees and others
                concerned to emphasise the Executive’s commitment to making
                this situation work.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Advertisements have been placed in the press
                seeking applications from eligible projects. Bids have been
                sought, and, consistent with the timetable that I have just
                explained, this scheme can cover the period up to October 2001,
                by which time the new programme will be fully on stream.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The approach to gap funding is about making
                sure that those who have been fulfilling the criteria of the
                Peace I programme — and who are likely to fulfil the criteria
                of the Peace II programme — will remain in place, fulfilling
                their objectives and the objectives of the programme without a
                loss of continuity.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The unique contribution of the European Union
                to supporting the agreement is something we should celebrate and
                acknowledge fully at every stage. We thanked Commissioner
                Barnier last week for that unique and ongoing commitment, which
                is helping to ensure the continuity of peace and reconciliation
                funding. It is also helping us to adopt new approaches in our
                region and lift our eyes beyond our narrow horizons. It is true
                to say that the assistance of the European Union with the
                process of peace and reconciliation has been vital and
                effective. Much credit is due to all who sought and obtained the
                new round of funding, including the MEPs, the two Governments
                and especially the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We now have a clearer basis on which to move
                these new programmes forward. With the negotiations with the
                Commission complete, the responsibility now lies entirely with
                the region to get on and complete the programme complements and
                to ensure that the call for applications goes out as soon as
                possible so that the benefits can begin to flow without delay.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I ask all concerned to push these objectives
                and to unite in working with the Executive, the local councils
                and social partners in order to achieve important collective
                objectives. This is a tremendous opportunity for us all. It also
                poses significant but welcome challenges.</p>

                Personnel and to thank the Minister for his statement, which is
                most welcome. A large gap is appearing between Peace I and Peace
                II, which has been discussed many times here, and that gap is
                increasing, because the new moneys will not be in place until
                September of this year at the earliest. The Committee will be
                meeting with departmental officials today to get further
                briefing on this matter. Our role will be to monitor what is
                happening in the structural funds.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister spoke of the Northern Ireland
                Regional Partnership Board and district partnerships. I want an
                assurance, as a member of a district partnership and of a
                district council, that that is not just an extension of the
                partnership board. I know that in a number of councils there
                have been difficulties identifying the roles of the partnership
                board and the district council. In my area that was not a
                problem, and we were able to put together all the political
                parties and the district sectors of the partnership board, but I
                want the Minister to ensure that statutory agencies coming to
                the partnership board will be actively involved in promotion.
                The Minister should ensure that the two sectors operate on a
                fifty-fifty basis. The statutory agencies should come to the
                partnership board with money — not just to block and control
                and not simply knocking back and ensuring mainstreaming.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Member for his points and, in
                particular, for the long-standing and helpful interest that the
                Committee for Finance and Personnel has had in the structural
                funds and in the peace programme. Over the present financial
                year we have addressed the concerns about gap funding. We have
                introduced new arrangements for interim funding for the next
                financial year so that we can actually make progress towards
                Peace II. Obviously, last week’s announcements make that all
                the more significant and provide an even more encouraging
                backdrop for all concerned.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I recognise Mr Molloy’s point that there
                has been an uneven relationship between councils and their local
                district partnerships. That was partly because membership of the
                partnership boards was based on individual councillors, and
                boards depended on the quality of an individual’s performance
                more than that of councils at corporate level. We want to
                improve that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It must be remembered that it is not just
                that new partnerships will have a say in managing Priority 3 and
                the funding for that. The strategic thinking of the Departments
                will inform and influence the work of local councils, in their
                wider areas of responsibilities, and that of other statutory
                agencies and Departments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Representatives of statutory agencies
                participated in partnerships in the last programme and feedback
                from various sources indicates that there were uneven levels of
                involvement and interest. One of the things that we have been
                concerned about in going for the fifty-fifty option is that we
                did not want to allocate a fixed proportion to the statutory
                agencies. We felt that that would just invite the danger that
                they would simply attend in the numbers allocated to them. We
                believe that they need, through negotiations with local
                government, to earn their places in the partnerships. We felt
                that they would, by participating on an agreed basis, show much
                greater commitment, and that local government would be put in a
                much stronger position by virtue of liaising at that level.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We want to make everyone’s involvement in
                the partnership boards more meaningful; not to give local
                government or the statutory agencies of regional government more
                control. We want to make them more amenable to the whole
                partnership ethos. It will mean that they can reflect the
                important and positive influences that the perspectives of the
                other social partners on the partnership boards can bring.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I think that it was an American politician
                some decades ago who said that the best form of social welfare
                programme is a well paid job. Can the Minister inform us whether
                a similar philosophy underpins the general approach to the use
                of these European moneys?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will he also confirm that since the
                transition moneys are, by definition, something of a final bite
                of the cherry that they will be soundly invested to promote the
                economic competitiveness and growth that will, in future,
                generate sustainable funding?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I ask that question because there is a
                perception that at least some of the previous structural funds
                in the 1980s and 1990s were, in effect, deadweight spending —
                that is, money that was given to already profitable private
                companies for investments that they would have found profitable
                to pursue anyway.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are dealing with two programmes. The
                programme formerly known as the Transitional Objective I
                Programme is now called the Northern Ireland Programme for
                Building Sustainable Prosperity. That programme is what we are
                getting in order to compensate for the fact that we no longer
                qualify for Objective I status. It is a special transitional
                measure. We must use the money well, and we are trying to use it
                for sustainable economic development. The money for the
                programme is not additional money, unlike that for the Peace
                Programme. Nevertheless, it does not relieve us of any of our
                obligations to make sure that we spend the money judiciously and
                not on investments that would have been taking place in any
                event.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We want to spend the money in a way that
                makes the biggest and most positive difference possible,
                particularly given the number of serious structural issues that
                we face as a region. We face many challenges in improving our
                competitiveness. That is the focus of that particular programme.
                There will be an improved economic focus on the peace programme
                and no compromise on the important emphasis that the programme
                must have on social inclusion. Nor will the integrity of the
                programme as one that is geared towards peace and reconciliation
                be undermined.</p>

                Does the Minister agree that there has been rumour and
                counter-rumour that is not in the spirit of peace and
                reconciliation?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am concerned that there has been rumour and
                counter-rumour, but it is not my place to address that here. I
                have been perturbed by some of the feedback, but throughout the
                process I have been determined to ensure that the social
                partners and the Northern Ireland Partnership Board were fully
                involved in the transition from Peace I to Peace II.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I acted to ensure that the new monitoring
                committees were representative of the social partnerships in a
                new way. The Northern Ireland Partnership Board, the district
                partnerships and the district councils were fully involved, in
                the autumn, in the working groups that decided on the agreed way
                ahead on local strategy partnerships. The group’s proposals
                were adopted by the interim community support framework (CSF)
                monitoring committee and then approved by the Executive in
                December.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I met the Northern Ireland Partnership Board
                in mid January, and that was followed by the colloquy that I
                convened at Ballymena on 31 January. A full explanation of the
                proposed way ahead was given at that meeting, which was attended
                by representatives from all of the district councils, district
                partnerships, intermediary funding bodies and Departments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The secretariat of the NIPB has been
                represented at the meetings of two groups. One is the department
                that is concerned with the transition at regional level and the
                other is the group that is concerned with the preparation of
                draft guidelines for local strategy partnerships led by the
                Special EU Programmes Body. The secretariat of the NIPB is
                responsible for keeping that board informed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There has been some discussion with the
                Department for Social Development, and I met the Minister for
                that Department to hear his views and concerns about some of the
                issues. It has been, and it remains, my intention to ensure a
                smooth transition from Peace I to Peace II at local and regional
                level. I shall be doing that in all good faith and in terms that
                are consistent with the proper and right decisions that have
                been taken by the Executive Committee.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to ask some very pointed questions,
                and I am not dealing with rumour. The Minister is well aware
                that I have been keeping a close eye on the process. At every
                partnership meeting that I have attended I have pointed out the
                unfair allocation of money that has been given to one side of
                the community. The Unionist community has been held to ransom.
                For example, at Castlereagh, there was no money for the victims
                of the La Mon bombing, but there was money for Irish dancing. I
                have been involved in this since the beginning, and Jacques
                Delors made me a promise that the money would be for victims.
                Unionist victims have not had that money.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.15 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not alone in that; I have raised the
                matter at one meeting after another. The Minister had much to
                say about the uneven allocation of places. What will he do about
                the uneven allocation of money? Why did he not move on the
                ring-fencing of grants so that each community would get a fair
                allocation? Will he do that? What will he do about the two
                members who were appointed by each of the MEPs to the regional
                board? So far, I have had no communication from him about that
                matter. There is an imbalance that must be faced and remedied. I
                find it amazing that the two Ministers who are responsible for
                that, Minister Haughey and Minister Nesbitt, are not even in
                their places today, and they are the people who are looking
                after the appointments to those boards.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Paisley has asked several questions, and I
                think that that was as close to being a speech as any other
                question asked here this morning.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will mainly address the Peace II issues.
                There is a specific indicative Peace II allocation, at this
                stage, of £6.7 million for victims. The Executive agreed that
                in February 2000. That money will be distributed using objective
                criteria, and the details of the criteria and precise measures
                will be developed at the programme complement stage that we are
                now entering.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In our work with the interim community
                support framework monitoring committee on our proposals for the
                CSF and the other programmes, we developed and agreed several
                horizontal principles. Those proposals addressed equality and
                balance considerations. I made it clear in our work with the
                committee that those principles partly reflected the need that
                was identified following Peace I to overcome the obstacles that
                existed, for whatever reason, and ensure that there was a better
                balance in the applications for the funds and their
                distribution. We agreed to take that forward.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I acknowledge the role of the MEPs, not just
                in making helpful interventions and showing interest in the
                current round of funding that we are talking about, but also in
                the Peace I programme. We are beginning a new programme. We are
                in a new context with new arrangements. Therefore not all of the
                arrangements for Peace I will be the same for Peace II. The role
                of the regional partnership board will be different, and the two
                junior Ministers at the Office of the First Minister and the
                Deputy First Minister will be chairing it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am addressing the issues in these
                programmes that are part of my responsibility as Minister of
                Finance and Personnel. I would again point out that we are going
                to finalise the programme complements. There will be a period of
                consultation, and the monitoring committees must agree the
                complements. Dr Paisley says that he has not heard from me on
                this; I have written to the MEPs seeking a meeting with them at
                this significant stage in the process.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Hope springs eternal, does it not? I welcome
                the Minister’s statement. It is fair to say that this is a
                good news day. A package of £1·23 billion cannot be sneezed
                at, nor should it be sneezed at by anyone.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How can the Minister assure the House that
                sustainability will be seen to be the key? The reference to gap
                funding in the previous round is a clear demonstration that
                sustainability was not really taken seriously. In the immortal
                words of the Rolling Stones, &quot;This will be the last
                time&quot;. Therefore it is essential that sustainability be the
                key and that that message be really drummed home.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, can the Minister further assure the
                House that proper and verifiable appraisals will be carried out
                on all the projects, thus ensuring that there will be a clear
                demonstration that the bad habits that crept in under previous
                rounds have been eradicated?</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the change of Rolling Stones tune
                from Mr Close. Normally I hear &quot;I can’t get no
                satisfaction&quot; in the Chamber. I am glad that he welcomes
                the stage we are at with these programmes, but we have still
                more work to do. He rightly identifies the important principle
                of sustainability. It is important not just for us but also for
                the European Commission. Essentially, part of the contract in
                Peace I was meant to be sustainability, and people receiving
                funding under Peace I were meant to make arrangements to ensure
                the sustainability of their projects and to provide exit
                strategies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, the difficulties that we are
                witnessing show that that has not happened. In fairness, all the
                blame cannot be laid at the doors of the individual projects.
                One of the things that we must do in the next round is to not
                just address the issue of sustainability as a hard economic
                test, the burden of which falls solely on each individual
                project, but also develop a wider framework for sustainability.
                We must see how we can ensure the sustainability of the sort of
                programmes, models, measures and mechanisms that have been
                developed under Peace I and that we want to see developed under
                Peace II. It is in the wider context of ensuring the
                sustainability of that sort of approach that organisations will
                find themselves even better equipped and even better motivated
                to concentrate on maximising their own specific grounds for
                sustainability.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the statement. Can the Minister
                elaborate on the role of the intermediary funding bodies? What
                percentage of the peace funds will be channelled through them,
                and how will they be chosen?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The intermediate funding bodies are being
                chosen on the basis of competitive tender in this round. That
                was agreed by the Executive. I know that some of the existing
                bodies were disappointed by that decision, but we believed that
                it was important, given that this is a new programme. We also
                believe that it is important given the European Commission’s
                requirements and our own public procurement requirements,
                because in a sense the work of these bodies really is an
                important contract.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are looking at an indicative distribution
                of 34% of the programme being managed by intermediary funding
                bodies.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Morrice:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I too rise to welcome the securing of the
                European funding and to congratulate the team for the work they
                have done to get it. I also thank Europe and the European Union
                for this commitment to Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister has concentrated most of his
                efforts on changing the partnership approach. My argument is
                this: if it is not broken, why fix it? What is the Minister
                doing to keep his own house in order? He will be aware of the
                findings of the Public Accounts Committees on European funding.
                I refer to what Seamus Close called &quot;bad habits&quot; in
                Government funding.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How much money is going to be channelled
                directly through the Government? How will the Minister ensure
                that that money actually goes to peace and reconciliation and
                not to pet Government projects? How can he ensure that funding
                is not blocked? We have some projects still waiting for money to
                be channelled from certain Departments which was promised
                months, if not years, ago. How can the Minister guarantee that
                the process will flow smoothly?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Member for the welcome that she
                gave to the announcement and for her thanks to the officials
                involved, who have undertaken an enormous amount of work. It is
                appropriate that thanks are expressed here by Members. The
                European Union is also due proper recognition.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Following on from the last question about how
                much the intermediate funding bodies are going to handle, in the
                next programme, the Department will be handling, on the basis of
                the indicative allocation that we are working on, some 39% of
                the funding in the next round.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also point out, as I indicated in my
                speech, that the Executive undertook last February to monitor
                what the Departments would do about their measures on social
                inclusion, and especially the inclusion of women, children and
                young people, North/South activity, and using local delivery
                mechanisms. As I have tried to stress, we do not see the only
                funding going to and through local delivery mechanisms as being
                the funding under priority 3. We want to see that used more
                widely.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are going to manage this programme in a
                meaningful way, and we have much more robust and more meaningful
                monitoring arrangements in place for this programme than was the
                case for the last one. The monitoring committees in the last
                round did not have a clear remit. They had very big and unwieldy
                memberships. We have, with the help of the social partners,
                designed a much more streamlined and coherent role for the
                monitoring committees.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There will also be clear reportage. The
                European Parliament will require annual reportage on how we are
                managing these issues and spending the moneys. There are
                problems with completing the spend in Peace I. All the
                allocations under Peace I have been made, but not all the money
                has been drawn down. My Department, other Departments and the
                Special EU Programmes Body are working with the district
                partnerships and intermediary funding bodies, to try to ensure
                that that money is drawn down and well spent.</p>

                welcome the Minister’s statement. Many groups and

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have looked at the timetable that the
                Minister has provided. There are concerns that the bulk of the
                money will not filter down to the ground until around January
                2002. Given those concerns, does the Minister believe that the
                existing arrangements are adequate for the gap funding, given
                that he has acknowledged the valuable work of the voluntary and
                community sector? Can the Minister assure the House that that
                European Union money will be truly additional and that it will
                not be used by Departments and statutory agencies to do what
                they should be doing already?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, in the last line of paragraph 13,
                the Minister refers to the use of &quot;private finance&quot; in
                the future. Can he give more details on how he envisages that
                finance being used?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will first deal with the issue of
                additionality. Peace II moneys, as with Peace I funds, are
                additional, and we respect that fact. We have been at pains to
                ensure that the peace programmes and the programme for building
                sustainable prosperity were distinctive in this way. As a
                result, significant changes had to be made to the draft of each
                programme, precisely to ensure and underpin the necessary
                distinctiveness, which is part of the guarantee of additionality.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have now made arrangements to build on the
                £9 million of gap funding that we have allocated for the
                current financial year. That allocation of funding from the
                Executive’s budget shows that the Executive are sensitive and
                responsive to those problems. A different approach is to be
                taken in the next financial year, which will be geared towards
                facilitating the transition to Peace II, particularly in the
                context of the operational programmes. The funding to be
                available under that mechanism can last until October, and we
                expect that that money will be allocated in September, based on
                the timetable I have outlined. This progression will, of course,
                be subject to our getting the necessary agreement on the
                programme complements on time in May, but with a big effort we
                can do that. If there are any other difficulties we will simply
                need to stretch the transition funding arrangement that we are
                planning. We are, therefore, dealing with the Member’s
                concerns about gap funding.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have no plans to use private finance on
                any particular project or in any particular way. However, the
                strategic partnerships are meant to be local, which should have
                an influence and a strategic bearing on a number of issues in
                their areas — not just priority 3 — and all the social
                partners, including businesses, should be involved. Several
                measures being taken at local level already involve some private
                financial investment or activity. In the light of that, all such
                positive developments should be within the purview of those
                local partnerships.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Leslie:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister for his statement,
                although I regret that he did not see fit to mention in his
                statement the fact that the structural funds were not
                additional. Before we throw our hats in the air with joy about
                that £860 million, we should remind ourselves that the funding
                is simply a mechanism by which the European Union graciously
                allows the United Kingdom to spend its own money, albeit that
                the amount spent in Northern Ireland is higher than it would
                otherwise have been.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister referred to match funding,
                although not in quantum. In the context of his comments on
                sustainability, does he believe that when those programmes end,
                the part of the spending that was represented by match funding
                might continue to be applied to the same measures in the future?
                It could be argued that that would not be a further burden on
                public expenditure as provision for such spending is already
                there.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I regret that I was unable to cover every
                detail on match funding in the statement. I assumed that most
                people knew that Peace II money was additional while the
                transitional Objective I funding was not. There was no attempt
                to mislead by omitting to mention that fact in my statement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, match funding is obviously a
                requirement that we must meet in respect of these programmes.
                Europe requires that. If the emphasis on the programme for
                building sustainable prosperity, which Mr Leslie seems to be
                most interested in, is to underpin sustainable economic
                development, when we come to the end of it, all those measures,
                areas of activity and sectors that have been benefiting under
                that programme will still have to be taken forward, depending on
                what stage of development they are at.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We will have to take decisions at that point.
                How do we sustain that development? I do not think anybody is
                pretending that all areas of those programmes will involve a
                finite commitment, within the life of these programmes, to those
                areas. There will be ongoing commitments with consequences. That
                is one of the reasons for, when deciding what measures we are
                going to adopt or support under these programmes, having an eye
                to longer-term sustainability.</p>

                lengthy process. Although there are still a couple of months to
                go on those programmes, today’s announcement will be of
                immense significance to how we progress. I am also conscious
                that there is a challenge ahead with sustainable prosperity.
                Given that a sound energy infrastructure is vital for economic
                development, equality of opportunity and access to prosperity,
                can the Minister confirm that those programmes can be used to
                support gas pipeline development so that people from outside
                Belfast, and especially those in the greater north-west, can
                enjoy a level plain field?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A notional sum of five million euros has been
                included in the new programme for building sustainable
                prosperity precisely for energy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Once proposals for pipeline development have
                been evaluated, funding for economic growth and competitiveness
                — a priority of the programme — can be redistributed to
                allow for the implementation of gas pipeline expansions. The key
                issue is the appraisal of realistic proposals from the private
                sector.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Colleague the Minister of Enterprise,
                Trade and Investment, Sir Reg Empey, will ensure that that
                receives proper attention, not just from his Department, but
                also from the Executive, at the proper time. I also remind
                Members that in the Budget and under the Programme for
                Government, we established an Executive Programme fund, which
                includes money for infrastructure and capital renewal.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Not for the first time is the Office of the
                First Minister and the Deputy First Minister showing gross
                discourtesy to the House by not turning up this morning for
                something in which it plays such a key role. I also have to say
                to Mr Close that we are not receiving manna from heaven. Perhaps
                the people of Northern Ireland are just getting back some of the
                money they have paid in taxes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Minister accept that while he
                intends to build on the strength of partnerships, he needs to
                eradicate the weakness of partnership? I bring to his attention
                accountability, fairness and equality, which we have not had in
                the past. Millions of pounds have been squandered, yet the
                Protestant community was so discriminated against in Lisburn
                that it ground the whole partnership system to a halt. What
                steps does the Minister intend to take to ensure that that does
                not happen with the Peace II money?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have already dealt with the point about
                balance. There are horizontal principles that will apply in the
                new programmes, not least in the Peace II programme. They aim to
                respect our equality obligations fully and to ensure that there
                is an optimum balance in the use and share of those resources.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to some of the criticisms that
                have been made about some allocations, obviously a number of
                measures were taken under Peace I. It would be unfortunate if
                whatever legitimate concerns or criticisms there may be were now
                laid at the door of local partnerships. The fact is that the
                district partnerships faced an enormous task during the life of
                Peace I, not least because of the novelty and the difficult
                circumstances that there were in the early days of the
                partnership enterprise.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, important lessons have been learnt,
                including some about deficiencies in the partnerships. Those
                deficiencies were not in the commitment or the qualities of
                those involved in partnerships but were deficiencies in the
                structures. We are trying to make that good by establishing a
                new and more strategic form of partnership at the local level.
                That will serve local communities in their fullest and broadest
                sense and not just in relation to European funding and the Peace
                programme — the partnerships will go far beyond those measures
                and will outlast them. I hope that people will recognise that,
                by bringing forward these changes, we are trying to respond to
                some of the difficulties and frustrations experienced by the
                partnerships and others in the last round. We are also trying to
                improve every other measure under this programme.</p>

                intermediary funding bodies in the Peace I structure were highly
                bureaucratic and that local groups often had to apply to several
                bodies to achieve a total funding package, thus wasting time and
                effort? Will the Minister advise that there will be a reduction
                in the overall amount of money spent on administration in Peace
                II so that more money can be directed towards the groups and
                projects on the ground? Is the Minister aware of the
                inequalities of the previous systems, particularly the money
                spent by intermediary funding bodies? For example, the
                Educational Guidance Service for Adults spent a total of £4·3
                million but only £26,000 in my constituency. Will he ensure

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In acknowledging the important questions
                raised by the Member, I make the point that intermediary funding
                bodies had a range of responsibilities under Peace I. They
                managed different types of funding over a range of sectoral
                areas. It is not the case that all allocations made by
                intermediary funding bodies — which are made at a regional
                level — are subject to a detailed breakdown at local level.
                Some allocations can be represented at constituency or council
                level, but that is not always the case. It is common for
                Departments to be in a similar position. Therefore it would be
                unfair to use that test against intermediary funding bodies. We
                must remember that we are dealing with different types of
                programmes and funding.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are trying to make sure that any
                deficiencies that existed in Peace I are rectified and improved
                upon. In response to the early part of the question, we
                recognise that there were problems of &quot;cocktail&quot;
                funding for both funders and applicants. We are trying to
                streamline those matters. Part of what is being attempted with
                the new local strategy partnerships is to enable them to respond
                to the interests and ideas of different groups locally — not
                just in relation to the funding managed locally by the local
                strategy partnerships but wider EU programmes. That is why they
                will be in a strong position to work with the Special EU
                Programmes Body, which is the managing authority for the wider
                Peace programme.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We want to see a stronger network of
                information and contact, so that people will not have to make
                lots of speculative applications all over the place and so that
                they will receive better advice and direction. The Special EU
                Programmes Body is an important asset in this round of funding,
                and it rectifies a clear deficiency in the last round. The
                programmes body, particularly as the secretariat of the regional
                partnership board, will be in a strong position to work closely
                with the local strategy partnerships.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I too welcome the Minister’s statement and
                appreciate his work and that of his team. Can he outline more
                specifically how the stronger economic focus of Peace II will be
                given effect?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The stronger economic focus in Peace II is
                not there to the exclusion of the emphasis that needs to be
                there for our own purposes and, indeed, in the European
                Commission’s interests on social inclusion, nor will it in any
                way impair the quality of this programme as one that clearly has
                to be centred on peace and reconciliation. With an emphasis on
                regeneration as well as reconciliation, this programme can
                contribute to economic improvement, and those improvements will,
                in turn, underpin social inclusion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As other Members have said, sustainability
                will obviously be a fundamental principle that underlies the
                programme, and project sponsors will be required to ensure that,
                where possible, projects and actions can continue beyond the
                life of the peace programme. That is particularly relevant when
                we are talking about those measures that are in the more
                economic area.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I must point out that under priority 3 there
                are local economic initiatives that can be taken that will
                specifically come in to the social economy area, for we have
                responded to some of the concerns that were expressed about
                earlier drafts of Peace II that had local economic development
                in under that measure. That measure has, in turn, been
                transferred to the transitional Objective 1. We have, therefore,
                been able to maintain that economic focus, while at the same
                time ensuring that it does not skew against the strong social
                inclusion emphasis that has to be there.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we are serious about taking advantage of
                all the opportunities that arise from peace, and if we are
                serious about building on the successes of Peace I, we should
                want to build new ways that sustain both economic as well as
                social growth.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Hay:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to bring the Minister back to
                the issue of ring-fencing. I want to say very seriously to the
                Minister that in my constituency of Foyle, if it had not been
                for myself and others in our district partnership fighting to
                try to ring-fence some money for the Protestant community, that
                community would have lost out desperately.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no doubt that in my constituency,
                when money was ring-fenced — and not only for the Protestant
                community, for some Nationalist groups lost out as well — it
                worked. You were able to go to a community and say &quot;Here is
                your money; you come up with a project or programme to fit
                around it&quot; rather than &quot;Come up with a programme or
                project, and we might get you the money&quot;. Under Peace II,
                that is an important issue to be looked at, especially in a
                community that is coming from a very low base and one that is,
                perhaps, not as active as the Nationalist community in filling
                in application forms and going for funding. We could argue here
                all day as to why that is happening.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister has to try to build on success.
                In my community and in the Foyle constituency we all saw money

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I urge the Member to put his question to the
                Minister.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Hay:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want the Minister to take a serious look at
                ring-fencing money for communities that are coming from a very
                low base.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have another question. There are councils
                and partnerships who, for whatever reason, will find it
                difficult to form a partnership to try to draw down this money.
                If that happens and the partnership is not formed, what does the
                Minister intend to do?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member raised several points, some of
                which have been touched on by others. I refer the Member to the
                horizontal principles that are meant to govern the use of this
                funding. I also stress that we are talking about having the
                partnerships, not just as local delivery mechanisms, but as
                local decision-making mechanisms.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive are trying to ensure wider
                understanding of that point and issue. Therefore, at this stage,
                it is not for the Executive, the Department of Finance and
                Personnel or the Special EU Programmes Body to start
                ring-fencing money that might be allocated by particular
                partnerships. As the Member’s last question indicates, the
                Executive are trying to encourage people to reach the agreement
                required to create new strategic partnerships locally. Therefore
                the Executive are trying to take account of people’s needs and
                concerns and reflect those in a positive and pragmatic way
                consistent with all of the principles.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Stronger monitoring arrangements are in place
                for this programme than was the case for the last programme.
                Notwithstanding the problems that Members have legitimately
                identified, there has also been significant progress in respect
                of some of the problems associated with Peace I — not least
                through some innovative interventions and allocations by local
                partnership boards. In those cases more was done to make good
                the deficit in application of funds to particular areas and
                communities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The intermediary funding bodies have seen the
                same improvements in making progress against that problem. It
                would be wrong for the Executive to suggest that there has not
                been progress on that issue just as it would be wrong for me to
                imply that more progress is not needed or would not be welcome.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dodds:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the statement’s commitment to new
                partnership arrangements that will enhance and increase the role
                of local government and district councils. That is important
                given the democratic nature of local councils and the important
                role that elected representatives and councillors have to play.
                There is concern among others who played a significant role in
                the previous partnership arrangements at the make-up of the new
                boards. Will the Minister indicate in more detail his thinking
                on the role that those other sectors will play in the new
                partnership arrangements?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Paragraph 24 of the statement states that the
                secretariat to the new Northern Ireland regional partnership
                board is to be the Special EU Programmes Body. Will the Minister
                explain the thinking behind that? Does he accept that that will
                not be viewed by some people in Northern Ireland as a positive
                development, but could rather cause some alienation with regard
                to the inclusiveness of the arrangements?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the Minister take on board the comments
                made by my Colleagues on this side of the House about the need
                to ensure that the lack of community infrastructure and capacity
                in the Protestant and Unionist community is recognised and
                acknowledged in the new arrangements? Will the Minister ensure
                that positive steps are taken to redress the deficiencies of the
                previous arrangements?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member raised several points for which I
                thank him.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive are trying to ensure that local
                government’s role at a corporate level is bedded more strongly
                in the partnership model for the future. The Executive do not
                want local government to dominate the partnerships or displace
                the influence of any other sector. The Executive want more of
                the capacity of local and regional government through the
                statutory agencies to be brought to the table of partnership.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the fifty-fifty model, it must
                be remembered that the Executive are saying that it will be for
                local government and the statutory agencies to determine locally
                what the balance should be. Some Members have suggested that the
                Executive should opt for a model that allocates a fixed 25% to
                local government, a fixed 25% to the statutory agencies, et
                cetera. That is not the best way to go because there is a danger
                of revisiting the situation where people from the statutory
                agencies turn up only to make up the numbers, rather than
                properly working their passage and engaging in the real spirit
                of partnership. Also, I am very conscious that we are talking
                about reviews of public administration and reviews of local
                government that might well see a change in the balance between
                the functions and capacities of local government and the
                statutory agencies. That is why, in setting the partnership on a
                fifty-fifty basis, we will have a model which can develop not
                only over Peace&nbsp;II but also beyond Peace&nbsp;II. We need
                to take account of the wider factors.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the interests of other
                sectors, we have been asked to embrace the principle of social
                partnership throughout all consultations that we have engaged
                in. I have also been urged by people in working groups, by
                social partners — and this reflects the district partnership
                perspective and the local government perspective too — not to
                impose a one-size-fits-all model. In that respect it is now 50%
                participation for social partners. Some people have suggested
                that we should fix the partnership at 25% for the community and
                voluntary sector, and 25% for business, trade unions and the
                rural and agriculture sector. I have no problems if people agree
                that level locally, or if at regional level the social partners,
                in the negotiations that will take place on the programme
                complements, can agree that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It would be wrong if we imposed that model.
                Many people have told me that they believe that different levels
                can be arrived at locally. I am happy to look at building in
                threshold guarantees to particular sectors. It is something that
                I looked at but was dissuaded from because people told me to
                allow it to go forward and be negotiated. I hope that reassures
                people. Like Mr&nbsp;Dodds, many people have been in touch with
                me, and when I have explained what we are doing and why we are
                doing it, they are reassured and wonder why others have been
                telling them yarns.</p>

                motion, and it was agreed by all parties who attended the
                meeting.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Last year, as Chairman of the Agriculture and
                Rural Development Committee, I tabled a motion in the House
                seeking the Assembly’s endorsement of the Committee’s first
                major report, ‘Retailing in Northern Ireland — A fair deal
                for the farmer’. The motion was agreed without a division.
                That report was the first of a series of three to come out of
                the Committee’s inquiry into debt in the agriculture industry.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today I have tabled a similar motion, on the
                Committee’s behalf, seeking the Assembly’s endorsement of
                the final two reports and asking that the Assembly seek the
                implementation of the 15&nbsp;recommendations contained in the
                beef sector report and the nine recommendations in the pig
                industry report. I was asked if now was the appropriate time to
                introduce those reports? My answer is emphatically
                &quot;Yes&quot;. Farmers are in desperate need of some hope for
                the future. Even before the current crisis, hope was a rare
                commodity in the farming community. Some farmers are going out
                of business, and others are struggling with crippling debts. The
                recommendations in both reports offer hope for the future, but
                only if they are implemented.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I firmly believe that the Assembly’s
                endorsement of the reports and recommendations, and the momentum
                for change in those recommendations, will be too great for the
                Department and others in those industries to ignore.</p>

                labours? Not one. That is all that farmers are asking for, and
                all that my Committee is being a voice for in the House. The
                Committee has investigated those important matters and has given
                a real insight into what is happening in agriculture today.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report on the beef industry was launched
                on 15 December 2000, the report on the pig industry two months
                later. Those reports were the result of the Committee’s
                consideration of 14 long written submissions and 13 very long
                oral evidence sessions. That represents a significant body of
                evidence from all sides of the industry. The Minister must lend
                her ear to the evidence. I commend all those who took part in
                the inquiry and I commend those in the Committee who worked hard
                at their task.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee made 15 recommendations on the
                beef industry. They covered a wide range of subjects including
                EU matters, herd improvement, the creation of effective and
                efficient partnerships, opening new markets, branding, quality
                and strategic involvement of the Department of Agriculture and
                Rural Development in the industry. I only have time to
                concentrate on a few of those today.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, the Department of Agriculture and
                Rural Development’s strategic role. Based on the evidence
                before it, one of the Committee’s firm conclusions was that
                the massive superiority of the market power of both processors
                and retailers was leading to the poor returns faced by beef
                farmers. We also found that the fragmentation of beef production
                was a real obstacle to the creation of a modern responsive
                supply chain.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Therefore one of our main recommendations was
                that the Department should set a high priority on the
                transformation of beef production from a collection of
                individual farmers with no market power to a market-oriented
                organised force, able to respond with a quality product. We
                recommended that the Department of Agriculture and Rural
                Development should create and lead a task force to help that to
                happen. What is the use of having the Department of Agriculture
                and Rural Development if it is not going to help the farmers?
                What is the use of turning the Department of Agriculture and
                Rural Development into a police force to look after and monitor
                farmers, rather than helping them to win markets?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Within the existing supply chain, Northern
                Irish beef is being processed and sold profitably but without an
                acceptable return for the producers. They are the Cinderellas of
                the high business strategy employed by large companies in our
                Province today. Those large companies are not going bankrupt,
                but the farmers are. The directors of those companies are not
                committing suicide, but some farmers are. Those companies give a
                tremendous return to their shareholders while the farmer has a
                pittance and his income is cut by over 50%.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another issue that the report highlighted was
                the alleged price differential between Northern Irish beef and
                that sold in Great Britain. The Committee defends Northern
                Ireland’s farmers — their beef is second to none. They
                deserve the same reward for their labours as their fellow
                farmers in the rest of this United Kingdom. We have recommended
                that the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development
                investigate the allegations with a view to securing comparable
                returns for similar livestock.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee was most concerned about
                evidence regarding the deterioration in the quality of beef
                cattle presented for slaughter. There are several reasons for
                that, including the high percentage of input from the dairy
                herds. Another significant factor is the lack of price
                incentives from processors to encourage farmers to present
                animals of a higher quality. During evidence sessions even the
                processors agreed that there was not a wide enough gap in prices
                in Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Therefore the main thrust of the Committee’s
                recommendations in that area is twofold. The Department must
                prepare an overall strategy for herd improvement that involves
                the whole industry, and processors must alter their pricing
                policies to offer stronger incentives. The Committee welcomed
                the Department’s beef quality initiative, announced in the
                Programme for Government, as a major step in the right
                direction. However, when the Committee questioned officials
                about the proposed scheme at the beginning of March it was
                disappointed to learn that processors had not commented on the
                individual proposals, although they supported the principle of
                the scheme. We want to see the principle not just supported but
                transformed into action.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That demonstrates the importance of the fully
                developed involvement of processors, as recommended by the
                Committee. If processors do not act, we fear, the initiative
                will not succeed, as the main tangible benefits to encourage
                farmers to undertake quality production — a premium for their
                animals — will not exist.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am pleased to inform the Assembly that the
                Minister has responded positively to the beef report. In her
                letter of 22 February, Ms Rodgers congratulated the Committee on
                producing a concerted and concentrated examination of the
                issues. Although it may appreciate those remarks, the Committee
                is more interested in action. Of the 12 recommendations directly
                relating to the Department, the Minister either will act or is
                already taking action to implement four of them. Those involve
                agrimonetary compensation, swift dispersal of payments to
                farmers, supporting efforts to reopen new markets and,
                crucially, conducting an investigation into the price
                differential between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. The
                Committee welcomes those actions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a further three recommendations — those
                relating to herd improvement, farm quality assurance and
                traceability — the Minister appears to accept the Committee’s
                findings but is not necessarily committing herself to taking to
                the action proposed in its report. The Committee will be
                interested to hear today whether the Minister will expand on
                those areas. In any event, it will seek to ensure that the
                actions taken by the Minister meet the objectives of its
                recommendations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In her reply, the Minister appeared
                unconvinced about the recommendation to brand Northern Ireland
                beef. In hearing evidence, the Committee learned about a
                successful branding exercise to sell our beef in Holland. The
                Committee also heard that the Great Britain market was largely
                based on a known-label strategy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee firmly believes that branding
                offers the only real protection against product substitution by
                the big retailers and that it must be pursued. Despite the
                Minister’s apparent reluctance, the Committee welcomes the
                fact that the Livestock and Meat Commission is to undertake a
                study of the scope of branding Northern Ireland red meat. That
                study should not be delayed, and Members will take a close
                interest in its findings.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister appears to have rejected three
                of the Committee’s recommendations. Those recommendations
                included the banning of imports of foreign beef if there is a
                risk to consumers or a threat to the industry. That is all the
                more important today, when meat that has not been properly
                handled — even under EEC rules — is coming from the
                continent into Northern Ireland. We also recommended that the
                Department become a more proactive participant in the beef
                sector and that producers should be organised into a
                market-orientated force.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It could be argued that only three rejections
                out of 12 recommendations is not a bad result for a Committee
                report. However, recent events, including the importing from
                Germany and other European countries of beef from which the
                spinal cord had not been removed, make our recommendation on
                that all the more valid. As recently as last Thursday, the
                Ulster Farmers’ Union called for the suspension of EU beef
                imports. Stern measures are called for.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of Agriculture and Rural
                Development’s involvement and leadership in creating a modern,
                responsive and powerful production force is crucial to the
                Committee’s vision for a better future for the beef farmers of
                Northern Ireland. If the Minister does not accept that our task
                force recommendation is the right way to go, the members of the
                Committee and I will be interested to hear her alternative
                suggestions for improving co-operation among producers and
                securing real partnership arrangements with powerful processors
                and retailers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The final report, ‘Restoring Profit for the
                Pig Producer’, was launched at a press conference on 16
                February. In that report, there were nine recommendations. The
                Committee has not yet received the Minister’s response to that
                report, which puts me at something of a disadvantage. I do not
                criticise the Minister for that; we all know and appreciate that
                she has been preoccupied in recent weeks. Nonetheless, we look
                forward with interest to her response today. The Committee will
                find out only today what the Minister plans to do about our
                recommendations, so we look forward to meeting her again and
                having further discussions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee’s findings covered four
                areas: the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development’s
                strategic involvement in the industry; the Department’s
                response to the crisis faced by pig producers;
                producer-processor partnerships, and reserved matters outside
                the direct control of the local administration. As was the case
                with the beef sector, the Committee found that the Department
                should be more proactive in certain areas of its dealings with
                the industry.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee was most impressed by the
                efforts of the United Pig Producers’ Co-operative to make a
                significant change in the supply chain. The Department of
                Agriculture and Rural Development would appear to agree, as it
                has allocated significant moneys to the co-operative to make it
                work. However, like the beef sector, there is an imbalance of
                market power. Pig producers have to either take it or leave it
                when processors offer them a price. Members felt that there must
                be a real advantage for processors in the assurance of a ready
                and consistent supply of quality pigs at an agreed price.
                However, we heard that the major processor, the Malton bacon
                factory, had not engaged in a meaningful way with the
                co-operative. Without such co-operation, further progress is
                impossible. For that reason, one of our main recommendations is
                for the Department to become much more closely involved in the
                negotiations. That processor has benefited from a very large
                grant assistance from the Department, and the Committee believes
                that the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development
                therefore has the right — indeed, the obligation — to
                intervene in that matter.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee also heard evidence on the
                disparity in prices between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.
                As was the case with beef, the Committee would have recommended
                that the Department investigate that differential. However,
                before the report was finalised, the Minister announced an
                investigation into the conformation of Northern Ireland pigs.
                The Committee welcomes that. If the findings reveal — as we
                expect they will — that the processors’ allegations of poor
                quality are absolutely unfounded, the Committee in its
                recommendation has urged the Department to follow that up most
                vigorously.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During our inquiry, there was much debate
                about the Government’s handling of the crisis in the pig
                industry, particularly in relation to the catastrophic fire at
                the Ballymoney processing plant. Northern Ireland pig farmers
                look endlessly across the border to their counterparts in the
                Republic of Ireland. The welfare scheme offered for pig farmers
                was nothing in comparison with that, and should not be likened
                to it. The pig farmers believe that the Government there
                understood the problems and acted accordingly. They do not
                believe the same could be said of the Administration here.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our report calls for the Minister to put in
                place a scheme that will take into account the specific
                difficulties faced in Northern Ireland. That would be in
                addition to the UK-wide pig industry restructuring scheme and
                would ensure that our producers are not disadvantaged compared
                to those in the south of this island. I will be particularly
                interested to hear the Minister’s response to this
                recommendation which, I believe, has the full support of the pig
                farmers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The UK-wide scheme I have just mentioned will
                have an effect on the overall industry in Northern Ireland. The
                Minister told the Committee recently that there had been some
                800 applications for the outgoers element of the scheme. It is
                obvious that the Northern Ireland pig industry will be much
                smaller when that scheme concludes. The Committee believes that
                its recommendations lay the foundations for more profitable
                times for those who decide to continue rearing pigs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is essential that support be given to the
                pig farmers quickly. It is now a year since Nick Brown, the
                Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food announced the UK
                scheme. Such a delay, I trust, will not be the fault of the
                local Minister, and the Committee finds it acceptable and
                recommends that she lobby Colleagues to ensure that funds reach
                their destination much sooner in the future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In conclusion, these reports are important
                milestones in the hopes for the recovery of the two important
                sectors of our industry, which at the moment are in turmoil. I
                commend them to the Assembly. I ask the Assembly to support the
                motion in order to send a clear message to the agricultural and
                wider rural communities that it is aware of, and is seriously
                concerned about, the future of our greatest industry in Northern
                Ireland. The Assembly must show that it is seeking to help
                farmers remain in the industry and give those that have given
                their lives to farming a proper retirement. It must bring new
                people into the farming industry who wish to remain in the
                farming community.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is a time-limited debate and a
                substantial number of Members wish to participate. I have to put
                a limit of seven minutes on subsequent speeches, save for the
                Minister, to whom the usual rule of thumb of 10 minutes per hour
                of debate will apply. Even with that limit, all who wish to
                speak may not be able to do so. We must adhere to the time
                limit.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy Chairperson of the Agriculture and
                Rural Development Committee (Mr Savage):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Deputy Chairperson, I support what the
                Chairperson of the Agriculture and Rural Development Committee
                has said. Our recommendations in the two reports were not made
                lightly. I hope that our efforts have gone some way towards
                providing a new beginning for the two parts of our industry that
                are in grave need.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As we pursued the two elements of our
                inquiry, the similarities in the problems faced by pig and beef
                producers in Northern Ireland made an impression on Committee
                members. Farm debt in both sectors had its roots in many
                different fundamental causes. Some of these were outside the
                control of farmers and others in Northern Ireland. However, it
                also became clear that in both cases producers were not getting
                a fair crack of the whip when it came to making profit from the
                food chain.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairman has rightly concentrated on the
                Committee’s recommendations to the Department and I would
                encourage the Minister to implement them without delay. It is
                also worth noting that we made several recommendations to others
                in the industry and I wish to highlight some of those. In the
                beef report we recommended that the Department of Agriculture
                and Rural Development should create and lead a task force to
                organise production. We followed that through by recommending
                that producers co-operate fully with that initiative and make
                any investments necessary to ensure its success.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a saying about leading a horse to
                water. Similarly, one cannot make farmers co-operate or
                participate even if the best of schemes are provided. However,
                our report recognises that producers must get involved and act
                together rather than stand alone. They are at the mercy of more
                powerful forces.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Making investments will not be easy decisions
                for farmers, but I fully expect that farmers will put their
                hands in their pockets if they are convinced that it will
                ultimately secure a better return. I say that again: they will
                do so if they are convinced that it will ultimately secure a
                better return.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When we made recommendations on beef herd
                improvements, we asked the Department to prepare the strategy
                and asked the processors to play their part by offering the
                right incentives. We have also asked producers to pay more
                attention to improving the overall quality. Even if the
                incentives are there, it is the producers who will still have to
                make them operable. Farmers should not fall into the trap of
                saying &quot;Why should I bother?&quot; A far more valid
                response would be &quot;Make it worth my while.&quot; Farmers
                must throw out the challenge to factories and processors and say
                &quot;If you make it worth my while, I will produce the best
                beef this country has ever seen.&quot; That is where the crux of
                the matter lies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We continued this theme in our report on the
                pig industry. We included two recommendations aimed at the
                producers and processors: to take their product and to make
                their product. We have urged the establishment of an equal
                partnership between processors and co-operatives. We have
                encouraged those involved in co-operatives to stick to their
                task. If co-operatives can provide a quality supply on which
                processors can fully depend, processors must see the attractions
                eventually.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A team effort is required from both the beef
                and pig sectors. All sides must have equal standing and respect
                for each other if the supply chains are to operate to their full
                potential. These are two good reports that have gone to the
                heart of the problems faced by local farmers and have offered
                some solutions. The problems will not go away because many
                aspects of the industry are currently outside the control of the
                producers. However, in the coming days I hope that those
                problems will be overcome. I urge all farmers to take on board
                what the Committee has been trying to do. We will not walk away
                from the problems. I hope that farmers will rise to the
                challenge that lies before them and make Northern Ireland a
                place where we produce only the best.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have great pleasure in supporting the
                motion.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Bradley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will not dwell on the beef aspect of the
                motion since the announcement made in Brussels at lunchtime has
                rather overtaken us. I am pleased to be one of the first Members
                of the Assembly to welcome the announcement that regional status
                has been granted to Northern Ireland. As a South Down MLA and a
                Newry and Mourne district councillor, I accept the Minister’s
                explanation that the entire Newry and Mourne area will have to
                wait a short while before it too can enjoy this regional status.
                I am, however, satisfied that we will not have to wait a moment
                longer than is necessary before the restrictions are removed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now that regional status has been granted, I
                thank Ms Rodgers, who is not present at the moment, and her team
                for their endless efforts and for overcoming the unforeseen
                problems which arose on the way to achieving this. Well done to
                the Minister and to everyone else concerned.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the question of profit creation and who
                should have a role in the recovery of the beef industry, we all
                agreed that the process should start with the farmers. However,
                that responsibility also extends to the processors, the
                retailers and the housewives — particularly the Northern
                Ireland housewives — who need to ensure that profits return to
                the farmers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The obstacle presented by the strength of
                sterling will continue to burden the agriculture industry and
                all local industries that depend on export markets. It is an
                obstacle that we could do without, but it would be pointless to
                ask Tony Blair or Gordon Brown to do anything about it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report highlights the level of mistrust
                between the farmers and the rest of the supply chain. A united
                approach to supplying the market with adequate quantities of top
                quality produce at the right time for a mutually agreed price is
                an important piece in the jigsaw of recovery. However, as I said
                at the outset, we held our breath today as we waited the outcome
                of the Standing Veterinary Committee’s deliberations in
                Brussels. The decision in our favour gives us a new foundation
                upon which to restore profits. Without knowing the full details
                of the regional status announcement, and despite the current
                gloom, this is a good day for Northern Ireland farmers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the section of the report which deals with
                the pig industry, the fight to restore profits to this sector
                will be more difficult than our long fight for beef recovery. I
                recall the evidence of Mr Forbes of the Ulster Curers’
                Association in response to a question about the role played by
                such supermarkets as Sainsbury’s.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Forbes’s reply reflected the views of
                many when he pointed out that the multiples pushed for quality
                assurance but then failed to pay the price for quality goods.
                They buy foreign products as an alternative. Until we can break
                the stranglehold which the multinationals have upon the
                agriculture industry, we will continue to have a non-profit
                situation on our farms.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have decided, in the short time available
                to me, to deal with labelling and branding. I wish to look at
                the evidence given by the President of the Ulster Farmers’
                Union, Mr Douglas Rowe, on that issue. Mr Rowe’s view is that
                everybody in the agriculture industry must explore the branding
                concept. I share his view that Northern Ireland needs a brand of
                its own — a brand name that will indicate quality produce at a
                glance. I call upon the Department of Agriculture and Rural
                Development to lead on the issue of branding. It has the
                necessary finances at its disposal and the marketing expertise
                to back it up.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That gives me an opportunity to raise an old
                hobby horse of mine and to re-emphasise a point that I have
                often made in the past — although it is probably an issue for
                another day. I refer to the stamping of our pork and the tagging
                of our animals for live export. All references to being UK born
                and bred will have to be removed from the identity tags and
                replaced by an Irish or Northern Irish identity if we really
                want to cash in on our many advantages and new regional status.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to express a personal view — that
                the demise of the small producer was the beginning of the end
                for the pig industry. The disappearance of the 10 to 12 sow
                units is a factor that has probably led to the current problems.
                Why did they exit the industry? I believe that the people who
                would be most embarrassed if they were asked that question today
                would be the millers and the grain traders. They ate into the
                profits of the small producers with weekly increases in feed
                prices until they eventually put the farmers out of business.
                Northern Ireland producers had to pay up to £15 per tonne more
                than their counterparts in the Republic of Ireland, England,
                Scotland and Wales. Is it any wonder that they went out of
                business?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The vast majority of young people in Northern
                Ireland under 20 years of age and living in the countryside have
                not seen a sow or a pig in their lifetime — that is how
                serious it is. As I look around the House, I would say that
                there are many Members who have not seen a sow or a pig in the
                last 30 years. The return of the pig to the small farms in
                Northern Ireland could well be the lifeline that the industry
                needs. I believe that that aim — albeit somewhat ambitious at
                this stage — should be addressed by those designated with the
                responsibility of regenerating the countryside.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">From our numerous sessions of evidence, there
                emerged the belief that the setting up of producers’ groups
                and co-operatives would be to the overall benefit of the
                industry. I agree, but it is my belief that this is not
                completely achievable if the small pig producer does not return
                to the industry. I repeat that regionalisation is the key to
                restoring profit to the beef industry. I thank the Minister and
                her team for their success on that issue. Restoring the pig
                industry to what it was in the late 60s and 70s may well be the
                way to reinstate profit for the pig industry.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Paisley Jnr:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is a most opportune time to debate
                agricultural issues, given the crisis that is being experienced
                in our country. It is unfortunate, however, that many of the
                Benches in the House do not seem to reflect the seriousness of
                this crisis as they are empty today. I hope that Members realise
                that if they are going to appear on television and go to other
                places and talk about a crisis in agriculture yet fail to turn
                up here and debate the crisis, then people will read into that
                that their only interest is a self-interest.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am very pleased that our Committee was able
                to come to unanimous recommendations on restoring profit to both
                the pig and beef sectors. It is good that we have had this
                debate, and I commend to the House the report that has been
                proposed by the Committee Chairperson and supported by the
                Members who have spoken so far. If anyone takes a moment and
                goes into the Senate Chamber of this Building —</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr Ian Paisley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Member not find it strange that no
                representative of the Government is in the House today to sit at
                the Bench and listen to this debate? That would not be tolerated
                in any other Parliament in the United Kingdom. The Minister
                responsible — or someone she has deputed — should be here to
                listen to the debate. How can she reply to anything said in this
                debate if she has not even heard it?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Paisley Jnr:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am bitterly disappointed that there appears
                to be a lack of interest, particularly on the Front Benches.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I think that that should go on the record. We
                are supposed to be in an era of joined-up Government, but where
                is it? That is evidenced by today’s debate on this serious
                issue. If one takes a moment to go into the Senate, one will see
                three representations on the gallery backdrop of the prime
                industries that ran Northern Ireland when this building was
                first opened: the industries of textile, shipbuilding and
                agriculture. If we in this House are not careful, we will be
                writing an obituary for the agriculture industry. It is very
                unfortunate that those other industries have declined so
                rapidly, but it would be a shame to see an obituary for this
                premier industry.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We want to see the Department implement what
                these reports say. We want to see a can-do attitude to ensure
                that an industry so important to Northern Ireland is developed
                and grows. We do not want to have a cannot-do or a
                not-allowed-to-do attitude because of European Regulations; we
                want to have a can-do Government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The officials in our Department are very
                clever men and women who have shown their ability in times past.
                Those people must be allowed to use that ability to get this
                industry out of the crisis that it is in. A lot of people are
                concerned that their abilities are being hampered by regulations
                and rules from other places rather than being used, and that is
                a scandal.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It would be odd not to say something about
                the regionalisation announcement today. It has come at last, but
                people are right to say that it took long enough to come. Others
                seemed to be out on the starting-blocks before us, and it is
                disappointing that Northern Ireland still has to wait another
                week before the effect of that announcement will kick in. I hope
                that when it does kick in we will get some benefit from it, for
                the good of the industry.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also want to refer to an article that
                appeared in Saturday’s ‘News Letter’ by Mr Alex Kane. In
                it he took to task not only the Minister here but the Minister
                at MAFF and, indeed, the Agriculture Committee for not doing
                enough. He said</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Politicians need to take a fairly
                ruthless look at the so called plight of our farmers. So far
                there has been no evidence that the Assembly Agricultural
                Committee is prepared to do this. For it seems prepared to act
                as a tax-payer funded lobby group for the industry pleading for
                new funds and increased understanding rather than face economic
                realities&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If Mr Kane had taken the time to read the
                reports he would have seen that they proposed fairly radical
                measures for the restructuring of the industry. The industry
                does need to be restructured. Farmers say to us &quot;We want to
                see the industry restructured&quot; because they know that by
                having the industry restructured they will find a better way,
                they will become more economically successful and they will
                become much more successful and productive. It was wrong for
                those words to be used in any way to batter the Assembly when
                reports are being debated today which propose the very things
                that he says are missing from the Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We also need some clarity from the
                Department. On 7 September last year the Minister wrote that she
                had very real reservations about the value of pursuing the
                course of bringing in producer co-operatives which the Committee
                was then considering; yet on 22 February she welcomed that
                proposal. I am glad that the Minister has welcomed that proposal
                and indeed is taking some credit for it. I do not really care
                who gets the credit, but what I want to see is clarity on
                policy, and the farming community, the consumer and indeed
                everyone in the food production chain want to see clarity from
                the Government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall deal very briefly with the pigs
                report. We hoped that the pig outgoers scheme would be helpful
                to pig producers. Indeed, we encouraged farmers who wanted to
                take that drastic step and get out of the pig industry to apply
                for the pig outgoers scheme. I understand that up to maybe 500
                people in Northern Ireland in pig production made applications
                under the pig outgoers scheme, and I am alarmed to learn that
                fewer than 100 of them were accepted by the scheme in the first
                round.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.
                I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important issue. I
                also welcome the regionalisation status that we have been
                granted. However, the Newry and Mourne area may find itself
                locked into the exclusion zone, and Departments should do all
                they can to help not only the tourism industry there but also
                other interests that could be affected.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For some time we have been asking for
                regionalisation in relation to BSE, and given that this has now
                been granted for foot-and-mouth disease, the argument could be
                made to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the
                European Commission that we are also entitled to BSE
                regionalisation. We have been locked into a negative situation
                for a long time because of foot-and-mouth disease and BSE, and
                markets must be opened up.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I accept the points that were made about the
                article in the ‘News Letter’ at the weekend. The views of
                people outside the industry can be challenging, especially when
                Alex Kane says that the Committee is simply a lobby group. Part
                of our remit is to lobby on behalf of farmers and others but the
                article was wrong to say that this was all we do. The points he
                made are unproven and unsubstantiated.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have already discussed the reports on the
                beef and pig industries, and their findings still stand. The
                problems of both industries are similar, as are the reasons for
                their non-profitability. These issues will have to be dealt with
                in the months and years to come. Tony Blair has said that
                livestock production must be approached in a different way.
                There must be a full overview of the industry, and whether or
                not this is done on an all-Ireland basis, we must ensure that we
                do not face this same situation in one year’s time or 10 years’
                time. We could eradicate foot-and-mouth disease now, but under
                the present regulations it could return in six months’ time
                because almost anything can be imported from the countries we
                deal with.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The reports make several recommendations that
                should be followed through. I strongly urge the Minister to put
                those recommendations into practice.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the Committee’s evidence sessions we
                tried to get to grips with the reasons for finding ourselves in
                this situation: sterling, the BSE crisis, the loss of markets
                (which continue to deteriorate), the fire at Malton’s pig
                plant in Ballymoney, the processors, and the power that
                supermarkets have beyond the farm gate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Foot-and-mouth disease has an impact beyond
                the agriculture industry. Shares dropped and the economic growth
                of the South will fall by 2% next year. In what is a
                multi-billion pound industry, talk is of billions being lost.
                However, farmers ask themselves &quot;What billions are being
                lost?&quot; They are certainly not making billions. The problem
                is that people outside farming have made the money. They have
                gained most from what is a very profitable industry. The problem
                is that the industry is for those outside the farm gate. That is
                where our problem lies. We have to get to the stage at which
                everybody in the industry makes a return and has a fair future.
                If we do not, the whole industry will fall apart and we might as
                well do as Alex Kane seems to say: hand it over to big landlords
                and do away with small farming families. From his article, that
                appears to be the only option.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are many stakeholders in the industry,
                including the bodies that deal with it. The Department of
                Agriculture and Rural Development is one with a major role to
                play. Groups such as the Livestock and Meat Commission (LMC),
                the Northern Ireland Meat Exporters’ Association (NIMEA) and
                others also have a role to play. From the evidence sessions, we
                learned from some of those groups that problems exist to do with
                price-fixing by cartels. Allegations were made, as yet
                unsubstantiated, but many farmers believe that that is one of
                the major reasons for their finding themselves in such
                difficulties over the years, leaving aside BSE and the current
                foot-and-mouth disease outbreak. Difficulties in making a profit
                have existed for decades, and for the same reasons. A farmer is
                an individual who has to work on his own, having been isolated
                by those all-powerful bodies who have control over the budget
                and over how they treat farmers. Farmers told the Committee that
                they are all working towards producing a quality product. We
                cannot have a quality product unless it is paid for at the
                primary producer end, which has never happened to any great
                degree. Farmers are manipulated through grading, and money is
                kept from them in other ways as they strive to produce a quality
                product.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we are going to change the entire
                agriculture industry we will have to act on the recommendations
                of the reports. We must not allow them simply to gather dust
                because they are as relevant now as they were in the past number
                of months.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Douglas:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I endorse many of the comments that have been
                made in the debate. Many factors are affecting our farming
                industry, and in the reports the Committee has sought to address
                the issues that are pertinent to the profitability of beef and
                pig producers — two of our main farm sectors that have been
                beset by problems over the past five years. A widely recognised
                point that I take from the report is that processors of red meat
                have never made more profit than they have done since the BSE
                crisis struck. They have used various excuses to cover their
                practices of offering low prices to producers while charging
                high prices to butchers and, hence, the consumers. LMC livestock
                figures show that the difference between what a supermarket
                charges for a bullock and what a farmer receives at the farm
                gate is £635. That is hard to believe. The consumer cost is
                238% higher than the amount the primary producer is paid.
                Consider the timescale of production for a farmer of two years’
                keep for an animal against a timescale of approximately two
                weeks for the meat processor and supermarket. That equates to a
                farmer’s receiving 63p per day while a processor and a
                supermarket gets £45·35 per day for their efforts.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the report, the re-establishment of niche
                markets in Europe is recommended. That I would also highly
                endorse, as many of the beef industry’s problems stem from a
                reliance on UK supermarket trade alone and the power that those
                giants wield. I quote from the report:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The best of Northern Ireland’s
                grass-fed steer beef stands comparison with any competing
                product in terms of farm quality, traceability, hygiene, service
                and eating quality.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, there does not appear to be enough
                of that product at the top end of the market, and that is due to
                various factors. Many producers would say that the grading
                standards have tightened, and they often appear to be correct in
                those assumptions. Nevertheless, other factors have a
                detrimental effect on beef quality, such as — and this is a
                bit rich, coming from a dairy farmer — the high percentage of
                dairy cows in the Province, which influences the grading
                quality. That is something that must be addressed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, there is a lack of price incentives
                and encouragement for the beef producer to produce better
                quality. Perhaps the most important factor is the subsidy
                system, which does nothing to encourage quality but only
                promotes quantity. I do not blame the farmers here. They are out
                to make a profit and they will do anything they can to produce
                the meat necessary to make a profit. However, something needs to
                be done here; something needs to be tweaked a little to
                encourage quality. On that subject, I welcome the fact that the
                Department of Agriculture and Rural Development has proposed a
                beef quality initiative. I look forward to its implementation at
                ground level.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The pig industry is having similar problems
                to the beef industry, with producer fragmentation and with large
                processors and supermarkets calling the shots. The report has
                recognised the need for strong producer groups in the pig
                sector. The United Pig Producers’ Co-operative (UPP) tried to
                address the problem but processors actively encouraged people
                not to get involved. They discouraged farmers from joining and
                tried to strangle the venture in its infancy. The Department
                must address that type of action so that the producers have some
                say and power over their own destiny.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is also the problem of the weakness of
                the euro resulting in the sucking-in of inferior products from
                Europe because of lower prices. We have a situation whereby our
                industry is regulated like no other in the world and, as usual,
                the producer has to pay. We had unilateral action by the UK
                Government to ban stalls and tethers seven years before the rest
                of Europe, with no compensation given to the farmers affected. A
                ban on meat and bonemeal was imposed, at a cost of £5·26 per
                pig, also with no compensation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Countries exporting to Northern Ireland must
                meet the same specifications imposed on our producers or face
                the consequences of their product being banned from the UK until
                they meet our standards of health and animal welfare. Our
                producers only want a level playing field and a fair market for
                their product. Give them that and they will produce the food as
                efficiently as they do now, but the difference will be that they
                will receive proper recompense for their efforts.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must also have a responsive Department,
                especially with reference to the implementation of assistance
                schemes such as the Pig Industry Restructuring Scheme. That
                scheme was introduced on 30 March 2000, but to date has not
                produced any revenue for pig producers or for those who have had
                to leave the pig industry. Ian Paisley Jnr referred the fact
                that a very small number of people have been received into this
                scheme to date. This is highly unacceptable because this scheme
                was put in place to help those who went out of business. Many
                are down hundreds of thousands of pounds with no comeback
                whatsoever. Many people from my constituency phoned me last
                night and none of them has been received into the scheme.
                Instead, they have been asked to reapply. Some had submitted
                very small bids and find it difficult to understand why they
                have not been offered any finance.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In conclusion, I urge the Minister to heed
                the recommendations of the report and act on them. Most of them
                do not cost a great deal of money but require the Department to
                go that extra mile to lobby for the beef farmer and the pig
                farmer. I support the motion.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the opportunity to speak in this
                debate. I also welcome the fact that the Minister for
                Agriculture and Rural Development is present to reply to what is
                said. I welcome the two reports on restoring profit to the
                agriculture industry. This debate is most timely, especially
                considering the problem of profitability.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our agriculture industry is going from crisis
                to crisis, and those involved in farming are getting deeper and
                deeper into debt. The farming industry has been under threat for
                some time. The BSE crisis, the strong pound, deep distrust of
                the pricing practices of processors and supermarkets, and now,
                of course, the dreadful foot-and-mouth emergency have all
                contributed to that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If actions are not taken, the producer base
                in Northern Ireland will fragment and disintegrate. The
                Department of Agriculture and Rural Development should play its
                part in helping to stabilise the agriculture industry by
                encouraging and facilitating better communication and
                co-operation among all levels of the supply chain. The
                recommendation that the Department should work with the farmers
                to secure an equitable price for their pigs and beef is one
                towards which we should work.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Northern Ireland is at the bottom of the
                United Kingdom price league. That inequality is unacceptable. I
                also welcome and support the recommendations to create
                producer/processor partnerships in order to look at and serve
                market trends. It is important that quality produce receive a
                fair price for everyone involved.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Improvements were mentioned in the beef
                producer report. The recommendations do point out the difficulty
                that the beef producer has had with regard to incentives for
                producing beef. The Department should look at, and perhaps
                instigate, an overall strategy to obtain better herd quality as
                a matter of urgency.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have spoken about branding before, and it
                is also mentioned in the beef producer report. Image and brand
                are both very important in the competitive market. Northern
                Ireland beef and pork are second to none. Consumers in the
                United Kingdom and Europe should be able to easily recognise
                that they are buying a product form Northern Ireland. A brand
                should be promoted and protected, with DARD taking a lead in
                partnership with the producers and the processors.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The problem of debt is also important. Point
                13 in the executive summary of ‘Retailing in Northern Ireland

                to help our farmers to overcome the debt, but it must be
                structured to take into account a long-term strategy that will
                allow farmers and their families to survive and make their farms
                profitable and secure for future generations. Fianancial
                assistance is also needed to make sure that Northern Ireland is
                not disadvantaged compared with the Republic of Ireland and the
                rest of Europe.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In October 1998 I spoke about the problems of
                pig producers. Very little has changed since then, and little
                help has been offered.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In conclusion, I support the report’s
                recommendations. I encourage Northern Irish consumers to make
                sure that the produce and the products that they buy in the
                markets and supermarkets are really produced here. The future of
                the Northern Irish agriculture industry is at stake. I support
                the motion.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dallat:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I too support the report. It demonstrates
                agreement between various groups with a common interest in
                restoring profitability to the farming industry. Indeed, we are
                all grateful for the contributions made and do not dismiss any
                of them out of hand. We must give very careful consideration to
                what has been said by all the groups, not least the farming
                unions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The principal causes of crisis in the farming
                industry are well established, so they do not need to be
                repeated. In addition to the BSE problem, there were the
                problems of currency exchange rates, cheap imports and the loss
                in the value of direct EU payments. Those are all well
                documented in the report. The current grading structures in
                particular have come in for criticism, and that criticism is
                well justified. The issue will rumble on because there is an
                urgent need to make fundamental changes if the farmers are to be
                given a fair price for their products. There is a widespread
                belief among farmers at the moment that they are being cheated
                and that belief must be addressed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">According to the report, there is a view that
                the farming industry is too vulnerable to the might of those who
                influence and control the retail market — the meat processing
                plants and the large supermarket chains. The supermarkets are so
                powerful that farmers are frightened to offer criticism in case
                they lose everything. That situation is unacceptable in a modern
                society.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Farmers are encouraged to offer a constant
                supply of top-class products to the processing companies, but
                there are no tangible benefits to the producers for doing that.
                That issue cannot be dismissed as being the result of the normal
                effects of market forces. During the gathering of evidence there
                was a useful dialogue on how the farming industry might overcome
                some of the powers of those who control so much of its
                livelihood at the moment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The concept of co-operatives emerged time and
                again and was mentioned earlier by the Deputy Chairperson of the
                Agriculture and Rural Development Committee George Savage and
                others. That must be pursued, and I welcome the agreement of the
                Department to assist and encourage the movement towards
                co-operatives. I fully accept that it is not a direct
                responsibility of the Department but of the farming industry to
                set up the co-operatives or control them. However, it is not
                feasible for farmers to do that without a great deal of support,
                including financial support in the early years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department has the expertise to influence
                the emergence of successful co-operatives that will not suffer
                from the weakness of previous models. In the past, the emergence
                of co-operatives broke the stranglehold of the gombeen men and
                that success can be repeated. In the recent Programme for
                Government, resources were set aside for education and training
                in the agriculture industry. Those resources are fundamental for
                equipping young people with the education and skills needed to
                tackle new concepts in marketing to deal with the current
                crisis.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Both farming organisations support the
                co-operative ideal and have indicated that they will support the
                development of such worthy principles. The Ulster Farmers’
                Union put forward constructive suggestions for the development
                of co-operatives. Those are worth examining and are detailed in
                the report. The Northern Ireland Agricultural Producers’
                Association gave evidence and also supported the concept of
                co-operation. It highlighted mistakes of the past but offered
                full co-operation, and that is very welcome.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of Agriculture and Rural
                Development emphasised in its submission that any new producer
                co-operative would need to be involved in processing and
                marketing as well as in selling primary produce. It cautioned
                about the massive investment needed and the risk of duplication.
                However, we cannot leave the industry to the monopoly of the
                large combines or allow opportunities for cartels that have the
                capacity to wipe out the industry.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We can learn from the past so that we can
                chart a new future that offers the hope of new prosperity based
                on sound financial principles. There is now a unique opportunity
                to move forward in partnership. For the first time there is a
                devolved Assembly that has the power to call witnesses,
                scrutinise the work of the Department and question the Minister
                on all aspects of her work.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The new dawn of democracy could not have come
                at a better time, and the new Minister could not be more helpful
                in her willingness to assist with change. The farming industry,
                in this time of crisis, is aware that this is a time for
                solidarity among all interested parties. They will thank no one
                who exploits their situation or attempts to make political
                capital of them. They are watching carefully and are determined
                that they will not be used by politicians, some of whom have
                never cultivated so much as a window box.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Time has not permitted me to deal with the
                pig industry in particular, but that does not indicate a lack of
                interest. The pig industry, like the beef industry, has a
                future. However, it must not be left to the control of market
                forces or the producers will become the victims of exploitation
                once again. I support the report.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Poots:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to address two points in the
                report. The first of those is recommendation 2, which states:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The Minister of Agriculture and Rural
                Development should press the United Kingdom Government to
                introduce a ban on imports of foreign beef that presents a
                threat to the local agricultural industry and a risk to
                consumers.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In recent weeks and months we have seen
                evidence of the risk that that poses to the industry and to
                consumers. The crisis that we are in today is the result of
                cheap imports into the United Kingdom. Cheaply imported pork and
                chicken products from the Far East that are used in the United
                Kingdom can enter the animal food chain through pigswill.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There have been several other instances when
                food of a lesser quality was imported to the United Kingdom, put
                on supermarket shelves alongside United Kingdom products, and
                used to keep the price of food down. The cheap food policy has
                not proven to be good for the industry or for consumers. We are
                in a crisis. Animals throughout the United Kingdom are being
                slaughtered because of the cheap food policy. That issue must be
                addressed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If food is imported, farmers in the United
                Kingdom should face equal and fair competition. That competition
                should not come from people who are not applying the same
                standards to food production as those rightly expected by
                consumers in the United Kingdom. Both the Minister of
                Agriculture and the Minister of Health — who has a role in
                this through the Food Standards Agency — should ensure that
                all food meets the high standards that are expected of Northern
                Ireland farmers. We have seen the meat plants and the different
                companies taking the opportunity, on too many occasions, to
                drive down the price of primary produce in Northern Ireland by
                introducing cheaper imports. That must stop; it is bad for the
                consumer, the farmer and the industry.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recommendation 11 states that processors
                should</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;alter their pricing policies to offer
                stronger incentives in favour of selling carcasses with a higher
                value within an overall price regime that is commercially viable
                to both buyer and seller.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That issue must be addressed. For many years
                now Northern Ireland has had a pricing regime based on what the
                meat plants actually want. Butchers are asking why they must pay
                certain prices for R grade animals. Farmers are expected to
                produce U grade and E grade animals. Butchers are not receiving
                those grades, yet they must pay the price that is expected for
                that animal. The farmers are not receiving the higher price; the
                butchers are not paying the lower price; but the processors in
                the middle are making a handsome profit.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It has not gone unnoticed that since BSE came
                into the equation about five years ago, farmers incomes have
                slumped, but at the same time the meat processors’ incomes
                have rocketed. Why has that happened? One of the key reasons is
                that farmers no longer have the ability to export live cattle;
                they can only export cattle that have been slaughtered.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are five meat-processing companies in
                Northern Ireland. They own nine meat plants. They are strong
                companies that dominate the market. Almost all their supplies go
                to supermarkets throughout the United Kingdom. The problem is
                that the farmer has no means of pushing up his prices. The
                livestock markets cannot be used in the way that they were used
                pre-BSE because buyers from the Irish Republic are not coming to
                Northern Ireland to buy live cattle and thus provide some
                balance to the market. The balance has disappeared from the
                market since BSE arrived five years ago. That has left the
                processors in an advantageous position, to the detriment of the
                agricultural community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome this report and the report on the
                pig producers. I hope that we shall soon see profitable times
                for beef and pig producers in Northern Ireland once again. The
                work that the Committee has done has been useful, unlike the
                comments that were made in the ‘News Letter’ on Saturday by
                Mr Alex Kane.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly should take the opportunity to
                try to restore agriculture to its position as a dominant
                industry in Northern Ireland. What has helped the Irish Republic
                in the past few years is that it has shown a greater level of
                support for its agriculture industry than we have shown ours. In
                that case, we should learn from what has happened in the Irish
                Republic. Grants have been made available to farmers so that
                they can improve the way in which they produce their food.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.45 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister would do well to take account of
                some of the measures taken there, rather than take policy
                directly from Westminster on each and every occasion. We have a
                devolved Administration and finance of our own. We should be
                looking at how to spend that money, and not necessarily at
                following the line taken in the rest of the United Kingdom.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I congratulate the Committee on presenting
                the report. I hope that it leads to better days for the
                agriculture industry.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Kane:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion and welcome the
                announcement on regionalisation. I hope that it will be a major
                step forward for agriculture and trust that the Minister will
                use her skills to regionalise Newry and Mourne district when
                everything in that area becomes foolproof. We hope that that
                will be sooner rather than later.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In compiling the report, the Agriculture and
                Rural Development Committee took evidence from all quarters of
                the industry. I am certain that everything possible was done to
                work through what are complex and multiple problems. However, it
                is not in the Committee’s remit to call for direct
                intervention into market arrangements. Many producers and
                farmers in the Province may feel that that is the only course of
                action to take to stem the huge losses the industry has endured
                over the past five years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I know of no measures that will promote
                co-operation between farmers and processors in the immediate
                future. It is insulting to call on producers actively to seek
                co-operation with processors because of the current distrust
                that is a result of processors’ greed and opportunism. It is
                up to processors to rebuild trust, for it was they who
                undermined it in the first place and who have continually
                undermined it since. If processors have a reliable and wholesome
                Northern Ireland product to market, they should show
                appreciation of its value by allowing an adequate return to the
                producers who made that possible.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The beef quality initiative is a step towards
                improving Northern Ireland’s herd quality. Moreover, strongly
                branded Northern Ireland produce would be an effective marketing
                tool. The Northern Ireland farm quality assurance scheme has its
                merits, but it will only be of value if implemented by the
                Livestock and Meat Commission (LMC) in a way that does not leave
                it open to abuse. There must be no opportunity for mixing and
                matching product or for &quot;product substitution&quot;. To
                that end the LMC has complete responsibility and must exercise
                its authority over what is its scheme, otherwise the exercise is
                nonsensical and its objective will be completely undermined.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although the report is extensive and
                considers many opinions, at best it can only touch on some of
                the current problems. The Department of Agriculture and Rural
                Development must constantly consider its obligations to the
                farmers and should ensure that its policy does not deliver the
                dividends to those who least deserve them. The encouragement,
                promotion and development of farming in the Province must be
                given higher priority. Farming underpins much of what makes
                Northern Ireland the place that it is. The report is just one
                step in the furlongs towards achieving that goal. I have much
                pleasure in supporting the motion.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Armstrong:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome this opportunity for Northern
                Ireland to export some of its produce again to the wider world
                market. That will restore the confidence that our farming
                community needs, but our farmers face many more problems. The
                report relays the need for the agriculture industry to open up
                new markets and to ensure healthy living and competition to
                exploit the superior quality of Northern Ireland produce. The
                current exchange rate greatly reduces those opportunities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was also pointed out that consumers have
                much more power than the farmers, and it is suspected that
                processors dictate the price. The Department cannot afford to be
                a mere spectator on this matter; it needs to take the lead. I do
                not say that the Department does not lead, but more leadership
                would be helpful to our farmers, who would appreciate such
                support. Our farmers need a good deal of support. For example,
                branding would allow consumers to offer more loyalty to Northern
                Ireland produce. We need more help on that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We all know that farmers should look beyond
                their present difficulties and become more positive, but that
                can only happen if they are given a level playing field. More
                trust between the producers and the processors is necessary.
                That will bring profit to the farmers, and result in more
                profitability to our Province.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Agriculture and Rural
                Development (Ms Rodgers):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I notice that, although the Chairperson of
                the Committee had a prop, I do not have one. I wonder whether we
                have swapped places, or is it simply an oversight?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall begin by placing on record the fact
                that I welcome the two reports from the Committee for
                Agriculture and Rural Development that we are debating here
                today. I apologise to Mr Bradley, in particular, for my absence
                during his speech. I thank him for his understanding of the fact
                that I was not able to be here and for the kind remarks that he
                made. I also apologise to Dr Paisley for not being present for
                the first part of his speech. I am told that he did not show
                quite the same understanding as Mr Bradley, but that is hardly
                surprising.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The pig and beef sectors are an important
                part of the industry because they represent 35% of the gross
                output of the agriculture sector and provide significant
                employment on farms and in processing. Both have faced
                significant difficulties in recent years. The loss of our export
                markets for beef after March 1996 meant that the industry had to
                refocus on the Great Britain market. Several of our local
                processors have built up a substantial trade with the Great
                Britain retail multiples. However, the Great Britain beef market
                is extremely competitive, and the strength of sterling has made
                it attractive for many countries to send beef there. The result
                has been a drop in prices for our beef producers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the pig sector the downturn in the
                production cycle, the strength of sterling, and the consequences
                of the fire at Ballymoney combined to create the effect that for
                several years, pig producers were making a loss, and in many
                cases a substantial loss. At present, both sectors are living
                with the difficulties caused by the outbreak of foot-and-mouth
                disease. I have already detailed to the Assembly the actions
                that have been taken to control the outbreak and to deal with
                the trading implications. I do not propose to repeat what I have
                said here before. Although there has been some increase in
                prices for both finished cattle and pigs as a consequence of the
                disruption to supplies in Britain, the situation remains so
                uncertain that we cannot confidently predict what it will be in
                the long term. I repeat that it is clearly in the best interest
                of all sectors that we continue to apply stringent measures to
                deal with the outbreak.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Much of the content of the Committee’s
                reports, and of what has been said today, relates to the
                longer-term future of these sectors. I want to concentrate on
                those issues. First, I shall respond to Dr Paisley, Mrs Carson,
                Mr Armstrong and others on the issue of branding. I note the
                support for branding, especially of beef, but I must make it
                clear that I have an open mind on this. It is not a simple
                matter. It requires careful consideration and full commitment
                from all parts of the industry if it is to work. I am pleased
                that the LMC has commissioned a study on the scope for branding
                Northern Ireland red meat. That is to be completed by early
                summer, and I look forward to the outcome. The LMC’s study is
                being funded from the money allocated to it for red meat
                marketing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Great emphasis has rightly been put on the
                relaxation of the BSE beef export restrictions. The Assembly
                will be aware of strenuous efforts, both on my part and that of
                my officials, to secure a relaxation. It was extremely
                frustrating that, just when we were ready to lodge a formal bid
                with the European Commission, BSE-related food scares once again
                surfaced in Europe, producing a political climate that would
                have been extremely prejudicial to our bid. Since then we have
                had the results of the survey of casualty slaughtered cattle
                aged over 30 months. That survey indicated a much higher
                incidence of BSE in those animals, including the Northern
                Ireland herd, than was previously thought. All member states are
                now undertaking their own surveys in accordance with EU
                requirements. Once the results of those surveys are known —
                and it may be some months yet — we shall be in a better
                position to take forward the case for relaxation of restrictions
                on our beef exports.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I can assure the Assembly that I am fully
                committed to that cause and will be pressing for relaxation of
                the export restrictions. Some people have called for a ban on
                beef imports. I can only impose such a ban if there is a threat
                to the health status of the domestic beef herd. Although I did
                impose a ban on trade with GB because of foot-and-mouth disease,
                I cannot ban imports from other countries unless clear evidence
                of a threat exists. Whether beef imports from any country
                represent a risk to human health is a matter for the Food
                Standards Agency and the Minister of Health, Social Services and
                Public Safety. Hitherto, the Food Standards Agency has not
                recommended any such ban.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I now turn to the need to improve the
                marketing strength of producers — a theme common to both
                reports. I am firmly convinced of the need for effective
                partnerships among all parts of the supply chain in both
                sectors. A partnership approach among the different interests,
                acting in conjunction with Government, is the only viable way
                forward. Although I recognise the need for producers to improve
                their marketing position, that should be done in conjunction
                with processors and retailers, not in isolation from them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The emphasis should be on strengthening the
                vertical links in the supply chains, building on the existing
                work taking place and building on the support mechanisms of both
                a technical and financial nature that are available. That
                requires collaboration and co-operation, not confrontation. It
                is not for Government to impose solutions on the industry.
                Business dealings in the supply chain must be governed by
                commercial considerations and driven by market needs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Paisley Jnr said that I had reservations
                about producer co-operatives. My reservations are based on the
                experience of some producer co-operatives whose plans backfired
                because, at the end of the day, those who took their produce
                could find other sources of supply. My Department and I can help
                the different sectors in developing whatever solutions are
                appropriate to their circumstances, be they formal co-operatives
                or other arrangements. Indeed, we have done that in the past and
                will do it in future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I firmly believe that the long-term interests
                of the beef industry lie in a broadly based marketing strategy,
                targeting those markets — be they in Great Britain or
                elsewhere — that are capable of ensuring that a premium price
                is paid for Northern Irish beef. That is why support has been
                provided to the industry in developing the red meat marketing
                strategy. The strategy was developed by all parts of the
                industry and the relevant Departments. An important part of that
                strategy is a focus on premium markets capable of providing a
                premium return for our beef.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, we need to produce top quality
                cattle for those markets. It is well established that there has
                been a decline in the quality of finished cattle. I have secured
                £2 million per year in the Programme for Government to reverse
                that trend, and I welcome the fact that Members have referred to
                that today. Details of the proposed measures have been provided
                to Committee members, and I was please to note that they have
                also supported them. The measures will be introduced as soon as
                state-aid approval has been obtained.</p>
                <i>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Much has been said about producers getting a
                rough deal from processors. I deplore any exploitation of one
                part of the food chain by another. As a public representative, I
                hear just as much about it as other Members. If it were proved
                that that was happening, I would push for strong action to be
                taken. The Office of Fair Trading examined the alleged existence
                of a beef cartel and found insufficient evidence on which to
                undertake a formal investigation. Although the differential in
                beef prices between Northern Ireland and Britain has narrowed in
                recent months, there are still concerns about the prices that
                Northern Ireland farmers receive for their cattle. I have
                decided to commission an independent study of the differential.
                The Committee recommended that I do that, and the move is
                supported by producers and processors. I hope that Members will
                recognise that, in responding positively to that proposal, I am
                making it clear that I am open to constructive and helpful
                suggestions from the Committee or from any other quarter.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not pretend that my Department or I have
                a monopoly on wisdom. In this devolved democratic institution,
                in which we all participate, all ideas are welcome. I shall
                would not be right to proceed with the investigation now, until
                the current difficulties with foot-and-mouth disease have eased.
                That said, I remain committed to ensuring that the study takes
                place.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am acutely aware of the importance of
                making prompt direct payments to farmers to help with cash flow,
                especially in the current circumstances. Everything possible is
                being done to expedite all grant and subsidy payments. In the
                coming weeks, we shall make all the balance payments for this
                year’s livestock schemes, as well as the payments under the
                new less-favoured area compensatory allowance scheme and the
                additional agrimonetary compensation. In total, those payments
                will be worth £55 million to local farmers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I can assure the Assembly that
                representatives of the pig industry made me aware of the
                problems that they face from the minute that I took up my post
                as Minister. It is a matter of some regret, however, that I have
                not been able to convince the pig producers that my scope to
                offer them cash help is almost non-existent. I can truthfully
                say that I explored every suggestion put to me on the matter but
                found insurmountable obstacles to all of them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some of the issues covered in the report,
                such as the pig welfare disposal scheme, relate to the period
                before devolution, and it is not for me to explain or defend
                them. However, on numerous occasions, I have reminded MAFF
                Ministers of the plight of our pig producers and have pressed
                them to devise the pig industry restructuring scheme and obtain
                EU clearance for it. I was disappointed to read a suggestion in
                the Committee report that I was in some way to blame for the
                European Commission’s tardiness in approving the scheme. I
                accept responsibility for my actions, but I am not prepared to
                accept responsibility for the operations of the European
                Commission. I know that the pig industry restructuring scheme is
                seen by some as a case of too little, too late. I am afraid that
                it is the only show in town, and our job is to see that Northern
                Ireland’s pig producers derive maximum benefit from it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have noted Mr Paisley Jnr’s comments
                about the pig industry outgoers scheme. That scheme, as we have
                said from the beginning, is a UK-wide scheme. It was based on a
                tendering exercise, therefore the lowest tenders were accepted.
                The unfortunate result of that was that, on the face of it,
                Northern Ireland appeared to have received less than its full
                share. However, Northern Ireland did get its fair share on a
                pro-rata basis of sow numbers. I have already taken the
                opportunity at a recent ministerial meeting in London to make
                the point to Nick Brown — in view of the fact that there is
                now to be an extended outgoers scheme — that, although we may
                have got pro rata on the basis of sow numbers, we did not get
                pro rata in relation to our problem, which is a much bigger,
                deeper and difficult one than that faced by the rest of the UK’s
                pig producers. Mr Brown was sympathetic to that view and made it
                clear that in the next tranche he will endeavour to see whether
                there are any methods compatible with the scheme that can be
                used to help us in that area.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am aware of the concern of many in the
                industry that the marketing of Northern Ireland pigs must be
                improved. I am pleased to announce that after protracted
                consideration by EU authorities we have obtained approval to
                spend £400,000 to further support the pig industry’s
                marketing effort. That money will be used primarily to promote
                pig meat in Northern Ireland, but will also be applied to help
                develop quality pig meat and improve the structures used to
                market pigs. Those were the priority areas for action as agreed
                with the pig sector. Officials will soon discuss with the
                industry the detailed arrangements of how to spend that money. I
                must say that the less direct forms of financial and
                non-financial assistance that my Department provides for pig
                producers tends to be dismissed too readily.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I stated in my written response to the
                Committee’s report, my Department has spent a great deal of
                time and effort on counselling and advising pig producers
                throughout the past three years. We have allocated a significant
                amount of money to support marketing initiatives and to working
                with producers to enhance co-operation and collaboration. We
                have done what we can to encourage the local uptake of Northern
                Ireland pig meat. Indeed, last year we also consulted with the
                Department for Social Development. That Department and my
                officials have worked hard to advise and facilitate pig farmers,
                who are not used to dealing with social security. The aim is to
                make it easier for them to access their entitlements in a
                situation in which they are losing money and in difficult
                financial circumstances. However, short of acting illegally by
                giving cash subsidies to pig producers, there is simply nothing
                more that my Department or I could have done to help. It is a
                sad fact that it has taken the foot-and-mouth disease crisis to
                force the Northern Ireland pig meat price over the £1 per
                kilogram level for the first time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I understand that during my absence from the
                Chamber Mr Bradley expressed concern about our inability here to
                put certain things on labels. Existing EU rules constrain what
                can be put on meat labels. However, there is scope for some
                flexibility, and I am willing to work with the industry — <i>[Interruption]</p>

                explore how this can be used the industry’s benefit. In
                particular, the rules on beef labelling should allow Northern
                Ireland beef to be clearly identified for the consumer. However,
                the UK mark must also be displayed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">By the way, I welcome Mr Poots’s remarks.
                It was refreshing to hear an unbiased and honest opinion from
                someone whose political views I totally respect and understand.
                I do not expect that those views will have changed, but
                nevertheless he was prepared to give credit where credit was due
                to the Republic. He also recognised that our devolved
                Administration have made and are making a difference, especially
                in the agriculture sector.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, I shall deal with those who have
                said that the Department and I are not doing enough for those
                sectors. I am not clear as to what other action they have in
                mind beyond the range of activities on education, training,
                research, technology transfer, marketing assistance, disease
                control, animal welfare, traceability and the implementation of
                the livestock subsidy arrangements. All those are currently
                taking place.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, I assure the Assembly that my
                Department and I shall continue with our efforts to assist in
                the development of the beef and pig sectors and the rest of the
                industry. I am committed to that and will remain so as long as I
                am Minister of Agriculture in Northern Ireland.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Agriculture and Rural
                Development Committee (Rev Dr Ian Paisley):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I regret that I have not got more time to
                deal with some of the matters that have been raised. The
                fishermen who made some noise entering the Gallery are seated,
                Mr Deputy Speaker, and they even come from your bailiwick, so do
                not be hard on them. They have enough hardship already without
                you turning on them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is one matter that I view very gravely.
                Neither my office nor the Agriculture and Rural Development
                Committee’s office received the Minister’s statement on
                pigs. However, in a section of the report, the Minister makes
                the claim that Malton Foods received &quot;considerable
                Government assistance&quot;. In a recent letter to me she stated</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;I cannot speak for the whole of
                Government, of course, but as far as Northern Ireland is
                concerned, I would like to record formally that neither IDB nor
                DARD has given any direct financial assistance to Malton at any
                time.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I know the whole story about Malton Foods; it
                is in my constituency. I was called in by the directors of
                Malton Foods after the fire. I also had talks with Mr Peter
                Small, the Department’s permanent secretary. I ask the
                Minister why she stated &quot;any direct financial
                assistance&quot;. Everybody knows — even the dogs in the
                street know — about the deal that was done in Cookstown and
                the amount of money that the owner of the Cookstown plant took
                when he agreed to enable Malton Foods to take it over. Malton
                Foods would not have been in possession of the Cookstown plant
                if that deal had not been done. I was involved at that time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nobody knows to this day how much money was
                given to the owner of the Cookstown plant. There should now be
                an inquiry to find out how much Government money was handed to
                the owner of that plant to make it acceptable for Malton Foods
                to obtain that factory. It does not matter whether the money was
                paid directly or indirectly. The letter referred to
                &quot;considerable Government assistance&quot;, and there
                certainly was such assistance. I resent the Minister’s coming
                today and referring to a letter that we did not receive with
                that statement in it, because that is not being utterly
                transparent. Everybody knows that a deal was done to get the
                Cookstown factory into the charge of Malton Foods.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today we have a report, produced by the
                Agriculture and Rural Development Committee, that has the voices
                of all sides on it. It was resolved by the Committee unamiously,
                and it was the Committee that drew up this motion. I did not
                draw up the motion. I am sick, sore and tired of hearing people
                say, &quot;Oh, that is Paisley’s doing.&quot; My business is
                to chair the Committee, and I have never heard anyone — even
                my political opponents — say that I have given them a raw deal
                from the Chair. They all admit that I call them carefully. I
                call some of them prayerfully, but I do call them all.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today the Minister has been talking about
                defending herself and her Department. This debate is not an
                attack on the Minister or the Department of Agriculture and
                Rural Development. It is an attack on those responsible people
                who still do not realise that farmers are in a catastrophe. The
                Department of Agriculture and Rural Development officials must
                remember that we are dealing with a catastrophe, but I fail to
                see recognition of the seriousness of the matter when I talk to
                them. A whole section of agriculture is going out of business.
                The situation is the same as that facing the fishermen. I met
                the Minister this morning and she knows that she told me that
                she could do nothing for them. It seems that nothing can be done
                for pig producers or farmers.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not understand why French farmers and
                French pig farmers can get money into their pockets, or why
                farmers in the South of Ireland got money into their pockets
                when they got their deal. However, Northern Ireland had a
                welfare scheme and the Department kept trying to bluff people by
                saying that it would be good for the pig farmers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Northern Ireland now has the outgoers scheme,
                and I noticed that the Minister did not challenge what my son,
                Mr Paisley Jnr, said in the House about the numbers involved in
                it. What good is that scheme to the agriculture industry if 500
                farmers apply and not even 100 are successful? What good is it
                if the remaining farmers are told to reapply?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Northern Ireland’s situation is different
                because our pig farmers faced the burning of Malton’s. Pig
                farmers across the water did not have to face that. The pig
                producers’ main factory was destroyed and that put them in a
                grave situation. Why was that not taken into account when the
                outgoer scheme was planned for Northern Ireland? Special
                consideration should have been given because of the difference
                between Northern Ireland pig farmers, whose main processing
                factory was burned down, and those in the rest of the United
                Kingdom. Special provision should have been made, but it was
                not. Therefore, pig farmers have great anxieties. They are being
                told that there is an outgoers scheme. However, when they apply
                for it, it can give them nothing. What can they do?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There must be something wrong with the system
                when beef and pig processors are doing exceptionally well while
                beef and pig producers are going out of business. There was a
                time when pig producing was the strongest part of intensive
                farming in Northern Ireland. Those farmers are now going out of
                business while the Department of Agriculture and Rural
                Development says that its hands are tied.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are doors in Europe that we are told
                are closed. It is funny that when one hammers on those doors
                they tend to open. A statement has come from Europe a few hours
                ago saying that if it can help with tying up the boats it would
                be prepared to look at that. That is an amazing statement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is about time we stood at the door and
                hammered on it until it opens. It has opened for many other
                countries that have breached European law more than Northern
                Ireland ever has. European law is monitored and policed in the
                United Kingdom like no other place in the European Union. The
                time has come when the House must say forcibly to Europe — and
                the Minister must take the message to Europe — that the door
                must be opened. If it is not opened people are going to lose out
                and there will be no way back. The Agriculture and Rural
                Development Committee wants a way back for pig farmers and beef
                producers. We want a way back for Northern&nbsp;Ireland
                agriculture, it must not die. We must get oxygen into it and
                keep it alive until this serious situation is over.</p>

                financial assistance for the fishing industry due to the
                restriction coming from the cod recovery programme.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issue is very important to my
                constituency of Strangford, as well as to south Down and the
                villages of Portavogie, Ardglass, Kilkeel and many others. The
                debate on the agriculture industry was very important because
                that industry is also in the throes of a crisis. We understand
                that its strength will be weakened and undermined, and we must
                commend the measures taken to try to restrict the spread of
                foot-and-mouth disease. Unfortunately, that crisis has eclipsed
                other problems in Northern&nbsp;Ireland, such as those that the
                fishing industry faces.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For a long time, people involved in the
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland fishing industry have been made to feel
                like the farmers’ poor relations. It is not a matter of
                &quot;them and us&quot;, but the fishing industry does feel like
                a second-class citizen within the Department of Agriculture and
                Rural Development. That is not simply the fishermen’s
                perception. The Government have continually refused to listen to
                the views and concerns of fishermen and of spokesmen from that
                sector. They have been forced to watch as the Government
                consistently fail to give fair and equal representation at
                national and European level.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since the day and hour that the common
                fisheries policy was created in Brussels in 1983, we have
                witnessed the piece-by-piece destruction of the fishing
                industry, with year-on-year reductions in the amount of produce
                our fishermen are allowed to land. Several fishermen are in the
                Gallery today.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The number of adult fish that live on the
                seabed has fallen by 90% since the early 1970s, yet Europe
                refuses to acknowledge the fatal repercussions of legislation
                that it has enforced. Between 1999 and 2000, the value of fish
                landed at Ardglass fell by £1·2 million. That represents a 30%
                decrease. In Kilkeel the figure fell by £2·5 million, which
                represents a 29% decrease. In Portavogie the figure fell by
                £1·5 million, which represents a 20% decline. Those are
                massive reductions in the three major ports.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While the Northern Irish fish sector
                continues to be strangled by such draconian legislation, other
                EU nations continue to rape United Kingdom waters. Fish from
                those waters are essential to the maintenance and growth of our
                own industry. That ill-thought-out policy has convincingly
                failed to deliver even one positive benefit to the fishing
                industry. If it is not scrapped, we shall witness the total
                extermination of the fishing industry in Northern Ireland. It
                will send local communities and economies into freefall. Those
                of us who represent fishing areas — in my case, Portavogie —
                understand how legislation will affect the economy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The latest gem to come out of Brussels — I
                shall not call it wisdom, because it is certainly not that —
                is the cod recovery plan. The second year of closures associated
                with the Irish Sea cod recovery plan commenced on 14 February
                2001 and will last until 30 April 2001. As with last year’s
                closures, derogation has been permitted to allow a nephrop
                fishery to continue. In addition, a further derogation to allow
                a directed haddock fishery to be prosecuted in the Irish Sea was
                allowed between 14 February and 22 March this year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a result of last year’s closures, and as
                predicted by all those involved in the industry and their
                elected representatives, many trawlers that traditionally
                targeted cod off the County Down coast diverted their efforts to
                the north channel that falls within the west of Scotland waters.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The EU convened a meeting in Brussels on 13
                February to discuss a cod recovery plan for the west of Scotland
                waters. That meeting resulted in the closure of the area fished
                by our trawlers in the north channel. The closure commenced last
                week and will continue until 30 April 2001. Next year it will
                run parallel with the Irish Sea closure. It is time for the
                Minister to wake up and smell the coffee, or in this case smell
                the fish.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our white fish fleet has nowhereto go.
                Similar closures have been introduced in areas north of the west
                of Scotland waters. However, inshore waters have remained open,
                which allows inshore fishing by vessels similar to our fleet to
                continue. Closures in the Irish Sea are the only ones that
                extend right up to the beach. I hate to use a pun, but this is
                no red herring.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is crunch time for our fishing industry,
                and the Government have failed abysmally to meet the demands of
                this very real and present danger. One option for our white fish
                fleet is to turn its attention to nephrop fishing, but that
                sector of the industry is also feeling the pinch from Europe.
                Frustration, anger and dismay are out there in great quantities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There will be a 10% cut in the total
                allowable catch for the Irish Sea. First and foremost, that cut
                will inevitably lead to restrictions on those who work with
                nephrops, so there is no conceivable way that the fleet can be
                expanded by vessels from the redundant white fish fleet.
                Secondly, scientists have stated that the 10% cut in the
                nephrops catch will result in only a 2% recovery of cod. That is
                a truly insignificant figure when we put it into perspective.
                Nephrops account for more than 50% of all fish and shellfish
                caught by Northern Ireland vessels.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Taking into consideration the continuing
                policy of restricting other sectors of fishing, that part of the
                industry is becoming ever more important. Therefore, it is
                madness to even contemplate making cuts in this fishery at this
                time.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Meanwhile, the decommissioning scheme
                continues to fall flat on its face in its main objective of
                cushioning effects on the Irish Sea cod stock. When one
                witnesses the growing problems and further restrictions that are
                being implemented, it is clear that this school of thought is
                without foundation or integrity.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The next phase of the Northern Ireland
                decommissioning scheme has been wrapped up in EU bureaucracy
                since the end of last year — I have information that goes back
                to 1999, when the first commitment was given to it — while
                trawler owners are left on tenterhooks about their future, if in
                fact they have any future. The overwhelming irony of all this is
                that Brussels bureaucracy, which is currently delaying some £8
                million to finance the scheme, is the same bureaucracy that has
                created and propagated the continuing crisis in fishing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I understand that we shall have an
                announcement today about decommissioning. I am interested to
                hear how that will work. There has been no move to address the
                fact that up to 40% of this may be payable to the taxman through
                taxation on grant aid and the repayment of modernisation grant
                aid. It will be interesting to see exactly how it works. Our
                fishermen are still waiting to observe even the slightest
                indication that this scheme will save the cod fishery in the
                Irish Sea. Will it save it? That is a question that we ask the
                Minister.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another issue that has not been
                satisfactorily addressed is light dues. Northern Ireland vessel
                owners pay £58,000 annually on light dues. That levy was
                initially imposed to cover the cost of navigational aids
                provided by lighthouses, and those are no longer used. It is
                especially frustrating that our fishermen have to continue to
                pay this levy while fishermen from the Republic of Ireland do
                not pay a single penny, as their Government make the payments.
                That shows commitment to the industry. Where is our Department’s
                commitment to fishing? Although the Minister has said that she
                will do what she can, the fishing industry is on its knees and
                needs serious help now: not next year, not the year after, but
                now, before the industry is confined to the annals of history.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As for the future of our white fish fleet,
                what must be done to alleviate the problems that are being
                experienced and to obtain commitments that something will be
                done? It is clear that an immediate and substantial financial
                package must be provided in order to secure even the short-term
                future of Northern Ireland’s white fish fleet. For example, 13
                boats are currently tied up in Kilkeel because the crews cannot
                be paid, and that came before the restrictions that were added
                last week.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For those who choose that option,
                decommissioning may, in a small way, address the issue. However,
                there must be a commitment from Government that those who wish
                to remain active within the sector will be catered for. The
                right to fish is an issue. Fishermen want to catch fish, they
                want to be involved in the industry and to support their
                families and others who are involved in it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the past, Westminster has opposed the
                introduction of a tie-up scheme that would keep vessels in port.
                However, the fact is that the white fish fleet faces an enforced
                tie-up for no other reason than it has been provided with no
                other options. It has nothing left to do. We must also look at
                boats that are not involved in white fish fishing. This will
                affect them as well. What we are looking for today is financial
                assistance that will help everyone who is involved in the
                fishing industry, from A to Z.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our Government have consistently failed to
                provide such essential assistance while the sovereign
                Governments of other EU member states have provided crucial
                finance to support their fishing fleets. We know who they are:
                Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Spain and the Republic of
                Ireland. They are all doing something for their fishing fleets,
                and because they are doing something their industries will
                survive.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of Agriculture and Rural
                Development has admitted that there are provisions in EU
                Regulations for the payment of compensation in such
                circumstances as those in which our fishing industry currently
                finds itself. The Minister says that it is not possible to
                implement such a scheme after a fishery has closed. The rest of
                Europe has already done something. Our Minister — here in our
                own devolved Assembly in Northern Ireland — has the power to
                do just that, and we ask her to do it. In fact, this particular
                aid package has been introduced following the closures
                associated with the North Sea cod recovery plan. That is what
                other countries are doing about that issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Can the Minister explain to me and my
                constituents — and those of South Down — exactly how she
                plans to address this problem? Why do the sovereign Governments
                of other EU states deem it necessary, while our Government
                refuse to accept the same responsibility? Our Government cannot
                expect to receive a sympathetic hearing when they refuse to
                acknowledge the magnitude of the crisis and take the necessary
                action that is urgently required if the industry is to be saved.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Individuals as well as fishing organisations
                have made written submissions to the Department of Agriculture
                and Rural Development and to the Minister outlining what is
                needed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For example, throughout the period when boats
                are required to remain in port, all vessels affected — that
                is, each fishing boat — should receive a weekly subsidy. A
                percentage of that financial assistance should be used to
                compensate the fish-selling companies, the Northern Ireland
                Fishery Harbour Authority and the producer organisations for the
                loss in income that would be inevitable should vessels be forced
                to tie up.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The financial assistance would allow trawler
                owners to maintain the repayment of bank loans, insurance and
                equipment hire costs, as well as provide crew members with a
                weekly wage. It is vitally important that the crew members also
                be looked after through that package, because they are the
                backbone of the fishing industry.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During this period the fleet will be
                restricted to port. Training schemes should be developed and run
                when the fishery is closed. The Minister and ourselves are well
                aware of a training scheme that the Republic of Ireland runs for
                their fishermen. Indeed, a substantial sum of money is spent on
                that training, and we ask the Minister to respond today and
                assure us that a similar training scheme could be introduced
                here. The implementation of such measures would go a long way
                towards providing assistance for the recovery of fish stocks and
                would prevent the white fish fleet diverting to working with
                nephrops, thus avoiding any further pressure on those quotas.
                That would also encourage crew members to stay with the fleet.
                Many are already voting with their feet and leaving the
                industry. We are aware of that, and we cannot let it continue.</p>

                he outlines are not options but are absolutely necessary? If
                they are not implemented, we face mass unemployment along the

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Shannon:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is a point that I ask the Minister to
                take on board. Those proposals are essential; they are not just
                ideas pulled out of a hat in the hope that she will consider
                perhaps one of the six. We ask the Minister to implement all
                six. If those long-term problems that the fishing industry has
                had to face are to be addressed, there is only one route that
                the Government can take. It is essential that whatever solution
                is found balances the need to maintain fish stocks with the
                continuing viability of a Northern Ireland fishing fleet — a
                fleet that wants to fish and that has the right to fish.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I suggest that the following action be taken
                to cement and bolster the Northern Ireland fishing industry. We
                must strive to ensure that the weight and importance of the
                fishing industry are elevated within the Department of
                Agriculture and Rural Development. For too long the fishing
                industry has been the poor relation in this family. A fishing
                villages initiative programme should be developed and
                implemented that would give control of inshore fishing to local
                fishermen. We must ensure that sufficient funds are made
                available in order to both maintain and retain the Northern
                Ireland fishing fleet and its associated industries such as the
                processing and sale of fish produce.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those currently involved with the fishing
                industry are crying out for acknowledgement and assistance in
                their struggle to keep their heads above water. Although
                attention to the foot-and-mouth disease crisis is essential, the
                Minister has failed to act in the same quick and decisive manner
                in relation to the fishing crisis. She must make a greater
                effort for the sake of the communities that we represent. Some
                of those people affected are here today. They are held together
                through fishing; for many of them it is not only a job, it is a
                way of life.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The crisis is not a recent occurrence, it is
                one that has been simmering for years. The fishermen need
                someone to fight their corner, as they are getting nowhere on
                their own. We ask the Minister to fight their corner; we ask her
                to make that commitment today. Doors are already slamming in
                their face everywhere they go, and that is frustrating. If one
                looks at the evidence, one cannot blame fishermen for asking
                whether, once again, the fishing industry in Northern Ireland is
                being considered expendable. I ask the Minister — indeed, I
                demand of the Minister — that she prove me wrong.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As long ago as December 1999 — well over a
                year ago — the fishermen’s representatives met with my
                Committee to tell us of the difficulties they faced. We have met
                with them again on a number of occasions since that day. We have
                also had meetings with the Minister and with her officials, and
                we have written to the Minister to seek action to relieve the
                real financial catastrophe faced by those men and by the entire
                fishing industry.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I must remind the House that, through
                compulsory curtailment of their activities, fishermen are being
                deprived of their means of earning a living. That is what this
                is about. It is putting them out of the position in which they
                can earn a living and support their families. That is the crisis
                we face today — men who have the ability and the wherewithal
                to make a living through fishing are being pushed out. The
                country is telling them that they cannot do it. They are being
                forced to give up the major part of their income without any
                compensation whatsoever.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is surely not right that a man can be
                stopped from doing his legitimate work. What are we stopping
                them for? This country had the greatest asset of any country in
                Europe — the fishing grounds. What has it done? It has thrown
                them away. I am from Northern Ireland, but in Europe today
                Spaniards can get up and tell me of their right to fish my
                fishing grounds. Europe is dictating a policy to put the people
                of this part of the United Kingdom out of business altogether.
                It is not as if those men can find some other use for their
                fishing boats. One of their representatives put it to our
                Committee. He said:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;We cannot diversify by turning our
                fishing boats into golf courses.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They cannot diversify — they are just out
                on the street.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The boat owners still have to pay their
                bills, of course. They cannot let their boats rot away in port.
                Their crew members need money to live on. Could any Member of
                the House exist on £54 a week? We are asking those fishermen to
                do that. Although we have been assured that a decommissioning
                scheme is a priority, by the time it appears it may be too late
                for many of them. They will already be out of business. Remember
                that in any decommissioning scheme the Government are going to
                claw back all the money that fishermen ever received in grants.
                Therefore, even if it were a good decommissioning scheme,
                fishermen would probably have nothing left at the end.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Financial aid is needed immediately. Why can
                we not have a scheme that would compensate the owners adequately
                for tying their boats up for this short period? Why can we not
                have that? And why can we not find ways and means to help our
                fishing industry when other countries can? Article 16 of EU
                Regulation 2792/99 makes it perfectly clear that payment of
                compensation is specifically permitted not only to fishermen and
                owners of vessels, but to the processing industry affected by
                stock recovery plans. That is contained in European legislation.
                Why can that not apply to us? When our Committee put that to the
                Minister on 5 March, her response was to agree that the rules do
                allow compensation, but that it was not practical to pursue the
                proposal for this year’s closures. The compensation was there,
                yet those closures came upon us this year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Why is there no representation to Europe now?
                Why are we not knocking on the door? What about Mr&nbsp;Fischler’s
                recent statement? The Minister has given the Committee an
                undertaking to carry out an assessment of the effects of this
                year’s closures and consult with the other Fisheries Ministers
                on the arrangements for next year. Next year will be too late.</p>

                A crew on a wage of £54 a week is hardly an economic statistic
                of which the Minister or anyone in the Assembly can be proud.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The way in which the fishing industry has
                been treated is evidence of a deeper problem — the way that
                the UK Government enforce European Union Regulations. Britain
                always enforces the rules to the maximum — to the absolute
                letter of the law — while other European partners continue to
                do exactly as they please, to their benefit and to suit their
                community. Our fishermen take care to conserve fish stocks,
                especially of young fish, yet our European partners sweep the
                seabed, eliminating young fish in the process and destroying the
                future raw material of the fishing industry. That vital raw
                material ends up being fed to animals, not even to humans. That
                is a crazy and irresponsible attitude. As a country we are going
                to have to address the issue of the difference between the
                levels of enforcement of European Regulations throughout the
                Community as a matter of urgency.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A new generosity of spirit needs to enter the
                relationship between the Department of Agriculture and Rural
                Development and the fishing industry. The Ministry of
                Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF) does not compensate in
                the event of a tie-up of fishing boats. That is bad policy and
                flies in the face of European Union Regulations that allow for
                compensation in the event of tie-up for fish stock recovery
                purposes. Only yesterday ‘The Times’ demanded that MAFF be
                closed down. The conduct of MAFF is hardly a good example for
                our Department in Northern Ireland. The Department of
                Agriculture and Rural Development should be following the
                European norm rather than the bad administrative example set by
                MAFF.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is not enough for the Minister to say that
                she will look at this in the next round. The hardship caused by
                the tie-up of boats is being felt now. Relief is needed now. The
                Department treats the fishing industry in niggardly ways. It
                should remember that this is the second year of closures for
                Northern Ireland trawlermen, while it is only the first year for
                the North Sea fishermen. The situation is therefore more serious
                here. The Irish Government do not even charge their fishermen
                for lighthouses, which they no longer use in any case. However,
                we do charge for lighthouses — because MAFF says that we
                should.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not getting at our Minister, as I know
                that she has a very difficult job to do. However I ask her to
                remember that our fishermen cannot, unlike their Southern
                counterparts, benefit from fishing in fishing boxes that are not
                closed. The situation is getting worse because those boxes have
                been further restricted since 2000. Their situation is so much
                more serious that the Department must consider special status
                for them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of Agriculture and Rural
                Development could make representations on behalf of the fishing
                industry. That would be of immediate benefit. I am thinking of
                the boundary of the Irish Sea cod fishery, which has been
                restricted to 4°50’ west. This should be returned to 5° west
                as it was in 2000 since that will cause confusion for both the
                fishermen and the inspectorate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The haddock fishery derogation should have
                been extended until 30 April 2001, for example. The cut-off date
                — 22 April — was a Thursday, which did not even allow for a
                full week’s fishing for our fishermen. Those are small
                matters, but in a situation like this, even small things can
                help. The deal that those fishermen have received so far is so
                niggardly — especially in the light of the further closures in
                2001 — that they merit special status.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those proposals have got to be put forward to
                help our industry survive. If not, the fishing industry will
                face the same problems as many other parts of the agriculture
                industry. It is not going to be here in a couple of years’
                time.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Madam Deputy Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I remind Members that it is not normal
                practice to refer to people in the Gallery.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGrady:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall certainly not refer to the welcome
                that one would give to the people in the Gallery, which is
                forbidden by you, Madam Deputy Speaker.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion. However, I have one
                small, or perhaps large, difficulty with it. That is the
                intention to provide short-term financial assistance to the
                fishing industry. That is our immediate problem, but the real
                problem is much bigger than that and much more of a long-term
                problem. In a sense, the necessity for short-term financial
                assistance is a result of the common fisheries policy, which has
                as its core the preservation of species for recovery. There is
                an inbuilt injustice when the European Union, which includes
                ourselves, requires conservation but is not prepared to pay for
                it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is really what this is all about. This
                is not the first year but the second year of the particular
                closure for white fish fishing. Last year was the same as this
                year. There is double jeopardy this year because other fishing
                grounds, which were a temporary alternative, are now also
                closed. As other Members have said, from Friday 23 March until
                30 April — a five-week period — boats in Kilkeel, Ardglass
                and Portavogie are tied up because they have nowhere to fish for
                their traditional catch. Unless, and this is the contradiction,
                they change their gearing and fish for nephrops. However, we
                have a problem with nephrops because this year the European
                Commission also reduced the total allowable catch of nephrops by
                10%.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are a series of inbuilt contradictions
                that are not the fault of the local Northern Ireland fishing
                industry, but the fault, or design, of the European Union. That
                is a grave injustice, given that the Northern Ireland fishermen
                and their organisations have constantly supported the
                conservation aspects of their industry.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One could argue that the Northern Ireland
                fishing fleet has made the greatest proportional sacrifice in
                the entire European Union through its contribution to
                conservation. Not only that, it has been proactive in proposing
                schemes to aid recovery plans for different species, yet those
                schemes have not been adopted. The Northern Ireland fishing
                industry has made the most major contribution, as we can easily
                see. The fleet has already been reduced by 30% — from around
                240 boats to roughly 170 boats. That is an enormous proportional
                contribution, and it has not been matched by other EU member
                states. It is ironic that the Republic of Ireland has the
                ability to increase its fishing efforts while we in Northern
                Ireland have the disability of decreasing our fishing efforts,
                even though — if I may use a cliché — we are literally
                fishing in the same pool.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another matter that strikes me as odd is
                that, away back in 1993, the European Commission made a special
                report on the Northern Ireland fishing industry. I remember
                quoting from it on one of my visits to Brussels. It said quite
                clearly that the Northern Ireland fishing industry and its major
                fishing grounds were a special case. Because of the industry’s
                importance to the community and the onshore development that
                arises from it, and because it creates 50% of the employment in
                the fishing towns and villages, it is a special factor. It is
                also a special factor because, believe it or not, the Irish Sea
                is a special ecological biomass for the recovery of species.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The European Union said that in 1993, yet we
                have been unable to get a UK Government to pursue that special
                case, because it did not include the other ports around Great
                Britain. I remember, late night after late night at the House of
                Commons, making that plea, which always fell on deaf ears. As a
                result we have the problem of penetrating the apparently
                impenetrable blockade from Belfast to London to Brussels.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must, in some way, create protocols by
                which that would happen.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.00 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members have correctly and eloquently put on
                record the statistics that reflect the horrific situation that
                the fishing industry is in. Given the time constraints it is not
                appropriate to repeat those, but there are three issues that
                must be addressed as a matter of some immediacy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first is the decommissioning scheme that
                was to have been put in place. I know that it has been held up
                pending agreement on the transitional Objective 1 programme. Now
                that that has been agreed, I hope that we are ready to move on
                that as soon as the other rules and regulations — which have
                nothing to do with the fishing industry — have been approved.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have some misgivings about a
                decommissioning scheme, even though it is absolutely essential.
                I am terrified that some day, if we pursue this avenue and not
                other avenues, the Northern Ireland fishing fleet will reach a
                critical point where it can no longer sustain itself or the
                onshore factories and products that are so dependent upon it. We
                shall probably not know when that time will be until it arrives,
                but I am very wary of pursuing decommissioning with negative,
                rather than positive, action.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Meanwhile, we have skippers and crewmen tied
                up for the next number of weeks when they could be enjoying
                lucrative fishing. That is not their fault. It is the result of
                EU Regulations. Funding apparently could not be made available,
                although I have yet to be convinced of that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unfortunately I must scrap most of what I
                wanted to say today. However, there was a debate in the House of
                Commons on 25 January in which the Parliamentary Secretary to
                the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food said that he
                would not rule anything out as regards urgent financial
                arrangements for the fishing industry. I took that in the
                positive sense, but it seems that I should have taken it in the
                negative sense — that he would rule nothing in. Nothing at all
                has happened on that issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, in relation to the
                &quot;tie-up&quot; proposals — and I know that that term is
                not liked — we are dealing with close working units of boat,
                crew and skipper. If those people have to stay ashore and take
                other jobs — albeit perhaps temporary ones — there is a
                danger that the skills, along with the total heritage of
                knowledge, will be dissipated and not brought to bear again on
                the industry. That can never be recovered — and certainly not
                in one generation. That aspect concerns me greatly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thirdly, we were promised that the further
                10% reduction on nephrops, which was applied to assist cod
                recovery, would be lifted somewhat were statistics available to
                show that that percentage was not as high as the EU set it out
                to be. It was not as high — I think that the figure was around
                0·2% — and therefore it was not a meaningful figure in terms
                of that restriction. The restriction must be removed
                immediately.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With 2,500 people dependent on the fishing
                industry, I want to see at least those three issues addressed
                immediately. Finally, I regret that the motion was not allowed
                to have total cross-community support, as was intended at the
                meeting in Portavogie. South Down Members were to be asked to
                sign the motion, but that did not happen.</p>

                In supporting the motion, and asking for short-term financial
                assistance for the fishing industry, the Department of
                Agriculture and Rural Development must strike a balance and
                address the long-term problems that the fishing fleet faces.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is unfortunate that on 21 March, when
                meeting the fish producers, the Minister, Ms Rodgers, appeared
                once again to rule out any form of &quot;tie-up&quot; scheme.
                The Minister must realise that 2,500 people are employed in the
                sea fishing industry. The problem affects not only the
                fishermen, but businesses and employment — in fact the whole
                economy. The fishing industry will lose out if we do not support
                it and provide it with what it needs. Can we afford to create
                such a situation in another industry? My constituency of South
                Down is feeling the effects of foot-and-mouth disease. The
                fishing industry has been the backbone of areas of South Down,
                such as Kilkeel, Portavogie and Ardglass, for many years. There
                are 2,500 people employed in sea fishing, and up to 50% of that
                workforce comes from Ardglass, Kilkeel and Portavogie.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 1999, £2·6 million worth of fish and
                shellfish was landed in the north of Ireland, and a further £70
                million was added to the value of the industry by 44 local
                processing companies. The introduction of the Irish Sea cod
                recovery programme and the closure of fishing grounds have had a
                great impact on the fishing industry. Our fishing fleet has
                shrunk by 30% over the past 10 years, and there are only 170
                fishing vessels more than 10 metres in length left.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our fishing industry has never depended on
                tie-up schemes, compensation or subsidies. The current proposals
                for tie-up schemes have been forced on us by the British
                Government and the EU. The fishermen want to go to sea and earn
                a living. They do not want to see the slow death of the fishing
                industry or the devastation that that will bring to the fishing
                communities’ economy. The 9·6% increase in the budget for the
                Department of Agriculture and Rural Development provided the sea
                fisheries division with an extra £125,000. However, all of that
                additional money has been spent on enforcing the cod recovery
                programme.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The delay in the decommissioning of fishing
                vessels is linked to the delay in transitional Objective 1
                funding. We need more action and more money. Fishermen were told
                in November 1999 that the impact of the cod recovery plan would
                be offset. We are now in the second year of closure. We need
                legislation, and I am sure that we shall get all-party support
                for that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have been waiting for an announcement on
                the decommissioning of fishing vessels for 18 months. It is sad
                that, while other EU fishing fleets are expanding, EU rules,
                regulations and closures mean that decommissioning our fleet is
                the only option for many fishermen. We need assistance for
                decommissioning for those who want to leave the industry and
                financial assistance for those who want to stay.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many fishermen who have traditionally fished
                off the County Down coast have been forced to fish in the North
                Channel. Those fishermen face closure because of the EU decision
                on the cod recovery programme that was made on 13 February. Next
                year, the closure in the North Channel and the Irish Sea will
                happen together. Where will our white fish fleet go? This is the
                only area with a recovery plan that includes inshore water.
                Fishermen here do not have the opportunity to fish away from
                close fishing grounds, and there is no reason why the financial
                problems that we faced last year will not be repeated — in
                fact, they will be far worse — owing to the additional
                closures.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need an immediate financial package for
                the white fish fleet. There are 13 boats tied up in Kilkeel, and
                they are losing their crews because there is no money to pay
                them. Financial aid has been introduced by other EU member
                states: Holland, Belgium, France and the South of Ireland, but
                not here. Go raibh míle maith agat.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ford:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many of the problems experienced by the
                fishermen have been aired in the Chamber today. There has been
                considerable unanimity. I shall not repeat all that has been
                said. I congratulate the six Members for Strangford on working
                together to bring such an essential topic to the Chamber. I
                apologise on behalf of Kieran McCarthy, who is elsewhere on
                Assembly business. I shall do my best to speak for him. As a
                representative of South Antrim who lives in a rural area, I know
                more about the other areas for which the Department of
                Agriculture and Rural Development has responsibility than I do
                about the fishing fleet. During Committee meetings here and on
                the occasion on which we met them in the three fishing ports —
                with rather exciting results — fishermen’s representatives
                have made the Agriculture Committee aware of the problems that
                the industry is having. It is obvious that something must be
                done to help them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The necessity for conservation measures is a
                matter for debate. Unfortunately, it is considered only in the
                latter part of the year, just before the Fisheries Council
                meets, leaving little time to plan for what will happen in the
                springtime. We all know, of course, that counting fish numbers
                for quotas is an inexact science. The Minister has acknowledged
                that counting sheep numbers in recent weeks has been a bit of a
                problem; sheep, at least, have the decency to stay on the
                surface of the land, although we cannot necessarily be sure
                which bit of the surface they are on. Let us assume that the
                conservation measures required by Brussels are accurate. Eddie
                McGrady said correctly that we should not discuss only the
                short-term problems; there is a long-term issue. Notwithstanding
                that, what can the Minister do in the short term to deal with
                the immediate problem that faces fishermen?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no doubt that the decommissioning
                scheme is somewhat belated. I am not sure whether it is welcome,
                but it is almost certainly necessary to allow people who are
                reaching the end of their career to depart from the industry
                with a degree of dignity. Today, we must consider what we should
                do, not for the people who are prepared to decommission their
                vessels but for those who wish to continue in the fishing
                industry and who have a long-term future there. That has not
                been addressed properly, and the decommissioning scheme is all
                that is on offer.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Concerns about the implementation of the cod
                recovery programme have been highlighted already. There is the
                question of the diversion to fishing for nephrops and all the
                problems and additional difficulties that that may create. It is
                noticeable that there has been wider agreement than we would
                normally expect on the tie-up scheme because of that difficulty.
                It is perhaps the first time that fishermen and conservationists
                have agreed that a tie-up scheme could serve the economic needs
                of fishermen in the short term and the need for conservation of
                fish stocks in the long term. That has not been given the
                attention that it should have been given in recent weeks.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A few weeks ago, the fishermen gave the
                Committee details of what their needs are, and the Anglo-North
                Irish Fish Producers Organisation Ltd (ANIFPO) put out a
                detailed plan as to how such a scheme could be implemented. So
                far, the only response we seem to have received from the
                Minister and her officials in the Department of Agriculture and
                Rural Development is that it is not really the done thing in UK
                policy and that up to the present it has not happened.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The fishermen — and MLAs — might
                reasonable ask what is the point of devolution if the Minister
                of Agriculture and Rural Development is not in a position to
                look to the real needs of Northern Ireland and forget what is
                done in England, Scotland and Wales. As Northern Ireland
                representatives, we expect our Ministers to respond to the needs
                of Northern Ireland and not to take the view that Whitehall may
                not approve. Indeed, the Minister of Agriculture and Rural
                Development has given us some very positive examples of that.
                When the issue of beef support came up a while ago she produced
                a scheme that suited Northern Ireland better than that which was
                being implemented in England, Scotland and Wales. She exercised
                her discretion then.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is absolutely no doubt that she has
                exercised considerable discretion regarding the foot-and-mouth
                disease crisis. She has made a much stronger case for Northern
                Ireland than that which has been made in Great Britain. We must
                ask her what she is now going to do on behalf of the fishermen.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There have been many clichés recently. It
                has been said that fishermen are experiencing something similar
                to foot-and-mouth disease, but I do not believe that to be the
                case. What they are going through is something more like
                foot-and-mouth disease, BSE and swine vesicular disease all
                wrapped together. They are now experiencing their second year of
                crisis. There has been some aid for the beef industry and for
                pig producers in the past. However, there has been absolutely
                nothing of short-term benefit, and almost nothing of long-term
                benefit, for fishermen.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is why we must ask the Minister to give
                us a real answer; not just some hopes and recitations as to what
                is being done by the MAFF-approved decommissioning scheme.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Short-term aid is needed for fishermen
                because they have had to make short-term decisions. They are
                faced with the situation whereby the Fisheries Council decides,
                just before December, what is going to happen a few months
                later. I do not know how anyone running a business, especially
                one such as fishing or farming, is expected to take decisions
                three months before serious changes are to be implemented
                because a diktat appears when the Council of Ministers meets. In
                the face of the short-term decisions that are made affecting
                fishermen, they have every right to make the case for short-term
                aid to help them cope. That is what would happen in other
                aspects of agriculture.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a case for a tie-up scheme. Other
                Members have already elaborated on it and I shall not go through
                it again. The case is there; it is just, and it is reasonable.
                It is essential so that stocks can recover and fishermen who
                wish to continue in the industry can prepare for the future. I
                trust that the Minister will listen to the unanimous view that
                is being expressed in the Chamber.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr C Wilson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion. I congratulate Mr
                Shannon on the very thorough manner in which he has laid out the
                case for the Northern Ireland fishermen. I would like to thank
                Mr Alan McCulla, the chief executive of ANIFPO, for the
                information he provided and for how well he has represented the
                views of the fishermen.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To back up what Mr Ford has said, the motion
                is supported by all the elected representatives for Strangford
                and the other areas in which fishing takes place. Undoubtedly,
                the question on the lips of the fishermen from Portavogie, which
                is within my constituency, Ardglass and Kilkeel will be,
                &quot;Is the Assembly going to be part of the solution to our
                problems or will it simply add another tier of
                bureaucracy?&quot;. The question does bear scrutiny, because we
                have heard the view of elected representatives from all parties
                that, to a large extent, bureaucracy is hampering our fishing
                industry.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I refer to a letter from the Minister of
                Agriculture and Rural Development, Ms Bríd Rodgers, to the
                chief executive of the ANIFPO. I quote from the second
                paragraph:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;I have explained to the Committee that
                it has not been policy to compensate for closures or quota
                reductions. To reverse this position would require detailed
                consultation and agreement amongst the fisheries departments in
                the member state. In addition, while there is no provision in EU
                regulation for payment of compensation in such circumstances,
                the proposed compensation must be argued and approved before the
                recovery plan is introduced.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The question that raises for the Minister
                today — and Members have already mentioned this — is why,
                considering that she has put forward a case that Brussels and
                Westminster are undoubtedly promoting, we are getting concrete
                information that suggests that the Dutch Government and their
                fishermen have reached an agreement to introduce an aid package
                that is exactly the type of scheme we seek for fishermen in
                Northern Ireland. We seek a short-term scheme to deal with the
                current problem that is facing the fishing industry here.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members have already said that what we are
                facing in Northern Ireland is the prospect of the ruination of
                the age-old tradition of fishing in our major ports of
                Portavogie, Kilkeel and Ardglass. As Dr Paisley has said, this
                is not simply the end of an industry. It will have a
                catastrophic effect on the villages and townlands in those
                areas, where 50% of the people are employed in the fishing
                industry in some shape or form. It will be particularly so on
                the Ards Peninsula and down the coast to Kilkeel.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many of the men who are sitting in the Public
                Gallery today are facing a road down which, as Mr McGrady has
                said, they do not wish to go — the road to decommissioning.
                Years ago many of them were encouraged to take out large loans
                and mortgage their homes. Those are men who have no option but
                to go with whatever scheme is available to take them out of
                their present situation, in which they risk losing everything
                that they have in the world. They do not have the luxury of any
                other options. As Mr McGrady has rightly pointed out, what we
                are looking at today is only a short-term fix, a way of dealing
                with the current crisis.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to say to the fishermen and their
                representatives that we know that they are proud men who simply
                want the right to fish. They are not looking for handouts; they
                are not looking for money to tie up their boats or destroy them.
                What they want to do is fish. The problem for those men and
                their families is that the bureaucratic system in Brussels and
                at Westminster is preventing them from doing what is their
                natural right to do.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I understand that the amount of money
                required to introduce and implement a short-term scheme for five
                weeks is relatively small — some £760,000 if my figures are
                correct. That money must be found urgently. Where there is a
                will, there is a way. I hope that when this debate is over and
                the Minister has given her reply, the fishermen will leave this
                Chamber in the knowledge that the issue will not be going away.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is not enough for parties to support the
                motion only to allow bureaucracy to be used once again as an
                excuse for failing to deliver the required money. Failure by the
                Assembly to find that money in the short term, cut through the
                red tape and deliver the money right now will mean failure for
                us and ruin for the fishing industry in Northern Ireland.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs I Robinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Three of the sectors in Strangford and South
                Down are vital to the economy — farming, textiles and fishing
                — and we all know about the decline affecting those three
                major industries. It is evident from the press releases
                published before any debate in the Assembly that the plight of
                our fishermen will receive a fair hearing. The press, in its
                coverage, has also captured the local mood, but that alone will
                not be enough. Sympathy will not pay a single wage. We do not
                want to have a nine-day wonder, marked by a good deal of talk
                and nice words without any affirmative action to match.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Farming has received a great deal of
                publicity because of BSE and the scourge of foot-and-mouth
                disease, and farmers will receive some assistance. I impress on
                Members that no one begrudges them a penny of that money,
                especially fishermen. However, we must not fail to assist the
                fishing industry, which is also facing a crisis, in every way
                that we can. The help requested by the fishermen, because of the
                cod recovery plan, will be short-term help. The closed area will
                exist for around five weeks, from now until the end of April. At
                present, boats are tied up, and they will remain so until the
                fishermen are allowed to resume fishing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us not overlook the simple fact that
                fishermen have not received one penny in subsidy — that in
                itself is a remarkable fact. This industry is worth £90 million
                a year; it is a vital part of our local economy, and it must be
                assisted to enable it to survive. Perhaps we could follow the
                example set in Scotland. Its Parliament gave fishermen more than
                sympathy — it gave them financial help. As we all know, there
                is money in the Northern Ireland system, and some of it will be
                spent in less important ways, such as on the Civic Forum, which
                costs taxpayers millions of pounds a year. The fishing industry
                is now crying out for help, and we should divert some of that
                money to the fishermen.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The fishermen do not want the Minister of
                Agriculture to say &quot;I hear what you are saying. I
                sympathise. We shall lobby Europe.&quot;, and so on. They are
                here today, and they are asking the Assembly to tell them
                exactly what will be done for them. This is a call for
                short-term aid; the fishermen are not asking for long-term aid
                today, although that must be dealt with sooner rather than
                later. They are asking for the aid that other countries, such as
                Spain, Italy, Belgium and Holland, are giving to their fishing
                industries. These European countries have all given assistance
                under article 16 of the EU Regulation 2792/1999.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Under the Belgian scheme, for example, 300
                boats received fixed costs as compensation for being tied up. In
                Holland, £7,000 was paid to each owner for eight consecutive
                days when their boats were tied up. No wonder they were happy
                with the scheme. The Spanish authorities gave their fishermen a
                massive 60 million euros. Of course some countries just ignore
                the regulations, which were so slavishly imposed on us. France,
                for example, failed to set appropriate rules for use of quotas
                and also failed to monitor fishing and the enforcement of
                regulations. Even more striking, why are the fishing fleets of
                other countries increasing in numbers when ours is decreasing?
                The Republic of Ireland has recently taken possession of 16 new
                trawlers. How can that be? Where is the level playing field?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">According to the Department’s figures,
                there are 344 locally licensed vessels.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.30 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Almost 700 people are directly employed in
                catching and more than 1,000 in processing. Those figures are
                probably an underestimate, as many interests directly depend on
                fishing. The number of people employed probably amounts to
                2,500.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of more significance is that half the working
                population in Ardglass, Kilkeel and Portavogie is directly
                employed in fishing. We are dealing here with real people with
                real needs who will not have any income at all for the next five
                weeks.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The fishermen have not been idle throughout
                all this. They have written, they have lobbied, they have done
                all they can to persuade, but it seems that so far they have not
                been successful. Therefore, they are here today to look to their
                own Assembly and to ask for help.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are small steps that can be taken
                immediately. Let the Minister tell us, for example, that the
                payment of light use will be removed. The Minister has pledged
                to remove that. Can we be told today that she has at last been
                successful? If not, why has that issue not been resolved? It
                would at least help in a small way to alleviate hardship.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I draw Members’ attention to the letter
                sent by Dr Paisley on behalf of the Agriculture Committee, which
                set out the case for the fishermen. Although that letter was
                specific, the response from the Department gave no indication of
                any real and practical help. The fishermen do not want to have
                repeated back to them what their problems are. They already know
                only too well. What they want to hear are the measures that will
                be introduced to help them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We all know that fishermen take great risks
                to bring in their valuable harvest, which contributes much to
                the Northern Ireland economy. That deserves recognition and the
                DUP recognises the importance of the fishing industry in
                Northern Ireland to the lives and incomes of those who live in
                the fishing communities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, what saddens me is that, all across
                Europe, Parliaments fight tooth and nail to protect their own
                industries. Time after time the Spanish, for example, get
                concession after concession. Meanwhile, all the cutbacks and
                hardships seem to fall on the Northern Ireland fishing industry
                without there being any help or compensation. Is that fair? Can
                the Assembly look those fishermen in the eye and say, &quot;You
                are on your own&quot;? They did not do so in Scotland. On the
                contrary, they gave them help. Can we afford to do less? The
                Minister must be more assertive in dealing with MAFF.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Are we exaggerating all this? Ask the
                fishermen whether all this is exaggerated, whether they have
                money coming in, whether they have money to pay wages, whether
                their boats are tied up, whether the banks have started to look
                for repayments. Who would dare tell them that they are not a
                deserving case? Ask those who have walked away from the fishing
                industry why they did so. They will say that they had no money
                coming in to pay wages and bills.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have all the evidence before us and now is
                the acid test. What will the Assembly do? It will not take much
                money. Approximately £3,300 per vessel per week — the total
                will depend on the number of vessels involved — will give much
                needed help to those whose entire industry is facing
                catastrophe.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Minister’s written response
                that the vessel decommissioning scheme is a priority. However,
                when will it be finalised? Indeed, when can it start? Must those
                fishermen wait until they are bankrupt? Those are central
                questions. Why could not the decommissioning scheme have been
                introduced at the same time as the cod recovery programme?
                Besides, what is wrong with our fishing industry that the
                fishermen have, it seems, only the option of decommissioning,
                when other countries not only get help but increase their fleet?
                How can that be? Is that right?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With each year’s closure, the problems for
                fishermen are compounded. I welcome the Minister’s move to get
                more training for fishermen, but that will not produce food on
                the table today. I also welcome her intention to carry out an
                assessment of this year’s closure. However, what amazes me is
                that we already had one year of closure. All we need to do is
                assess that to know what the impact has been and will be. Why
                can that not be done?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That again will not pay the bills that need
                to be paid now. What we need is a full meeting with MAFF. It
                seems to me that MAFF is the weakest link in all of this. It
                does not appear to be doing all that is necessary. After this
                debate is over, we need a meeting involving the Chairperson of
                the Agriculture Committee, Members from constituencies that are
                directly affected by the cod recovery programme and
                representatives of the fishing industry.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With the support and backing of the Assembly,
                the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development should seek an
                urgent meeting with MAFF to discuss those issues and secure a
                positive result.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Hamilton:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion in the hope that it will
                highlight the fact that the Northern Ireland fishing industry
                faces as uncertain a financial future as the farming industry. I
                hope that the Minister and her Department will act immediately
                to introduce measures that will be meaningful and practical for
                those who earn their living from the sea. Mr Shannon and many of
                the Members who have spoken have given the financial facts of
                the current plight faced by fishermen. I do not intend to repeat
                those figures. Instead, I aim to concentrate the mind of the
                House, and especially that of the Minister, on the reality of
                the present situation for those who rely on fishing for a
                living.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For the next five weeks, the white fish
                fleet, which operates out of ports such as Portavogie, Ardglass
                and Kilkeel, will simply have nowhere to go. It has nowhere to
                fish, and it has nothing to do. That is the bottom line of the
                current crisis, which is a result of the latest restrictions
                announced by Brussels.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, although the right to fish may stop,
                other things do not: banks still expect loans to be met; it is
                necessary to keep paying insurance bills; and the costs and
                charges for hiring equipment must still be met. As well as the
                right to fish, all that will stop are the wages of crews
                employed on the affected vessels, together with a reduction in
                revenues at processing plants et cetera. Unless some sort of aid
                is provided over the next crucial five-week period there is a
                distinct possibility that a substantial part of the Northern
                Ireland fishing fleet will go out of business. The Assembly, and
                especially the relevant Department, should be moving heaven and
                earth to prevent that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unfortunately, that does not seem to be what
                is happening. Compared to the compensation efforts made in the
                agriculture sector, the response of the Department to the
                fishing crisis has — to say the very least — been weak. We
                are told that the policy has not been to compensate for closure
                or for quota restrictions. As all Members know, policy can be
                changed. It can be changed, Minister, if the will exists to
                change it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department admits that there is provision
                to pay compensation, but that it must be argued and approved
                before the recovery plan is implemented. However, the Dutch
                Government are introducing an aid package to assist their
                fishermen following the introduction of closures associated with
                the North Sea cod recovery plan, and they are doing that without
                prior argument or approval. Again, it can be done if the will
                exists to do it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fishermen want to hear the Minister tell them
                how she is going to help them. I hope that they will receive the
                type of reply I wish to hear — that the Minister and her
                Department value and are concerned about the future of Northern
                Ireland’s fishing industry and that she will act to protect
                fishermen’s futures with the same speed she has shown towards
                the farmers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The figure involved is £760,000. That is not
                a large sum in the context of Northern Ireland’s budget.
                However, for many fishermen and their families it represents the
                difference between a future and no hope. I urge the Assembly to
                provide that hope and support.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McHugh:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.
                I too welcome the opportunity to speak on this topic. Like
                David&nbsp;Ford, I am from a rural area, although I probably
                know more about agricultural matters than about fishing. There
                are, however, great similarities between them. I visited those
                areas on one occasion with a Colleague, and we were warmly
                received. In fact, I even noticed that some people diversified
                into food production for the day.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, I am quite sure that if the Chairman
                of the Agriculture and Rural Development Committee were to visit
                some of the areas I represent, he would find that
                diversification goes on there too. I do not hold anything like
                that against people or communities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was a good learning process, however, and
                it was very useful to see at first hand the difficulties, the
                areas concerned, how the population was made up and the
                coastline, of which I was unaware until that occasion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Members, our first responsibility is to
                work for the plight of communities, wherever they are — be
                they in Fermanagh, Portavogie or anywhere else. Their problems
                and day-to-day difficulties are the same. The problem is that
                people in coastal communities have far fewer options in respect
                of what they can do should their main industry fail.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I think that the Chairperson said earlier
                that this was a historic problem — a historic failure in terms
                of our negotiations when entering the EU. The natural resources,
                which existed for those populations and communities, were simply
                negotiated away in favour of other things for other parts of our
                industry. To a large degree we lost our fishing grounds all
                around the coast of Ireland to people such as the Spanish, who
                moved in with factory ships and for the most part cleaned the
                waters out.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Others have already mentioned the facts.
                Fishing is important to the area — 50% of the civilian
                workforce are involved in that industry in Ardglass, Kilkeel and
                Portavogie. In 1993 — I think that another Member mentioned
                this — a report stated that fishing in that area should be
                maintained as a priority, because those communities had very few
                options, if any, to move into any other type of industry.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The fleet in the South of Ireland was able to
                be increased by 36%, whereas that in the North has had to suffer
                a 30% reduction. That highlights the commitment of the
                Governments, North and South. The commitment of the Government
                in the South — and this was pointed out to us by the
                representatives of those in the fishing industry on whose behalf
                they negotiated — was massively different from that of MAFF
                and the British Government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not blame our Minister, for she had very
                little to do with it. What the British Government want to do and
                how they see policy in England as opposed to the north Down
                coast — or any part of Ireland for that matter — and,
                indeed, the importance they attach to those communities is
                probably beyond her scope.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is the difficulty. The problem that one
                will have to surmount is to try to convince a Government that
                are totally biased in respect of small communities and people
                who are meaningless to them in terms of their overall plan. That
                will not be easy to do.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I mentioned MAFF in GB and British Government
                policies. British Government policies on agriculture and fishing
                — and there are similarities between the two — are
                unsuitable here. They are unsuitable for fishing and small
                fishing villages here. When the British Government go to Europe
                to negotiate on behalf of the fishermen, that is how they
                operate. In fact, we are now in a position in which BSE and the
                foot-and-mouth disease problem have probably overshadowed the
                present attempts by the fishing communities to negotiate. This
                is an important time for them, but they are likely to be pushed
                into the background. They are now expected to tie up their
                industry more than a month, and that means a loss of income.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.45 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The representatives of the fishing
                communities, particularly Dick James and Alan McCulla, were very
                forceful in getting their message across to the Agriculture and
                Rural Development Committee. There is no question of that. They
                did a particularly good job in comparison with almost everyone
                else who presented issues to the Committee. They tried to get
                their message through to the Committee. The problem is that the
                Committee cannot impact beyond advising the Minister. It is for
                the Minister to work with Nick Brown and others in the British
                Government to try and make things happen in terms of action that
                will be of some use and some benefit in those communities. That
                is the problem. However, the Agriculture and Rural Development
                Committee will do all it can to represent the views and issues
                that those people brought to the Committee.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The fishing community has had problems in
                trying to alleviate a situation in which all they wanted was
                some financial assistance and short-term compensation for losses
                last year of approximately £6 million. They will have no income
                for more than a month. They have costs and bank charges to pay,
                and they may have to risk their lives at other times of the year
                to go out and fish when the weather is unsuitable. That has to
                be taken into account. I do not know whether MAFF or any other
                British Government Department takes that into account when
                making its policies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Owing to the foot-and-mouth disease, the
                Agriculture Minister and the Department asked people to close
                their industries and businesses voluntarily. They did not force
                them to close, because if they had done so compensation would
                have had to be paid. I wonder whether there is anything in that
                for the fishermen. They are being forced to close down their
                businesses for a period.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion. It is timely in
                representing the views of the communities in the areas
                mentioned. Go raibh maith agat.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I congratulate my Friend Mr Shannon for
                raising this issue, ably supported by Mrs Robinson. It is a
                timely motion, and it is appropriate — with all the noise and
                clamour about foot-and-mouth disease — that we remember that
                another crucial aspect of Northern Ireland’s rural economy is
                in dire straits.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the disadvantages of speaking late in
                a debate is that many of the points have been made. I apologise
                to Mr Shannon for being late, but on the basis that the debate
                was to begin at 6.00 pm I arranged a meeting in Kilkeel — of
                all places — for 2.30 pm. I managed to get that over with
                fairly quickly and came here to be in time for the latter part
                of the debate.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Shannon:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Did you drive slowly?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Wells:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I certainly did not.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are talking about an industry that
                represents 50% of civilian employment in Kilkeel and Ardglass,
                both of which are in South Down. Both communities depend on
                three pillars for their economy: fishing; agriculture and
                tourism. Sadly, today’s announcement, plus the sheep grazing
                ban on the Mournes, will mean that tourism and farming in South
                Down is going to go through a difficult period.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister has been concentrating on the
                foot-and-mouth crisis — and justifiably so — but I have a
                sneaking suspicion that that concentration has meant that the
                needs of the white fish fishermen in Northern Ireland have been
                ignored. I hope to produce some evidence of that later in my
                contribution.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The fishing industry is already struggling as
                a result of the cod recovery plan of 2000. Many Members will
                remember attending a very heated meeting in the Stormont Hotel
                about a year ago at which this issue was discussed in some
                detail by the representatives of the fishing community. At least
                there were alternatives in 2000. The haddock fishery could be
                pursued and some fishing grounds were still open to the Kilkeel
                and Ardglass fleets.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This year, they find themselves with no
                alternative but to tie up their trawlers. Unfortunately the bank
                manager and the insurance companies do not take the same
                attitude. There is no moratorium on interest charges. Insurance
                companies still want their premiums, and harbour dues still must
                be paid, so, while fishermen’s debts continue to mount, they
                have no way of realising an income. Normally in such situations
                we are asked, &quot;What is the alternative?&quot; — that
                question has been ringing in Members’ ears for three years —
                but the fishing representatives have themselves provided the
                Minister with a realistic alternative that would only cost
                around £750,000.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That may sound like a great deal of money,
                but compared with the vast amount of money that has been poured
                into agriculture in the form of subsidies, it is a drop in the
                ocean. It is also a drop in the ocean in comparison with the
                Minister’s present budget for the next two financial years. If
                a minimum of economies were made, that money could be found
                within her budget. I wrote to the Minister about that subject,
                as did many others. I must ask whether the Minister foresaw this
                situation? If not, why not? I detect from the paperwork that the
                Department was caught unawares. There is absolutely no excuse
                for being caught unawares, and for two reasons: first, there was
                every likelihood of a second recovery plan being introduced for
                this year; secondly, the Minister had been warned many times by
                representatives of the fishing industry.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Over the past few weeks, my fax machine has
                been red hot with warnings from representatives that unless the
                Department does something, the fishermen will be in dire
                trouble. When Mr&nbsp;McCulla and Mr&nbsp;McGrady met the
                Minister last week she did not even seem to have given the
                proposals adequate consideration. The response was a blanket
                &quot;No&quot;. That was very much in line with a letter that
                she sent to Mr&nbsp;McCulla on 12&nbsp;March 2001, in which she
                said:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;I have explained to the Committee that
                it has not been policy to compensate for closures or quota
                reductions. To reverse this position would require detailed
                consultation and agreement among the Fisheries Departments in
                the member states.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If that is true, why did the Dutch Government
                immediately implement a compensation aid package for their
                fishermen simply because they blocked the port of Rotterdam? If
                the Minister is under the same constraints as other EU&nbsp;Ministers,
                why could an aid package be implemented in Holland and not in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland? Why have the Irish Government been
                flexible in their interpretation of the regulations to enable
                generous training grants for attendance at courses et cetera?
                Why could the Minister not have shown the same flexibility? We
                are told that nothing can be done:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;In addition, while there is provision
                in the EU&nbsp;regulation for payment of compensation in such
                circumstances, the proposed compensation must be argued and
                approved before the recovery plan is introduced.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The fishermen of south&nbsp;Down want to know
                whether the Minister argued that case in Europe? If she did, why
                was she less successful than her Irish and Dutch counterparts?
                If we are to be effective as an Assembly in representing the
                people we cannot simply say that nothing can be done or that
                consultation is required, while we watch equivalent Ministers in
                other countries deliver for their fishermen. That vital point
                must be addressed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Proposals were made for a tie-up scheme that,
                at a conservative estimate, would cost just £3,300 per trawler
                per week. That estimate is an indication of the outgoings of
                trawlermen who will have no income over the next five weeks. The
                tie-up scheme seemed to be watertight, but it has not been
                introduced, and we want to know why. The implications of that
                decision go much further than the fishing industry in Kilkeel
                and Ardglass. I have no experience of Portavogie. However,
                Members such as Mrs Robinson and Mr&nbsp;Shannon have been more
                than capable of representing their needs. The knock-on effect on
                the Kilkeel community is much more dramatic than fishermen
                simply having to tie up their trawlers. At least
                13&nbsp;trawlers in that harbour are permanently tied up, and
                workers are being lost — the men are getting no wages, so they
                are seeking work elsewhere. There is also a knock-on effect on
                shops, post offices, banks and the other small businesses in
                Kilkeel, which account for much more than the £760,000 that we
                are talking about today.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Rodgers can strike a blow for this
                Province, and she could do so much to save a community that is
                going through so many difficulties by saying, &quot;I am going
                to tear up the regulations and use the power given to me by the
                Assembly and the Government. I am going to step out of line with
                my colleagues in Wales because I believe in this fishing
                industry in Northern Ireland. I believe in an industry that has
                not taken a penny of subsidies for decades. I believe in an
                industry that is providing enormous knock-on value and
                additional employment. I am going to be brave and for this
                five-week period help the fishermen of South Down.&quot;</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We owe an enormous debt of gratitude to those
                men who have been out working in the most difficult conditions.
                Some of them have lost their lives. The very least that we can
                do is come up with the pittance they need to keep going through
                this enormously difficult period.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Agriculture and Rural
                Development (Ms Rodgers):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I realise that I only have 15 minutes. It is
                impossible to deal with all that I need to deal with in that
                time, but I shall do my best. I thank Members for the
                opportunity to address the Assembly on this very important
                sector of the Northern Ireland industry.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many Members have observed, both orally and
                in correspondence, that the problems of foot-and-mouth disease
                have diverted my attention from the problems being experienced
                by the fishing industry. Let me assure all Members that contrary
                to what Mr Shannon has said, nothing could be further from the
                truth. The very fact that I am here for two hours today while
                very serious issues are evolving outside shows my commitment to
                the fishing industry.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion has called on me to provide
                short-term financial assistance to the fishing industry to
                compensate the fishermen for the restrictions on fishing imposed
                by the cod recovery plan. I have listened carefully to what
                Members have had to say, and it is obvious that they share my
                concern for the plight of our local fishermen.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no doubt that for some members of
                the fleet the fishing opportunity will be very limited in the
                latter half of the Irish Sea cod recovery programme. That has
                been exacerbated by the west of Scotland closures referred to by
                Mr McGrady. Inevitably, that is causing financial difficulties.
                However, there is a need to balance the requirement to conserve
                the stocks with the requirement to preserve the livelihoods of
                the fishermen. If there are no fish left in the sea, we shall
                not have a fishing industry. That is the balance that must be
                struck, and it is extremely difficult.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, our fishermen appreciate that the
                closures, although painful, are agreed as one means of
                conserving fish stocks to help ensure a sustainable industry for
                the future. As Members will be aware, a number of stocks are in
                a powerless state. Mr Shannon referred to the right to fish. Of
                course fishermen have the right to fish. What I want to ensure
                is that they will be able to continue to have that right and
                that fish will be there to be fished.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I take this opportunity to thank our local
                industry for its co-operation in the handling of the current cod
                recovery plan. The vast majority of fishermen have complied with
                the rules and enabled the plan to proceed. Indeed, they have
                also contributed very effectively to the negotiations on the
                implementation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I totally reject the view that I have failed
                the fishing industry. I have worked very hard and consulted with
                it on measures that I am able to pursue to help the industry in
                the short and long terms. I shall return to those. I absolutely
                agree with Mr McGrady when he says that the short-term view is
                important, but the long-term view is also extremely important.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In relation to short-term financial
                assistance, through agreement among fisheries Ministers in
                England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland it has not been
                policy to compensate for the effects of recovery programmes.
                Given some of the comments they have made, I am almost tempted
                to think that some Members on the other side of the House have
                come around to the idea that it might be better to be part of
                the Republic of Ireland than to be part of the UK. It is not a
                cheap political point; I am simply making an observation.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Paisley’s initial remarks that the
                provision exists for compensation to be sought were correct.
                However, in a letter that I wrote to him some time back I said
                that, because it was not submitted to the European Commission by
                the member state within the approval for the plan, it is not now
                possible to have it. I also said that I could and would
                undertake to carry out an assessment of the effects of this year’s
                closures and to consult with other Fisheries Ministers on future
                arrangements. I remind the House that those arrangements have to
                be agreed among the four UK Ministers. It is a decision that has
                to be taken on an UK-wide basis. It is not for me alone to
                decide. I have to do it in conjunction with the other Ministers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, such compensation schemes have a
                limited impact. It would be impossible to introduce such a
                scheme for the current closure period as it would require prior
                EU approval on state aid, which takes considerable time to
                obtain.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall come to that if the Member will allow
                me the time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The money, even if approved, would have to be
                found against many other competing demands.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to outline the steps I have taken, as
                well as those being planned, to address the needs of the
                industry, and I assure Mr Ford that those include those wishing
                to remain in the industry as well as those wishing to leave.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the cod recovery plan we secured
                derogation for a controlled haddock fishery for the first half
                of closure. That has provided a very useful fishing opportunity
                in addition to the continued provision for nephrops fishing. The
                haddock derogation produced 26 tonnes, worth approximately
                £30,000, in its first two weeks. My officials will be
                assembling the results of this fishery to present to the
                European Commission. I hope that the experiment will prove
                useful in demonstrating the industry’s strong views on the
                potential for a clean haddock fishery.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was very disappointed, as were the
                fishermen, when the Commission imposed a 10% cut on the nephrops
                total allowable catch (TAC) at December’s Fishery Council. I
                agree with Mr McGrady’s comments on that issue. I have done
                everything in my power to have this decision reversed. I
                immediately held a meeting with my scientists to explore what
                could be done to get this under way. They have done sterling
                work in a very short time to produce an analysis that supports
                our case for retrieving TAC, and that work has been included in
                the UK case for restoration of the TAC. I have written to the
                Fisheries Minister, Elliot Morley, asking him to keep the
                pressure on the Commission to pursue the issue as a matter of
                urgency.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The results we obtained in Northern Ireland
                look as though they could help reverse the cut. The by-catch —
                as has been quite rightly stated by Mr McGrady — has been
                minimal, and that is a point in our favour. I recognise the
                importance of nephrops to our local fleet, and I am determined
                to see this through. Of course, it also has implications for the
                processing sector and the wider industry. Members should be
                aware that Northern Ireland was the first region to complete
                this work, and I want to congratulate all concerned in achieving
                that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to structural funds, Members will
                recall last week’s approval by the European Commission of the
                Northern Ireland transitional Objective 1 plan for the next six
                years. Within that, £21 million is earmarked for the fishing
                sector, and I assure Mr Ford that this is a Northern Ireland
                plan for the Northern Ireland fishing industry. Mr Murphy asked
                why I did not go ahead with the scheme: I could not go ahead
                until I had received approval.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In response to industry demands, I am
                prioritising a vessel decommissioning scheme this year. Dr
                Paisley expressed reservations to me about the decommissioning
                scheme this morning, but I pointed out to him, and I repeat now,
                that this decommissioning scheme is being introduced at the
                behest of the industry. Its representatives told me that they
                wanted it, and I have no doubt that if I were standing up here
                now saying that I had refused it I would be getting flak from
                all sides — including possibly from Dr Paisley himself — for
                not having delivered it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It will be of both short-term and long-term
                benefit to the industry. It is generally accepted that there is
                a mismatch between fishing capacity and fish stocks, often
                described as, &quot;Too many boats chasing too few fish&quot;.
                That applies widely to Europe, not only Northern Ireland. Work
                is well under way on stock recovery programmes. A
                decommissioning scheme will facilitate many of those who wish to
                leave the industry and will, I hope, result in a more viable
                future. My plan is to target both the white fish and the
                nephrops sectors through the scheme. I hope to be able to reduce
                the target sectors by some 15% and to achieve what Mr&nbsp;McGrady
                referred to as the critical mass — <i>[Interruption]</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;McGrady made an extremely
                constructive and well-informed speech.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In relation to training, in the fisheries
                plan I have allocated £50,000 per annum over the next
                three&nbsp;years to provide basic and refresher safety training,
                including risk awareness and accident prevention. That training
                will be provided locally by our group training association and
                will be free of charge to the fleet. I have no doubt that
                Members share my desire to make safety a high priority.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Moreover, and in view of the industry’s
                understandable concerns about limited fishing opportunities in
                the coming weeks, I have asked my officials to introduce
                proposals for additional training, related to the needs of the
                industry, to be delivered in the near future. I shall seek to
                ensure that that is properly resourced. The plan also has
                provision to support processing and marketing in fishery sectors
                as well as much-needed infrastructure improvement in the fishing
                ports. My Department plans to enter into discussions with the
                industry to review research and development in fishing gear and
                to examine innovations that could be incorporated into local
                trawls to improve the escapement of juvenile fish.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have been working on the issue of light
                dues. As Members will know, I have written to the Department in
                Great Britain. It has not shown any inclination to waive the
                fees. I share the wish of the industry to secure a healthy and
                viable fishing industry and I am not giving up. I want to
                continue working with the industry and to listen to their
                concerns.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I assure Mrs I Robinson that although
                Scotland has announced a £27&nbsp;million scheme, the bulk of
                that is going on decommissioning. Furthermore, Scotland has a
                larger fleet than Northern Ireland. According to my Brussels
                contacts in the fisheries directorate, none of the countries
                that has been mentioned have been given approval for a
                compensation tie-up scheme.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Shannon mentioned fishing villages. Those
                villages have benefited from both the fishing villages
                initiative and the PESCA programme during the 1994-95 round. A
                wide range of projects have been funded and are being
                implemented to help the area’s economy. Mr Shannon also
                referred to the modernisation grant. That will have to be repaid
                if the applicant is approved for decommissioning. I have no
                power to waive that regulation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Cedric Wilson mentioned other countries. I am
                not aware of any other tie-up schemes in Europe. That is a
                matter for the other member states. No other region in the UK
                has introduced a tie-up scheme. The closed box in the Irish Sea
                that was mentioned by Mr Savage is actually smaller than it was
                last year, as a result of our negotiations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We did well to achieve a five-week haddock
                derogation. Mr&nbsp;Wells was wrong. The fleet had a much better
                haddock derogation this year — five weeks with very good
                fishing opportunity, despite the weather. Mr&nbsp;Wells asked
                whether we saw that coming. He referred to a meeting that I had
                last week with Mr&nbsp;McGrady and a representative of the
                industry. It was suggested by Dr&nbsp;Paisley that I have had
                several meetings this year with the industry. In actual fact,
                that was the only meeting that I have had with the industry, not
                because I do not want to meet with it, but because I did not
                receive any requests. I am very open to requests. I meet
                regularly with everyone who asks for a meeting, and I did have
                that meeting last week. Had I had other requests, I would have
                responded to them. <i>[Interruption]</p>

                referred, which was with a representative of the industry
                accompanied by Mr McGrady, issues were raised. We did know that
                the recovery programmes were coming up. I also knew, as did the
                industry, that it would not be a one-year recovery programme,
                that it would take a number of years. I did give careful
                consideration to proposals that were put to me at the meeting
                — to which Mr Wells referred at second hand — and I gave a

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also wish to acknowledge the contribution
                made by the industry to the wider economy, and in particular to
                the cod recovery plan. Members will be interested to know that
                the European Commission has recently published its Green Paper
                on the future of the common fisheries policy. Over the next week
                I shall be launching a consultation exercise on that paper to
                ensure that the needs of the Northern Ireland fishing industry
                are factored into the debate at June’s Fisheries Council
                meeting. I fully intend to be present at that and to play a full

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am bitterly disappointed at the Minister’s
                response. Not once did she give any hope to the fishing industry

                Through the offices of Down District Council we have been asking
                for a meeting with the Minister for three months, and we are
                still waiting. When the Minister goes back to her office,
                perhaps she will ask one of her civil servants to scurry around
                the office to see whether that reminder from Down District
                Council can be found. It has been lying there for almost three
                months. Perhaps then we can have a meeting on behalf of the

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People in the Gallery may be invisible to
                you, Madam Deputy Speaker, but they are not invisible to me.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The right to fish is a core issue, and the
                Minister has not addressed it. Each and every one of the parties
                took time to deliberate on this issue, which is of great
                importance to the fishing industry.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to summarise some of the points made.
                In his introduction, Dr Paisley mentioned saving the fishermen
                from disaster and the fact that they need to earn a living but
                that there is was no room for them to diversify. Mr Savage, the
                Deputy Chairperson of the Agriculture Committee, also mentioned
                the need for a generosity of spirit between agriculture and
                fishing, and he underlined the immediacy of that need. We come
                back to that point all the time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The next time we have a debate on fishing we
                shall just let Mr McGrady speak, as he says everything for the
                rest of us. Mr McGrady said that decommissioning would be an
                integral part of the package but not the whole package. One
                point he stressed was the short-term need — financial
                assistance should be made available now.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Over the years I have sat with Mr McGrady in
                the Ards, Newry and Mourne and Down Councils looking at the
                fishing industry. Mr McGrady was at the most recent meeting to
                discuss those important issues. We are looking at a long-term
                strategy, but the issue today is to do with the cod recovery
                plan and how we are going to assist the boats with the tie-up
                scheme.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank all Members for their comments. Mr
                Ford pointed out that assistance for agriculture is already
                there, but that that same assistance has not been available for
                the fishing industry. We must look at the source of that
                assistance. All in the Chamber implore the Minister to
                acknowledge the needs of the fishing industry.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Colleague Mrs Robinson referred to the
                lack of food on the table. Is that not the very essence of this
                proposal for short-term financial assistance? We represent the
                people involved in the fishing industry, and they need something
                now to get them over the five-week period. Their bills continue
                to arrive and their debts still remain to be paid. The mortgages
                for the boat and the household bills do not simply stop. The
                Minister still does not have the compassion to understand the
                dire needs of the fishing industry.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Hamilton hoped to move heaven and earth to
                try to help. That is what we want. We want enthusiasm,
                dedication and a positive approach from the Minister. She can do
                it, and she has the power to move on this problem. I implore her
                to look at those fishing matters and to do her best to address
                the question.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Allow me to return to decommissioning, which
                was requested by the fishing industry away back in the summer of
                1999. Almost two years later we are finally looking at a
                possible decommissioning scheme. That was the only light to come
                out of the Minister’s address. Decommissioning is only part of
                the package. Today we want a tie-up scheme.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Madam Deputy Speaker, is it possible for the
                Minister to stop talking to her Colleague and listen? Let us
                listen to the issues — we are not here putting in time. We
                implore the Minister on behalf of the fishermen of the three
                villages of Portavogie, Ardglass and Kilkeel to do something for
                them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am concerned that the Minister has chosen
                to make some cheap political points today. We are not here as
                political parties; we are here on behalf of the people we
                represent to try to fight for the fishing industry.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am trying to be respectful of the Minister’s
                position, but I must remind her that, as Minister of Agriculture
                and Rural Development for Northern Ireland, she has a
                responsibility to the fishing industry. We have not had one
                glimmer of hope for the tie-up scheme.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need to conserve the fishing stocks, but
                the fishing industry also wants some help to try to overcome
                this problem. It is interesting that the World Wildlife Fund —
                a major conservation body — also agrees with the fishing
                industry. It has a joint plan. It wants to see the fishing
                industry going forward. Fishing needs to be conserved, and the
                World Wildlife Fund believes that financial assistance is vital
                for that to happen.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister said that she would need to have
                meetings with her Colleagues in Scotland and Wales. Perhaps she
                could indicate how many meetings she has had on the issue with
                the other Assemblies and what progress has been made? It would
                be interesting to see whether any meetings have taken place on a
                tie-up scheme. Let us in Northern Ireland for once not be
                subservient to the other parts of the United Kingdom. Let the
                Assembly lead the way. Let the Minister lead the way on behalf
                of the fishing industry over the tie-up scheme.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Member agree that the Minister could
                follow the example of her Dutch counterpart, who, within 24
                hours of a protest in Rotterdam harbour, was able to find 14
                million euros to help compensate her fishing fleet? Can the hon
                Lady not follow suit and do exactly the same? She would be
                applauded by the House if she did.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have some resource problems. The Member is
                talking about the Minister of a member state who has access to
                the Treasury of that member state. I am the Minister of a region
                and am not in the same position. I cannot obtain resources at
                the drop of a hat. I have to compete in the block for all of the
                resources, and there are many competing demands in Northern
                Ireland.</p>

                with the fishing organisations that she has the wherewithal to
                make some assistance available. I ask her to deliver on the
                commitment that she has given to the fishing organisations and
                elected representatives. She can help the industry, but she must
                make the effort. The tie-up scheme is what we need, and we need
                it now. Short-term help for the whole industry is needed at the
                moment. We are all aware that plenty of money is available when
                it comes to other organisations such as North/South bodies. Let
                her make money available. I implore the Minister to take the
                gracious step and help the fishing industry. It is quite clear
                to the elected representatives that no constructive response has
                been forthcoming from the Minister today.</p>
