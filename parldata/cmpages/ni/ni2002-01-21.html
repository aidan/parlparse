          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>Mr Gallagher:</p>
          </b><font SIZE="3">
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I beg to move</p>
          </font><font SIZE="1">
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That this Assembly notes the increasing
          difficulties facing those who have to rely on community care packages
          and calls on the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety
          to take action to remedy this situation.</p>
          </font><font SIZE="3">
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the mark of a civilised society is the way in
          which we care for our sick, elderly, disabled people or people with
          mental health problems, clearly we here have some way to go. A key
          component of our Health Service is what goes on under the heading
          community care. I have tabled the motion because there are glaring
          problems with that provision. When we examine what is happening on the
          ground, we see that community care is something of a misnomer.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the moment, practically every trust is reporting
          that it cannot meet the needs of those who require home help and other
          forms of domiciliary care. In many instances the community care
          budgets ran out some time ago. In my area, the Sperrin Lakeland Trust
          reports that it needs an additional £700,000 to provide for the
          assessed needs of the sick and the elderly.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In many cases, the only way in which home help
          services can be found for new patients is by cutting back on the home
          help hours of existing patients. Every week, cases are reported to my
          constituency office and, I am sure, to the offices of other Members of
          the Assembly, which show that the level of community care is
          inadequate. I know of a 90-year-old man being looked after in his home
          by his 80-year-old wife. They receive only two hours of home help a
          week. Money is so scarce in the system that the sick and the old are
          being asked by some trusts to use their own pensions and benefits to
          pay for community care packages.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not suggesting that the state of community
          care — and it is in a sorry state — is the fault of the Minister
          of Health, Social Services and Public Safety. In Britain during the
          1990s, expenditure on health and personal social services rose by 57%,
          while in Northern Ireland it rose by 35%. That shows how our Health
          Service was short-changed under direct rule. That was the difference
          in funding during the 1990s, and from reports in the media we know
          that the Health Service in Britain is breaking down. We need to have
          that historical underfunding put right and made good, and to do that
          we require the combined efforts of the Treasury, the Executive and the
          Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At Executive level, finding the resources to meet
          the pressing demand for additional domiciliary care and day-care
          packages must be made a priority. However, the crisis in community
          care is not solely about funding. There are steps that the Minister
          can and must take. The administration of the Health Service has to be
          streamlined, and the current unwieldy structures have to be sorted
          out, because they are contributing to the shambolic community care
          provision. The Health Service needs less bureaucracy and more
          efficiency, which is something that the Minister and her Department
          must tackle now.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The inability to deliver meaningful care packages
          impacts directly on other budgets and contributes directly to bed
          blocking and spending inefficiencies in the Health Service. People in
          hospitals are suffering. People are waiting for heart surgery, joint
          replacements and for fractures to be dealt with. Youngsters are
          waiting to have their tonsils removed, while their education and
          health suffer. The list is growing. We have cases of patients,
          particularly elderly people, being kept in hospital at a cost of up to
          £900 a week, and no clinical reason is given. The explanation is that
          no money is apparently available in the home help service to keep
          people in the comfort of their homes.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Why does this happen? There is clear mismanagement
          when £100 or £150 a week cannot be found for the home help service,
          and £900 is spent instead. That is being caused by our crazy maze of
          health trusts.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Places in nursing homes for those who are unable to
          return home cost between £300 and £350 a week, but no money is
          available to provide them. In one case, a lady was kept in hospital
          for eight weeks solely because no money was available to fund a place
          for her in a residential nursing home. If that one bed had been
          available during an eight-week period, how many more people could have
          been treated?</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Community care provision is also vital for cancer
          patients. There are 8,500 new cancer patients in Northern Ireland
          every year, and increasing numbers — up to 90% — are being looked
          after in the community, in accordance with medical recommendations. In
          some areas the demand for palliative care packages has increased
          rapidly. The social work department in one of Northern Ireland’s
          four cancer units reported recently that it receives an additional 17
          referrals every month. The good news is that the number of cancer
          patients who make a full recovery is on the increase, but there is a
          serious shortage of skilled staff to deliver palliative care. The
          level of that care is patchy across the North, and in some areas the
          voluntary sector is too heavily relied upon. The voluntary agencies do
          outstanding work, and we are all aware of examples of that, but that
          sector cannot be expected to do everything.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Alzheimer’s Disease Society recently issued a
          report on community care support for people who suffer from dementia.
          In Northern Ireland, 20,000 people, many of whom are under the age of
          65, suffer from dementia. That report advises that, in many cases,
          although carers felt that they needed more support, they were
          experiencing cutbacks. Seven out of 10 carers had to contend with
          regular sleep disturbances, yet help is rarely available during the
          night; the availability of such provision varies according to where
          the carer lives. That encapsulates the inconsistent approach by our
          health authorities to community care.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the most damning messages of that report is
          that many of the carers surveyed said that they found it difficult to
          obtain information from social services bodies. Many described the
          procedure as a battle. It is wrong that people who are trying to care
          at home for a family member with a distressing illness should have to
          battle to get information. The point was made in the last couple of
          weeks at a meeting of the Committee for Health, Social Services and
          Public Safety when members heard the case of a carer who had to look
          after two members of his family in distressing circumstances. That
          carer experienced great difficulty in getting any information from the
          system.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These responses sum up what many feel is wrong
          about the way in which healthcare is provided — it is no longer the
          service that it should be. It has become, from the carers’ point of
          view, a system that they do not understand. Putting aside the fact
          that money is not forthcoming, there is no excuse for the lack of
          availability of information for carers. I ask the Minister to take
          every step necessary to remedy the problem.</p>
          <i>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.15 pm</p>
          </i>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mental healthcare is another important area which,
          as many Members know, relies heavily on the voluntary sector. The
          shortage of skilled staff is a serious problem, and mental healthcare
          also suffers from the problems that affect other areas of healthcare.
          Recently, I learnt that seven people who were medically fit for
          discharge were not released from Holywell Hospital because no care
          packages were available to assist them or their families.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the other end of the spectrum, some people are
          released from hospital with little or no domiciliary care available to
          help them in their home surroundings, which is an important element of
          the recovery process. The only contact that they have is with the
          social worker who comes to assess their needs. The social worker can
          move only those individuals who have no movement onto waiting lists.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Furthermore, there is the question of parity of
          expenditure. People in rural communities are entitled to the same
          level of community care and access to services as people in urban
          areas. There is a disparity of expenditure between health boards and
          trusts on care programmes for the elderly. Some urban trusts have a
          greater per capita expenditure on such programmes. For example, in
          1999-2000, in the North and West Belfast Health and Social Services
          Trust area the per capita expenditure figure was £3,200; in the Foyle
          Trust area the per capita figure was £3,300; but in the Sperrin
          Lakeland Trust area the figure was £2,700. I will examine those
          services to check that they have been, or will be, rural proofed to
          ensure that people who live in rural areas are not being
          disadvantaged.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have mentioned only some of the anomalies,
          inadequacies and inconsistencies of the current community care
          provision. There are many other examples: stroke patients facing
          lengthy delays for physiotherapy; people waiting for assessments by
          occupational therapists for home adaptations; and people waiting for
          speech therapy — the list goes on.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister was due to receive the preliminary
          report on care in the community last year. I would like the Minister
          to announce the outcome of that review. I would also like to see a
          clear plan of action and a definite management strategy to sort out
          the mess that carries the misnomer of care in the community.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The inadequacies of the Health Service are having a
          detrimental effect, not only on the patients and those who care for
          them, but on the people who work in the service. I want to acknowledge
          the work that is done by all health workers. In the face of all the
          difficulties, they endeavour to provide the best possible care.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is not a matter of simply throwing money at the
          problem. Undoubtedly, resources are a key element in tackling the
          growing mess. However, resources must be part of a clearly developed
          strategy for the whole of the North, not a sticking plaster for the
          trust that happens to shout loudest about the crisis. If the Minister
          does not initiate such a strategy quickly, undoubtedly we will face a
          worse crisis.</p>
          <b>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker:</p>
          </b>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ten Members wish to speak in the debate, for which
          just over two hours have been set aside. Therefore I ask Members to
          accept a limit of 10 minutes for their speeches. That limit will not
          apply to the Minister, or to Mr Gallagher, who will wind up the
          debate.</p>
          <b>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Berry:</p>
          </b>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I commend Mr Gallagher for raising the important
          issue of care in the community. The motion reminds us that health
          provision is not what it should be. While newspaper headlines tell the
          public about elderly people blocking beds, they do not reveal the
          human face of those involved.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recently I had to deal with two constituents who
          had been admitted to Daisy Hill Hospital. Both were well enough to
          leave the hospital after having had successful operations and
          receiving care, but they remained there for 13 weeks. One needed a
          care in the community package that was not available at that time due
          to lack of funding. The other needed residential care, which was also
          unavailable for the same reason. The cost to the Health Service for
          those 13 weeks runs into many thousands, the vast bulk of which could
          have been saved had those patients been able to get out of hospital
          sooner. If it costs a hospital around £1,300 a patient, a week, those
          two patients were costing Daisy Hill Hospital and the trust £2,600 a
          week, which adds up to £33,000 over 13 weeks.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These are not unusual cases. The average overstay
          in some hospitals across Northern Ireland is five weeks. Hospitals are
          losing a fortune in that area alone. If each of the 150 delayed
          discharges in December and January were patients who had spent five
          extra weeks in hospital, each occupying a bed, the cost to the Health
          Service would be £975,000. That is probably a conservative figure. I
          suspect that the real cost is around £1,000,000. Had the Department
          got its act together and applied a holistic approach, it could have
          saved thousands of pounds every week for care in the community. Those
          savings could have been used to increase the money paid to the
          providers of nursing and residential homes, which are closing at an
          alarming rate. That point does not seem to have registered with the
          Department, judging by its answers to written questions on this
          important subject.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While I welcome extra resources for care in the
          community, that is only part of the problem in the Health Service. The
          Department seems unable to see the whole picture. There is a problem
          recruiting and retaining carers and home helps. That has been made
          acute in places where there are large retail centres close by.
          Recently I held discussions with the chief executives of two different
          trusts. They said that they were having a difficult time recruiting
          carers and people to look after the elderly. In some areas carers are
          leaving to take up jobs in large shopping centres and retail units
          where the pay, hours and conditions are better. There is a rising
          staffing problem, not only in hospitals but also for care in the
          community. To provide extra resources is good, but if the personnel
          are not there, we are back to square one.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What is needed is an overall approach by which
          patients can be discharged into the community or into residential
          homes on a temporary basis, with resources and staff available to
          ensure that patients do not end up in hospital unnecessarily, as they
          do at present. With a clear vision and will it is realistically
          possible to reduce bed blocking to an acceptable level without the
          expenditure of huge resources. Savings in one area will more than
          cover what is paid out in the other.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Until this problem is tackled across the board,
          piecemeal actions will not resolve it. The longer it remains
          unresolved, the bigger it will become, until hospitals are no longer
          physically able to take in any new patients. That is already happening
          on an infrequent basis. It does not take a genius to realise that at
          the current rate, it will become a permanent reality. It is important
          that this issue has been highlighted today. As Mr Gallagher said, it
          is not about funding or resources alone, but about having a holistic
          approach to the important issues of care, and carers, in the
          community.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I commend and support the motion.</p>

          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat. I commend Tommy Gallagher for
          moving the motion. I agree that we are judged by how we treat the most
          vulnerable in society. Steps must be taken within the administration
          of the Health Service. However, similar steps must be taken in the
          review of public administration. At what stage is that review? The
          Executive initiated it, but the administrative issue within the Health
          Service, boards and trusts also needs to be addressed.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Minister of Health, Social Services
          and Public Safety’s announcement of a 1,000 extra community care
          packages, which was mentioned by the last two Members who spoke. I am
          glad that the Minister is here to explain the detail of the package.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The last debate before the Christmas recess was on
          the Health Service, during which my Colleague, John Kelly, and I
          tabled an amendment that called on the Executive to provide additional
          money to tackle issues in the Health Service. That was six weeks ago.
          At what stage are we now? Every party agreed that additional money was
          needed. Areas that must be targeted include the acute sector,
          community care, young people and the elderly.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Everyone is aware of problems within the
          occupational therapy (OT) sector, which often have knock-on effects
          for community care packages. The Minister’s officials and officials
          from the Housing Executive held discussions to tackle OT waiting
          lists. Measures to solve those problems may involve simply installing
          a handrail, but a patient is unable to leave hospital until that
          handrail is installed. How have the discussions progressed? We talk
          about collective responsibility. Those issues may not necessarily be
          the responsibility of the Minister or her Department; they may be
          another Department’s responsibility. The issues must be targeted.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Tommy Gallagher said that the Personal Social
          Services (Amendment) Bill is currently at Committee Stage. I welcome
          that Bill. The Health Committee is going through it clause by clause.
          Examination of the Bill highlighted some problems that carers and
          their families face. Those problems are being targeted, and the Bill
          should be brought before the Assembly shortly.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I said, we could debate the motion all day.</p>
          <b>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker:</p>
          </b>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope not.</p>
          <b>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Ramsey:</p>
          </b>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not suggest for one minute that I will do so
          or that one problem in the Health Service is more important than any
          other. The Health Service needs substantial investment. The money must
          be provided to target the problems.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In a way, the Committee for Health, Social Services
          and Public Safety pre-empted this debate. Although the Committee
          supported the Minister’s bids and welcomed the money that was
          received, it also supported calls for additional money. The Committee,
          which closely scrutinises those issues, wrote to both the Office of
          the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister and to the Minister
          of Finance and Personnel to request an urgent meeting to discuss not
          only the money that is needed for this year and future years, but for
          the years of serious underfunding that the Health Service has endured.
          It is more than ten weeks since that meeting was requested, and it has
          yet to be timetabled.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although I welcome the additional money that was
          announced in previous months, some of that money — if not a large
          percentage of it — is a one-off.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It does not ensure forward planning or allow a
          three- year or five-year plan to be implemented. The additional money
          is a one-off. That needs to be questioned.</p>
          <i>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.30 pm</p>
          </i>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This matter is a test for the Executive because the
          Programme for Government informed us that health, along with other
          matters, was a priority. We need to do more than talk about it; we
          must ensure that the money is allocated to, and invested in, that
          priority. Rather than have announcements of one-off amounts, we should
          ensure that money is in place for the long term.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the motion and congratulate Tommy
          Gallagher for moving it. My party supports it. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
          <b>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCarthy:</p>
          </b>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I too thank Tommy Gallagher for raising this vital
          matter on the Floor of the House. Care in the community is a very
          worthwhile policy, which has the support of many people. However,
          sufficient funding is needed to deliver a good, comprehensive
          community care service. Funding is vital and must be provided. I
          appreciate the Minister’s presence today to hear our concerns.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Community care should be defined as helping those
          who cannot manage on their own at home. It means helping such people
          to live in the community in their homes or, perhaps, in sheltered
          housing or residential care. Different people need different forms of
          assistance. A range of services can enable some people to stay in
          their own homes. That is what they want, and everyone should endeavour
          to bring that about. For others, a place in sheltered housing or in
          residential care might be more appropriate.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Care in the community is sometimes thought of as
          only for people who are being discharged from hospital, but many other
          people need that extra care at home. It may involve the provision of
          aids or appliances to assist them at home, meals on wheels, a home
          help service or perhaps day-care respite. Someone with a learning
          disability or someone who has suffered a stroke might require care and
          assistance. The list goes on.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Tribute must be paid to all those who care for our
          sick or elderly people. It must be said that carers do far more than
          they are paid to do — and they do it out of love and compassion for
          the people who are so dependent on outside help.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I appeal to the Minister to ensure that sufficient
          funding is in place to meet the needs of care in the community
          throughout Northern Ireland. I support the motion.</p>
          <b>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr C Wilson:</p>
          </b>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is an important debate. In considering an
          issue which affects the most vulnerable in society — the elderly who
          are physically or mentally infirm — we need to give serious thought
          to how we deal with the crisis.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A report last year disclosed the alarming figure of
          162 delayed discharges in the Eastern Health Board’s area. Bodies
          often find innovative ways of publishing statistics and information to
          hide the true plight. A more accurate definition of &quot;delayed
          discharges&quot; might therefore be that at the end of September 2001
          162 people were &quot;imprisoned in hospital&quot;. They were unable
          to go home because proper care was not available. Families were unable
          to have their loved ones brought home from hospital and provided with
          care packages or have them discharged to proper care in residential or
          private nursing homes.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The situation is even more alarming. A report
          issued by the boards’ independent health watchdog body has revealed
          that 333 people are at home waiting for care packages. That is a great
          indictment of the Department, because Member after Member has referred
          to the cost of providing care for these patients who are now
          imprisoned in hospital. I ask Mr Gallagher to check his figures; he
          mentioned a cost of £900 a week for bed blocking, but I understand
          that the figure is nearer to £1,500 a week. Of course, that does not
          include the capital costs that are normally there for private
          healthcare.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is a disgrace: those patients who are blocking
          beds, against their wishes and those of their families, are denying
          care to hundreds of patients who require it daily and weekly. Various
          Members have asked for additional funding to be thrown at this, but we
          are acutely aware that it is unlikely that that would solve the
          immediate problem because the amount of funding that would be required
          is not readily available.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Therefore, I challenge the Department to do what it
          should have done — grasp the nettle and look at how care can be
          provided within existing funds and budgets. It should use the money to
          purchase the care required in a way that will provide the maximum
          amount of care for the greatest number of people. We would all like
          additional funding, and it is essential that additional funding be
          found, but the Department has been lacking.</p>
          <b>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Birnie:</p>
          </b>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Member for giving way. If I am wrong, I
          am willing to be corrected. However, I understand that the Member may
          have a personal interest in this particular industry. Perhaps he
          should declare it.</p>
          <b>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr C Wilson:</p>
          </b>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will declare it again. I have made it clear on
          numerous occasions that I have a personal interest in private nursing
          care. I represent a body that has spent many long hours with the
          Department, the trusts and the boards in an attempt to resolve the
          anomaly. I have often pointed out that a crisis was looming in that
          industry.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The crisis in the private nursing sector was
          front-page news in the ‘Belfast Telegraph’ and received other
          media coverage. The Sandown Group, one of the largest providers of
          care, was recently placed in the hands of the receiver. That must be
          of concern to the Assembly and the Department. It would be worse if,
          regardless of the Assembly’s efforts to find money to provide the
          care that is essential for these elderly, vulnerable people, it was
          then the case that there was nowhere to place them following their
          discharge from hospital.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is a real problem that the Assembly and the
          Department must consider. Across the United Kingdom, the private
          sector is suffering as a result of the statistics that I quoted.
          Patients who have been assigned beds in a private home, and people
          whose families have selected a home for them, find that the funding is
          not available for the care. Something is wrong, and that must be
          obvious even to people without any experience in the fields of
          healthcare or care in the community. There must be something wrong
          with how the money in the system is being allocated.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am sure that many Members are aware of the
          ridiculous cases of home care packages that are provided at costs of
          up to £2,000 a week. They deprive other people of services. The main
          argument is that the situation depends on the way that funding is
          allocated — on the Department’s budgeting and system of allocating
          money.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Anyone who looked at the situation in a sane or
          rational fashion would see that it makes sense to move someone out of
          a hospital bed, costing up to £1,500 a week, into the private sector
          or to provide a home care package that costs substantially less.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I appeal to the Department to do a fundamental
          root-and-branch reappraisal of the way in which care is purchased and
          provided in the community. Some patients are bed blocking, while
          others are sitting at home. The Department should examine ways in
          which it can alleviate this problem.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As elected representatives, we are all aware of the
          plight of elderly people who have to provide care for their husbands,
          wives and others who receive no assistance. At a time when we are
          moving to provide free care at the point of delivery, we start to hear
          stories of elderly people having to fund their care from their
          pensions or whatever small savings they have. This is a matter of
          urgency, and if the Assembly is wise, it will highlight the plight of
          those who require our help.</p>

          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker:</p>

          <b>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms McWilliams:</p>
          </b>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Mr Tommy Gallagher for tabling the motion.
          It could not have come at a more important time. The serious situation
          that we face in the Health Service is caused by a combination of the
          problems in hospitals and community, primary-care services. If we get
          this right, we can probably find our way through the crisis.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have seen enormous changes over the years in the
          way in which illnesses are dealt with. At one time people with
          tuberculosis were sent to separate facilities. There were cottage
          hospitals with convalescence and rehabilitation facilities. These have
          all been closed. People who need rehabilitation treatment or time to
          convalesce must now stay in hospital. People are moved from hospitals
          into nursing homes if community care is not available.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we approached the problem in a different way, we
          could save a great deal of funding and provide better services,
          particularly for the elderly and the disabled. We must change the way
          that we think about health services — we must change their delivery
          and the culture that surrounds them. To do this, we must take account
          of a huge rise in the elderly population. Between 1995 and 2025, the
          number of people over the age of 80 will increase by 50%, and the
          number of people over the age of 90 will also double. We cannot expect
          hospitals to deal with an elderly person every time he or she gets a
          chest infection. When an elderly person becomes ill, the GP is called.
          If the GP cannot deal with that person, he or she is admitted to
          hospital.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Having visited several trusts, I am aware that many
          have recently introduced some innovative schemes, such as intensive
          home care beds. These enable staff to provide intravenous medicine,
          carry out blood transfusions and other processes that require complex
          nursing. The trusts have started some wonderful programmes. The Down
          Lisburn Health and Social Services Trust, for example, has introduced
          the Hospital at Home programme and a rehabilitation service for stroke
          patients called Step Down Care as well as many other interesting
          services. However, these require 24-hour, seven-days-a-week health and
          social care services to be in place. The culture of the trusts must
          change. They must provide nurses in the community.</p>
          <i>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.45 pm</p>
          </i>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was heartened when the South and East Belfast
          Trust told me that nurses want to work in the community and that it
          has 60 applications for every community nursing post, while hospitals
          have problems recruiting nurses. If we were to reorient nursing
          services to deal with patients and the elderly in the community, we
          could avoid bed blocking, delayed discharges and trolley waits.
          Frequent readmissions to hospitals, risks of pressure sores, exposure
          to infections, institutionalisation, dependence, depression and
          confusion present major challenges to a system that requires major
          service redesign. We must change the way in which we deliver services
          soon. I am heartened that a community care strategy is being reviewed,
          and I hope that it will be put in place shortly.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We will need a well-balanced supporting
          infrastructure between the primary healthcare services and the GPs,
          and that is why, after April, we must get primary care right. We also
          need a menu of services so that patients can be maintained and
          rehabilitated and can receive acute care in their homes. We must stop
          equating acute care with hospitals — acute care can be delivered to
          patients in their homes in a complex way by integrated teams of
          physiotherapists, occupational therapists, nurses and doctors working
          together.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A thriving independent sector is also needed. I am
          aware that there are problems with the nursing homes. The Sandown
          Group has recently gone into receivership. There is a problem with the
          elderly not being able to find places because of fees. However, that
          is a debate for another day.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have just read a recent report from the Northern
          Ireland Ombudsman called ‘Facing the Future’. In it, the Ombudsman
          says that it is interesting that the nature of the complaints that he
          has received recently has changed and that the majority of complaints
          that he now receives concern community healthcare. He says that that
          is because of the non-provision of community services and the lack of
          resources. He believes that, although it may not be a matter of
          maladministration, it clearly is an issue when people who have a
          statutory right to services, and who have been assessed for those
          services, are not given them.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Last week, the Committee for Health, Social
          Services and Public Safety dealt with the Committee Stage of a piece
          of legislation that, again, introduces a statutory right to care
          assessments. I told the Committee that there is no point in that
          legislation being introduced if the services are not then put in
          place. Otherwise, people will have their needs assessed and be made
          aware of the services to which they are entitled, but they will then
          be told that they cannot avail themselves of those services because
          they do not exist. Tom Frawley tells us that his mailbag is full of
          complaints about this. Perhaps we would prefer the Northern Ireland
          Ombudsman — who is also the Assembly Ombudsman — to be dealing
          with other kinds of complaints, rather than have his mailbag full of
          complaints about the lack of community care services.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clearly, a fundamental review is required. We must
          think about the services that we provide. My vision for the future of
          the Health Service is that hospitals will deal only with surgery —
          be it elective or emergency — and that the majority of people,
          including those suffering from mental illness or disabilities and the
          frail elderly, will be treated in their homes or by the independent
          sector in the residential and nursing sector, with respite services
          also in place.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We cannot go on simply saying that if we close
          convalescent and rehabilitation services, those services should be
          provided in hospitals. Hospitals do not have the resources to provide
          them. However, there are many dedicated professionals who have the
          necessary skills but are unable to use them, for example, in the
          mental illness field. A wonderful initiative has been introduced —
          the Thorn nurse training initiative — but patients who leave
          psychiatric units to return to the community quickly find themselves
          back in psychiatric hospitals, because the nurses have not been able
          to apply their wonderful skills and give the services that psychiatric
          patients need in the community.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They are intensive and will require significant
          extra resources. However, in the end, those resources will be more
          cost efficient.</p>
          <b>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McFarland:</p>
          </b>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The debate on care in the community is ongoing —
          in fact, I think that our last debate on it was in October 2001. I
          welcome Mr Gallagher’s motion today, which will, I hope, continue to
          highlight the issue.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many would argue that solving the community care
          problems is the key to solving the difficulties in the acute
          hospitals, and Members have referred to that already. New patients
          referred by primary care cannot get into hospital in the first place
          because recuperating patients cannot get out. It is interesting that
          some 43% of community care packages are home care packages. Indeed,
          86% of community care packages are for the elderly. Those are all
          important, particularly the packages for the elderly.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although the Minister has given money towards home
          care, residential care is equally important. I understand that
          statutory homes, in many cases, have closed and are continuing to
          close. However, the most frightening aspect involves the private
          sector homes, which, in theory, should take over from the statutory
          sector to deal with the problem. Private sector homes are now closing
          because the amount per head that is allocated for looking after
          patients is not enough. What is the Minister doing about it? This has
          the potential to be a disaster. Even if money were put in, we would
          have a mammoth problem if there was nowhere for those patients to go
          to be looked after physically in the community. The Minister should
          give some thought to that.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to raise the unfairness in the present
          system of charges for personal and nursing care. In Scotland, free
          personal and nursing care is to be introduced from April. England and
          Wales have free nursing care. Is it right that people who spend their
          lives saving end up in their old age having to pay for their care?
          People who have paid their taxes, assuming that the NHS would look
          after them, suddenly now find that that is not the case. Indeed, their
          homes are at risk. The implications of that are that you should all
          live life to the full, forget about saving and squander your money,
          because that way the system will look after you. I am afraid that you
          just lose it all at the end if you are prudent about your affairs
          throughout your life. That is a frightening thought for all those who
          have been prudent. Elderly patients’ houses are at risk, and I
          understand that there is a deferred payment scheme in England,
          Scotland and Wales to allow the burden of losing your house to be
          eased. Does the Minister have any plans to introduce such a system
          here?</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Care in the community is not just about money; it
          is also about organisation. The Minister should look at the whole
          issue again with renewed vigour. I support the motion.</p>

          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Courtney:</p>
          </b>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion by my Colleague Mr Gallagher,
          and I thank him for bringing it to the House today.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In many instances care in the community is assumed
          to refer to the elderly, but that is only part of the story. Trusts
          responsible for community care have to ensure that resources are
          sufficient to meet increasing demands, not only in elderly care but
          also across a wide range of other services. Chapter 9 of the Hayes
          Report dealing with primary care states</p>
          </font><font SIZE="1">
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;our analysis strongly suggested that patients
          are being treated in hospitals in Northern Ireland who would be
          treated in the community elsewhere.&quot;</p>
          </font><font SIZE="3">
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should, therefore, reduce pressure on the acute
          hospital sector by treating more patients in the community, provided
          that levels of resources, organisation and motivation in primary care
          are sufficient.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of Health and Social Service’s
          consultation paper, ‘Fit for the Future’, presented health and
          personal social services as a single, integrated service, centred on
          primary care. ‘Putting it Right’ encouraged general practitioners
          to work more closely with hospital- based medical teams to extend
          their skills, thus enabling more services to be developed in the
          community. For example, minor surgery is now performed at health
          centres.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">‘Building the Way Forward in Primary Care’
          points out that close links between primary care and hospital services
          are essential if people are to receive treatment in the right setting
          at the right time and if they are to be able to move easily through
          the health and social care system. General practitioners are
          effectively the gatekeepers of the wider systems of care, and they
          have a key role to play in deciding what kind of care, treatment or
          support is necessary to meet people’s needs.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Equally important is the fact that primary care is
          often a bridge to back-to-normal health for those who have received
          more specialist care. Effectiveness in guiding patients in and out of
          the hospital system is essential if the Health Service is to provide
          the service for which it was created — appropriate treatment at the
          appropriate time and free at the point of delivery. When that service
          fails to deliver, as it currently appears to be doing, there are
          problems, and we must ask ourselves why.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Health and personal social services are underfunded
          and have been for decades. However — and this is critical — some
          figures suggest that the situation has worsened under devolution,
          despite extra resources. For example, between March 1996 and March
          2001 waiting lists jumped by 700%. Trust deficits have more than
          doubled in the periods 1998-99 and 1999-2000, despite a 7·2% increase
          in the Budget announced in October 2000 and allocations of £17
          million in November 2000, £14·5 million in January 2001 and £18
          million in February 2001. The total budget available for 2002-03 will
          be 37% larger — an increase of £687 million — than when the
          Minister took office. There is evidence that the Executive and the
          Assembly are committed to the Health Service, but, I contend, there
          are arguments about management as well as money.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Resources are only one element, but we have a
          responsibility to ensure good management and accountability for the
          way in which they are used. We can all quote instances of patients
          lying in acute beds waiting for beds in the community, and we must ask
          why. Usually the reason given is that trust responsible does not have
          the resources to buy more beds. Nursing homes are closing, and it has
          already been pointed out that the Sandown Group has gone into
          receivership. That is sad, because many people depend on nursing
          homes.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nursing homes can no longer cope and give adequate
          care to those who need it. Their allocation is less than £400 a week
          a patient, yet it costs approximately £1,500 a week to keep a patient
          in the acute sector. At the end of 2001 the Ulster Hospital had up to
          42 beds with delayed discharges, and it is a similar story in all
          acute hospitals. The Hayes Report stated that 10% to 15% of acute beds
          were not available because patients were waiting to be transferred to
          the community.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The last thing that is needed is another review,
          given that most reviews to date have not been acted on. That point was
          highlighted in a written answer on 18 January 2001 from the Minister
          to a question that had been put by my Colleague, Mr Bradley. He had
          asked her</p>
          </font><font SIZE="1">
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;to detail (a) the number of reviews that have
          been initiated by her Department or its agencies since devolution; and
          (b) the number that were ongoing when she took office&quot;.</p>
          </font><font SIZE="3">
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister replied:</p>
          </font><font SIZE="1">
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Since the establishment of the Executive in
          December 1999 I have initiated six major reviews. My Department has
          also initiated a further 15 professional reviews/studies. Some 23
          reviews/studies have been initiated by HSS boards, trusts and
          agencies. Fourteen reviews, of which 12 were departmental, were
          ongoing at December 1999.&quot;</p>
          </font><font SIZE="3">
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There have been many reviews.</p>
          <i>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.00 pm</p>
          </i>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is still a lack of resources, but we must ask
          how the current money is being spent. For example, how much of the
          additional £687 million was spent on consultancy fees, public
          relations and reviews? The audit trail is so poor that there is no way
          that we can find out. Instead of constantly referring back to
          underfunding under direct rule, the Minister must accept
          responsibility for answering those concerns if confidence in the
          Health Service is not to dissipate completely.</p>
          <b>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Shannon:</p>
          </b>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am encouraged that the motion is being debated
          today, but it must be stated that it is ridiculous that we are once
          again pleading on behalf of our needy constituents to the Minister of
          Health, Social Services and Public Safety to make the Health Service
          work here.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A week ago, I watched her agree with a television
          news reporter that the situation was grave. However, she refused to
          reveal what she and her Department were going to do to improve it. I
          also noted that she did not take up Dr Maguire’s challenge to
          experience life on a ward that has not been prepared for her arrival
          and which is overrun with patients sitting on trolleys because there
          are no beds available. The Minister does not know what a real ward is
          like, because she does not make unannounced visits. If she did so, she
          would see that chief executives do not want to advertise the
          conditions under which doctors and nurses are suffering day and night.
          The Minister has certainly not ventured into the Strangford
          constituency to talk to people who are currently receiving, or waiting
          for, community care. The Minister for such a failing Department should
          at least make the effort to look interested.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The lack of adequate funding has overstretched the
          resources of the whole of the National Health Service. Some elderly
          and disabled patients are not being allowed home until adequate care
          facilities become available, and then no community care places are
          available anyway. Other patients are let out of hospital too early,
          only to return with complications or to avail of extensive care
          packages. If there were enough money for the correct and adequate
          community care packages to address that need, a huge burden would be
          lifted from the Health Service. Perhaps Sinn Féin can lend a hand now
          that it is gaining four new office allowances from Westminster.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recently, the Minister gave the go-ahead for pay
          rises for chief executives. Has she given any thought to the people in
          the country? People in my constituency wait for years for hip
          replacements, and due to the delay they must have community care to
          help them wash, dress, prepare food and keep their houses clean —
          the very basics. They were angry to hear that the Government in
          England have enabled those who have waited more than six months for
          operations to travel abroad for treatment; some of those patients went
          to France last week. Is the Minister going to make provision for such
          facilities here? That would considerably ease the burden on the
          community care departments, not only in my constituency of Strangford
          but in the Province as a whole.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Ulster Community and Hospitals Health and
          Social Services Trust needs £20 million to sort out the deficiencies
          in its community care department. The entire Province got £13
          million. Is it just me, or is there something lacking in the
          Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety? The
          Department and its Minister do not recognise the daily problems faced
          by the trusts in the Province and the fact that it is real people whom
          they are dealing with and not just numbers. We see real people and
          their problems every day. The amount of money required to help such
          people is phenomenal, but there is no way around the fact that it is
          needed. Although the Minister may try to ignore the situation, she
          cannot.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People in her constituency must also be waiting for
          community care; their home helps’ time is also being cut back and
          rearranged to cover the increasing number of people needing care. I
          would love to know exactly what she says to those people, because I,
          for one, am fed up listening to the same old platitudes and trying to
          reassure my constituents that the issue will be addressed in the
          Assembly. It is being addressed today, but what will the answers be?
          The situation worsens day by day for many of them.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Each year, the Ulster Community and Hospitals
          Health and Social Services Trust sets out its targets and goals. With
          disgust, its representatives told me that they could not achieve those
          aims because they receive no financial back-up or support. They want
          to provide the service, but they cannot do so because the money is not
          forthcoming. They say that they must provide £10,000 for each person
          who needs care management. Using this figure as a barometer, only
          1,300 people across the Province were helped by the release of £13
          million to the National Health Service.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If all the money went into the community care
          department, a minimum number of people would be helped. This means
          that a great many people are being left in pain and without help or
          the facilities to help themselves. My constituency is laughingly
          called &quot;better off&quot;, but many of the elderly and disabled
          are living on the poverty line and need this help to survive each day.
          It is not a service — it is a necessity. It gives many people the
          independence and standard of living that should be the bare minimum
          for anyone in our society. I urge the Minister to look at her
          Department and realise the hardships that many people face. It reminds
          me of the workhouses in Dickens’s novels, and people in this country
          deserve better. They have paid their National Insurance to have this
          service, and it is failing them miserably day-by-day. I support the
          motion.</p>
          <b>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr J Kelly:</p>
          </b>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I too
          support the motion. I pay tribute to the carers who are working under
          very difficult circumstances to maintain a service to the elderly. I
          congratulate the Minister for bringing forward 1,000 extra care
          packages this year. Sometimes we overlook — for whatever reason,
          political or otherwise — some of the positive aspects of what is
          happening in the Health Service.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Jim Shannon’s reference to being disappointed
          that the Minister did not visit his constituency is a revelation. I
          wish that he would carry that forward and encourage his Ministers to
          participate in the Executive to help in this very critical area to
          deliver a better Health Service to our community.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the question of the Minister not going to the
          Downe Hospital, the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public
          Safety met with doctors and junior doctors before Christmas and agreed
          that it would visit the Downe Hospital, which it did last week. These
          sensationalisms do not help the Health Service and are detrimental to
          its conduct. Indeed, they do not have the agreement of many of the
          medical practitioners in the Health Service.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People are living longer, and I congratulate and
          concur with the review of the capitation formula that looks at this
          issue and attempts to provide funding for our increasingly ageing
          population. It is easy to make political capital out of the Health
          Service, and there is too much of that going on. I do not say that
          because I am a member of the same party as the Minister. I have an
          example of that. Before Christmas — I see Billy Hutchinson has left
          the Chamber — I had a case where an 80-year-old woman released from
          hospital could not get access to a wheelchair to be wheeled down a
          country lane to get some fresh air. When I rang the local trust, I was
          told that they did not have wheelchairs. When I probed further, it
          emerged that there were wheelchairs but that they were not being given
          out in case the trust ran out of wheelchairs and did not have the
          funding to provide more.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have this layer in the Health Service. Certain
          boards are holding back what they have because they are afraid that
          for some reason they will not get the funding to provide items such as
          incontinence pads for old people. In this case it was a wheelchair
          that the trust had to hand but was not giving out because it was
          afraid that it would not get funding for other wheelchairs. Then the
          trusts say that they would welcome complaints to the Department and
          the Minister. Trusts seem to be determined to direct as many
          complaints as possible to the Department without making reference to
          the resources that they already have available for those in the
          community who need them.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As my Colleague Sue Ramsey said, we could go on and
          on. In response to Tommy Gallagher’s point about a health strategy,
          we cannot have one unless the necessary funding is provided. Finance
          Ministers Gordon Brown and Charlie McCreevy, when they provided the
          funds for a health service strategy, looked not only to the immediate
          health crisis, but five years ahead, in an attempt to prevent health
          service crises from recurring.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Any extra funding that the Minister may receive
          will still be inadequate to cater for the strategic view that the
          Health Service needs. That strategy should include the development of
          provision for the elderly, including pensioners such as you, Mr Deputy
          Speaker, Rev Robert Coulter and myself.</p>

          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker:</p>

          political parties and by all medical practitioners is the only way to
          solve the immediate crisis in the Health Service and to provide a
          strategy.</p>

          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Robert Coulter:</p>
          </b>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I apologise to the House for being late. I was
          hosting the Dalriada Doctor-on-Call group in the Long Gallery. I
          recommend that Members go along for five minutes to hear what
          representatives of that group have to say.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Mr Gallagher for moving the motion. It is
          fitting that we should discuss the matter today. The problems that
          affect the community care sector have already been covered in the
          speeches that I have heard today. We all know what kind of Health
          Service we would like. However, we need to discuss not only what we
          should do to achieve that objective but what we can do in the short
          term to alleviate at least some of the problems that people face.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At present, I am dealing with the case of an
          elderly woman in her 80s, who lives alone, and who spent five weeks in
          hospital recently. When she was discharged, she needed access to
          oxygen at all times, and she depended on a neighbour for assistance.
          The hospital did not inform the woman’s GP that she was being sent
          home. When the patient informed her GP, he contacted the local trust,
          but it was 48 hours before a community worker visited her. There is
          something seriously wrong with the management of a system that allows
          such treatment to occur — that incident happened in the past two
          weeks.</p>
          <i>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.15 pm</p>
          </i>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the Minister has already said, we could ensure
          that the first priority for those who are responsible for sending
          patients home from hospital would be to have at hand the information
          for the patient’s GP and a list of the patient’s needs, medical or
          otherwise. It would not take a great amount of money to do that; it
          would not take a huge amount of administration. We are
          over-administered with 19 trusts, four boards, five agencies — a
          plethora of administration. It has also been suggested that we are
          going to set up four or five more committees in each board area. We
          need to adopt a sensible approach to what we can do in the short term
          to rectify the problem. It will not help to apportion blame or to
          throw money at the situation. Another consultation document will not
          help either. John Kelly hinted that if all those who are involved
          could get together to see what we could do in the immediate future, we
          could act immediately.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need decisions at every level of community care.
          I recently realised that Homefirst Community Health &amp; Social
          Services Trust, which is centred in Ballymena, is the largest
          community trust in the entire United Kingdom. When we examine the
          percentages, we see that Homefirst is being castigated because it
          cannot meet its needs. It covers one fifth of the entire population of
          Northern Ireland, so is it any wonder that we have problems? We need
          to focus on money and management. Although we can all say what system
          we should have, I appeal to the Minister and the Department to get
          together and stop blaming each other or anyone else. We need to see
          what we can do and then do it.</p>

          than Rev Robert Coulter. I make a plea for one aspect because all the
          other areas have been well covered. In my constituency of West Tyrone
          the norm is for the family to care for aged relatives. Most Assembly
          Members welcome the fact that there are still those in the community
          who care for their elderly relatives. However, it is a punishment for
          one family member to do that under the present system. If people of
          working age give up their work to look after their elderly parents,
          they are reduced, even with income support, to giving 24-hour care on
          £77 a week. At the same time, they are further punished by having to
          give up their pension rights. In other words, they cannot receive any
          additional money. Family members are being punished for looking after
          their elderly relatives.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although this is not the direct responsibility of
          the Minister, I appeal to her to deal with the matter. Through the
          single equality Bill and section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998
          we have raised the expectation that we will give equal treatment, and
          I presume that that involves pay. We should reward those carers not
          for 24 hours’ work but for at least eight hours’ work. They do not
          ask for anything more; it is reasonable that they should be justly
          rewarded. The expectations that were raised by the lovely glossy
          magazines on the subject might then be met.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the past, I presented to the House, in a
          puritanical fit, a pile of health documents produced in the past five
          years, and weighing some 17 stone, which were written, published and
          printed at a cost of millions of pounds. I make a plea this afternoon
          that, in the extended family care system, those who give up work to
          look after their kith and kin receive an adequate and fair reward for
          their input.</p>
          <b>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McHugh:</p>
          </b>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I
          welcome the opportunity to speak on the issue as someone who is not a
          member of the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety.
          Mr Gallagher, who shares my constituency, has raised issues that are
          also of concern to me and to constituents. The Minister has a
          difficult job trying to deal with all the issues and to act
          accordingly. The main problem that affects the health system is the
          inadequacy of budgets.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Community care is a sensitive but vital issue in
          rural areas. Mr Gallagher said that we no longer have the service that
          we should have, which implied that in the past we had a service that
          we could be proud of. That is not the case. The Thatcher years
          resulted in 14 years’ destruction of the Health Service. In the
          1980s and 1990s the Tory Governments made 3% cuts, year-on-year. Those
          trying to deal with the cutbacks were told that if they did not run
          the hospitals, private managers — now known as &quot;roving
          managers&quot; — would be brought in to do the work for them. I do
          not think that that approach worked. The Labour Government seem to be
          taking the same approach by giving money with one hand and taking it
          away with the other, as is evident from the cutbacks in hospitals, bed
          shortages, et cetera.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The increased elderly population, particularly in
          Fermanagh, will create difficulties in the provision of community
          care. People live longer than before. Although diseases such as
          tuberculosis no longer affect people, today’s hospitals treat
          patients for chronic diseases such as strokes, multiple sclerosis,
          Alzheimer’s disease and drug-related illnesses. There are not enough
          nurses in our hospitals, and nursing staff are usually rushed off
          their feet. They do not have enough time to care for patients
          properly, with the result that staff become sick due to stress and
          there are twice as many people on the payroll to cover those absences.
          In addition, winter pressures, which affect older people more than
          anyone else, create an extra burden.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those factors create massive pressure for the
          Minister, and much of that problem is inherited. Is the Department of
          Health, Social Services and Public Safety looking after the needs of
          carers? Doctors in areas such as Fermanagh find it difficult to get
          carers. They get neither time off nor relief from their job. The
          financial situation of homes creates a further burden.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Budget did not allocate enough money, and
          people’s health is suffering. Poor housing is also a factor in ill
          health. In my constituency of Fermanagh and South Tyrone, 17% of the
          housing stock is in poor condition. Dampness and inadequate toilet
          facilities also affect people’s health, particularly stroke patients
          and those with serious illnesses. I join John Kelly in welcoming the
          1,000 care packages announced by the Minister.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is poor access to hospital day care in rural
          areas. Since bus passes for pensioners were introduced, elderly people
          have been told that they cannot take taxis to hospital — they must
          use the bus. However, in our area there are some routes that have only
          one bus a week. Even Rural Lift does not allow bus passes to be used.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the issue of healthcare in border areas, an
          all-Ireland approach is necessary. North and South could work
          together, for example, Co-operation and Working Together (CAWT). There
          are natural hinterlands. Mr Gallagher will know that villages such as
          Kiltyclogher and other cross-border villages have worked together in
          the past. They did not look towards Enniskillen and places that are 30
          miles away.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Specialists are a massive cost in rural care.
          Social workers may visit one area or one patient at home. Other
          workers, such as health visitors and district nurses, have to be paid
          for their mileage. These are costs that did not occur previously when
          one general health carer was able to assess a patient’s healthcare
          needs. That situation could be considered on a cross-border basis,
          between the Department of Health and Children in the South and the
          Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety in the North,
          in order to create savings and prevent duplication. In some cases,
          their base could be Letterkenny, which is a hell of a journey from
          border areas in south Fermanagh.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of Health and Children in the South
          is trying to do something about it, although it inherited the health
          system in the 1920s from the British, which has not served the country
          well. They spent far too long working with the system rather than
          trying to dispose of it and have something better.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is specialisation needed, with all its inherent
          cost? Of course there are issues such as litigation, changing times
          and skills to be taken into account. In the 1950s a patient undergoing
          a hernia operation, for example, might have spent four to six weeks
          recuperating in the hospital, whereas today it is a day procedure. In
          order to keep up their skills, surgeons now have to perform at least
          50 appendix operations a year.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister has also announced a timetable for the
          establishment of local health and social care groups and the ending of
          GP fundholding, which has a tremendous impact in my area on delivering
          care.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rural proofing is needed in applying the Noble
          formula in relation to deprivation. Per capita, Fermanagh has £31, in
          contrast to places like Derry, which has £84 per capita under that
          formula. What impact will that have across other Departments? Will
          they follow the Noble formula as a basis? Voluntary groups will
          discover that they are losing out under this formula.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People in rural areas also face health problems. I
          am a member of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development,
          and it has been brought to the Committee’s attention that farmers
          face problems such as stress, depression and even suicide arising from
          factors such as low income, isolation and a lack of future prospects.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What help or counselling was provided to families
          or individuals in the wake of the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease?
          There was a helpline, but what follow-up help has there been in areas
          affected by foot-and-mouth disease, such as Newry and Armagh? What
          impact did the outbreak have on stress levels or the incidence of
          heart attacks, for example?</p>
          <i>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.30 pm</p>
          </i>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have mentioned issues that involve three
          Departments. Health is a cross-cutting issue, which involves other
          Departments besides Ms de Brún’s. Farmers’ families need help,
          especially if they have not received help with their financial
          situations. Ms de Brún has inherited the problem, which has been
          brought about by a lack of adequate finance.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Gibson mentioned the inadequate benefit payments
          for people who have given up work. Does he not agree that that is an
          issue for the Minister for Social Development? As I have said,
          cross-departmental issues are involved.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat.</p>
          <b>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr William McCrea:</p>
          </b>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The debate is timely, although its subject has
          exercised the Assembly time and again. It is 2002, and the situation
          is the same as it was in 2001. We rehearse the problems, because that
          is what we have — a plethora of problems. We had them last year, and
          we had them the year before. We have had reviews, and we have had
          consultation documents. We have had reviews of reviews and reviews of
          consultation documents — but when will the Department and the
          Minister make decisions? We rehearse the problems in our debates, but
          decision-making is lacking.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister, as the person who leads the
          Department, is responsible for overseeing what happens in her
          Department. Every Department can rightly say that it needs adequate
          finances, but is that the only answer? Adequate finances have been
          provided across the water, but it has been like pouring water into a
          big hole — there has not been the required improvement in services
          to the public. We can see that happening in our Province. The Assembly
          has voted considerable amounts of money to the Health Service since
          devolution. However, when we ask whether we have we seen the
          corresponding improvements, the answer is &quot;No&quot;.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister gave us the age-old statement —
          which, of course, leans towards the Labour Party — that we should
          blame the Conservatives. They are blamed for everything, even though
          they have not been in power for five years. When will the Minister
          take some responsibility for her Department, instead of blaming
          everybody else? Blaming everybody else for the problem is a cop-out.
          The real problem with the Department is that there have been no
          decisions. There has been no decisiveness at the top of the
          Administration and at the top of the Department on how to make real
          changes with the money that has been allocated.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us not turn up our noses at the amount of money
          that was allocated. Certainly, it is insufficient, but, when money is
          provided, improvements must be seen, and that has not happened.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is true that we have an increasingly elderly
          population. It is also true that many of those elderly people feel
          totally deserted. They feel that politicians and the Administration
          have let them down. They worked hard, and, with the rest of the people
          of the United Kingdom, they built a service that was second to none.
          They were promised that they would be looked after from the cradle to
          the grave, but they have not received that care. In fact, at the most
          vulnerable time in their lives, they feel more deserted than ever.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us examine community care packages. If we want
          to know what community care means, we should ask the public. In
          reality, it means that people are thrown out of hospital into the
          community. Care packages are promised, but they are not provided. Rev
          Robert Coulter mentioned a case in his constituency. In my
          constituency, an 80-year-old lady who needed continual treatment was
          forced to leave hospital. She was sent home to be cared for by her
          86-year-old brother, who was also ill. She was thrust back into the
          community.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly has discussed getting people out of
          hospital and back into community care. I believe in community care —
          we want to keep people in the community. However, it is not enough to
          use the verbiage without providing proper care for such people. That
          is not a criticism of those excellent workers in the Health Service
          and the community who are trying their utmost. Many are at their wits’
          end to know exactly where to go next, and whom to go to next, because
          such a demand is placed on their time. They cannot cut themselves into
          a thousand pieces.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have rehearsed the problems, and that is only
          right because we must bring this need before the Assembly constantly.
          The Department and the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public
          Safety need to take responsibility, because the Assembly cannot rely
          on the vision that the Minister recently published in the press. There
          is no vision. There is a verse of scripture, which Mr Coulter will
          know very well, that says:</p>
          </font><font SIZE="1">
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Where there is no vision, the people
          perish.&quot;.</p>
          </font><font SIZE="3">
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Without a clear vision for the Health Service and
          community care, people will die. That is what is happening. So many
          elderly people await operations that I sometimes believe that there
          are those who almost hope that a person will die before the operation
          is performed, such is the crisis that the Health Service is in. The
          reviews and consultation documents are about how to close hospital
          facilities rather than meet the need in the community.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some people have been sent to France for
          operations. I suppose that the next thing is that they will be sent to
          Russia, because they cannot have operations in Northern Ireland. That
          is a disgraceful situation that must not be allowed to continue. It is
          not only due to a lack of money, as one Member pointed out. Need must
          be targeted, and a vision must be carried through. Real decisions that
          will make a difference to Northern Ireland’s community care and
          Health Service need to be taken. My hon Friend Mr Gibson talked about
          glossy documents. I am fed up looking at glossy documents that tell us
          how wonderful the provision is. Less should be spent on glossy
          documents, and more money should be put into getting people the
          operations and the community care that they need. I assure the House
          that that would go down much better with the people than documents
          that tell us what provisions there are for the elderly.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the start of 2002, many families, as well as
          many elderly people, feel deserted. The burden is on them. I strongly
          believe that families have a responsibility for their elderly. That
          has always been a trait of good Ulster people — they cared for their
          fathers and mothers and sought to do their best. However, many
          families are being pushed over the limit; they are being used and
          abused. Whenever they look for help to enable them to keep their
          parents at home, they are faced with a blank look and no help at all.
          Many people in Northern Ireland feel that not only is the Health
          Service in crisis, and that the community care packages are in a
          critical situation, but that the Minister of Health, Social Services
          and Public Safety has no idea what the answer is. That is the worst
          situation of all. There must be decisive decision-making and a clear
          vision of where the Health Service is going in the future.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Mr Gallagher for his timely motion. I
          trust, as the year progresses, that we will see a true change for good
          in the lives and health of our people.</p>

          na nithe tábhachtacha seo a chur faoi bhráid an Tí.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">D’éist mé go cúramach leis na pointí
          fiúntacha a luaigh Comhaltaí le linn na díospóireachta agus is
          ábhar imní agam é chomh maith na deacrachtaí atá ann ag riar ar

          bhliain airgeadais seo chugainn beidh fáil ar 1,000 pacáiste breise
          cúraim phobail.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Mr Gallagher for bringing these important
          issues to the Floor of the House. I have listened carefully to Members’
          valuable points and share their concern about the difficulties in
          meeting the increasing demand for community care packages.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will try to respond to many of the points.
          However, that will be difficult at times, as some very sane Members
          called for a fundamental re-examination of the Health Service on the
          one hand and for no more reviews on the other. Members also called on
          me to allocate more money to virtually every sector in health and
          social services but also to act within my existing budget. There was
          also a call for greater information to be given on what is available,
          and in the same debate there was a call for an end to documents and
          leaflets outlining what is available.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members are aware of several significant community
          care initiatives that I have taken in the past year. In the current
          year, I have allocated an additional £2 million specifically for
          community care provision to deliver an additional 230 care packages
          over and above planned provision. Next year will see the introduction
          of a further 1,000 community care packages. The elderly, as the main
          users of community care, will gain substantially from that. More
          people will be cared for at home and in other community settings, and
          there will be a reduction in delayed discharges from hospital.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The packages will be a mixture of domiciliary and
          residential care and will go a long way towards easing the
          difficulties that are experienced by some people in getting access to
          support services in the community. I stress that I understand the
          extremely important point that community care is not just about
          delayed discharges from hospital or preventing people from going into
          hospital — it is about looking after the whole range of needs of
          those outside hospital.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since I came into office, I have initiated five
          major reviews, as well as a routine quinquennial review of the Mental
          Health Commission. Members know that very distinct and specific
          actions have come from those. Comments made by Annie Courtney and Rev
          William McCrea about the reviews were rather unfortunate. Aside from
          the routine five-yearly review of the Mental Health Commission, two of
          the five major reviews were initiated within weeks of my taking office
          and have resulted in significant actions and benefits.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Following the pressures on health and social
          services during the outbreak of the flu-like illness in the winter of
          1999-2000, two of my first actions as Minister were to ask the Chief
          Medical Officer to review intensive care provision and the chief
          inspector of social services to review community care. As a result of
          detailed information gathered during those reviews, extra intensive
          care and high-dependency beds were made available in the acute sector
          — a total of 33 since I came into office.</p>

          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A total of 230 extra community care packages were
          provided this year, with 1,000 more to follow in the next financial
          year. ‘Facing the Future: Building on the lessons of winter
          1999/2000’ recommended a comprehensive review of community care
          policy. I endorsed that recommendation in October 2000. A project
          board with an independent chairperson was set up to conduct the review
          — users, providers and carers were represented on it. In July,
          August and September 2001, extensive consultation took place, which
          took on board the views of statutory and independent sector providers,
          voluntary organisations and the health and social care professions.
          The objective was to identify barriers to the delivery of community
          care services, to identify good practice in place across the North and
          to implement recommendations for short-term improvements. From the
          outset, we have not only sought extra resources in that area but have
          examined what could be done to improve existing areas, for example, we
          have sought to build on good practice. I welcome the comments made on
          major initiatives and on the good practice that has been employed in
          some trusts. I shall consider the review’s findings.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although the review is ongoing, action has been
          taken to identify a range of good practices in place in trusts and,
          where appropriate, to put similar schemes in other places across the
          North. People will see that, where improvements can be made quickly,
          necessary action will be taken.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those who were in residential and nursing care
          homes before the introduction of community care in 1993 were given
          preserved rights to special rates of income support to meet the costs
          of their care. However, they were not included in the new health and
          social services care arrangements at that time. Those residents are
          now being brought into care management arrangements, which, along with
          the transfer from social security of the related funding, is intended
          to give help and reassurance. Those people will, for the first time,
          be subject to an assessment of their needs under the care management
          arrangements, and, where necessary, those care needs will be met in a
          more appropriate manner.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The payment of residential allowance to those in
          independent sector accommodation who receive state assistance with
          their costs also went unchanged at that time. That created a perverse
          incentive to place people in care rather than keep them at home. That
          allowance will end for new residents but remain for those currently in
          receipt of it, and that will involve a funding transfer from social
          security. That funding will allow the trusts further flexibility to
          consider care at home rather than in a residential care setting.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am aware of the difficulties in recruiting and
          retaining staff. The poor pay and conditions still experienced by many
          front-line care workers make it difficult to attract and retain staff.
          I shall continue to examine the scope available for providing
          additional funding from my allocation to address that matter.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the statutory side, staff recruitment is a
          matter for each trust. I am aware that trusts continue to attempt to
          recruit staff as the need arises and to address recruitment and
          retention. Those issues will be addressed by a departmental working
          party that is currently developing a new health and social services
          workforce plan.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another important point raised during the debate
          concerned delayed discharges. Delayed discharges show the difficulties
          faced by health and personal social services, especially when there is
          increased demand on services. The level of delayed discharge can peak
          during the winter months, but it now proves to be a more persistent
          feature of the pressure on services all year. We have seen the need to
          create additional services in the community to allow the earlier
          discharge of patients who are improving, so that they can be cared for
          in a proper nursing environment outside hospital. We are moving to
          address that need with whatever resources become available.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is also necessary to support primary care with
          more resources, so that GPs and other primary care professionals can
          do more to deal with patients in the community and to prevent their
          being admitted into hospital. The recorded number of patients waiting
          for care packages in the community stands at over 400 at any time. The
          Department recognises that it is not simply a matter of solving one
          aspect of the problem; there must be an integrated and holistic
          approach, which it is taking.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Health and personal social services have piloted
          several local projects and schemes to make their community services
          more responsive. Examples include rapid response nursing, hospital at
          home, intensive community care and home from hospital schemes that
          provide intermediate care in the community and prevent inappropriate
          admissions to hospital. Such step-up and step-down initiatives have
          developed good practice and demonstrated innovation. The challenge is
          now to replicate that type of scheme across the North and to provide
          the necessary funding to ensure that they are successful. That is
          something that the Department will attempt to do while working within
          the overall budget.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Health and social services boards and trusts have
          operational responsibility for the assessment of the need for nursing
          home and residential care in their areas, and they constantly review
          the beds available against that assessment.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In some areas there are difficulties with the
          provision of residential beds in the independent sector. However, I am
          advised that regionally there does not appear to be a shortfall in the
          numbers needed. There are three different types of providers of
          residential care beds: the statutory sector accounts for 36%; the
          private sector accounts for 43%; and the voluntary sector accounts for
          20%. Approximately 95% of nursing home beds are provided by the
          private sector. The remainder is provided by the voluntary sector.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several Members mentioned the difficulties faced by
          people who are involved in running nursing homes in the independent
          sector. The Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety
          examined the fees structure in the independent sector and reported in
          May 2000. As a result of that report, over the last two years fees
          were increased by more than the social security uplifts. I fully
          recognise the contribution that the independent sector makes, and if
          Mr Cedric Wilson were still present, I would assure him of that. I
          will continue to explore ways of providing further increases within
          the available resources.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several Members asked what the additional 1,000
          community care packages would mean. They will prevent inappropriate
          admissions and speed up the discharge of improving patients. However,
          they will also provide for the needs of those in the community whom
          the trusts are trying to help at present. I assure Members that trusts
          will look at local and individual circumstances in their areas.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When considering the parity of such funding, it is
          unfortunate if Members quote the funding that is available to bodies
          such as the North and West Belfast Health and Social Services Trust
          without making it clear that funding for community and hospital
          services in that trust area also includes the funding for Muckamore
          Abbey Hospital. However, there are differences in community care from
          trust to trust, depending on the specific needs that the boards and
          trusts must assess.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The cost of keeping people in hospital rather than
          in the community is a given. The Department knows that, clearly, that
          must be addressed. However, it is equally clear that the only way in
          which it could instantly make a massive change — by putting all
          funding into the community sector — would stop people from receiving
          treatment in hospital because, in the interim, the hospital’s
          overheads remain.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Therefore we need a service with the flexibility to
          make the moves that are needed. During the 1980s and the 1990s, £190
          million — in today’s terms — was taken out of both hospital and
          community sectors. That robbed the service of that flexibility. This
          measure will save money in the future. We have been working to provide
          230 extra packages this year and 1,000 extra packages next year. We
          will continue to make as much as we can of the available resources in
          a holistic manner. We hope to be able to make progress in this area.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The money that I have received since I came into
          office was also mentioned. Five sixths of that money is spent on the
          rising costs of existing services. People need to look at the extra
          money in that context. The rest of the money is all that can be used
          to build up services.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am keen to ensure that the standard of care and
          provision is maintained and improved. Not only have we taken immediate
          action, but the consultation document ‘Best Practice — Best Care’
          sets out proposals for a framework for setting standards; securing
          local accountability for the quality of services delivered; and
          improving monitoring and regulation.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many people who receive community care services to
          manage their lives depend on the care and support of a carer. It is
          estimated that there are 250,000 carers here and that there is a carer
          in 18% of households. Carers enable many thousands of vulnerable
          people who need support to continue to lead independent lives in the
          community. At the same time, carers reduce the amount of input that
          social services and other agencies need to make. It is essential that
          we act positively to protect the interests of carers and foster a
          climate in which they can continue to care for as long as they wish
          and are able to.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important to state that many carers carry out
          their roles because they wish to do so. However, we must foster a
          climate in which they can continue to care for as long as they wish
          and are able to do so without jeopardising their own health or
          financial security and without reducing their expectations of a
          reasonable quality of life. Therefore, in recognition of the role of
          carers in delivering health and personal social services, I
          commissioned a strategy for carers in October 2000. Officials have now
          developed proposals and recommendations, working with, and in close
          consultation with, the major carers’ organisations and carers
          themselves, including those mentioned by Members in the debate.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I recently received the report with recommendations
          for services that will support carers in the valuable work that they
          do. I join with other Members in commending those who carry out that
          tremendous caring role. I have made it clear that I want a strategy
          that will contain practical measures that will make a real difference
          to carers here. I am determined to make a reality of the strategy. One
          measure that I have already indicated to the Assembly is my intention
          to allocate funding breaks for carers in 2002 and 2003.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members will also be aware that I recently
          introduced a Bill to the Assembly to give health and social services
          boards and trusts the power to provide services to carers to improve
          their health and well-being. We must give the boards and trusts the
          power to do this. I will also continue to argue for the extra
          resources that are needed and ensure the provision of those resources
          when I can.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It would not have been right or proper to introduce
          a Bill without providing carers with the right to an assessment. The
          right to an assessment does not alter the trusts’ existing legal
          responsibilities. As with all services for which people are assessed
          — whether those are in coronary care, care in a hospital or care in
          a community setting — we want to be able to provide the services and
          have the resources to do so at the right level.</p>
          <i>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.00 pm</p>
          </i>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Health and social services were given priority in
          the Executive’s revised Budget for 2002-03, which has enabled the
          Department to prepare to tackle some of the current serious problems
          in the community and hospital sectors. There was a proposal to inject
          additional funding into community care next year, and £4·5 million
          has been allocated for the introduction of free nursing care from
          October 2002.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Subject to the necessary legislation being passed
          through the Assembly, measures to facilitate free nursing care will be
          carried in the health and personal social services (No 1) Bill, which
          will be introduced in the Assembly in the coming weeks. I have asked
          the chief nursing officer to set up a group to examine how the need
          for nursing care can be assessed professionally and in a manner that
          can be understood clearly by the public and with a minimum of
          additional bureaucracy. That group will report to me with
          recommendations in sufficient time to allow the necessary consultation
          and to introduce the required legislation to implement the agreed
          recommendations by October 2002.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The proposals that I have outlined will pave the
          way for free nursing care in all settings and will relieve some of the
          financial worries of those cared for in nursing homes. Further
          improvements have been made to the charging system for care, and the
          ending of the income support preserved rights scheme will bring around
          1,700 existing cases fully into care management, allowing those people’s
          needs to be assessed for the first time and met in the most
          appropriate manner. The ending of the residential allowance and the
          transfer of the related funding will allow trusts more flexibility in
          considering care at home rather than in residential settings. I have
          provided funding for an additional 230 care packages this year and a
          further 1,000 care packages next year. All those proposals are already
          underpinned by appropriate funding in 2002-03. As additional funding
          becomes available, I will introduce other measures that are part and
          parcel of clear plans that I have for the way forward for the service.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A member of the Committee for Health, Social
          Services and Public Safety stated that Scotland would provide free
          nursing and personal care from April 2002. That statement is
          incorrect. Scotland’s latest plans are that that care will be
          delivered from July 2002, and we shall see how that progresses. It is
          unfortunate that we have not been able to move as quickly on that
          issue as others have elsewhere, but we have had to work with the
          funding that is available to us. I am delighted that we now have the
          funding to provide free care.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive are currently conducting their own
          review of the future of public administration structures here. I
          reiterate that it makes sense to take any review of health service
          structures forward in the context of the Executive’s stated
          intention to bring that forward and to examine the outcome of the
          initial consultation on the acute hospitals review, which also
          mentions structure. The Executive must decide whether some of those
          issues are taken forward separately or simultaneously with aspects of
          the public administration review.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, I must make two important points. First,
          administrative and clerical staff carry out a range of duties related
          directly to patient care, and the provision of support to professional
          staff means that more professional time can be devoted to patient
          care. Therefore, administrative and clerical staff clearly play a key
          role in healthcare provision.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, no amount of restructuring will provide
          £190 million, which is today’s equivalent of the amount that was
          taken out of the health and social services budget in the 1980s and
          1990s.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The setting up of the Assembly provided a new
          beginning. When I came into office, many issues needed to be
          addressed; Members were aware of that. We can now make progress
          together on many of those issues: on the one hand, we can take
          immediate action to deal with immediate problems, while on the other
          we can draw together the strands of different examinations,
          initiatives and some initiative reviews to create an overall regional
          strategy, as I reported to the Assembly and the public. I would
          welcome the opportunity to engage Members further in this debate.</p>
          <b>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Gallagher:</p>
          </b>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I acknowledge the fact that the Minister was
          present at the debate for more than two hours, which is a considerable
          demand on ministerial time. The issue is not the responsibility of one
          Department only; it involves serious cross-departmental matters, such
          as transport, housing, culture and leisure, and employment and
          learning. In addition to housing, Mr McHugh mentioned cross-border
          issues, which form an important part of improvements to care in the
          community for those who live adjacent to the border.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All Members’ contributions were well made and
          highlighted the key points involved. Mr Berry was the first to draw
          attention to bed blocking. He referred not only to the problem of
          patients’ having to wait on trolleys in corridors, but to the
          importance of having places and funding for nursing home beds, which
          are known as &quot;step-down beds&quot;. If trusts had the available
          resources, they could move people from hospitals to those beds, thus
          helping to avoid the serious pressures of recent weeks and previous
          winters.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Respite care, which was mentioned by Mr McCarthy
          and Ms McWilliams, gives carers a break and eases the demands on them
          by enabling the person that they are caring for 24 hours a day to stay
          at a facility for a few days. Carers favour such facilities, but at
          present our provision is sketchy. Many of the available respite
          facilities are located far from carers’ and patients’ homes, and
          that can result in stress for a patient who is moved there. There is
          considerable dissatisfaction with our respite care provision at
          present.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Courtney and Ms McWilliams mentioned primary
          care. It is an area that I hope will receive more concentrated
          attention in the coming months and years.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Paul Berry, Alan McFarland and Annie Courtney
          referred to the closure of nursing homes, and the Minister made it
          clear that more than £4 million will be available for the provision
          of nursing care from October 2002. The waiting lists, and their
          implications that seem to clog up the system, were outlined by Cedric
          Wilson, among others. Rev William McCrea’s perspective on people who
          depend on community care was well articulated, and he reminded us how
          unsatisfactory it is for people to experience shortcomings. It was
          useful to be reminded how the users of the service feel about it.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One inescapable problem, which was highlighted by
          John Kelly, was the increasing number of elderly people, which is a
          trend that is set to continue. Rev Robert Coulter, among others,
          referred to the breakdown in communications and the difficulties
          arising from that.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In some instances patients are discharged too early
          from hospital. Many of them have to return to hospital, and that
          compounds the problem. Jim Shannon pointed that out. The matter of
          giving up pensions and benefits was raised by myself and developed by
          Oliver Gibson. John Kelly said that a strategy is one thing, but the
          strategy in itself is of no use if we do not have resources to back it
          up. We cannot argue with that, but at the same time we cannot get hung
          up on which comes first — the chicken or the egg, the strategy or
          the money.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the Health Service we can always take steps to
          improve the quality of service, and that applies to every other area
          too. However, we can tackle the unwieldy structures that were referred
          to and that are a problem in some cases. Many Members gave examples of
          how we can tackle the inefficiencies and the inconsistencies, as well
          as the information deficit. I gather, from comments that have been
          made, that the point has been taken. I hope that we will improve in
          that regard.</p>
          <b>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr J Kelly:</p>
          </b>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Member agree that you cannot have any eggs
          if you have no chickens?</p>
          <b>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Gallagher:</p>
          </b>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yes, but I do not want to digress. Suffice it to
          say that there is room for improvement in every organisation, and we
          hope that it will be ongoing. There are particular points to which we
          want priority to be given. The Minister made helpful comments with
          regard to additional money to improve the situation around
          high-dependency beds. More people in residential nursing homes will
          qualify for assessment; that is very helpful too. I did not quite pick
          up the Minister’s point about the community care review, but I look
          forward to reading it in Hansard.</p>

          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Belfast Agreement directly addresses the
          problem of alienation in Northern Ireland wherever it occurs. All
          parties to the agreement have recognised the birthright of all the
          people of Northern Ireland to identify themselves and to be accepted
          as Irish, British or both. The agreement also guaranteed that Northern
          Ireland’s status as part of the United Kingdom shall not be changed,
          save with the consent of a majority of its people. It also affirmed
          the parties’ commitment to mutual respect, civil rights, religious
          liberties and equality of opportunity for everyone in the community.
          The Programme for Government makes clear our commitment to the
          practical implementation of those guarantees, in particular through
          our policies for community relations, equality and tackling social
          need.</p>

          unsolved murders in West Tyrone that are never mentioned except by
          local representatives. This weekend the community felt that the
          Teebane massacre, in which eight workers were killed on their way home
          from working in my town, barely got a mention, except by their
          relatives. Also, in Enniskillen residents of my constituency of West

          a supplementary question to his question — not to make a statement,

          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Gibson:</p>
          </b>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In view of the fact that the Unionist community of
          West Tyrone feels totally alienated, what will the Minister do to help

          <b>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister:</p>
          </b>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I understand the point that the Member makes, and I
          appreciate people’s feelings with regard to, for example, the
          Teebane massacre and the others that the Member mentioned. When people
          see the publicity given to other cases there is inevitably an element
          of reflection. However, the Member will acknowledge that one of this
          morning’s newspapers devoted a double-page spread to the
          commemoration service that took place at the weekend for the Teebane
          massacre, so the matters are not forgotten.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As to the question of unsolved murders, it would be
          helpful if the police would sometimes give us an indication of which
          cases they have closed the files on. A large number of incidents in
          Northern Ireland are formally regarded as unsolved. Although the
          police have closed the files, they know who were responsible, and they
          know that those persons are no longer in a position to be made
          amenable — many of the perpetrators are now themselves dead. It
          would be interesting to know just how many cases have been cleared up
          and how many have not. That would give an entirely different
          perspective on the matter.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Generating confidence within the community as a
          whole is very much at the forefront of all our actions in the
          Administration. The primary way in which we hope to give that
          confidence is by delivering good administration and demonstrating to
          people in Northern Ireland that everyone can be included in the
          arrangements if they so wish. We regret that in some cases people feel
          excluded. However, that is in part due to the poor quality of
          leadership offered to them.</p>

          out, a duty on all political leaders to articulate a new inclusive
          vision for our society? Do the Ministers also accept Mr Haass’s view
          that there has been a failure by political leaders to articulate such

          and I warmly commend the speech by Ambassador Richard Haass that she
          refers to. The central section of that speech addressed some of the
          issues that the previous Member addressed and, indeed, put its finger
          on the problem of the quality of leadership that is being offered in
          some quarters. In particular, I endorse one sentence from Richard
          Haass’s speech:</p>

          that they have to have a breadth that covers the community as a whole,
          and not just concern themselves purely with the interests of one
          section alone. Modesty might prevent me from referring to the fact

          contains an implicit threat, and that is to be deprecated wherever it
          occurs. Those who represent or are linked with some of the
          paramilitaries responsible for this behaviour have a duty to try to
          ensure that nothing is done by those organisations that in any way

          report on obstacles to cross-border mobility on the island of Ireland
          by the end of this month. The study comprises a wide range of research
          methods, including surveys of members of the public, a programme of
          case studies and interviews with representative bodies. Towards the
          end of the assignment, two public consultation conferences were held
          in Omagh and Carrickmacross. At these conferences the views of
          interested parties, including consumers, were identified and explored.
          The report makes a number of recommendations for information
          improvements, social security and pensions, education, training and
          employment, telecommunications, banking and insurance.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In view of the scope of the study the devolved
          Administration and the Irish Government have agreed that, upon
          publication and prior to offering views, a consultation exercise will
          be undertaken. That process will enable interested organisations,
          including Government Departments and individuals, to give their views
          on the recommendations and their implementation. We have no doubt that
          the appropriate Departments and bodies which have an interest in the

          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Members know, I have reservations about many of
          the individuals who make up the Northern Ireland Human Rights
          Commission, although I concede that there has been some improvement in
          that respect recently.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Human Rights Commission in the Republic of
          Ireland has not progressed as far as ours has done. The Irish
          Government have put their commission on a statutory footing only in
          recent months, so it is still early days in that regard. It is a
          matter for the committee to consider whether the charter that is
          envisaged in that part of the agreement should come into existence.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Having said that, I understand the point behind the
          Member’s question. If there were such a charter, it would be nice to
          see which parties were prepared to sign it and stand over its
          provisions. That might be a revealing exercise.</p>

          encourage people to apply. Procedures are in place that must be
          followed, and appointments are now very rarely made purely on

          ease the financial burden, such as those that Her Majesty’s Treasury’s

          situation with regard to rates. District council swimming pools and
          leisure centres, playing pitches and changing rooms are exempt from
          rates. Amateur sports clubs — that is, those which are
          non-profit-making and do not employ professional staff or players —
          have a 65% reduction available to them. Last autumn the Chancellor
          brought forward an Inland Revenue tax incentive scheme to help
          community amateur sports clubs. Around the same time the Charities
          Commission made a statement that charitable status could be a possible
          way forward. I refer to ‘Promoting Sport in the Community’ as
          mentioned in my previous answer. The Chancellor now asks sports clubs
          to determine which way they want to go, whether by the Charities
          Commission’s statement on possible charitable status or by his
          Inland Revenue tax incentive scheme. Responses are due by 1 February
          2002, and I encourage all clubs to respond. That will determine a way
          forward with regard to rates.</p>

          </b>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Numerous arts festivals in Northern Ireland are
          sponsored by a variety of bodies, including district councils and
          community and arts organisations. Although I am unable to give an
          exhaustive list of all arts festivals, I can say that under the
          cultural diversity grant application scheme run by the Department,
          several festivals, with a strong arts component, have received
          financial support. The Northern Ireland Events Company funded four
          arts festivals, and during the millennium celebrations, the Department
          of Culture, Arts and Leisure funded 84 festivals and projects.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All applications for cultural diversity funding
          must adhere to the criteria outlined by the cultural diversity
          assessment panel. The projects must have strong cultural diversity
          elements to encourage participation from all sections of the
          community. They are aimed at increasing people’s understanding of,
          and education in, a variety of issues.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Arts Council funded 42 festivals in the 2001-02
          financial year. The Arts Council and its clients are committed to the
          promotion of equal opportunities and the targeting of social need in
          all their programmes, including arts festivals.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The standard conditions for grants state that the
          Arts Council must inspect the client’s equal opportunities policies
          and stipulate that all events must be open and inclusive.</p>

          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr K Robinson:</p>

          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister for his comprehensive answer.
          However, when allocating finances to local arts festivals, will he
          consider giving proportionate amounts to different communities, unless
          it can be shown that the festival is truly cross-community?</p>
          <b>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGimpsey:</p>
          </b>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To give the Member a better understanding, the
          Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure does not directly fund any
          arts festivals. It allocates funding through an intermediate body —
          the Arts Council. As I said earlier, it supported 42 festivals in the
          previous financial year, at a total cost of £530,000. That amount was
          made up of £273,000 of grant and aid funds, for which the House
          voted, and £257,000 of lottery funding.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Northern Ireland Events Company, which is the
          direct responsibility of the Department, has also supported
          approximately four festivals. Most festivals are not directly
          supported by those organisations; district councils play an important
          role. Ken Robinson said that such events should be inclusive of all
          communities. We all strongly support that notion. Where it exists,
          division reflects our society. Those fundamental ills cannot
          necessarily be cured by the Arts Council of Northern Ireland, the
          Northern Ireland Events Company, or any district council. Our aim is
          to address the issues and to tackle them through our policies on
          equality, promoting cultural diversity and targeting social need (TSN).
          In tackling those problems, the proper way forward is to eliminate the
          chill factors, or perceived chill factors.</p>

          </b>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The cost implications of providing a national
          stadium would be considerable. A pre-feasibility study carried out in
          1999 indicated that some £60 million would be required for a
          35,000-seater stadium. The cost of the site, site works, car parking
          and so on would be additional. The study also indicated that the
          annual running cost would be some £2 million. The advisory panel’s
          report on creating a soccer strategy for Northern Ireland is out for
          consultation until 31 January 2002. The report recommended the
          establishment of a national stadium, which would provide a neutral and
          welcoming environment and meet international standards for football.
          That recommendation will be given further consideration in the light
          of the responses received during the consultation period. The needs of
          other key sports, and proposals for meeting those needs, will also
          have a bearing on the issue.</p>
          <b>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr M Robinson:</p>
          </b>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister for his response. Given the
          likely cost implications which the Minister referred to, and the
          impractical physical task of creating a stadium which is
          multi-purpose, does the Minister not agree that it would be more
          feasible to upgrade the existing stadium at Windsor than to construct
          a new one?</p>
          <b>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGimpsey:</p>
          </b>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One option is to upgrade Windsor Park. However,
          that is merely an option. We do not have a strategy for soccer at the
          moment. We have a strategy for Gaelic football, which is being
          finalised. The strategy for rugby is also being finalised — that is
          no secret, because representatives of the sport made it clear that a
          15,000-seater stadium is required. Gaelic football officials are
          examining their requirements. We must deal with the matter
          holistically, and we must consider the needs of more than one sport.
          In addition, the costs are steep. We have yet to make a final
          decision; we are still considering the possibilities.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The upgrading of Windsor Park would certainly be an
          option, if we decided to provide a soccer-only stadium. That would
          presuppose that Gaelic football officials were content to go ahead
          with the facility at Casement Park, or that rugby representatives were
          content to provide their own facility at Ravenhill Road. All of the
          options have cost implications. It is not enough to say that Windsor
          Park is cheaper — the cost implication of that option for other
          sports must also go into the mix. The size of the pitch, the number of
          spectators, the locations, the possibility of sharing and the costs
          must all be considered in the light of the various sports’
          strategies.</p>

          the Minister met, or does he intend to meet, Government

          surrounding proposals for their national stadium, which is popularly

          Dublin is not relevant to us. We have our own problems to tackle; we
          can see a way forward, and we aim to follow that. We do not need to
          look South of the border for experience on the matter. Organisers of
          the various sports — soccer, rugby, Gaelic, athletics, and so on —
          have enough expertise to allow us to go forward in partnership.</p>

          in the region of £210 over the course of the stay in the host town.
          This figure is based on bed-and-breakfast-style accommodation, meals
          and transport. This cost will be borne entirely by the host town.
          However, in addition there will be a spend to go with that. It is a
          matter for the host town to decide whether it will be the beneficiary.
          My Department does not have the budget to offer the type of grant aid
          the Member is suggesting, but I do not think it is necessary. The
          benefits to each town will be such that they will be able to recoup
          their investment and then some.</p>

          management programmes for sports grounds. To date, some £2·5 million
          has gone to soccer clubs, Gaelic clubs and rugby clubs. A further £1
          million has been made available for 2002-03, which will allow the
          scheme to continue. Taking the allocation that we are getting from the
          Sports Council for Northern Ireland, topped up with some money from
          the Football Foundation, it means that we will have £1·5 million to
          continue the scheme next year. That is an important benefit, not only
          to soccer, but also to rugby and Gaelic sports.</p>

          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Arts Council of Northern Ireland is providing
          the Ulster Orchestra with revenue funding of £1·25 million in the
          2001-02 financial year to carry out several programmes, one of which
          is in the field of education. For many years the orchestra has,
          through its outreach programme, offered various activities and
          programmes of work for the benefit of children. Those have been
          developed in conjunction with the education and library boards and the
          district councils. Schoolchildren are given opportunities to
          participate in special events such as adopt-a-player schemes,
          curriculum-based creative projects, special concerts, outreach work,
          local community music groups and residencies by smaller ensembles from
          the orchestra.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is impossible to assure the Member that every
          schoolchild will have the opportunity to participate in workshops and
          performances given by the Ulster Orchestra. However, I am confident
          that everything possible, within the limitations of available
          resources, is being done to encourage and support closer associations
          between young people and the Ulster Orchestra.</p>

          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I take the opportunity to express my appreciation
          to the Ulster Orchestra for the efforts that it has made to reach out
          to the wider community, and to young people in particular. I am a
          little disappointed that the Minister cannot guarantee that all
          schools, particularly those in rural or disadvantaged areas, will have
          the opportunity to experience the educational value as well as the
          entertainment value that the orchestra provides. I ask the Minister to
          give some thought to how all children can be treated equally in that
          respect.</p>
          <b>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker:</p>
          </b>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not sure that there was a question there, but
          the Minister may wish to respond.</p>
          <b>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGimpsey:</p>
          </b>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the Member referred to all schoolchildren, I
          assumed that he meant schoolchildren in Northern Ireland only. There
          are approximately 350,000 schoolchildren in the system, so it would be
          unreasonable to expect us to reach 100% of them.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Ulster Orchestra recognises that children are
          its audiences of the future, and it also recognises the strong
          educational benefits that getting involved with schoolchildren can
          bring. Consequently, it has set up an educational department to
          develop opportunities for schoolchildren to participate in workshops
          and performances. Education plays an increasingly important role in
          the orchestra’s work. It is also part of my Department’s corporate
          strategy. I am sure that the Member is aware that one of our targets
          in the Programme for Government is to increase participation through
          enhancing children’s and young people’s access to creative
          expression. The Ulster Orchestra’s efforts are a perfect example of
          that, and we are serious about ensuring that the orchestra reaches
          large numbers of people. We encourage that, but there are limitations
          to the resources that the Ulster Orchestra has available, and, as the
          Member will be aware, there are also limitations to the Department’s
          resources.</p>

          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will do my best. I am satisfied. Waterways
          Ireland’s budget is £22 million; Northern Ireland’s contribution
          is £3·7 million, in exchange for which we are getting around 1,000
          kilometres of navigable waterways managed. We have the potential to
          create navigable waterways on the upper and lower Lagan, the Newry/Portadown
          Canal, the Ulster Canal and Lough Neagh. When grafted onto the
          Shannon-Erne Canal, Lough Erne, the Lower Bann and the waterways
          system in the South, those developments will create huge potential.
          Canals in the South are at a sophisticated level of development, and
          that benefits tourism there. As Mr Gibson and Mr Hussey pointed out,
          the development of waterways is a means of creating tourism in rural

          grants scheme, the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development has
          assisted potato processors to invest in modern grading, washing,
          packing and storage facilities. Since 1 January 1999, grant payments
          totalling £858,000 have been made to potato processors. Non-capital
          support to encourage better marketing has also been provided under the

          shortly to join the European Union and will be able to trade without

          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We will certainly be giving marketing advice to our

          Member that we will also enable our farmers to compete better with
          growers from other countries through processing grants and through our
          advice on how to improve the quality of their potatoes. We have been
          particularly aware of that factor in recent years, given the demands
          by supermarkets for uniform, nice-looking potatoes, which appeal to
          the customer. My Department has also been working hard to ensure that
          our producers are in a position to compete in that market.</p>

          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am aware that we have problems with level playing
          fields in certain sectors. I have had representations made to me from

          Competence development programmes to help improve husbandry skills,
          which have an impact on returns, also exist. In addition to grants for

          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to take questions 2, 3, 10 and 17
          together, as they all relate to the same area — the December
          Fisheries Council and its outcome.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This was a long and arduous meeting, particularly
          as we were faced with proposals for extremely severe cuts in stocks,
          including those of particular interest to the local industry. The best
          deal possible for Northern Ireland in the circumstances was obtained.
          I was successful in obtaining an increase in the nephrops total
          allowable catch (TAC) from the proposed 14,175 tons to 17,790 tons.
          This was no mean achievement, bearing in mind that the European
          Commission’s proposal was for a 25% cut in this TAC. It was
          reluctant to accept any increase because of its view that the by-catch
          at this fishery includes stocks under threat.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition, increases above the Commission’s
          proposals were obtained for such stocks as Irish Sea cod, plaice, sole
          and haddock. While I have not made an individual assessment of each
          fish species for which total allowable catches were agreed, I regard
          the outcome as successful, particularly for Irish Sea cod. I was
          grateful for the support of my ministerial colleagues from England,
          Scotland and the Republic of Ireland during the negotiations. However,
          the need to conserve fish stocks has to be balanced with the need to
          protect the industry. During these negotiations I was determined to
          achieve that balance.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to assistance for the industry, I have
          already introduced a £5 million fishing vessel decommissioning
          scheme, the results of which have recently been made known. In
          addition, I have recently announced the availability of £15 million
          to fund four new schemes to assist the local industry. These are the
          improvement of facilities at Northern Ireland’s fishing ports,

          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Rodgers:</p>
          </b>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many of the issues raised by Mr Shannon are a
          matter for the Department for Social Development, not my Department. I
          have addressed the question of the tie-up scheme on numerous occasions
          in the past. It has not previously been policy to provide compensation
          for a reduction in quotas or for closures. However, I am taking stock
          of the economic position of the industry following the outcome of the
          December Fisheries Council meeting. The position is that despite last
          year’s closure, the local industry was able to catch almost all of
          its cod and haddock quotas and a substantial proportion of the quota
          for nephrops.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Following the December council outcome, which was
          quite favourable in terms of overall fishing opportunity, and given
          the current reduction in the fleet following our decommissioning
          scheme, there is no strong prima facie case for compensation. I am,
          however, keeping the situation under review.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The retraining programme that the Member referred
          to will be resourced by the £25 million of EU funds allocated. Its
          specific details will be made known as soon as we come to a decision.</p>

          However, it would appear that the fate of the fishing industry lies
          largely at the whim of scientific agencies, despite the fact that our
          experts quite often disagree with their findings. Will the Minister
          continue to raise these anomalies with her United Kingdom partners

          in which the fishermen will agree with the scientists. I endeavour to
          ensure that the fishermen are part of the consultation exercise.
          Whereas the Commission has always taken the view that it had to go by
          the science, this year’s proposals for cuts were clearly not in line
          with the science. I was able to use that strong argument at the
          council, as did my ministerial counterparts, to ensure that the cuts
          were not as drastic as those proposed.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have to be guided by the science community. I
          cannot use scientific arguments in favour of reducing cuts one year
          yet refuse to accept them in another year if they do not suit me. The
          real issue for the fishing industry and me is to ensure that we find a
          balance between maintaining a viable industry and conserving the
          stocks. That is never going to be easy. Looking at the scientific
          evidence and taking cognisance of it is an important part of that

          strategic study on how best to develop organic farming in Northern
          Ireland. I considered the report to be a realistic view of the
          prospects of the organic sector against the targets set out in the
          rural development plan, which is to have 1,000 producers farming
          30,000 hectares of land organically by the year 2006. The report

          the Future of the Agri-food Industry exercise. The vision report
          recommends that the organic development strategy should be implemented
          in full. The consultation period for the vision exercise has been

          welcome the Minister’s launching a report on organic food
          production. Does she agree that the Department of Agriculture and
          Rural Development should aim at a target higher than 3% for organic
          produce? As a consequence of foot-and-mouth disease we are more aware
          of the need for food safety and of the need to monitor imports
          carefully. Should we not therefore raise our target to the 10% or 20%
          that other European countries are trying to achieve?</p>
          <b>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Rodgers:</p>
          </b>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, I am concerned that there is an implication
          in the Member’s question that food that is not organic is not safe.
          I should like to knock that on the head. Three per cent is a realistic
          target at this stage, and we have the funds to meet it. We must also
          look carefully at the market.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are two issues that come up in organic
          farming. First, we have to keep our eye on the market. At the moment,
          demand exceeds what is available. For obvious reasons, the premium
          could drop, so we have to take cognisance of all the issues. At the
          moment, 3% is a realistic target, and we have the funds to meet it.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not want to raise expectations unnecessarily,
          but I want to repeat that although organic food is a marketable
          product at the moment, we are anxious that in Northern Ireland we
          should be able to meet our market needs and not have to import from
          other countries. I do not want anyone to run away with the idea that
          if it is not organic, it is not safe. All our food in Northern
          Ireland, especially our beef, is as safe as you can get.</p>

          producers with 30,000 hectares within five years, can she give an

          is only half the number anticipated at this stage. That is mainly due
          to the effects of the foot-and- mouth disease situation, which meant
          that necessary on-farm inspections by organic sector bodies could not
          take place. However, we anticipate increased interest in the scheme in
          2002.</p>

          £200 million each year in direct subsidies to Northern Irish farmers.
          That is an average of £6,700 per farm business. It also has a role to
          play in the administration of CAP market support mechanisms, which are
          estimated to be worth up to a further £100 million per annum to
          Northern Irish farmers and are particularly important in supporting
          the dairy sector. The Department also operates measures such as the

          meeting with the industry and the president of the UFU.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The fact that the industry can use only 15% of its
          fluid milk in Northern Ireland does create a large problem for the
          industry when export refunds are cut. We are heavily dependent on the
          export of milk powders to other countries. Given the present state of
          the market and the current level of EU support, export refunds are
          clearly insufficient to maintain producer prices.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At last week’s meeting in London with the UK
          agriculture Ministers, I impressed upon Ms Beckett the need to put
          pressure on the EU Commission to secure a significant increase in
          refunds. That is necessary if prices are to be stabilised and we are
          to avoid undermining the financial stability of this important sector
          for Northern Ireland. We did receive modest increases in November and
          December, but the need to get further increases was impressed upon Ms

          has been developed by the Department of Finance and Personnel and the
          Special EU Programmes Body (SEUPB). Although the database was devised

          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member will also be aware that the Assembly
          Commission recently asked the Senior Salaries Review Body (SSRB) to
          review Members’ salaries, allowances and pension arrangements. The
          review will examine all areas associated with Members’ allowances,
          including the payment of rent for constituency offices. The review is
          a three-stage process in which all parties, including the Member’s
          own, have every opportunity to contribute. Hay Management Consultants,
          on behalf of the review body, have just concluded the job analysis
          element of the review. Parties have also had the opportunity to submit
          written evidence, and the review body will take oral evidence on 29
          January. I encourage all Members to take this opportunity to raise any
          issues that concern their parties about the current arrangements.
          Again, it would be inappropriate to comment on any issue covered by
          the review in advance of the SSRB’s report of its findings in April
          of this year. However, I assure the Member that the Assembly

          his Colleague, Mr Fee, last week. It appears not to address the issue
          raised by my question at a time of widespread cynicism about political
          life in every part of this country and in the Republic.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, does the Assembly Commission have access to
          the House of Commons review of the payment of office rents? Secondly,
          is there reason to believe that what happened in Scotland may happen
          here, because it seems that there are no procedures to prevent it?
          Thirdly, in the light of Mr Fee’s response, which suggested that
          there was no monitoring of the use of Assembly Members’ offices for
          electoral purposes last year, should the Commission not be more
          proactive in monitoring? Merely reporting that 19 Members had declared
          the use of their offices is at least a step forward, but it does not
          go far enough to deal with the cynicism that exists.</p>
          <b>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Wells:</p>
          </b>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Commission does not have access to the material
          submitted to the House of Commons review and will not have access to
          it until the report has been published. I emphasise that before a
          Member can submit an invoice for rent, a valid rental agreement must
          be submitted to the Finance Office, and it is carefully checked.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The use of Assembly Members’ constituency offices
          causes enormous difficulties because there are 108 Assembly Members,
          some of whom may have two or even three constituency offices. Barring
          asking Assembly staff to sit outside their offices every day taking
          note of who goes in and out and for what purpose, it would be very
          difficult to monitor the continuous use of offices. The Assembly
          Finance Office monitors the situation carefully, and a complaint drawn
          to its attention is investigated immediately.</p>

          provision it is making to subsidise community and voluntary groups
          using the facilities in Parliament Buildings.</p>

          <b>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Wells:</p>
          </b>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly Commission is very conscious of its
          accountability and therefore does not provide subsidies to any group
          using the facilities in Parliament Buildings. The Commission believes
          that that would be a misuse of public moneys. Members may sponsor
          functions in Parliament Buildings. I am sure that Members want the
          Commission to ensure that all financial proprieties are observed in
          managing functions in Parliament Buildings.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the Member is referring to the costs associated
          with the running of the various catering outlets in Parliament
          Buildings, I can advise her that all those fall into two categories:
          internal and external. Internal costs are those associated with the
          operation or function of Assembly business, for example, the basement
          dining room and the Members’ dining room. In this case the Assembly
          Commission has, through a process of competitive tendering, put in
          place a cost plus contract, whereby all costs associated with the
          functioning of Assembly business are borne by the Assembly Commission.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">External functions are not directly associated with
          the running of the Northern Ireland Assembly, therefore the direct
          labour element of the service provision, in addition to the cost of
          refreshments, is borne by the external organisation. However, I
          emphasise that no recurrent overhead costs such as heat, electricity,
          cost of room hire or security at weekends are borne by the external
          organisations. The Assembly Commission continually monitors all costs
          associated with the functioning of the Assembly to ensure that it
          achieves value for money. Where costs can be reduced without
          compromising accountability, the Commission will do so.</p>
          <b>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Lewsley:</p>
          </b>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This Building should be accessible to everybody.
          Often the organisations that visit here can bear the catering cost;
          voluntary groups, however, may find that more difficult. I sponsored a
          voluntary group to visit Parliament Buildings at the beginning of
          November. It had to cancel, because it was asked to pay £80. I
          understand what the Member says about catering. However, is the
          Commission aware there were 100 people coming that day but that only
          60 chairs were available in the Long Gallery? The organisation was
          going to have to bear the cost of hiring 40 chairs at £2·00 each.
          There was no crèche facility — all it was asking for was a room.
          What will the Commission do in future for such facilities?</p>
          <b>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Wells:</p>
          </b>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member raises a valid point. The Assembly
          Commission is aware of that difficulty. At present, an external
          function that has anticipated more than 60 attendees cannot be catered
          for without additional seating: we have only 60 chairs. The Assembly
          must bear the cost of hiring extra chairs at approximately £2·35 a
          chair. That is added to the cost of the function, because the Assembly
          passes it on to the organiser. However, the Commission is aware of the
          problem and has asked the Office of the Keeper of the House to
          investigate the costs of purchasing additional chairs. It will report
          to the Commission on the matter, and the Commission will assess
          whether that option is cost-effective. If it proves to be so,
          additional chairs will be bought so that community groups, such as the
          one that the Member mentioned, will not be placed in that position.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Crèche facilities have not yet been considered,
          but I am sure that the Commission will want to take that on board.
          That is a very good point.</p>

          </b>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At an early stage in the Commission’s
          consideration of the Assembly’s staffing needs, it became clear that
          the accommodation in Parliament Buildings would be unable to cater for
          the needs of Members, Ministers and party support staff. It is planned
          to increase the staff to 450 , including existing staff in the
          Assembly Secretariat. Parliament Buildings was built in 1932 to
          accommodate a Parliament of that time. The building is unable to meet
          the accommodation requirements of a modern legislative Assembly.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 2000, an economic appraisal arranged by the
          Commission considered all options for meeting the Assembly’s
          additional accommodation requirements. The appraisal recommended
          Ormiston House as the preferred option, and, in September 2001, the
          Commission secured its purchase at a cost of £9 million.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Commission’s long-term plan is to renovate
          the house and outbuildings to provide additional permanent office
          accommodation for some Secretariat staff. In the medium term, it is
          proposed to provide a temporary office building in the grounds of
          Ormiston House. The Planning Service is considering a plan for Crown
          development approval.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In mid-2001, with approximately 300 staff in place,
          the Commission decided to relieve some of the pressure on the
          accommodation within Parliament Buildings by moving approximately 30
          staff in the Finance and Personnel directorate to temporary
          accommodation in Annexe C beside Dundonald House. In doing so, the
          Commission recognised the need to maintain a continuity of service and
          staff of the Finance and Personnel Directorate in Parliament
          Buildings. The Member is aware that one or two staff remain available
          for consultation on the fourth floor of Parliament Buildings.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Commission has not yet taken a decision on
          which staff and functions will move permanently, but every effort will
          be made to minimise any disruption to Members that could potentially
          arise from the management of a split site.</p>

          was an absolute bargain in commercial terms. Had that site been put on

          for property development. In respect of wise use of the Exchequer’s
          money, it has been a very good move, and should it transpire that
          development of the Ormiston site is not possible, it can be sold on by

          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Staff recruited directly from a wide variety of

          commitment to publicly advertise all jobs accept the Assembly’s

          those of the Northern Ireland Civil Service. However — and this is
          crucial — it is the policy of the Assembly Commission that secondees
          from outside organisations retain their existing terms and conditions.
          In the case of Northern Ireland Civil Service secondees there is an

          disparities and inequalities in the current arrangements and to make
          recommendations on how differentials can be addressed.</p>

          expedite, as agreed, their provision of all relevant documents and
          files to the Independent Commission of Inquiry into the 1974 Dublin
          and Monaghan bombings, which is chaired by the former Irish Supreme
          Court Judge, Henry Barron.</p>
          </font><font SIZE="3">
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At approximately 5.30 pm on the afternoon of 17 May
          1974 a terrible atrocity took place in the city of Dublin. Another
          took place later that same evening in Monaghan. Thirty-three people
          were killed, and over 300 were injured as a result of bomb explosions.
          A bus strike in Dublin that day meant that there were more pedestrians
          than usual in the streets when the bombs went off. It may well be
          understood that the explosions created pandemonium. Inside 90 seconds
          three bombs exploded in Parnell Street, Talbot Street and South
          Leinster Street. Ninety minutes later, a further bomb exploded outside
          a Monaghan pub which, incidentally, was owned by a Protestant family.
          The suffering and anguish of those families is similar to that of the
          families of those who died in Omagh, but their experience has been
          treated quite differently.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Frank Massey, whose 21-year-old daughter died six
          weeks before her wedding, summed up their feelings. He said:</p>
          </font><font SIZE="1">
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;We have been treated like lepers.&quot;</p>
          </font><font SIZE="3">
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The families feel betrayed.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Alice O’Brien lost her sister, brother-in-law and
          two nieces in the Dublin bombings. When researching the background of
          the bombings, I was moved to learn that those two babies, aged 15
          months and seven months, lay unidentified because no one knew until
          the next day that their parents had also been killed. Alice O’Brien
          said:</p>
          </font><font SIZE="1">
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;As families we wish to bring closure to our
          suffering through knowing the truth. For twenty five years we have
          endured the costly and unnecessary ordeal of fighting a legal battle
          to gain access to Garda files. As well as being the innocent victims
          of an atrocity we have had to endure the ignominy of fighting our own
          political and police authorities.&quot;</p>
          </font><font SIZE="3">
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is only the beginning of their story.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some of us were members of the team that negotiated
          the Good Friday Agreement. In the agreement we wrote that</p>
          </font><font SIZE="1">
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;it is essential to acknowledge and address
          the suffering of the victims of violence as a necessary element of
          reconciliation.&quot;</p>
          </font><font SIZE="3">
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a consequence of those words, a victims’
          commissioner for Northern Ireland, Sir Kenneth Bloomfield, was
          appointed. The Republic of Ireland also has a victims’ commissioner,
          Mr John Wilson. I pay tribute to Mr Wilson, whom I have met often as a
          result of my work with the families of the disappeared.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">John Wilson wrote a report for the Irish Government
          on the needs of victims and included in it what he had heard from the
          families of those killed in the Dublin and Monaghan bombings. He
          requested that the Irish Government do something about it.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In January 2000, the Dublin Government established
          an Independent Commission of Inquiry into the Dublin and Monaghan
          Bombings that is now headed by Mr Justice Barron, a former judge of
          the Supreme Court. In that year, the Taoiseach told the Dáil that he
          expected a report from the inquiry to be presented to a joint
          Oireachtas Committee by May. He later informed the Dáil that he
          expected the report to issue before the summer recess in June 2000. He
          then said that he expected the report by September 2000. It is now
          January 2002, and the report has not been completed.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The terms of reference of the independent inquiry
          were that the facts, circumstances, causes and perpetrators of the
          bombings be investigated and that the nature, extent and adequacy of
          the garda investigations, including the co-operation of the relevant
          authorities in Northern Ireland and the handling of evidence,
          including the scientific analysis of forensic evidence, also be
          investigated. Also, the reasons why no prosecutions took place,
          whether the investigations had been impeded, and if so by whom and to
          what extent, should be identified, and the issues raised by the
          Yorkshire Television documentary ‘Hidden Hand: The Forgotten
          Massacre’ broadcast in 1993 should be considered.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The terms of reference were clear. However, yet
          again, almost a year has passed since Mr Justice Barron made a formal
          request to the UK Government to release documents that would enable
          the inquiry to bring the matter to a conclusion. The Prime Minister
          met the Taoiseach and agreed to facilitate Mr Justice Barron in his
          search for the files. Last week, the Secretary of State met Mr Justice
          Barron and said that police and forensic documents had been handed
          over. However, Mr Justice Barron still awaits many more documents.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The amount of relevant documentation is a disputed
          issue. Apparently, the Northern Ireland Office holds 68,000 documents
          — not including those held by the Ministry of Defence. The Secretary
          of State said that it has taken a considerable amount of time to go
          through the documents in order to provide a file for Mr Justice
          Barron. Quite rightly, the families do not understand why it has taken
          so long to provide the documents; it has been almost a year. It might
          have made more sense to provide such an enormous file of documents
          every month or every two months rather than hand them all over at
          once. Some people may now argue that the delay in the handover is
          stalling the inquiry and that, in the absence of the files, Mr Justice
          Barron may conclude that he cannot carry on with it.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It gives the impression that there is something to
          hide, and that should not be the case. To date, the garda
          investigation file remains open. The coroner has stated that he is
          prepared to reopen the inquests that took place so shortly after the
          bombings and that were closed so quickly. The families have always
          wanted a public statutory inquiry, but they have a private independent
          inquiry in its place. The least that they deserve is for that inquiry
          to reach its conclusions. The loss of their loved ones seems to have
          been compounded at every stage, initially by the Irish Government, and
          now by the UK Government.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There has been an enormous loss of faith in the
          institutions of the Republic, which, through officials’ actions,
          omissions and denials, have prevented the full disclosure of events.
          If people in Northern Ireland know anything about conflict resolution,
          it is that the least that the victims of the troubles deserve is to
          know what happened and why — to have the truth and to have closure
          on terrible events. Those families have not had that, and it is little
          wonder that they sum up what has happened to them as &quot;a trust
          betrayed&quot;.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I tabled the motion because we should be able to
          say to those victims, and to all victims who approach us in the
          Assembly, that they have our unanimous support. I hope that we can
          take the transcript of today’s debate to the Secretary of State and
          ask for action to be taken. Perhaps in one month’s time, the file
          will be available, and Justice Barron will be able to close his
          inquiry. The Irish Government will have to decide what to do following
          that.</p>

          <b>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr A Maginness:</p>
          </b>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Ms McWilliams for tabling the motion — it
          is useful that the matter has been brought to the Floor. The motion
          should not cause controversy in the House. The UK Government have
          agreed to co-operate with the Independent Commission of Inquiry into
          the Dublin and Monaghan Bombings. The problem is that the Government
          have failed to provide that inquiry with all the information that has
          been requested. The delay is becoming intolerable. It is appropriate
          for the House to deal with the matter and to emphasise the necessity
          for the British Government to make a full and true disclosure as soon
          as possible.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issues of transparency, accountability and
          public confidence are central to the case. We must remember that the
          Dublin and Monaghan bombings were the worst atrocity in the history of
          the troubles. Even the terrible atrocity at Omagh was not as great.
          The inquiry is long overdue and was not initiated lightly by the Irish
          Government. Many unanswered questions remain. Some 33 people were
          killed in those appalling attacks, for which no one has yet been
          charged. There have been persistent allegations that known suspects
          were not pursued, despite eyewitness identification. We must therefore
          examine the issues. If possible, we must reassure the families that
          everything has been done and that suspects have been pursued but not
          yet brought to justice because of a lack of evidence or another
          factor.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issue is not confined to the existence, or
          otherwise, of adequate evidence to secure convictions, however. It
          extends to wider issues that concern the procedures that were followed
          in response to the attacks — from the alleged connections between
          suspects, the RUC and the UDR to the level of co-operation offered by
          the RUC to the Garda Síochána. It also concerns the capacity of the
          UVF, which was clearly responsible for the atrocities, to have carried
          out such an attack without outside assistance.</p>
          <i>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.30 pm</p>
          </i>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a real suspicion that they had that
          assistance, because it is doubtful that they would have had the
          technical capacity to carry out such an attack at that time.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The families of those killed, and the survivors of
          those atrocities, are entitled to accurate information on how those
          events arose, the competency of the investigations that were conducted
          by the Garda Síochána and the RUC and why no one has ever been
          prosecuted. The families of the victims of the Dublin and Monaghan
          bombs have a right to know exactly what happened, just as the families
          of the Omagh bombing are entitled to know the details of the police
          investigations.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some events of our recent history have been of such
          magnitude that they now represent the core of our conflict — and the
          Dublin and Monaghan bombings are part of that core. The SDLP wants
          such representative issues to be examined so that the fresh air of
          accurate information can bring about the healing process, as Monica
          McWilliams rightly referred to it, and so that procedures can be
          established to prevent any recurrence of past wrongdoings. The SDLP
          believes that if key questions are not adequately answered, that will
          have a long-term and damaging impact on our efforts to move forward.
          We therefore support the motion and urge the British Government to
          fulfil their duty to provide full and accurate disclosure.</p>
          <b>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McLaughlin:</p>
          </b>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I am
          grateful to Monica McWilliams for tabling this important motion. I
          fully endorse her introductory comments and Alban Maginness’s
          contribution.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although I fully support the case that has been
          made, I do not wish to cover old ground. In the context of a conflict
          resolution process, it is important that we examine the clear evidence
          relating to many incidents, particularly multiple killings by Loyalist
          gangs that were later shown to have been penetrated, and sometimes
          controlled, by RUC Special Branch or British military intelligence.
          The Dublin and Monaghan bombings are a particularly horrific example
          of that.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other examples are easily brought to mind, and the
          current controversy over the investigation — if it is appropriate to
          call it that — into the Omagh bombing shows that a hidden hand is at
          work. Republican, Nationalist and, in particular, Unionist
          representatives must address that dimension of the &quot;dirty
          war&quot; in Ireland, because there can never be full reconciliation,
          closure or peace until that aspect of the troubles is included in the
          examination of the activities of Republicans and Loyalists. That forms
          part of society’s understanding of how certain circumstances arose
          and why they were permitted to continue for so long.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These events happened almost 28 years ago. Since
          then strenuous efforts have been made to elucidate the inexplicable
          failure to follow through on available evidence and to examine the
          precision that had never been demonstrated before or since by the UVF
          gang that claimed responsibility and which subsequently claimed to
          have acted on its own. That happened despite evidence from court
          records at the time, and for a long time afterwards, that the gang had
          been penetrated by British military intelligence. Why did the
          authorities in the Twenty-six Counties fail to confront and deal with
          this suppression of information? Why was the Garda inquiry wound down
          within three months? It is significant that when the Omagh
          investigation is scrutinised, exactly the same pattern emerges. First,
          there is an initial response, when the Government appear to act with
          authority and urgency and resources are poured into the investigation.
          Subsequently that turns out to have been a façade, important
          information has been suppressed and in some instances important
          evidence has been destroyed. After much propaganda and publicity the
          investigation is substantially wound down.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the case of Dublin and Monaghan there is a
          linkage to the difficulties that are now confronting those who are
          bringing forward arguments for full accountability and transparency.
          The answer is to be found in exposing, once and for all, the role of
          British military intelligence and the RUC Special Branch in the
          manipulation of those Loyalist death squads over that period of time.

          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Morrow:</p>
          </b>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was not going to say anything on the motion, but
          as I listened to the contributions from some Members, I decided that
          perhaps I should speak. It is interesting that some Members have
          stated that the motion should not divide the House and that it is not
          a motion that is pointing the finger. However, it is also interesting
          that some Members have stated that Unionists have something to answer
          for in relation to what happened in Dublin and Monaghan. As a
          Unionist, I have absolutely nothing to answer for on that.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Politicians of all ilks tell the House that it is
          time we moved on, that it is time to draw a line under the past and
          let history be the judge. Of course that is not what is being proposed
          in the motion, any more than what is being proposed in relation to the
          inquiry into Bloody Sunday. I do not hear those same people calling
          for an inquiry into Teebane. I do not hear a cry for an inquiry into
          the slaughter at the La Mon House Hotel or into the slaughter in
          Enniskillen in my constituency. I do not hear a great clamour for an
          inquiry into the atrocity in Omagh, other than its being used as a
          yardstick and an opportunity to pillory the security forces. I do not
          hear about an inquiry into Bloody Friday. There have been many acts of
          slaughter in this Province, yet inquiries are called for only in cases
          in which Republicans claim that there has been security force
          collusion. Every opportunity is seized upon to denigrate the forces of
          law and order and to put them behind the eight ball. I have no doubt
          that that is what is happening here.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms McWilliams stated that she had no political axe
          to grind on this, that it was simply a matter of getting to the facts.
          Alban Maginness again referred to security force collusion. According
          to some Members of the House, every time there is an atrocity such as
          this, it seems that there must be security force collusion.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We either move on, or we stand still, or we are
          selective. Some want to turn a blind eye to all the atrocities, but
          some of them were more heinous than others, as if that is possible.
          Yet, some of the most heinous atrocities do not seem to be of any
          consequence. That is something that we on the Unionist side find very
          hard to understand.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With no disrespect to Prof McWilliams, I have yet
          to hear her call for an inquiry into Enniskillen, where people were
          slaughtered while attending a Remembrance Day service. I have yet to
          hear her talk about Teebane, where Protestant workers were slaughtered
          on their way home. I have yet to hear her talk in the Assembly about
          La Mon House Hotel, but maybe I have got it wrong. Maybe she has
          referred to all the incidents.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The least that the Assembly must ask for is a
          degree of consistency. Let me make it quite clear that I have no brief
          whatsoever for those who carry out such atrocities. I do not believe
          that anybody should be marked out because of his politics. However, I
          would like to see a degree of consistency and less hypocrisy when
          Members are speaking here. When I am told that this is another one
          that is being referred to as part of the dirty war and that this is
          something that Unionists will have to address, I find that very hard
          to take, particularly coming from a group that is inextricably linked
          to the greatest killing machine in the whole of western Europe. That
          group is not cutting —</p>

          have suffered grievously, and they have yet to see the perpetrators
          convicted and/or get answers about the circumstances that led to the
          deaths of their loved ones. I only have to refer to last week, when we
          remembered the Teebane slaughter. We offer our sympathy to those
          people who are still looking for justice for that atrocity.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The problem with the atrocities in Dublin and
          Monaghan is the commitments that were given by our Government some
          time ago that have not yet been honoured. The Irish Government set up
          the independent commission of inquiry in January 2000, after pressure
          from the relatives of those killed and injured, because after so many
          years no one has been apprehended or brought to justice for
          perpetrating those horrendous outrages against innocent human beings.
          Of course, as I have said, that applies equally to all the outrages
          committed during the last 30 years.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Much has been written about the atrocities in
          Monaghan and Dublin, and rightly so. Fingers are pointed in many
          directions, but when the commission was set up, people were hopeful
          that answers would be forthcoming. At the time, the British Government
          gave an assurance of co-operation with the commission. Unfortunately,
          to date little or no co-operation has been forthcoming, and that is
          why we are discussing this today — in the hope that that will be put
          right.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The longer the saga continues, the more suspicions
          and rumours are created, which does nobody any good. We are all aware
          of the commitments and goodwill that were given by our Government —
          by Mr Blair, Adam Ingram, John Reid and many others — to help
          provide information to the commission of inquiry.</p>
          <i>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.45 pm</p>
          </i>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So far that commitment has not been honoured. Those
          gentlemen are hon Members of the British Government, and I urge them
          to do the decent thing and provide this vital information as soon as
          possible. We often hear people say that they support the victims of
          violence. This is a real opportunity to show that actions speak louder
          than words. Relations between Britain and the whole of Ireland are
          presently in good standing. I am thankful that, since the start of the
          all-party discussions that led to the Good Friday Agreement, relations
          between all the people in these islands have been at an all-time high.
          Let that continue.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Only this week, relatives yet again expressed deep
          disappointment at the outcome of a meeting between Mr Reid and Justice
          Barron. Again John Reid, our Secretary of State, said:</p>
          </font><font SIZE="1">
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;I will do all I can to see we are as helpful
          as possible.&quot;</p>
          </font><font SIZE="3">
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While that was a welcome statement, after nearly
          two years it falls far short of what is now required. All files held
          by the Government on the atrocities committed on that awful day, 17
          May 1974, must now be produced in full to Justice Barron. Only then
          can the relatives begin to see justice. The Alliance Party fully
          supports this motion and hopes that our Government will listen to the
          words of the Assembly.</p>
          <b>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr C Wilson:</p>
          </b>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My party would be pleased to support a motion in
          this House from any party that adheres to the democratic process for
          an inquiry into any act of terrorism in the United Kingdom or the
          Irish Republic, if we believed that the purpose of that inquiry was to
          ascertain the truth and apprehend those responsible for acts of murder
          and maiming. That would be true whatever group was involved —
          whether Republican or so-called Loyalist terrorists.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, having listened to Ms McWilliams, I will
          say most emphatically that we will not be party to what is clearly a
          farce. Ms McWilliams had the audacity to inform us about her and her
          party’s involvement in the Belfast Agreement — an agreement that
          brought unreconstructed, unrepentant terrorists back onto the streets
          of the Province to return to their trade. It was a process that did
          not put terrorists in the dock, in court or in jail but into the
          Government of Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Mr Morrow has pointed out, many events in
          Northern Ireland require inquiries. I am not just offended by the
          jurisdiction — by the fact that Ms McWilliams and her Colleagues
          feel that they should start calling for inquiries into the events that
          occurred in Dublin and Monaghan. When one reads of those events, one
          is struck by their similarity to the 30 years of violence and, as some
          have mentioned, the bloody Fridays that we have had in Northern
          Ireland. Indeed, every day was a bloody day in Northern Ireland —
          365 days of the year, every year for over 30 years.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms McWilliams and her Colleagues have suddenly had
          some attack of conscience on this matter. What I find most offensive
          is that it is clear that she and her Colleagues, other Members on the
          opposite side of the House and those who signed up to the Belfast
          Agreement are now prepared to endorse the latest move by the British
          Government under the terms of the Weston Park agreement. Those who are
          currently on the run for acts of terrorism are going to be given an
          amnesty. If she had anything genuine in her heart on this matter, she
          would not support that.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no point in having an inquiry to find out
          who organised, assisted and planted the bombs in Monaghan and Dublin
          if one is not prepared to take the next logical step: once you
          ascertain who was responsible, you apprehend them and bring them to
          justice. That is what the people of Northern Ireland and the Republic
          of Ireland require. Those responsible must to be put in jail, not
          granted amnesties. I did not vote in this House, as these Members had
          the absolutely disgusting audacity to do, to put those who front
          terrorist organisations — &quot;inextricably linked&quot; to terror,
          to quote the Prime Minister — into positions such as that of
          Minister of Education and Minister of Health, Social Services and
          Public Safety in Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we are to have public inquiries in Northern
          Ireland, let us have an inquiry into the activities in the days
          leading up to Bloody Friday of Mr Gerry Adams, the commander of the
          Belfast brigade of the IRA, responsible for organising and
          orchestrating that violence. Let us have an investigation into the
          activities of Martin McGuinness, that self-proclaimed member of the
          IRA — and we all know his role in that.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will return, Mr Deputy Speaker — <i>[Interruption].</p>
          </i><b>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker:</p>
          </b>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Wilson, I remind you that you must speak to the
          motion. You have moved off it substantially. I have given you quite a
          licence.</p>
          <b>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr C Wilson:</p>
          </b>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms McWilliams will need to explain to the victims
          of violence in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland why, when
          she is calling for this investigation on the one hand, she is saying,
          with her great experience of South Africa, that all she really wants
          to know is the truth. She does not want to go any further because that
          might ruffle a few feathers. It is OK to call for those who
          orchestrated and organised the bombing of Omagh to be brought to
          justice, but, we are told, the Sinn Féin Members who are glaring at
          us from across the Chamber must have immunity so that in the future
          the Minister of Education cannot be removed from his post and put in
          jail where he belongs.</p>
          <b>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McFarland:</p>
          </b>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Dublin and Monaghan bombings were appalling
          tragedies, and those responsible should have been brought to justice.
          However, while there was evidence, the Irish authorities considered
          that is was not enough to lead to convictions.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am concerned about the glee with which Sinn Féin
          approaches these subjects in the House. It sees Brit plots everywhere,
          and we have another one today. I am concerned about the present
          one-way traffic of these inquiries, and many Members have also drawn
          attention to that. Ms McWilliams talked about victims having a right
          to know what happened. There are over 3,000 victims who have a right
          to know what happened. The majority were victims of the Provisional
          IRA.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Where is the clamour by Amnesty International, the
          Committee on the Administration of Justice, the Human Rights
          Commission and others who quickly take up these causes? Where is the
          clamour to investigate the outrages of the past 30 years? We do not
          hear it. I have warned repeatedly in the House about having a truth
          commission. If we have learnt anything from South Africa, it is that
          we should not continue examining the entrails of the last 30 years.
          People from both communities in Northern Ireland need, and mostly
          want, to put the conflict behind them. Let us leave this behind us. If
          we get into 30 years’ worth of murder and mayhem and over 3,000
          deaths, with each one being investigated to find out who did it and
          when, this conflict will never end. We will be at this in another 50
          years with accusations across the Floor of the House between the
          communities about who did what and when. We should put this conflict
          behind us and let these issues lie.</p>
          <b>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms McWilliams:</p>
          </b>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us all be assured that the things that have
          happened in the past need to be opened up. John Paul Lederach visited
          Northern Ireland to address victims’ conferences — many of which I
          attended. He said to remember and to change — he did not say to
          forget. He said to remember everything that has happened to you, to
          change and to learn lessons from it to ensure that it does not happen
          again.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For those Members who are concerned about my moving
          this motion, every time there have been human rights abuses, currently
          or in the past, I have asked for them to be investigated. I have
          especially asked for an investigation for the families of the
          disappeared. I will continue to work with the families of the
          disappeared in Northern Ireland to ensure that they get some truth,
          even if they never get their bodies returned for Christian burial.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The inquiry is already established. This motion is
          not calling for an inquiry; it is calling for the closure of that
          inquiry. It is already up and running. Mr McFarland may have
          questions, as I have, about how many more inquiries we will have.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rest assured: there will probably be many more
          inquiries. I hope for Mr Morrow’s sake and for all of our sakes that
          some day there will be some kind of truth in this country about what
          happened at La Mon, Teebane, Enniskillen and elsewhere.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All of us who have read ‘Lost Lives’ by
          McKittrick, Kelters, Feeney and Thornton might be able to establish
          things that we did not know before. Until I read that book, I did not
          know that a close friend of mine was tortured before he was murdered
          in 1974, at exactly the same time as those bombings took place. That
          was a little bit of truth of which I was unaware. Can we imagine what
          it must have been like for that person’s mother to read that for the
          first time? That is what inquiries attempt to do. So many questions
          remain unanswered that the families, many of whom will be listening to
          this debate, simply want to know what happened and why.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If there are questions about why the Garda
          Síochána investigation concluded early, Mr Justice Henry Barron
          should answer them. If there are questions about the technical
          capacity of the paramilitaries to carry out the bombings, some of the
          files might answer them. What was the level, or lack, of co-operation
          between the Garda Síochána and the then RUC? Was there penetration?
          That would not be surprising after 30 years of the troubles in
          Northern Ireland. In order to gather intelligence from those operating
          against one’s police force, does one not try to infiltrate and
          penetrate in order to understand them better than they understand
          themselves? That is what I understand to be a line of military
          intelligence gathering. Do we not want to ask those questions and
          always have them answered? The difference is that we expect standards
          from those in charge of law and order that we might never expect from
          paramilitaries.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The inquiry is in place, and all that is being
          asked for is a full and truthful disclosure, and, it is to be hoped,
          some consistency. I have worked with victims’ organisations such as
          Families Acting for Innocent Relatives (FAIR), Families Against Crime
          by Terrorism (FACT) and others. Let no one be under any illusion that
          they do not disparage the word &quot;truth&quot; any more than the
          families of the forgotten do. What unites them is that they want
          disclosure, and they want some truth.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In order to protect ourselves from perpetrators, we
          have to have retribution. However, in a conflict resolution situation,
          there must also be some restoration of justice. The least that we can
          do is give those families a little bit of that.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In this Building last week, pupils from Lagan
          College presented a play by Paul Goetzee, ‘The Pilgrimage’, in

          <p ALIGN="left"><b>Mr Gallagher:</p>
          </b><center><font SIZE="3">
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issues of unemployment and job losses have been
          discussed in the Chamber before; they will be revisited today. In the
          constituencies in the west of the Province, unemployment levels are
          persistently high.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Lisnaskea is the second largest town in Fermanagh;
          it has a population of 3,500. In the past three years the town has
          suffered major job losses — there were 70 redundancies when the
          Adria factory closed, 80 jobs were lost when Fermanagh Creameries shut
          down, and 196 were lost when the Sir Richard Arkwright textile factory
          finally closed in July 2001. The loss of those 350 jobs has resulted
          in hardships for the employees involved, their families and other
          local people.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Belfast has a population of 352,700. Can Members
          imagine what would be the impact upon Belfast of 35,270 job losses —
          one-tenth of the city’s population — over a three-year period? The
          job losses in Lisnaskea were a severe blow to the town and to the
          wider Fermanagh community. The wages of employees at the Sir Richard
          Arkwright factory contributed some £2 million to the local economy
          each year. In the aftermath of the closures, there were promises of
          renewed efforts to secure more inward investment to the area. To date,
          however, there has been no breakthrough in that regard. Those who were
          made redundant were given some support in the form of help to relocate
          and retrain. Some were able to find work elsewhere, although many of
          those jobs were located outside the Lisnaskea area and some were
          situated across the border.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The unfavourable exchange rate disadvantages those
          who work in the South but live in Fermanagh and pay their bills and
          mortgage in sterling. For several years the difference in the exchange
          rate has created a downward trend in cross-border trade in towns such
          as Lisnaskea. The effects of that have now been compounded by the job
          losses.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A more hopeful sign has been the resolute action
          and attitude of the local community. The local development association
          has put in place a strategic plan to help small local businesses to
          grow. It has built small business units, all of which are already
          occupied. There is a demand for extra workspace, and at least one of
          the present tenants of one of those units is ready to move to larger
          premises and to increase his workforce. Conveniently located land is
          available for that purpose, and locals are formulating a plan to help
          to finance further developments. Their aim is to retain expanding
          business in the area and to increase employment. As we know, increased
          employment, in turn, will bring greater social and economic benefits
          for that hard-pressed area.</p>

          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is one example of the approach referred to by
          the Minister, Sir Reg Empey, at the time. I note that he is present
          for the debate. He referred to the development of local business as
          one way of countering the blows of factory closures in the Fermanagh
          area. Locally- owned, home-grown businesses are a success story in
          Fermanagh. However, indigenous industry must be nurtured by Government
          agencies. Therefore, I call upon the relevant agencies to give
          assistance to local development initiatives and to facilitate
          expanding businesses at Lisnaskea so that they can bring their plans
          to fruition.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We want inward investment in the area, and we are
          entitled to a level playing field when competing with other areas in
          Northern Ireland to attract new jobs. The area suffers from some
          disadvantages. For example, it is far from the bigger airports, and
          its roads are in a poor state. I repeat my demand that the Department
          for Regional Development includes the upgrading of Fermanagh roads in
          its plan. In response to a recent question in the House, the Minister
          for Regional Development, Mr P Robinson, said that it would help
          Fermanagh if the roads in neighbouring counties were upgraded. The
          people of Fermanagh will not be fobbed off with that suggestion. We
          want the roads in our county to be upgraded so that we have a level
          playing field for attracting inward investment and helping local
          businesses.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the job losses occurred at Lisnaskea last
          summer, there was a great outpouring of concern about the situation.
          We must remember that the employees who lost their jobs and their
          families are living with the consequences. Hence, I proposed this
          debate, and I ask that the creation of jobs in the area be given all
          the attention and support that it deserves.</p>
          <b>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Morrow:</p>
          </b>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is appropriate that the Assembly should discuss
          this matter at this time, and I thank Mr Gallagher for bringing it to
          our attention. About 18 months ago, people living in Fermanagh and
          south Tyrone read headlines in the local papers, such as, &quot;135
          Jobs lost in Desmonds closure&quot;; &quot;Staggering loss to
          Employees&quot; at the closure of Unipork and &quot;Shock turns to
          anger for cheesemakers out of a job&quot; when a cheese factory
          announced its closure.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the Lisnaskea factory closed, I contacted the
          Minister, Sir Reg Empey. I was impressed by his hands-on approach and
          his willingness to do all that he could to try to avert the job losses
          and create better prospects for the future. I attribute no blame to
          him whatsoever for his best endeavours. It is right that Members
          should acknowledge that he is present in the House today. He has again
          shown that he does not take these matters lightly but wants to adopt a
          hands-on approach.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At that time, around 18 months ago, when there
          seemed to be a catalogue of announcements, Sir Reg Empey said that the
          Malton’s closure was another regrettable setback for Fermanagh, one
          of the regions where the Department of Enterprise, Trade and
          Investment and its agencies were focusing initiatives to strengthen
          employment. I look forward to hearing how the Minister has advanced
          those initiatives since then. It would be appropriate for the Minister
          to tell the House what the future strategy is for areas like County
          Fermanagh. We are entitled to be treated like any other part of
          Northern Ireland. We could be forgiven at times for thinking that we
          are not treated that way. We will let others be the judge of that.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">County Fermanagh is an area of high unemployment.
          Unless we get investment quickly we could be in a very bad situation.
          The people of Fermanagh, in areas such as Lisnaskea, are innovative
          and have made honest endeavours to do things and to stimulate their
          area. They cannot do it without the support of the Minister and his
          Department. I call on the Minister to take a particular interest in
          County Fermanagh and the Lisnaskea area and for his Department to come
          up with a strategic plan that will directly tackle the recent job
          losses and, more importantly, stem the flow of redundancies that have
          come in a glut recently.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also ask the Minister if he is prepared to
          consider County Fermanagh for high-tech jobs. Fermanagh suffers more
          from the lack of that type of investment than any other region in
          Northern Ireland. I would like to direct the Minister’s attention to
          that particular type of work to ensure that the job losses do not
          continue in the days ahead. A proper infrastructure and a strategic
          plan are needed. I hope that the new Invest Northern Ireland board
          will divert some of its energy and money to tackling the chronic
          problem.</p>
          <b>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McHugh:</p>
          </b>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I
          thank Mr Gallagher for raising this matter nearly a year after the job
          losses occurred. Not much has changed for those who found themselves
          out of work in Fermanagh — Lisnaskea in particular, where almost
          half the total jobs were lost. I have looked at the figures relating
          to the factories that were closed. We all know which factories lost
          out. One of the worst cases was Fermanagh Creameries. Food production
          was something I considered to be fairly high-tech, given the quality
          of the machinery that was in that factory. I believe that it could
          have been continued. However, that is not the Minister’s fault, or
          indeed anyone’s fault. It is one of the things that happen. Members
          have no say or control over them. However, we must deal with them when
          trying to represent our areas.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was a perfectly good factory, which could have
          produced for years to come. It is now lying idle. Most of its
          machinery is dilapidated and can no longer work.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Agricultural businesses outnumber other businesses
          in the county. Although agriculture is important, it is also a
          weakness because of the great dependence on it. Farming, for example,
          is an industry in the doldrums. It is difficult to see a future for
          farming or a way out of the present situation despite the ‘Vision
          for the Future of the Agri-food Industry’ report from the Department
          of Agriculture and Rural Development. Of all registered businesses in
          Fermanagh, 58% are agricultural; the figure for the Six Counties as a
          whole is 33%. That highlights the area’s rurality and the importance
          of farming to its economy.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unemployment figures from the Department of
          Enterprise, Trade and Investment in 2001 show that 1,767 people were
          unemployed in Fermanagh: 1,264 male and 503 female. That gives an idea
          of the effect of job losses on those who expect to find work in the
          area.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All job losses have dramatically affected the
          people of Fermanagh. Such job losses are unacceptable. However, it is
          even more unacceptable to be told that the situation is improving
          because the number of people claiming jobseeker’s allowance is
          decreasing. It is not mentioned that the number is decreasing because
          people are being siphoned off into training schemes, forced to claim
          other benefits or entering part-time or temporary employment with
          lower wages.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A recent study by consultants for Fermanagh
          Economic Task Force highlighted a labour force reserve of 2,829,
          compared with a Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment jobless
          total of 1,766. The Department’s figures do not include those who
          are not claiming benefit because they work in a temporary or low-paid
          job, are unemployed, or are unemployed farmers. In addition,
          unemployment in the farming community is high and continues to
          undermine our economy’s ability to grow. There is a considerable
          difference in those figures, which the Minister can perhaps explain.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is clear that the peripherality of Fermanagh
          means that the area requires disproportionately more IDB investment
          and support to attract and retain inward investment and to develop
          local indigenous businesses — possibly more than anywhere else. IDB
          assistance in Fermanagh between 1996 and 2000 was 5% of the Northern
          Irish total. However, only 2·5% of the jobs that were promoted and
          safeguarded by the IDB were in Fermanagh.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A recent Department of Enterprise, Trade and
          Investment labour market bulletin recognised that districts in the
          west, among them Fermanagh and Tyrone, showed the highest
          concentration of long-term unemployment. In several districts, over
          34% of the workforce were long-term unemployed. In Fermanagh, the
          figure was 38%, while the figures for Derry and Omagh were both 34%.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">LEDU has had an impact on the small business sector
          with its business start programme. Of the 149 people in Fermanagh who
          completed the programme, 86 went on to start their own businesses —
          almost double the Northern Irish average. There is a significantly
          higher percentage of small business starts in Fermanagh in comparison
          with Northern Ireland as a whole, which proves that starting and
          establishing small businesses is one of Fermanagh’s strengths rather
          than attracting larger businesses, as the area does not have a large
          pool of workers.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Between 1995 and 1999, tourism ranked as the fourth
          highest generator of money in the local economy. The TSN programme of
          action is obviously one of the areas of greatest need. The ‘Measures
          of Deprivation in Northern Ireland’ report by Dr Mike Noble is
          significant. Perhaps the Minister and other Departments can look at
          how that will affect Fermanagh.</p>
          <i>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.30 pm</p>
          </i>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If all Departments follow suit, the figures show
          that among the voluntary agencies — even in health — anyone doing
          anything in Fermanagh is obviously at a disadvantage. The Noble index
          is unfair, as opposed to our position on the Robson indicator. We are
          losing a considerable amount of money. The local strategy partnership
          (LSP) may operate in respect of some of the new money for the new
          rural programme, and that impact will continue. I do not know what we
          can do about it, but the impact on Fermanagh will be severe in
          comparison to that on other areas, including urban areas.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The current population of Fermanagh is 57,000. That
          will rise to almost 59,000 by 2003 and to 60,000 by 2008. The
          population of working age will rise from 33,500 to 37,000 by 2008.
          Therefore, more people will be available either to look for work or to
          fill jobs provided by outside bodies. The Robson and Noble indicators
          will be significant, and that is worrying unless figures can be
          produced to show something different.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of the 45 Noble indicators, seven domain
          deprivation measures are combined to produce one overall multiple
          measure, with income weighted at 25%, employment at 25%, health and
          disability at 15%, education, skills and training at 15%, geographical
          access at 10% and social environment and housing at 5%. Seventeen per
          cent of our housing is unfit. The ranking is very low for something so
          important, and Fermanagh will fare badly as a result.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fermanagh’s strength is, as I mentioned earlier,
          in the small business sector. We have several small but considerable
          businesses that survive on their own. Whatever profits they make are
          returned to the business. Through the rural programme, we probably
          need to start up more small businesses in small villages to provide
          off-farm jobs. That has been done successfully in parts of County
          Monaghan.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our difficulty is that planning policy statement
          (PPS) 7 permits no commercial development in the countryside. Most of
          Fermanagh’s villages have no zoned areas for development, and that
          creates a problem for people who have to travel from places such as
          Rosslea to Enniskillen to start up a business. They are forced to pay
          for space that they cannot afford, when quite often they would prefer
          to start a small business in their own back yards or on their own bits
          of property. Many of our businesses started that way.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That has not been dealt with. Planning continues to
          be a severe difficulty for us, and it will continue to be so, even in
          the new rural development programme. It is for those Departments and
          Ministers to examine that matter and see what can be done; otherwise
          the new programmes will be a waste of time.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Businesses are more easily started across the
          border. There is more incentive from the Industrial Development Agency
          (IDA). Our problems seem to be greater. More business is permitted in
          rural areas, and that must change. We must encourage investors,
          together with small- and medium-sized businesses, into all areas.
          Small business managers must be persuaded of the benefits of staff
          training versus looking for capital handouts. That is often their
          chosen route, and it can be bad value for money. It should be
          explained to them that training their staff in marketing would gain
          them more.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The aggregates tax is obviously going to put us in
          an uncompetitive position. Construction is one of our strengths in
          Fermanagh, and it is a growth industry. It will become uncompetitive
          with the introduction of the aggregates tax, and I welcome the stay of
          execution on that.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fermanagh and, perhaps, Derry also are without
          broadband services, information and communication technology (ICT) and
          the superhighway. Other areas have those facilities. I mentioned the
          matter to British Telecom officials during a recent presentation, and
          its representatives said that they would look at that in greater
          detail. However, it puts Fermanagh at a competitive disadvantage when
          compared to other areas such as Letterkenny. Those services are
          important to education, and participation in the ICT industry is
          something that Fermanagh could gain from.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If my figures are correct, then, according to the
          Noble report, Fermanagh needs to benefit from rural proofing. That is
          why we have been arguing for rural proofing of the various
          departmental policies and the effect they have on rural areas.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Hayes Report raises other issues, and its
          implementation would make a big difference to a county that is in dire
          need of jobs. The Erne Hospital is one of the area’s largest
          employers and one of our greatest strengths, and we are hoping against
          hope for success there.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report from the Department of Agriculture and
          Rural Development’s vision group can also give benefits. The
          Executive will need to support their implementation by providing the
          necessary resources. Without those resources, much of the proposed
          rural programme will not happen. Agriculture faces a difficult future.
          Those developments may deliver local jobs, and the Minister of
          Enterprise, Trade and Investment, and others, should consider them.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister for his consideration of the
          jobs situation. The job losses that occurred were not his fault, and
          he was not in a position to do much to prevent them. He did his best,
          and he worked with everyone, including myself, to try to do everything
          possible for the people who lost their jobs. Many of those people have
          had to travel to firms such as Quinn’s, to places across the border
          and to other areas in search of jobs. Even though some of them have
          found employment, the fact remains that they have had to travel away
          from Lisnaskea. That shows that if local jobs were available, the
          people would be there to do them. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><a href="#top">TOP</a></p>
          <b>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment
          (Sir Reg Empey):</p>
          </b>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the opportunity to respond. The reasons
          for the debate are apparent, and they have been eloquently addressed
          by the Members who have spoken.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The substantial reduction in jobs, associated with
          the closures that have been referred to, is regrettable. However, as
          Members have accepted, the decisions to cut jobs were taken by the
          individual companies involved for their own reasons. I do not need to
          remind anyone of the difficulties that the food-processing and textile
          sectors in Northern Ireland have faced recently. Lisnaskea and the
          wider Fermanagh area have not been alone in suffering the effects of
          changes in the market place.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, we have been taking action to try to halt
          the decline in those traditional sectors and to encourage them to
          become more competitive. Many of the jobs lost were in the textile
          industry. The Kurt Salmon Associates (KSA) report that we
          commissioned, and which was published last year, is a clear example of
          how Government and industry have worked together to identify a way
          forward for the sector.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There were five themes for sustainable growth in
          the sector — focusing on branded products; applying e-business and
          knowledge techniques; the development of strategic alliances between
          suppliers, customers and centres of excellence; the development of
          more balanced sourcing of portfolios that include offshore suppliers;
          and the development of unique and desirable products.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As part of the recommendations of that report, a
          new industry-led company called Catalyst was established in December
          2001. It will provide strong leadership for the sector and continue
          the work of the report’s implementation team. The IDB will continue
          to work closely with the sector bodies and individual companies to
          ensure that the momentum that was built up following the publication
          of the KSA report is not lost. I wanted to mention that, because some
          people believe that we have given up on the textile sector. That is
          not true — it is still a significant employer in Northern Ireland
          and is well ahead of the national average. Between 13,000 and 14,000
          people are employed by the industry, so it is a significant sector by
          any standards. That does not compensate those in the Fermanagh area
          who have suffered. Nor does it compensate others in that sector, in
          areas such as County Antrim and County Down, who find themselves under
          threat. That sector has been under continuous threat over the past
          decade.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Work is continuing to replace the jobs lost in
          Lisnaskea and elsewhere in County Fermanagh. One way of doing that is
          to attract inward investment. I understand Fermanagh’s concerns that
          it has not had its fair share of new inward investment in recent
          years. There has been a significant number of visits to the county. In
          the last three years, there have been 13 inward investment visits to
          County Fermanagh. The IDB continues to encourage people to establish
          businesses there. Telecom and network service sectors have provided
          the bulk of new inward investment in Northern Ireland. It has been
          hard to encourage many of those businesses to establish in areas west
          of the River Bann. County Fermanagh is no exception, but we continue
          to try. However, despite the fact that the companies are offered
          incentives to locate in New TSN areas, they have concluded that a
          large critical mass of skilled people within a limited travel-to-work
          area is required for their types of business, and it has been
          difficult to encourage them to establish in certain areas.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The IDB has been working closely with others,
          particularly with council and community representatives, to establish
          how we can best market and promote the area to do our best for inward
          investors. At the end of the day, it is they who make the final
          decisions.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have also been collaborating with LEDU on the
          council-led economic task force, which was established in March 2001
          following job losses. The task force has been very important. It
          comprises representatives from all Department of Enterprise, Trade and
          Investment agencies, the council and the local community. It is a good
          example of how local people can respond, and we are ready to help that
          task force in any way that we can.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Inward investment is not the only solution. Most
          jobs in Northern Ireland are created by indigenous companies rather
          than by inward investment. Much has been done to stimulate and help
          the development of local businesses, enabling them to become more
          internationally competitive. One of the key priorities identified by
          the economic task force was the need to support small local businesses
          to identify and develop potential for growth. To this end, the
          Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment has offered financial
          assistance for the establishment of the Fermanagh growth programme,
          which is directed specifically at small businesses.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many companies from the area have participated on
          international-led trade activities, such as trade missions, trade
          development visits and exhibitions. They have also made use of
          tailor-made consultancy from trade advisors in the Middle-Eastern,
          European and Asian markets. Competitive assessment and improvement
          methods are also offered to companies in the area, and several have
          availed of these services. In addition, the IDB’s e-business service
          helps prepare traditional manufacturing companies to participate in
          the digital economy by using information and communications technology
          to protect and enhance their profitability and achieve sustainable
          growth. Some forward-looking companies have recognised the importance
          of this and have made use of the service.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Not all has been doom and gloom in the county.
          While this debate focuses on Lisnaskea, it must be emphasised that
          there are job opportunities in the wider area. For instance, in
          December 2000, I was privileged to announce the £2·5 million
          investment by Belleek Pottery, at a time when traditional companies
          were under pressure.</p>
          <i>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.45 pm</p>
          </i>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So far, that has resulted in the creation of 30 of
          the 50 jobs that were promised, and I hope to see the speedy
          conclusion of that expansion. Rye Valley Foods in Enniskillen is
          another success story: it is investing almost £14 million at its
          plant, which will ultimately create 130 new jobs in the manufacture of
          frozen prepared meals for the Irish, British and European retail food
          service markets.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">LEDU also remains active in supporting local
          industry in the Lisnaskea and Fermanagh area. For example, LEDU has
          represented my Department on the task force and on the Into the West
          and Innovation West initiatives. Last year LEDU organised a business
          growth seminar at which it presented a range of support services
          available to clients and at which the Fermanagh growth programme was
          launched. The LEDU western area regional action plan aims to ensure
          that all small indigenous businesses located within disadvantaged
          areas of Fermanagh and Tyrone are afforded the opportunity to
          participate in a range of business development programmes.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Raw unemployment statistics are only one indicator
          of unemployment levels. Members have pointed out that other issues are
          involved and that raw statistics cannot be taken on a stand-alone
          basis. However, they are not insignificant. According to the last set
          of figures that I have available, some 1,670 people are currently
          registered on the claimant count. That figure is 100 fewer than Mr
          McHugh’s figure.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This year’s pattern has similar highs and lows to
          last year’s. Last August unemployment rose to about 1,900, largely
          due to the closure of the Sir Richard Arkwright textile factory and
          the effects of other previously announced redundancies. However, that
          figure is still marginally below the figure for the same period in the
          previous year. The subsequent figures show that that pattern is
          continuing: unemployment is now slightly lower now than it was last
          year, with a difference of approximately 123. I acknowledge that it is
          a blunt instrument and that those figures must be viewed alongside
          other issues. It is true that some people may have moved on to claim
          other benefits or not sought re-employment. However, many people who
          lost their jobs last summer have managed to find themselves relocated,
          many of them in the Enniskillen area. Ironically, several companies
          complained to me that they could not attract labour and were having
          difficulties recruiting staff.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So there has been some displacement, and I do not
          doubt the validity of Members’ anecdotal evidence about people
          having to find jobs across the border and so forth. However, it has
          not been all negative, because some people have started their own
          businesses, having been counselled when they were made redundant.
          Admittedly, that number may not be large; nevertheless, it is
          significant as it shows that people have taken the opportunity to move
          on on their own.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As regards LEDU, if all goes well, we expect
          approximately five projects to be announced between now and the end of
          the financial year. Those five projects will create approximately 34
          jobs. Although I cannot be specific at this stage, the IDB is
          negotiating with some companies in the county, and I hope to be able
          to make some announcements before the end of the financial year.
          However, on the whole, the small business sector in the county is one
          of the most vibrant in the west of the Province.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many people there are actively promoting, expanding
          and starting businesses. The county is taking up a disproportionate
          share of the available resources in the west of the Province because
          there is a good core of businesses there. Clearly, there are people in
          the county who are anxious to progress. There is leadership from the
          council, and now a new basis and good analysis in the recent Quinn
          report. I am hopeful that this will send out a message that, despite
          all the difficulties, the county still has a vibrant, viable small
          business sector. Indeed, it is clearly growing, as I have outlined,
          with the projects that we hope to announce between now and the end of
          the financial year, and I see no reason why this should not continue.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, I am aware of the underlying fragility in
          certain areas. There is disproportionately high dependence on
          agriculture, and we all know that there are clear difficulties there
          — difficulties that apply right across the Province and further
          afield. Those difficulties do not often show up in unemployment
          statistics. Often self-employed farmers have to take a second job, and
          they do not necessarily show up as unemployed. At the same time,
          however, there is a reduction in earnings and therefore less money in
          the economy.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Foot-and-mouth disease had a disproportionate
          effect on two of County Fermanagh’s stable industries — tourism
          and agriculture. There is no doubt that our tourism industry has not
          yet fully felt the effects of 11 September; there is a long way to go.
          We know from experience in the Gulf war that it took three to four
          years for the transatlantic tourist traffic to return to pre-war
          figures. I see no reason to believe that we shall not face similar
          time scales. Tourism is re-focusing its emphasis on the European and
          Great Britain markets to compensate for the shortfall, and, of course,
          a major drive will be made in the Republic to encourage more visitors.
          Those areas will be targeted to supplement some of the anticipated
          losses from long-distance destinations.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am concerned that we are talking down the economy
          of County Fermanagh — almost implying that it is on its knees. It is
          not on its knees. It has suffered a bad period in its history with
          these losses. However, I am hopeful, as the county has a good
          community spirit. Many good voluntary organisations are working in
          close co-operation with the council and the statutory bodies, and
          there is co-operation between the statutory bodies, which is
          absolutely critical. Indeed, County Fermanagh is one of the leading
          examples of this co-operation in Northern Ireland. It is happening at
          a structured level. Resources are being put into it, and the council
          is taking a major lead. There is civic leadership in the area to
          justify support.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is also a strong small business sector, which
          we sometimes underestimate. The announcement of one or two extra jobs
          somewhere in the country does not necessarily make the headlines. The
          media gives disproportionate coverage to closures, and I have watched
          this closely over the last couple of years. If one tries to get a good
          news story on the economy into the press, one may or may not succeed.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The announcement of a closure will have no trouble
          whatsoever in achieving headlines. However, it will have a detrimental
          effect on our ability to give confidence to the business community in
          the county. People who wish to invest money need to have confidence.
          They are aware of what is going on around them, so if they hear
          stories of doom and gloom, they are less likely to invest.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another key issue that was raised during the debate
          was planning, and my Colleague, the Minister of the Environment, is in
          the Chamber.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a tug of war between the desire to help
          small businesses to locate in rural areas and the desire to protect
          the environment, and permanent tension exists between those two
          objectives. Many people would not want to see ad-hoc or willy-nilly
          development in rural areas, because that would spoil one of County
          Fermanagh’s key assets — its beauty. Indeed, that county has a
          collection of some of the most beautiful landscapes anywhere, and
          nobody would wish to see that destroyed. Therefore, the Department of
          the Environment has a huge task in trying to balance the protection of
          the environment with allowing the economy to grow. We must continue to
          discuss those tensions, which are reflected in the local community,
          the district council, communities in the wider county and elsewhere in
          rural Northern Ireland, because we want to protect our heritage and
          the environment. However, at the same time, we do not want to stifle
          economic development.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The tension is reflected throughout the community.
          It does not have any party political issues attached to it; it is
          purely a matter of how we see our future. My Department is interested
          in the matter, but we must be aware of that tension, and we do not
          want to destroy our heritage. We want to pass on an environment of
          which our successors can be proud.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another closely related issue is land and the
          provision of sites. That has been a live issue in Lisnaskea in
          particular.</p>
          <b>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Madam Deputy Speaker:</p>
          </b>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I remind the Minister that thanks to the
          family-friendly Standing Orders, our cut-off point is 6.00 pm.</p>
          <b>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
          </b>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to close on the issue of the land. We are
          negotiating with economic development people in Lisnaskea and await
          their proposals. I am hopeful that we can achieve a way forward. We
          are also looking closely at other projects in the county, which could
          ensure access to sites for industrial development. We want to
          encourage such development, because Lisnaskea has an excellent record.
          With several sources of funding, there is the potential to achieve a
          satisfactory outcome especially given Lisnaskea’s track record of
          success.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want Members to be aware that we are far from
          complacent. I thank Mr Morrow for his comments, but I regret that some
          of the communications concerned negative news. Nevertheless, the
          county has much going for it. It is beautiful; it has immense
          potential in the European Union for expansion of its tourism sector.
          However, people do not want to sit in a museum. They want to be active
          participants. They want to see businesses that can provide employment
          so that their children do not have to leave. Our agencies and Invest
          Northern Ireland, when that is established in the spring, are
          determined not to take their eye off the ball in County Fermanagh, and
          I certainly hope to visit the area in the near future.</p>
