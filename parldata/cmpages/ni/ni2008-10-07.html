	        <p class="H2DocumentDate">Tuesday 7 October 2008</p>

	        <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The Assembly met at 10.30 am (Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr  Dallat] in the Chair).</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Members observed two minutes&rsquo; silence.</p>
	        <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="1"></a>Private Members&rsquo; Business</p>
	        <p class="H4StageHeading">Cuts in Ambulance Services</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to one hour and 30  minutes for the debate. The proposer of the motion will have 10 minutes in  which to propose and 10 minutes in which to make a winding-up speech. All other  Members who wish to speak will have five minutes.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
	        <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly notes the proposals to reduce the level of  ambulance service provision and calls on the Minister of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety to find savings elsewhere and to agree not to reduce  the ambulance cover.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I express my gratitude to Members for agreeing that  the Assembly should debate this vital issue. I hope that our worst fears can be  allayed.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I pay tribute to the Ambulance Service in Northern Ireland.  Its staff continue to save lives, and the Assembly is grateful for their work  during the difficult years of the Troubles. Furthermore, more recently, crews  on duty have been attacked by stupid, callous individuals. I hope that such  behaviour is in the past.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that the motion will trigger a positive response from  the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, Michael McGimpsey. I  remind Members that, despite the doom and gloom that some commentators offer,  the Assembly has achieved positive outcomes for constituents. As the Alliance  Party health spokesman, I want major improvements to be made to the ambit of health  provision in Northern    Ireland. That said, progress is being made.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">On 15 May 2007, I proposed a motion that called for free  prescriptions for all patients. The Assembly unanimously supported that  proposal, and, on 29 September 2008, Minister McGimpsey agreed a time frame for  the introduction of free prescriptions. That is progress.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">On 17 September 2007, I proposed a motion to promote  equality for all through the introduction of free public transport for women  from the age of 60 That was introduced last week, and that is progress.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Many other positive health initiatives have been brought to  the people of Northern    Ireland. Indeed, only yesterday in the Long  Gallery, the Minister launched the Lifeline scheme. That scheme is an extension  of the mental-health provision and investment in the prevention of suicide and  self-harm. That is also progress. Let us give credit to the Assembly and to  Ministers for the positive new measures that benefit us all.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Given those steps forward, I hope that we do not back-pedal  when it comes to good provision for our Ambulance Service. We are extremely  concerned about the proposed cuts in ambulance cover across Northern Ireland.  I welcome Michael McGimpsey&rsquo;s announcement last week that &pound;17 million will be  invested to purchase 60 new ambulances and 26 rapid-response vehicles over the  next three years. However, real concerns exist about rapid-response vehicles as  they cannot transport patients to hospital. Real concern is also being  expressed about the proposed number of ambulance hours to be covered in all  areas.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">We are all too aware of the current unavailability of ambulances  when required, and we have all experienced that deficiency. On some occasions,  patients have had to wait far too long for an ambulance to arrive &mdash; and that  has put lives at risk. We are also aware of difficulties in getting ambulances  to move patients from one hospital to another &mdash; and that is before ambulance  hours are cut. Furthermore, we are being told that the Ambulance Service will  be cutting 15,000 hours, or more, from front-line ambulance cover in order to  comply with 3% efficiency savings. That is horrendous and incomprehen&shy;sible,  and it will definitely leave more patients in real danger. I appeal to Minister  McGimpsey to not put lives at risk by introducing the proposed cutbacks</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">In my own constituency, patients have been deprived of  ambulance provision in places such as Portaferry, Killyleagh and Saintfield,  which is totally disgraceful. In other areas, there have been recent incidents  in which ambulances have broken down simply because they were clapped out in  the first place.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly wants an Ambulance Service in which  constituents are confident. When there is a need for an ambulance, that need  should be met; and patients should be transported to hospital where they should  receive immediate, first-class treatment. In my own part of the Strangford  constituency, we have been campaigning for an out-stationed ambulance for rural  areas at the tip of the Ards   Peninsula. Unfortunately,  the campaign has not been successful to date, but we are determined to continue  with it. Perhaps Minister McGimpsey will revisit that request.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Scepticism remains about the rapid-response vehicle (RRV)  proposal in that both the RRV and the ambulance will be required to reach the  patient early. That might not always be the case, leaving patients and  relatives at risk.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The motion urges the Minister to make savings, if they need  to be made, in areas where the lives of patients will not be put in danger. The  major investment of &pound;17 million announced last week is very welcome, but we  have heard similar proposals in the past that were never delivered. How can we  expect to have a first-class Ambulance Service when staff are not properly equipped,  and when there is not the sufficient manpower to properly carry out the duties?  Ambulance staff are unhappy about current management demands about working with  greatly reduced ambulance-cover hours.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, I am grateful that Minister McGimpsey is  present to hear the many worries and concerns about the Northern Ireland  Ambulance Service. I ask Members to support the motion.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Buchanan</strong>:  I support the motion. No Member can doubt the invaluable service that the  Northern Ireland Ambulance Service has provided over the decades. I commend the  paramedics and staff who, through difficult and dangerous times and  circumstances, when they came under fierce attack, did not waver in providing a  service and demonstrated their professionalism and dedication to the Northern Ireland  people. Many people owe their lives to the professionalism and skills of the  Ambulance Service&rsquo;s paramedics and staff.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Ambulance provision is a lifeline for people in isolated,  rural communities who live some way from the nearest hospital. I come from a  rural community in County   Tyrone. Tyrone is the  largest county in Northern    Ireland, containing approximately 166,000  people, yet the Minister has stripped it of all acute hospital services. Consequently,  the Ambulance Service is the only lifeline for the residents of west Tyrone,  and that concerns people throughout the county.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Tyrone is the only county in Northern Ireland without an  acute-hospital facility, and that concerns not just medical staff, consultants  and patients but also elected representatives. Tyrone people must now depend  only on the Ambulance Service.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">People in Omagh were assured that a proper ambulance service  would be put in place before the removal of acute-hospital services. Sadly,  that assurance was put on paper but not into action. Without the necessary  life-saving services, people in west Tyrone, and further afield, will be  vulnerable.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I know that I am not popular with the Health Minister  because I highlight health disparities and inequalities in County Tyrone;  I know that I am a thorn in his side; however, I will continue to highlight  such matters.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Given that my rural constituency is now so dependent on its  much-needed ambulance service, I urge the Minister not to cut it any further. I  note the Minister&rsquo;s announcement last week about the provision of a new  ambulance fleet and about the finances that will be put into it; however, I am  concerned that using rapid-response vehicles will put people&rsquo;s lives at risk. I  am not convinced that that is the way forward.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">At the scene of an accident in a rural community, a  rapid-response vehicle would offer no more than a large box of medical  equipment &mdash; it would not be able to move a patient from the scene. Another  ambulance would have to attend in order to move a person who might be severely  injured. Therefore, it would be better if fully equipped ambulances were put in  place rather than rapid-response vehicles.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Perhaps providing rapid-response vehicles, which do not  serve the same purpose as ambulances, is part of a money-saving exercise, which  may result in people losing their lives. I urge the Minister to resist cutting  ambulance services and to ensure that the required service is in place for  people in rural communities.</p>
	        <p class="TimePeriod">10.45 am</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I am sure that the Minister would disagree that you are a thorn in  his side, Mr Buchanan.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  He is the thorn and I am the rose.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I commend Mr  McCarthy for tabling the motion, which is especially relevant on the day that  the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety is hosting an  all-day event for the emergency services in Parliament Buildings. Although that  event is aimed at promoting the positive work that the emergency services do,  it is important that we debate the negative aspects of the emergency services  in order to rectify those, so that, together, we can achieve a positive  outcome.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">In supporting the motion, I commend the good work that the  Ambulance Service carries out. Ambulance Service personnel are on the front  line in dealing with healthcare issues. Those people have a difficult job to do  at possibly every emergency that they are called out to deal with, and we must  recognise the difficult circumstances that they face. I am glad that the  Minister is present, because genuine concerns about emergency-services  provision exist, especially over ambulance cover. That has generated concern  among individuals, families and communities, who are worried about their safety  in the unfortunate event of their having to call for an ambulance.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Over the past few weeks, as the previous two Members to  speak have said, ambulances have broken down on their way to an emergency call.  With that in mind, I welcome the commitment that the Minister gave last week to  make available additional money to replace the ambulance fleet over the next  few years. However, I am concerned as to whether replacing the fleet will deal  with the issue of availability of Ambulance Service cover for our communities &mdash;  that balance must be struck. I do not want to come across as negative, because  additional money for the Ambulance Service is welcome, but we must send out the  clear message that, although we are replacing its fleet, we are not attacking  the service that it provides.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">We heard earlier about the problems with Ambulance Service  cover and about the issue of efficiency savings. However, it is important that  all Members, including the Minister, send out the clear message that, although  we are considering efficiency savings &mdash; no one is being negative about doing  that &mdash; all Departments must make such savings. We must make it clear that we  will not attack front-line services, because such a commitment will go some way  to reassuring our communities about those services.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">When proposing the motion, Kieran McCarthy said that people  have a genuine concern about the rapid-response proposal, and I agree with him.  Thomas Buchanan raised the issue of rural communities having additional  concerns, and I agree with Thomas on that. The Minister must reassure the  unions &mdash;</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:<span class="Italic"> [Inaudible.]</span></p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  I am agreeing with everyone today, Maurice; I will agree with you later.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister must reassure the House, unions, communities,  Ambulance Service personnel and those who live in rural communities that his  proposed changes will stabilise the service for rural communities and will  result in a positive outcome.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that we do not get confused or be negative  about the additional money that was given to the Ambulance Service last week.  We must find out whether renewing its fleet will make a positive difference to  the service and the cover that it provides, whether that be in rural or urban  communities or for rapid response. I support the motion.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  It is regrettable that today&rsquo;s motion has been tabled, because it is based on  rumour as opposed to hard fact. The Minister has made it clear that he will  bring any proposed changes before the Health Committee; therefore, some  perspective must be introduced into the debate.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Health Service in Northern Ireland is undergoing a  substantial period of change, reform and modernisation. Given his concerns  about the rapid-response vehicles, Mr Buchanan should speak to health  professionals and listen to their views on them.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">It is undeniable that those changes are linked to the 3%  efficiency savings that all parties and the Executive &mdash;including Sinn F&eacute;in and  the DUP &mdash; have agreed to and which all Departments are required to achieve.  However, those changes also represent a goal of developing a more efficient and  effective Health Service.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Northern Ireland Ambulance Service is an integral part  of the Health Service, and is, therefore, at the forefront of many of those  necessary changes. All Members in the Chamber will accept that we have a Health  Minister who is fully committed to the NHS and that he has already shown that  devolution can have a significant, beneficial impact for the people of Northern Ireland.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Changes occur because they are necessary. We must work with  the Minister to deliver those changes and achieve the best possible outcomes.  The modernisation and investment that the Minister has announced to date has  been necessary and will result in better ambulance service provision.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">In July 2008, changes to the ambulance service provision  were announced. That process of change was part of the 3% efficiency savings  that all Departments are required to meet. As a result of those changes, the  Ambulance Service was able to allocate &pound;2&middot;5 million for rapid-response  vehicles, additional coverage at weekends and a new pilot scheme that uses  doctors and control rooms to provide advice to patients. That modernisation  process will enable the Ambulance Service to respond more quickly and  appropriately to emergency calls, and, most importantly, patients will be put  first.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">In May 2008, the Minister opened the new regional dispatch  centre at the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service&rsquo;s Belfast headquarters. That new centre uses modern  command and control systems to assign clinical priority to emergency calls.  Furthermore, it uses geographical information systems to dispatch the nearest ambulance  available to a particular emergency. Moreover, the Minister recently announced  that up to 60 new accident and emergency ambulances, 60 non-emergency vehicles  and 26 rapid-response vehicles will be purchased over the next three years,  amounting to a &pound;17 million capital investment. The Minister also plans to  invest some &pound;100 million over the next 10 years in the fleet, the estate and  vital equipment, such as defibrillators.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">That amounts to the largest single investment in the  Northern Ireland Ambulance Service&rsquo;s history, and it has been welcomed across  the Health Service and the Assembly. With it, the Minister has given the  service the ability to plan more effectively for the future and to regularly  replace the ambulance fleet.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The reform package for the Ambulance Service must be viewed  in its entirety, and the Minister&rsquo;s decision will create an improved service.  Ambulance Service staff are some of the most highly skilled people working in  the Health Service. They are at the front line of the provision of patient  care, and they now have the vehicles and command and control systems to match  their skill and dedication.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">It is widely recognised that the budget that was given to  the Minister &mdash; even after he had fought for extra funding &mdash; was inadequate to  deliver all of the desired improvements. That, together with inflationary  pressures, which have led to the Ambulance Service&rsquo;s fuel costs increasing by  &pound;220,000 over six months, makes those achievements and the changes that the  Minister has made all the more welcome and notable.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  No. I have very little time left.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister is fully committed to involving the Health  Committee, the Assembly and the Health Service in all of the changes that he is  making. I urge Members to recognise that and to direct any concerns that they  have to their colleagues on the Health Committee and to the Minister himself.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  I support the motion. As other Members have said, the Ambulance Service is  highly regarded, and its personnel carry out valuable work in difficult  circumstances. Often, they must put up with abuse and, in some instances,  physical attack when they attend scenes in areas where rowdy mobs congregate at  the weekends. There is public outrage that those attacks are still taking  place.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Ambulance Service is an integral part of the Health  Service, and, as such, it requires major investment to bring it up to standard.  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s recent announcement to put additional resources into  the updating of the Ambulance Service, as have some of the Members who spoke.  The plans to purchase 60 accident and emergency ambulances over the next three  years, as well as the non-emergency vehicles and the 26 rapid-response vehicles,  are encouraging, because, as Members will know from the well-documented  examples that have been cited, the fleet of ambulances in some parts of  Northern Ireland has not been up to the job.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Can the Minister provide the House with more details on how  the new fleet will be rolled out? Will the areas in greatest need be assigned  vehicles in order of priority? Tom Buchanan informed the House of the concerns  that exist in Tyrone, and the same applies in Fermanagh. Those are vast rural  areas. Will those areas be given priority when the new vehicles are being  distributed?</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Sue Ramsey mentioned efficiency savings. I would be  grateful if the Department could provide us with information on how efficiency  savings and the Minister&rsquo;s recent announcement sit with the reductions in staff  cover that the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service announced some time ago.  Those reductions were particularly severe in Newry, in the Southern Health and  Social Services Board, and they also raised concerns for people living in the  west. In view of those proposed staff reductions and the ambulance cover in the  west, the Minister&rsquo;s recent announcement is important, welcome and encouraging.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">It is also important that the future need for an air  ambulance to serve all of Northern    Ireland, particularly the remote areas, be  kept on the agenda. Members accept that that need goes beyond Northern Ireland.  If an air ambulance is ever to be in place, it will have to be implemented with  the co-operation of the health authorities in the rest of Ireland.  Therefore it should be raised at some of the North/South meetings. Does the  Minister accept that? Has he had an opportunity to put that issue on the  agenda?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>:  Members are aware that we live in a world of finite resources. It would be  wonderful to have the unlimited means to finance all the schemes and programmes  that we could devise for the Health Service. However, we must establish  priorities for our spending, and it is imperative that we do not take chances  or cut services without serious consideration of the consequences.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">In the present financial context, the Minister is required  to make efficiency savings as part of the most recent comprehensive spending  review. Cuts in the health budget of 3% per annum for a three-year period  amount to serious challenges for a Health Service that many regard as being  already underfunded to meet the demands that are placed on it.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Ambulance Service has been set targets of savings of  &pound;1&middot;2 million for 2008-09; &pound;2&middot;7 million for 2009-10; and &pound;4&middot;4 million for 2010-11.  That amounts to a staggering reduction in resources of &pound;8&middot;3 million over the  next three years.</p>
	        <p class="TimePeriod">11.00 am</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  agree with the Member&rsquo;s analysis of the health budget. His party celebrated  when the Budget was passed &mdash; and celebrated particularly the settlement for  health. He seems to be telling a different story today, damning what he  describes as &ldquo;cuts&rdquo; rather than efficiency savings and saying that the Budget  was inadequate. Will he explain the DUP&rsquo;s change of heart?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>:  Those are efficiency savings. The Health Service received an injection of an  extra &pound;500 million from our Minister, so the Member needs to get his facts  right.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">To allay our fears, the Minister tells us that we have an  overall planned net investment of &pound;12 million for the next three years and that  funding of the service will not be cut. We are also advised that an additional  &pound;5 million will be spent on replacing our ageing ambulance fleet,  defibrillators and estate. Replacing clapped-out ambulances is, of course, a  priority, and savings can be made by rationalisation, the management of the  response system and the Health Service estates. The recent announcement that  several new ambulances will soon come on stream is welcome, and it is good to  see that a DUP Minister supplied the extra money for that purpose.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">However, we are told that one element of efficiency savings  this year will come from a re-profiling of ambulance cover, with 17,520 hours  of current planned ambulance cover replaced by 43,800 hours of paramedic cover  using rapid-response vehicles. Around 35,000 hours will be cut by 2009-10 and  70,000 hours of ambulance cover will also disappear by 2011, which should  concern us deeply.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">To the man or woman in the street, such information seems  to amount to smoke, mirrors and political spin. People want to be sure that if  they require an emergency admission to hospital, an ambulance will arrive  quickly for them or their loved one. First-responding schemes, serviced by  volunteer groups and rapid-response paramedics, have a part to play in many  emergency situations. However, people know that in any emergency situation the  first hour is vital. In that golden hour, critically ill people or those  seriously injured in road accidents must be delivered to hospital without  delay, whether they live in east Belfast,  Enniskillen, south Down or Londonderry. We  need to provide all the people of the Province &mdash; both in rural and urban areas  &mdash; with the security that Members of the Assembly put people first. We want for  them what we want for our own families in an emergency &mdash; the knowledge that an  ambulance will take them as quickly as possible to hospital, where specialists  will be on hand to deal with them.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">In this response-target environment we have the incredible  situation of an eight-minute target. If a medical response reaches a patient in  10 minutes and the patient lives, it is registered as a failure; if a medical  response reaches a patient in eight minutes, even if the patient dies, it is  registered as meeting the response target. Everyone connected with the delivery  of the Ambulance Service is worried about those changes. The target mentality  will cost lives, which seems to be the evidence emerging from similar reforms  in England.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Solutions for urban problems are not always applicable in  the mainly rural environment of Northern    Ireland. We need a fully resourced, fully  staffed, modernised ambulance service, supported by rapid-response paramedics  and well-organised volunteer first-responder groups to give taxpayers, who fund  the service, the reassurance that they need.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Anderson</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I share the deep concerns of the  Members who have spoken, and I thank the Member who proposed the motion.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The underinvestment in ambulance services in my constituency  of Derry was exposed in the most dramatic fashion  recently when the same ambulance broke down twice in as many weeks while  answering call-outs. Both of those incidents could have easily led to a  tragedy, and the fact that they did not was due only to sheer good fortune.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">On 13 September, the &lsquo;Derry Journal&rsquo; reported that the city  was without adequate ambulance cover for several hours on a Thursday night  because there were simply not enough vehicles available. That situation has  occurred time and time again. We are aware of those incidences and, despite the  assurances given by the Minister yesterday, some have had association with  fatalities because ambulances have had to attend from as far away as Fermanagh  when not enough ambulances, or none, were available in the city of Derry. That  is a shocking situation, and it is intolerable that any area &mdash; let alone a city  the size of Derry &mdash; should be left without  adequate ambulance cover for any period of time.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Instead of providing the kind of major investment in the  Ambulance Service that is so clearly needed, the Minister is planning to slash  the service. He wants to cut 15,000 staffing hours and replace traditional  ambulances with rapid-response vehicles. That is a genuine concern for many  people who may find themselves in need of a fully equipped ambulance that can  transfer them to a hospital. Those RRVs will be unable to do that, and it is  difficult to escape the conclusion that the proposals could end up costing  lives. The proposals will have a huge effect right across the North, and no  area or person will be left unaffected. Rural communities will become even more  isolated, as Tom Buchanan said, and our health workers, who already feel so  undervalued, will become even more demoralised.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">In July, the Minister claimed that there would be no cuts  to the Ambulance Service, but that is clearly not the case. Although I welcome  the recent plan to replace old ambulances, ultimately, that will simply leave  us at a standstill: the plan will not improve the service, it will merely  replace the vehicles that are no longer fit for purpose. It is clear,  therefore, that much more needs to be done, and the Minister must address  people&rsquo;s concerns and abandon plans to make cuts to the service.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I am also keen to hear his plans for greater co-operation  with the health authorities in the Twenty-six Counties, particularly in the  border areas of Derry and Letterkenny. To be  blunt, the issue of adequate ambulance cover boils down to a matter of life and  death. Some Members in this Chamber may laugh, but the matter is certainly not  funny. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order, please.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Anderson</strong>:  Those cuts will devastate people right across the Six Counties. Go raibh m&iacute;le  maith agat.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  Looking again at the motion, I must say that it could have been better put. It  was incumbent on the Alliance Party to do a bit better, particularly given that  it has taken on the mantle of opposition to everything that happens in the  Assembly. The motion calls on the Minister to &ldquo;find savings elsewhere&rdquo;. It is  very original thinking, indeed, to ask the Minister to go out and get the money  from wherever he likes. I have little doubt that the Alliance Party member who  makes the winding-up speech will want to suggest where the money should come  from. Money does not normally come from &ldquo;elsewhere&rdquo;; it is the responsibility  of the proposer of the motion to suggest where the money should come from.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  plan to do that.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  That is very good; we look forward to listening to what our colleague will say  later. The DUP will not divide the House on the matter, despite the motion&rsquo;s  ineffectiveness. Party members will allow it to pass because we agree with its  broad thrust, even though it is light on detail.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I speak as a representative of a rural constituency,  Fermanagh and South Tyrone, which others have mentioned this morning. It seems  that when cuts are made in any area, rural dwellers are always hurt the most. I  hope that the Minister will take cognisance of the comments made in today&rsquo;s  debate &mdash; I am certain that he will &mdash; and re-examine the Ambulance Service. He  recently, and rightly, announced plans to introduce free prescriptions. I hope  that the Ambulance Service will not have to pay for that proposal, and that  there will be no other reduction in services as a result of it. We will await  the Minister&rsquo;s response &mdash; no doubt he will reassure us that that will not be  the case.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Buchanan and others have already pointed out that those  of us from the west of Northern    Ireland are concerned about the future of  health services in general. For example, there are no longer any acute services  in the South Tyrone Hospital;  the status of the hospital in Omagh has changed or is changing; and a new  hospital has been prescribed for Fermanagh.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">It would be interesting to know how plans for that new  hospital are progressing, because all those matters are interlinked and  important. In May, I asked the Minister for his comments on ambulance services  in Dungannon, bearing in mind that that area has the oldest ambulance on the  road. In one incident in Tyrone, the back door fell off an ambulance as it was  transferring a very ill patient from one hospital to another. That is not the type  of service that instils confidence in the community. That is not a criticism of  Ambulance Service crews, because they provide a valuable service, which is much  appreciated.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I take this opportunity to condemn attacks on our Ambulance  Service and other emergency services, and I condemn the irresponsible people  who are involved in that activity. Such action is intolerable in this age.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister declared that he was satisfied that the  vehicles were roadworthy, but is it acceptable for ambulances of a certain age  to be on the road? The Minister made his recent announcement, and that was very  welcome, but we want to ensure that ambulance services in rural areas will be  fit for purpose and that will be as effective and efficient as that which is  being provided for urban areas. I hope that the Minister will take time to  address those issues, because they concern rural dwellers. At times, we feel  that we are very much second-class citizens, and that we do not get the same  treatment as people who live in urban areas.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I see that you are looking at the clock, Mr Deputy Speaker.  I could say much more about this issue, but perhaps there will be an opportunity  to do that in the future. We will propose a better motion next time, Mr  McCarthy.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I support the motion. This debate  is very important, and it provides an opportunity to hear the Minister&rsquo;s thoughts  on this issue. Hopefully, the Minister will clarify that the threat is not as  great as it first seems.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I pay tribute to the Ambulance Service for its work over  the years in providing a service that takes the place of the health service  that should exist in rural areas. When maternity and medical beds were closed,  and acute services across Tyrone were closed, we were promised that there would  be adequate ambulance services to ensure that patients&rsquo; safety was in no way  endangered. However, that was simply a bluff to get people over the initial bed  closures. It seems that every service is being transferred to the greater Belfast area and that  whatever happens in rural areas is no one&rsquo;s concern, but it is a concern to  residents and representatives from rural areas.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The South   Tyrone Hospital  has closed, as have acute services in Mid Ulster, Omagh and Tyrone. Therefore,  the promises that have been made must be fulfilled. Those were not simply  promises to get over the media hype in the short term &mdash; they were promises to  provide adequate cover for rural dwellers in those areas.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">During the suspension of the Assembly, Ulster Unionist MLAs,  MPs and party leaders, and other parties, promised that if they took the health  portfolio in the future, acute services would be restored immediately and new  hospitals would be built. However, the Minister has been in post for more than  12 months, but there have been no proposals for acute services to be replaced  or for new hospitals to be built, as his party promised. It is important that  those promises be fulfilled, along with the promises of investment in the  Ambulance Service and other medical services. There is a proposal to replace  the ambulance fleet with a smaller fleet, but that is not adequate to provide the  essential cover that is required.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the fact that the Ambulance Service&rsquo;s vehicles  are to be replaced, but we must also ensure that adequate cover is provided  across the North &mdash; including rapid-response cover where required &mdash; so that  patients can be delivered to hospitals quickly.</p>
	        <p class="TimePeriod">11.15 am</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">We were led to believe that none of us would need new  hospitals at all, because the massive new building at the Royal Victoria   Hospital was supposed to  cater for the whole of the North and provide the rest of us with all the  necessary services. Last Friday, I dealt with a constituent who had been in the  Mid-Ulster Hospital  for a few days receiving treatment for a number of broken bones, but who could  not be transferred to the Royal   Victoria Hospital.  That patient could not be treated in the new building. If a patient lives in  the greater Belfast area, he or she can be taken  to the Royal Victoria  Hospital within 10 minutes, but a  patient from a rural area might have to wait a few days before an ambulance can  take him or her to Belfast.  Even last Friday, when my constituent was told that the transfer would take  place, no ambulance could be found to take the patient from the Mid-Ulster Hospital  to the Royal Victoria Hospital.  It took several phone calls to obtain a response, and, in the end, a different  vehicle had to be found. People in the rural community are concerned about  those issues.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister&rsquo;s announcement that prescription charges would  be done away with was welcome. However, he accompanied that important statement  by saying that there would be no reduction in other services. I hope that the  Minister lives up to those commitments, and that they were not just PR stunts.  I hope that services will be maintained and enhanced, and that the benefit of  those services will be felt, particularly in rural communities.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Ambulances are the only lifeline available to those  communities. It is important that the Minister reviews the decisions that were  made by the Health Service and ensures that the promises that were made about  ambulance cover to the people of Mid Ulster, Fermanagh, Omagh and across Tyrone  are kept in future. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>: I  pay tribute to the staff of the Ambulance Service in Northern Ireland, who over  the years, and particularly in the dark days of our past, carried out a most  demanding duty in a way that was a credit to their professionalism as they  attended many incidents which were horrific to say the least. Ambulance Service  personnel attend road traffic accidents and other incidents daily, reflecting  their sheer determination and continued professionalism.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I concur with the comments of my party&rsquo;s chairman and Whip,  Lord Morrow, who highlighted the deficiencies in the Alliance Party motion. We  look forward to hearing that party put some meat on the bones, because it has  failed to do so to date. To anyone who has suffered in an emergency, and who  has required Ambulance Service support to reach hospital and receive  life-saving care, the prospect of cutting that most important link must sound  like insanity.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Despite its ineffectiveness because of a lack of detail,  the motion raises the prospect of a significant threat to the health and  well-being of any of us who might at some time in the future need an ambulance  in an emergency. The Minister is not excluded from that, even if it were only  to remove the thorn from his side that was referred to earlier in the debate.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to highlight to the Minister the particular needs of  my constituency. Obviously, the debate gives Members the opportunity to raise  specific issues. For some time now, fears have been expressed in Ballymena, in  my North Antrim constituency, about the risks  that local people might face as a result in the reduction in ambulance cover.  Those fears are on the verge of being realised. One of my party colleagues on  Ballymena Borough Council, Councillor Tommy Nicholl, articulated the problem  that is facing Ballymena when he pointed out that Ballymena&rsquo;s ambulance cover  must continue if local people are to be offered top-quality care.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I wonder what excuse the Minister will give if Ballymena  loses one third of its daily cover. How much confidence in the Minister will  the people of Ballymena have if he tells them that that cut is the result of  efficiency savings, when he should be making ambulance cover a priority? Rather  than carry out a cost analysis, the Minister should conduct a &ldquo;care analysis&rdquo;.  That analysis should be central to any decisions that he makes on ambulance  cover.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I remind the Minister that there are currently three fully  staffed ambulances serving Ballymena daily. The Northern Ireland Ambulance  Service&rsquo;s proposed cuts in order to meet his Department&rsquo;s budget strategy will  mean that the people of Ballymena will see one of those ambulances shed. That  equates to 2,685 hours &mdash; or 112 days, 16 weeks or four months &mdash; of cover. That  is the situation that my constituents in Ballymena are facing. Although much  praise has been heaped on the head of the Minister this morning after his  welcome announcement that new ambulances are to be provided and that money is  being spent, we must seriously consider whether those developments are being  implemented in a manner that is to the best possible advantage of the people  who use the service.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Can the Minister confirm that his plans to purchase  rapid-response vehicles and other ambulances for the fleet have the full  confidence of Northern Ireland Ambulance Service staff? In discussions that I  held with its staff in my constituency, they raised, and continue to raise,  serious concerns about the future of the Ambulance Service.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister clarify his position on obtaining public  service vehicle licences for ambulances? Will he perform due diligence and  ensure that care is taken of the existing ambulance fleet? Lord Morrow referred  to an incident recently in which a door fell off the back of an ambulance. I  want the Minister to state his position on that incident &mdash;</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>: &mdash;  and give assurances that he will continue to provide a top-class Ambulance  Service for Northern Ireland.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Boylan</strong>:  Will I have extra time added to my speech? Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann  Comhairle.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Members who tabled the motion. Sinn F&eacute;in  admires the men and women of the Ambulance Service for their commitment and  dedication to their work, especially in difficult circumstances. I come from a  rural community, so I am aware of people in isolated areas&rsquo; concerns about any  cutbacks in services, especially cutbacks in critical services, of which  ambulance services are one. Public concerns have also been raised in recent  weeks about incidences of vehicles breaking down.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister&rsquo;s initial announcement of his plans to replace  fully equipped ambulances with rapid-response vehicles has, on reflection,  raised the question of whether those vehicles will be able to satisfy all  patients&rsquo; needs. I ask the Minister to satisfy the public&rsquo;s concerns, as well  as those of Ambulance Service personnel, particularly over the transportation  of patients to their nearest facility.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Rural communities in particular feel that they need a  greater degree of Health Service investment and increased ambulance provision.  Ambulance Service personnel say that a system based on rapid-response vehicles  is not suited to rural areas, considering that the Ambulance Service, by its  own admission, treats everywhere outside Belfast as rural. That is a concern.  Can the Minister assure people from the vast rural community that any changes  to the Ambulance Service will not have a detrimental effect on them?</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">That issue, as I am sure the Minister is aware, has been a  major concern in south Armagh. Whether  ambulance services from Daisy   Hill Hospital  are to be retained is a concern. Indeed, the prospect of all that hospital&rsquo;s  services being diluted is a concern. People in the area have asked for a review  of the service. Most people in south Armagh  live outside of areas that ambulances can reach within the stated 20-minute  response time. When one considers that all medical evidence states that a  stroke victim has a greater chance of recovery if reached within eight minutes,  it is clear that many people fall outside that critical response time. Sinn  F&eacute;in has consistently lobbied for action on that matter.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Is the Minister saying that his welcome announce&shy;ment about  the abolition of prescription charges a few weeks ago has forced him to make  cuts in other areas, which will affect the overall quality of the Health  Service? If so, the Chamber and the general public would appreciate an honest  answer. I support the motion. Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I said recently in the Chamber that one ambulance station to cover the whole of  Strangford is not enough. Strangford is in severe need of at least one more new  ambulance, because four of the five ambulances in the constituency are five  years old. The mileage of those four ambulances is 167,000, 172,000, 174,000  and 192,000 respectively. The six-year-old ambulance has only 106,000 miles on  its clock &mdash; perhaps it is being nursed because of its age.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Ye dinnae hae tae bae a car sales man tae bae fit tae wrocht  oot at thae ambulances ir neir done. Thon isnae onie a wie fer me tae get mae  spoke in aboot hoo mich we hae need fer new  ambulances &ndash; bit hit shews hoo mich  thae ambulances ir uised an&rsquo; hoo they ir allus in uise. Tae gie less cover wil  hae the ootcum at simboadie at bes in an emergency an leukin fer an ambulance  wulnae get yin es fast es they wud hae done.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">One does not have to be a car salesman to work out that  those ambulances are on their last legs. I am not quoting those figures to get  the spoke in for how much we need new ambulances, but they illustrate how much  those ambulances are used. Therefore, lessening cover will mean that someone  who calls for an ambulance in an emergency will not receive one as quickly as  they should. Newtownards is in the top 20 out of over 60 areas in the Northern  Ireland Ambulance Service table of response origins by priority. Therefore, we  require a fully functional and dedicated service. I pay tribute, as other  Members have, to the Ambulance Service personnel; they do an excellent job and  need the correct equipment to do it even better.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The statistics that I quoted are from the response to a  question for written answer that was asked by my DUP colleague Jim Wells  because an ambulance in his area had broken down when it was on an emergency  call. The figures in the response are very worrying. Why are the emergency  services in Strangford using vehicles that have nearly 200,000 miles on the  clock and should have long since been replaced? Strangford requires several new  ambulance vehicles and cannot afford any lessening of cover, lest it mean that  a life is the price of cutting back the service.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The stated response target is for 70% of category-A &mdash; life  threatening &mdash; calls to be attended within eight minutes. For those of us who  live in the Ards Peninsula, eight minutes is an impossible target &mdash; the drive  from Ards to Portaferry takes at least 25 minutes when driving carefully and  adhering to the speed limits. The Ards   Peninsula is already at a  disadvantage, and we cannot afford to have any less ambulance cover. Therefore,  I was dismayed to learn from the news that further cuts will be made to the  Northern Ireland Ambulance Service. It seems that more cover is taken each year  from the Ards, and from the peninsula, in particular. Last June, there was a  threatened reduction of ambulance cover on Monday and Tuesday evenings &mdash; such  threats cannot continue. It is time to put the house in order and allocate the  necessary funding to ensure that our ambulance cover is not further diminished.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I agree with UNISON that the rapid-response vehicles simply  do not cut it. They are not as well equipped to handle emergency situations as  ambulances, and lives could be lost that would be saved if a fully equipped  ambulance got to the scene quickly and transported the patient to hospital. A  local district nurse told me that a rapid-response vehicle does the same job as  her, and that, when she rings 999, she requires a vehicle that can transport  the patient to hospital, not merely assesses the needs of the patient.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I often hear the sound of an ambulance siren when I am in  my office, which tells me that someone is in trouble. We must ensure that when  people are in trouble they receive the best service. Ambulances provide  life-saving care, which is being jeopardised by cuts and by not having  sufficient new ambulances in place. I ask the Minister of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety to examine the Ambulance Service and not just demand  savings at any price. We are playing not merely with figures &mdash; we are playing  with human lives.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">It is not a matter of saving pounds; it is about saving  lives. The Minister must examine the matter personally and take responsibility  for the service in the area in which he lives. The Ambulance Service in  Strangford and across the Province must improve. People demand that from the  Health Minister.</p>
	        <p class="TimePeriod">11.30 am</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  I thank my colleague Jim Shannon for pointing out the inadequacies of provision  in the Strangford constituency. Not only is the ambulance fleet depleted, but  it is inadequate for the job of work for which it was designed. We must  remember the disadvantages that rural communities in Northern Ireland face. In the  narrow roads, highways and byways of the Province, getting directions and  finding addresses are some of the many factors that add to the time that is  lost when ambulances are called out on emergencies.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">There are several young people in the Gallery. I appeal to  young people across the Province to stop making hoax 999 calls in order to have  ambulances and fire engines dispatched. It is detrimental to people who  genuinely need that provision. Ambulance and fire-engine crews do not need  those additional pressures.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McClarty</strong>:  Does the Member accept that young people are not the only ones who make such  calls to the emergency services?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  I thank the Member for his intervention. Of course, that is the case &mdash; sadly.  Adults should know better. Statistics show, however, that the younger  generation usually make the calls.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Ambulance Service has been a crucial emergency service  in Northern Ireland  throughout the years. I want to record the Assembly&rsquo;s gratitude to members of  the service for their invaluable work in the community. They must not be  short-changed in their ability to deliver the response that Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  people expect. Like Members who have spoken earlier in the debate, I have  concerns about the Minister&rsquo;s proposals for the Ambulance Service. I look  forward to the fulfilment of the promise of &pound;12 million investment during the  next three years. I look forward to the renewal of 20 Ambulance Service  vehicles each year for the ensuing three years. I look forward to the  fulfilment of the promise of &pound;2&middot;5 million&rsquo;s being invested in new  rapid-response vehicles. I also look forward to when the Minister brings his  proposals to the Health Committee. However, like most Members, I am sure that  those proposals will, once again, fall short of the service&rsquo;s needs and  requirements.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Again, the proposed investment is cosmetic. It simply  replaces what already exists. It does not enhance the service&rsquo;s ability to meet  emergencies that happen on the roads; sudden illnesses; or unfortunate  tragedies that happen in communities through various accidents. There have been  several examples in the debate of the service&rsquo;s inadequacy in meeting  emergencies, particularly in the west of the Province. People want an Ambulance  Service that is not funded by recycled money, but by new investment. I am  delighted that the Minister is present to respond.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Ambulance Service cannot be short-changed. It is matter  of saving lives. Time is of the essence when emergencies occur. If a door falls  off an ambulance while a patient is being treated in it; if a wheel comes off;  if an ambulance breaks down when it has a history of doing so &mdash; it is not fit  for purpose. It is not fit to deliver the provision that the community needs.  The service is only as good as the provision that exists. It is only as good as  the vehicles in which investment is made.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I appeal to the Minister: in order to deliver a first-class  service, he must examine the matter more closely and ensure that adequate  resources are found in order to provide the best vehicles and fleet that is  required for the service to have an impact in the community and cut the number  of lives that are lost for reasons that we cannot understand or know about.  Time is not on the side of a person who is found lying by the side of a road,  or in his or her home, having suffered a major heart attack. I appeal to the  Minister to consider the matter and, rather than come up with a cosmetic  answer, find real solutions that involve real funding.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mr McGimpsey)</strong>: I thank Mr  McCarthy and Ms Lo for proposing the motion. Several points have been made, and  I will attempt to respond to them. I welcome the opportunity to clarify the  position on Ambulance Service efficiencies and to address some of the misconceptions  about what will happen over the comprehensive spending review (CSR) period. In  particular, I reassure Members that the level of Ambulance Service provision  will absolutely not be reduced.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I share Members&rsquo; appreciation for the work carried out by  the staff of the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service. It is not merely a  transport service; it is the front line of emergency care. The men and women of  the service &mdash; skilled health professionals who deliver that vital life-saving  service &mdash; deserve to have modern equipment, vehicles and technology to allow  them to deliver high-quality emergency care to the public.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">To that end, on 1 October, I announced a major investment  in the Ambulance Service, which totals almost &pound;100 million over the next 10  years. That includes &pound;17 million over the current CSR period. That is a hugely  significant investment that will allow the service to modernise its estate and  replace its fleet and equipment on a regular basis. During the CSR period, that  will allow for the purchase of around 60 new accident and emergency (A&amp;E)  ambulances over the next three years to replace older vehicles. A further 60  non-emergency patient-care vehicles will also be purchased, as well as 26  rapid-response vehicles.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">A rapid-response vehicle carries all the equipment of an  A&amp;E ambulance, except for a stretcher. The point of that vehicle is to  arrive at the scene of the emergency rapidly: the first few minutes are vital.  Ambulance work is not all about snatching people off footpaths, or out of their  homes, and rushing them off to hospital. It is about rendering vital medical  support as quickly as possible; and rapid-response vehicles &mdash; which are always  manned by a fully trained paramedic &mdash; provide a way to do that.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I realise that many who have looked at that my proposals  for efficiencies in ambulance services have thought only about the A&amp;E  ambulance numbers, and they have equated that to the levels of service. I wish  to explain the impact of the efficiency measures and the new investment in our  ambulance services.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">It is interesting to note how some DUP Members talk. When  Peter Robinson was Minister of Finance and Personnel, he spoke of  &ldquo;efficiencies&rdquo;. However, now those efficiencies have become &ldquo;cuts&rdquo;. My  proposals contain efficiencies, not cuts. The money that comes out of the  service goes back in.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">To clarify the position, the Executive has agreed that all  Departments must deliver 3% efficiency savings over the next three years. My  Department will deliver &pound;118 million, followed by &pound;233 million, then &pound;344  million.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: No. I am in the middle of my  speech.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  He will not give way.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I may give way in due course. I  do not need asides. I am explaining this matter to the House and reminding it  where we are with respect to efficiencies.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Those efficiencies will total around &pound;700 million. That was  agreed to by the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in at one of the Executive Committee meetings  that we managed to hold.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Every health and social-care organisation has been asked to  deliver efficiency savings. The Northern Ireland Ambulance Service has been set  the same target, relative to its size. The efficiency savings set for the  service over the CSR period are as follows: &pound;1&middot;2 million in the first year,  &pound;2&middot;7 million in the second, and &pound;4&middot;5 million in the third.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive had good reason to ask for efficiency savings.  This is not just about money; it is about making the service more efficient.  The need to improve the efficiency of public services is real. It is crucial  that additional resources be released to improve the way in which those  services are delivered to the public. The Health Service is one of the areas  most in need of investment, so it must be involved.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">As I have said repeatedly, we need investment, we must be  efficient, and we need to engage the population in public health. The demand on  the Ambulance Service is rising at around 10% per annum &mdash; year in and year out,  an extra 8% to 10% burden is added to the service. Clearly, if the Ambulance  Service continues to work in the way in which it always has done, it is not  going to meet that demand.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Department has identified savings of &pound;4&middot;5 million by  year 3. Of the total funding generated throughout the CSR, I will allocate &pound;12  million to the Ambulance Service in additional revenues. That will see the  Northern Ireland Ambulance Service&rsquo;s operating budget increase by around 24%  from &pound;46&middot;5 million last year to &pound;57 million in 2010-11. Therefore, I will  continue to invest in the resource. Ambulance Service resources will increase, rather  than be cut as has been suggested. The additional investment of &pound;12 million  will allow the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service to modernise its services;  respond to emergency calls faster, and help to deliver life-saving emergency  care to the people who need it.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Ambulance Service has suggested a range of realistic proposals  on how it will deliver its CSR efficiencies without affecting services. For  example, up to &pound;1 million will be found from a reduction in absence and from  generic efficiencies. Those will include more efficient training and  administration, fleet servicing, and reconfiguration of non-emergency vehicles&rsquo;  hours of operation. Several Members expressed concern about that point. The  Ambulance Service&rsquo;s proposals will see a small reduction in the number of  accident and emergency ambulances and an increase in the number of  rapid-response vehicles. Overall, there will be a net increase of seven  vehicles providing emergency care and delivered by skilled paramedics.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I will make another point clear: the effectiveness of the  provision of ambulance services is not measured simply, or solely, by the  number of accident and emergency ambulances on the road. We must examine the  service&rsquo;s capability to respond to emergency calls and ensure that available  resources are targeted at enhancing the level of the emergency cover that the  Ambulance Service provides. By the end of the CSR period, paramedic-response  capacity &mdash; by which I mean the total amount of cover provided by accident and  emergency ambulances and rapid-response vehicles &mdash; will be increased by 61,000  hours to more than 600,000 hours of cover.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The net increase in vehicle numbers means that more  vehicles will be on the ground to provide emergency care. I assure Members that  jobs will not be lost as a result of the efficiencies. At present, the  Ambulance Service employs 1,076 people. There will be no reduction in that  figure as a result of the efficiency proposals.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Reports in the media and elsewhere have insinuated that a  paramedic who responds to a call in a rapid-response vehicle is somehow not as  effective as one who responds in an accident and emergency ambulance &mdash; I do not  accept that argument. An accident and emergency ambulance is manned by one  paramedic and one technician whereas a rapid-response vehicle is manned by one  paramedic. The paramedic model of service has been in place in Northern Ireland  for four years. It is accepted nationally as an effective and modern treatment model  that provides direct assessment, care and treatment to the people who need it.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">All rapid-response vehicles are staffed by skilled paramedics.  The vehicles have an advantage over accident and emergency ambulances in that  they can provide a faster response and can gain access to some places that  ambulances cannot get to. Mr Shannon made that point.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The equipment provided in a rapid-response vehicle is the  same as that provided in an ambulance. The only difference between the two is  that a rapid-response vehicle cannot transport patients to hospital. I stress  that in the event of an emergency call, an ambulance and a rapid-response  vehicle are sent to the incident at the same time. As soon as a rapid-response  vehicle arrives at a scene, the paramedic will immediately start to treat and  stabilise the patient and will also decide whether an ambulance is actually  required. Around 10% of all category-A &mdash; life-threatening &mdash; calls are, in fact,  not life-threatening at all. In one case, an ambulance responded to a  category-A call only to discover that the person had a toothache. In another  case, a person had called because they could not get a GP appointment, and in  another case, a person called because they had cut their finger.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The paramedic who operates a rapid-response vehicle will be  able to indicate immediately whether a situation is life-threatening. I had  first-hand experience of that during one of the busiest social nights in Belfast, when I  accompanied a rapid-response vehicle paramedic during his shift. In one  incident, he went to the aid of a young man who had been knocked down. Within  minutes of the call being received, he was at the scene and had started to  treat the victim. Only a few minutes later, an ambulance arrived to take the  injured man to hospital. That is how I envisage the RRVs working; getting  support and help out there as fast as we can.</p>
	        <p class="TimePeriod">11.45 am</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">There is a target for ambulances to respond to 70% of  life-threatening incidents within eight minutes, and we are on target this  year. From April 2009, I will increase that target to 75% because the period  immediately following an incident is crucial. It is not always a matter of rushing  in and snatching away the patient; it is often a matter of providing the  emergency medical support that the patient needs, particularly if it is a life-threatening  incident. That is why those eight-minute targets are in place and why we are  providing RRVs.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">We are following a practice that has been in place for some  years and has a proven track record nationally. That way of working means that  patient care is not compromised; getting a paramedic response to an emergency  more quickly means that there is a chance of saving a patient&rsquo;s life. If a  patient needs to be transported to hospital, the ambulance will take them,  freeing the RRV to attend another emergency. An A&amp;E ambulance spends 60% of  its downtime waiting at the ambulance station to be called out; the RRV is  constantly out patrolling the hot spots, as I saw that night. They are there to  respond rapidly because, as I said, in around 10% of cases an ambulance is not  required.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Each year, the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service receives  360,000 calls of which 125,000 are emergencies, and, as I said, that figure is  rising by 8% to 10% every year. However, around 25,000 of those calls are for  incidents that are neither immediately life-threatening nor serious. In  addition, the service has to deal with some 6,000 hoax calls, and, as David  McClarty said, those are not all made by youngsters but by people from all  walks of society. All of that adds significant pressure to resources.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">To help to address that problem the Northern Ireland  Ambulance Service intends to pilot a scheme that uses doctors in the ambulance  control room to provide clinical advice to people who call the service. That  control room will operate for 16 hours a day, seven days a week, and it will  enable the Ambulance Service to target emergency resources better. In order to  help the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service further, the public too has a  responsibility to make sure that they dial 999 only in an emergency. Every call  that is not an emergency only delays an ambulance from attending a real  emergency. We are saying, &ldquo;think before you ring&rdquo;.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I recognise the genuine concerns expressed by Members.  Martina Anderson talked about two ambulance breakdowns, but the fact that that  is memorable indicates how extremely rare a breakdown is, given that ambulances  respond to some 360,000 calls a year. Further to what I said yesterday, the  first occasion involved a category-A call, and the patient experienced a  seven-minute delay before a second ambulance arrived. The second occasion was a  category-B call and the patient experienced a 19-minute delay. I apologise for  that; it should not have happened.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I have an inherited fleet that I am seeking to invest in  and replace. Over the next three years the Department will buy 60 A&amp;E  ambulances, 60 patient-care service vehicles and 26 RRVs, giving us 146 extra  vehicles. However, over the next five years, I have allowed for the full  replacement of the entire fleet and investment in a rolling programme of  replacement so that, in future, no vehicles will be more than five years old.  Some of the current vehicles, as Members pointed out, are long past needing to  be scrapped.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: If Mr McCarthy would just allow  me to finish, Tommy Gallagher made a point about an air ambulance. There are no  plans at the moment for an air ambulance and that is probably some years away.  I have explained how the fleet will be rolled out. Lord Morrow talked about  replacing ambulances in Dungannon, where there is one of the oldest ambulances  on the road; that is exactly what I am doing &mdash; scrapping the old vehicles and  replacing them. Ambulances are serviced every 12,000 miles, which is far more  frequently than the manufacturer recommends. They are very well looked after,  but it is long past the time for them to be replaced.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Sue Ramsey raised the point that replacing the fleet does  not mean attacking the service that it provides. In fact, the opposite is the  case; the fleet follows the service that we provide. Investment has been made  throughout Northern Ireland,  including in Omagh. Tom Buchanan has obviously forgotten about the new accident  and emergency ambulances in Omagh and Enniskillen and the 24/7 cover in  Castlederg.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  join all other Members who spoke in commending the work of the Northern Ireland  Ambulance Service: that sentiment is shared across the community. Furthermore,  it reflects the concern at the current situation. In addition to its other  work, the Ambulance Service is one of the core emergency services. Many people  rely upon it, and they fear the consequences of changes in the system.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Many issues affect the people of Northern Ireland, and, although  they look to the Assembly for answers, the solutions are often outside our  control. However, through the Budget that it passed earlier this year, the  Assembly created the problem of cuts in ambulance services, and we have the  solution in our hands. The Assembly is accountable for the problem, and the  people of Northern Ireland  should be in no doubt about where the answers and responsibilities lie.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Budget, which was passed by the Assembly and agreed by  the Executive, was opposed by the Alliance Party. Despite the claims that were  made at that time of record levels of investment in the health budget,  investment in health in Northern Ireland  is flatlining compared with the UK  average. It does not keep up with the pace of investment elsewhere in these  islands in reflection of new demands in the field of health, such as more  expensive drugs or an ageing population. That amounts to a potential shortfall  of around &pound;200 million by 2011, which is a sobering reality.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">At that time, the Minister of Health, Social Services and  Public Safety acknowledged the problems with the Budget. Disappointingly,  however, he claimed victory because of a cosmetic set of changes that were made  in response to his protests. Those changes have not tackled the underlying  problem of underfunding of the Health Service.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">As a solution is sought, much emphasis will be placed on  the forthcoming monitoring rounds, during which the Department of Health,  Social Services and Public Safety has the first claim upon new resources that  come forward. The October monitoring round is already well behind schedule &mdash;  yet another victim of the Executive&rsquo;s paralysis. Even if a monitoring round  does take place, it remains to be seen how much in the way of resources will be  made available by other Departments for reinvestment in health, given that the  budget is tight across the system. I am not optimistic about resources becoming  available.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The so-called efficiency savings are another key aspect of  the current financial difficulties. The Minister said that money from  efficiency savings goes back into the pot for spending on other aspects of  health. That is not exactly the case. The Budget was premised on the basis of  3% efficiency savings across the board. The baselines were recalculated on that  basis. The whole settlement has been tightened, right across the board, based  on spending 3% less than has so far been the case.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">A fine line must be found between efficiency savings and  cuts. We can all welcome efficiency savings if it means shifting resources from  outmoded policies and practices and reinvesting them in more efficient ways of  doing things to provide more effective outcomes. That makes a lot of sense.  However, cuts are seen as reductions in services.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">That raises a point, which, although it does not relate  directly to the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service, relates to the  accountability of how those efficiency savings are being found in the system.  Several bodies below the Department deliver health services, and I am not sure  how clear in practice the accountability lines are to show where those  efficiency savings will be found.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">To my mind, and in the experience of numerous colleagues,  many bodies are taking a simplistic approach to making efficiencies by simply  slicing their services by 3%. That brings me to the core issue of the reduction  in the hours of cover by accident and emergency ambulances with the capacity to  transport a patient. In 2008-09, 17,000 hours of cover will be lost, rising to  35,000 hours in 2009-10, and 70,000 hours by 2010-11. That profile of cuts  mirrors the practice of how efficiency savings will be implemented over the  three years of the comprehensive spending review.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Ambulance Service is a front-line service, and people  become extremely concerned when they see savings that are, in practice, cuts,  being made to such services. The cuts will create gaps in the service. Members  spoke about the non-availability of ambulances in response to emergency calls  or for the transportation of patients who may miss their slot or have to wait  for many hours. Although the new rapid-response vehicles may have a role,  people are concerned that their introduction is at the expense of cover from  traditional accident and emergency ambulances.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">My colleague, Mr McCarthy, began the debate by making the  strong point that the Assembly can make a difference, and he outlined, in  robust terms, the case for retaining the full range of front-line services.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Several other Members referred to the impact of cuts in  their areas, particularly the problems that would be created in the west of Northern Ireland in Derry,  Tyrone and Fermanagh.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Sue Ramsey made a critical point about the new investment  in the ambulance fleets; and everyone will welcome the positive news that the  fleet is to be modernised. However, that is a slightly different issue from the  number of hours&rsquo; cover that the Ambulance Service provides. One could envisage  a situation in which brand new ambulances are not used to their full capacity  due to a lack of commitment to staff them, which is in contrast to the new  investment.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I was disappointed that only one Member from the Ulster  Unionist Party, John McCallister, defended the Minister&rsquo;s position.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I am faintly surprised that the Member is calling on me to say a few words. The  Minister spoke with clarity on the correct position to take and on how to move  forward, and we are 100% behind what he said. If the Member wants to know the  position of the Ulster Unionist Party, he should listen to our esteemed  Minister.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  am glad that, as far as the cuts in the Ambulance Service are concerned, Mr  McCrea has put the entire Ulster Unionist Party on the hook. The UUP&rsquo;s representatives  across Northern Ireland  will know where to look when they join others in complaining about the situation  in their areas and people are objecting to having been sold a pup.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">It was fascinating to listen to Members of the DUP. Today,  they let the cat of the bag: they no longer defend the Budget that they so  rigorously endorsed when it was passed earlier this year. Members of the DUP  now talk about the inadequate health budget, and their use of the phrase  &ldquo;efficiency savings&rdquo; has been abandoned in favour of &ldquo;cuts&rdquo; &mdash; I welcome them to  reality. However, had they spoken in that way when the Budget was being  debated, there would, perhaps, have been a very different settlement.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Lord Morrow, and others, challenged the Alliance Party to  state what it would do differently to provide funding, and I will address that  point. However, the DUP did not propose any solutions to the problem that it  identified as existing across Northern    Ireland.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">In the short term, the problem can be addressed during the  monitoring rounds. As the Minister said, the total shortfall over a three-year  period is only &pound;4&middot;5 million, which equates to approximately &pound;1&middot;2 million in the  first year. Such a shortfall can be addressed in the monitoring rounds.  However, I sound a note of caution about what the first monitoring rounds this  year may bring; but we will see what happens.</p>
	        <p class="TimePeriod">12.00 noon</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, monitoring rounds do not affect the underlying  baseline, and, therefore, we are forced to address that problem annually. In  the long term, the Assembly must grapple with wider Health Service problems in  order to release resources. Ultimately, the solution lies in better investment  in public health and preventative care. We must reduce the number of situations  in which people become sick and must be treated by the Health Service. A  reduction in such instances will occasion a major change in how money is spent  on health in the long term. I do not want to disappoint Mervyn Storey, and,  therefore, I must mention that the cost of division is an obvious area in which  we must seek solutions.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">This issue is of great concern in Northern Ireland.  It threatens people&rsquo;s sense of health security. Ambulances are a front-line  service, and I urge the House to support the motion and to send a clear  message.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
	        <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly notes the proposals to reduce the level of  ambulance service provision and calls on the Minister of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety to find savings elsewhere and to agree not to reduce  the ambulance cover.</p>
	        <p class="H5StageHeading"><a name="2"></a>Opportunities for Special-Needs &nbsp;School Leavers</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to one hour and 30  minutes for the debate. The proposer of the motion will have 10 minutes to  propose and 10 minutes to make a winding-up speech. All other Members who are  called to speak will have five minutes.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr W McCrea</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
	        <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly calls upon the Minister for Employment and  Learning to provide the opportunities and support necessary to ensure that  young people leaving special-needs schools at 16 and over 19 years of age can  further their education and aspire, where appropriate, to meaningful  employment.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The motion asks the Assembly to consider the need to  enhance life after school for young people with learning difficulties and/or  physical disabilities, who have spent up to 15 years in a well-resourced,  highly structured and supportive learning environment, in which professional  staff and helpers have been dedicated to enabling pupils to achieve their best  in all aspects of education and essential life skills.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Although the benefits of the special-school system are  evident, it is not true to assume that the needs identified in statements of  special educational needs have been magically met by the age of 16 or 19. Many  parents and carers are disappointed to discover that at school-leaving age,  there are, largely, only day-care services available. Moreover, that highly  pressurised provision is, at best, limited and, at worst, non-existent.  Although further education schemes are offered in theory, the majority of  pupils who leave special schools will be unable to take up independent  education. Most pupils will still require supervision and help with personal  care, medical needs and safety &mdash; services that are, typically, more readily  offered in a Health Service day-care facility.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, it is sad that the effort, encouragement and  financial resources that define the excellence of the special-school system are  quickly eroded when children reach school-leaving age. As a community, surely  we want to offer those young people a chance to lead fulfilling lives and to  achieve what we take for granted. We must offer them choice, create  opportunities for them and give respect to them. There is an overriding need to  continue the quality of education that young people receive up to the age of  19.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Beattie Report, produced in Scotland in 1999, recommended that  young people with learning difficulties and/or physical disabilities:</p>
	        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;should have access to adequate and appropriate  learning provision&rdquo;.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, the report outlined:</p>
	        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;the needs, abilities and aspirations of young people  should be recognised, understood and met within a supportive environment which  encourages them to achieve their goals and to make real, measurable progress.&rdquo;</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Beattie Report recognised that in order for those young  people to progress, it was likely that they would require more than one type of  support and that their needs may change over time. Although the Department for  Employment and Learning (DEL) cannot be expected to deliver the entire solution  in isolation from other Departments, the further education sector has a  generous part to play in helping those young people to lead fuller and more  valued lives.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Warnock Report, which was published in 1978, found that  people with learning difficulties should be seen, first and foremost, as  learners. It is with regret, therefore, that the Student Voices report, which  was produced by Skill Northern Ireland  in 2002, recorded that the perception of members of the disabled community was  that further education was not for them.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I appreciate the Minister&rsquo;s presence at the debate, and I  have no doubt that he will be keen to inform us that valuable progress has been  made since then. I place on record my thanks to the Northern Regional College  and the East Tyrone College of Further and Higher Education for their  willingness to embrace the ideas and ideals of parents and carers who seek a  more appropriate and meaningful provision for their children.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Access to education is the right to equal opportunity &mdash; not  just physical access. Those young people deserve as much opportunity to enjoy  ongoing education as mainstream students, but they desperately need a  structured learning environment in which they may continue to progress beyond  the age of 19 to attain the kind of life skills that others take for granted.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I want the Department for Employment and Learning to focus  more on learning for that group of young people. The emphasis has been placed  upon academic achievement and employability for far too long. The FE Means  Business and Training for Success programmes are both work-orientated and focus  largely on vocational training. Alas, for many of those young people, the world  of work is not a realistic option. That is why there is a challenge for further  education to provide those young people &mdash; where appropriate &mdash; with the support  and high-quality provision that they need to benefit from education and to  improve their chances of a successful life.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">In a letter to me, the principal of Clifton  Special School  in Bangor  stated:</p>
	        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;the availability of training and resource places a  constant concern for school principals and also for parents who need to provide  care, occupation, training and entertainment for their children, seven days a  week, if an appropriate adult alternative cannot be found.</p>
	        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">The more one tries to explore the options, the more  one becomes aware of the gaping holes in provision. Throughout their school  lives, we constantly strive to help them to fulfil their potential and it is  demoralising for school principals and devastating for the child and their  parents to find that at 19 there may be no future provision for them.</p>
	        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">This is an issue that needs urgently addressed by  those with responsibility for ensuring that consideration is given to the needs  and the rights of our learning disabled.&rdquo;</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The principal of Elmbrook   Special School  in Enniskillen felt that the issue of provision for special-school leavers:</p>
	        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;will continue to be an ever increasing problem unless  it is addressed at the highest possible level and long term strategies  employed.&rdquo;</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The principal of Riverside   School in Antrim  commented that further-education provision is often dependant on a work  placement; that would not be possible for many pupils who leave a special-needs  school. For those for whom a work placement is possible, it would not be so  without support. Those young people require a means of continued stimulation,  whether at a further-education campus or through further-education input at an  adult day centre.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">At ages 16 and 19, their young lives open up, and educational  advancements become noticeable. Simply because those advancements are not  measurable on the national qualifications framework does not mean that they are  not real. They should not be ignored.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">We are duty bound to ensure that the intensive help and  support provided by the special-schools system is not eroded and that a choice  greater than that which is currently available is offered to those young  people.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I ask the Minister: what assessment has his Department made  of the situation; what contact has he had with his ministerial counterparts to  consider areas of mutual concern; what priority has he attached to the  promotion of link courses between further education colleges and special-needs  schools; and how much funding will he guarantee for the maintenance and  promotion of non-vocational courses for students with learning difficulties  and/or disabilities at further education colleges and in day-care settings?</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">If we are to embrace a society in which learning is a  lifelong pursuit for everyone, I &mdash; and, I believe, the House &mdash; cannot accept  that educational opportunities appear to end for some of the most vulnerable  people in our society, who might have major learning and physical disabilities  and who may have a 19-year-old body, but the mind of a six-year-old.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">In order to help young people with special needs or  disabilities to embrace the lifelong pursuit of learning, the further education  sector must be flexible and responsive; its access routes and the content, type  and delivery of its courses must meet the needs and aspirations of those young  people. Life after school is the next big challenge; the Assembly must ensure  that those young people have a chance to overcome the barriers that they face,  and our society has a responsibility to make that happen.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Employment and Learning (Ms S Ramsey)</strong>: Go raibh maith  agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. On behalf of the Committee for Employment and  Learning, I support this important motion, and I congratulate the proposer on  having it selected. However, I must reflect on the fact that almost a year ago  to the day, the House debated a similar motion &mdash; which I proposed &mdash; that called  for increased employment and training places for disabled children and young  people. Six months ago, my colleague Michelle O&rsquo;Neill proposed a motion that  expressed concern about the lack of further education provision for young  people with learning and physical disabilities.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">When I read the record of those debates, I was struck by  the fact that there were no dissenting voices. Even the Minister for Employment  and Learning &mdash; who responded to both the motions and who will respond today &mdash;  more or less agreed with what was said. Nevertheless, I remind the Minister  that the Committee is still waiting for the review of the extent and nature of,  and ways to improve, special-needs provision throughout the further education  sector, which was promised by the end of June 2008. Perhaps, in his  contribution to the debate, the Minister will give us an update on that review.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I do not intend to use my time to share statistics &mdash; Dr  McCrea highlighted some, and I am sure that other Members will do the same. We  are not dealing solely with statistics and numbers; we are dealing with people.  We must never forget that young people with special needs or disabilities are  as important as anyone else.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Every Member in the Chamber takes his or her education and  training opportunities and access to jobs for granted. Young people with  special needs or disabilities should also be able to take such things for  granted. Let our society be judged on how it provides, and cares, for its  weakest and most vulnerable members.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee for Employment and Learning is fortunate.  Organisations that represent the young people whom the motion is about trust  the Committee and come to seek its help. We have been lucky enough to develop  close working relationships with groups such as the Union of Supported  Employment, Disability Action, and Ulster Supported Employment Ltd. We work  closely with those groups and attempt to ensure that we consult them at every  relevant opportunity.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee is united in its support for the work of  those, and other similar, groups, and the motion aims to provide greater  Government assistance for their activities. Although the motion primarily  addresses the Minister for Employment and Learning, all Ministers have a role  to play, as the proposer of the motion said.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I shall take this opportunity to share with Members the  story of a young man who, before recess, made a presentation to the Committee.  Robert has a learning disability, but he wanted to tell the Committee about how  his life has been enhanced by the work of the Union of Supported Employment.  Robert works for four days a week in a cinema; he cleans and helps out. He has  a boss who looks out for him, and his support worker, who organised work  experience for him before he left school, helped him to get the cinema job, for  which he is paid.</p>
	        <p class="TimePeriod">12.15 pm</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">When Robert started his job, he also moved into his own  apartment. He delighted in telling us that his job provides him with money; he  can buy his own CDs and listen to them in his own apartment. He loves his job,  and he is appreciated, liked and respected by his workmates. He has friends,  and he feels secure and supported. I know that not every young person with  special needs or disabilities will be able to have what Robert has; however, we  must aspire to make those opportunities available to all who want them. To me,  Robert represents how things should be, but we all know that reality is very  different.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">There are multiple barriers to accessing further education  or training and employment for those with special needs or disabilities who are  leaving school. Those barriers include current employment practices; a lack of  organised support systems; prejudice; indifference; a lack of sustainable  programmes and long-term funding; and a reliance on the European Social Fund.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">As Dr McCrea highlighted in his opening remarks, all  Ministers have a role to play to rectify the situation &mdash; I support that  statement. In particular, the Minister for Employment and Learning should  ensure that the views of young people with special needs and disabilities are  taken into account during the development, delivery and assessment of relevant  programmes.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">We all wish for a world in which all people are treated  equally and have the same opportunities and choices. Thankfully, we have moved  on from the days when young people with special needs and disabilities were  institutionalised and hidden from view. However, our challenge is to ensure  that when those young people leave school they have opportunities and a purpose  and are supported in making their contribution to society.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I do not believe that any of us would seek to deny young  people with special needs any of those rights. I call on the Minister for  Employment and Learning to listen to what is said in the debate and reflect on  what has been said in previous debates on this matter. No one here disagrees  with young people with special needs or disabilities having the right to  progress from school into whatever further education, training or employment  will allow them to fulfil their potential and enjoy their lives.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member should draw her remarks to a close.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  I support the motion.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McClarty</strong>:  I declare an interest as chairperson of the board of governors of a school with  a special-needs unit.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I am delighted that we are debating this issue, because I  believe that the Assembly has a responsibility to bring the requirements and  potential of young people with special needs further into the public domain.  Regardless of the investment and strategies that we put in place, if the  mindset of the wider community is not open, educated and welcoming, the  potential for young people with special needs to gain achievements through  further education and, where appropriate, gain meaningful employment, will be  diminished. For that reason alone, the debate is crucial.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister has overseen a substantial increase in the  funding that is available to support students with disabilities in further  education. The additional support fund provides assistance with the cost of  technical and/or personal support. It is my understanding that in 2004-05 that  fund was increased from &pound;500,000 to &pound;1 million, was further increased in  2006-07 to &pound;1,125,000, and has been increased to &pound;1&middot;5 million in 2007-08 and  2008-09.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">In 2007-08, the Department made &pound;1&middot;5 million available for  discrete provision, and that has been increased to &pound;2 million in 2008-09. That  fund enables colleges to meet the cost of reduced classroom size, additional  lecture contact time, an increase in the number of classroom assistants, or the  development of other services involved in delivering tailored courses for those  with learning difficulties.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">In 2008-09, &pound;2&middot;5 million has been given to the support  fund, which enables colleges to provide help to students whose participation in  further education is prohibited by financial considerations. Since 2001, the  Department has allocated over &pound;18 million of capital funding to colleges to  improve access for people with disabilities. It is my understanding that  &pound;474,000 has been set aside in 2008-09 for capital programmes expenditure,  which includes funding to improve access for people with disabilities. I  believe that the Minister is dealing with the issue proactively.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I understand that the review of special needs provision in  further education, which the Minister announced during a debate in 2007, has  been carried out and completed by the Department. That review will include  recommendations that will be brought to the Committee for Employment and  Learning for consideration as soon as possible.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ramsey</strong>:  The Member is a member of the Committee for Employment and Learning, which was  assured that it would be presented with the review in June. It is useful to  keep returning to these issues because, irrespective of what the Member&rsquo;s  understanding is, I, as Chairperson of that Committee, do not know where the  review is.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McClarty</strong>:  I appreciate the fact that the review should be brought to the Committee. This  is the third time that the Assembly has debated the issue in just over a year,  and it is important that we highlight it.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the action that the Minister and his Department  have taken to promote positive attitudes towards people with disabilities and  to encourage their participation in public life. There are concerns about the  ability of young people with special needs to gain access to employment &mdash; an  area that my colleague Dr Coulter will explore in more detail later.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Every parent recognises the desire that their children fulfil  their potential in life. That desire is no different for the parents of people  with additional needs. Furthermore, we can all recognise how disillusioning and  frustrating the inability to achieve that potential can be. Society must do  more to recognise and welcome the benefits that people with special educational  needs can bring.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">More can be done, and we have a Minister who is engaged in,  and committed to, further improving the potential and opportunity for young  people with special needs. I and my colleagues on the Committee for Employment  and Learning look forward to the review of special educational needs in further  education being brought before the Committee. I support the motion.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  I support the motion. The issue has been an ongoing concern for parents and  education facilitators of special-needs young adults for some time.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The degrees of special needs are more complex than ever. As  such, many parents, when their young adult reaches school-leaving age, face a  blank canvas without the tools that they need. The security of the school  setting is a far cry from the oasis that is the future for many special-needs  young people. Current transition systems and post-school opportunities appear  to be less than helpful in easing those difficult pathways from the  child-friendly school scenario to the adult world &mdash; a world in which there are  many pitfalls and dangers for young people with disabilities.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I consulted my local special-needs school, which had no  hesitation in affirming the sentiments of the motion. That school told me that  the dire lack of post-school placements available to young people with  disabilities in the north-west is causing continuing anxiety.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">However, like Sue Ramsey, I can tell the Assembly about a  young man with special needs. He is called Kevin, and he is a very badly  disabled 21-year-old who requires a great deal of medical help. Kevin attends  the North West Regional College  and is making wonderful progress. Indeed, he believes that he is ready to face  anything in the world. That is great for Kevin, but we need the same to happen  for all our young people with special needs.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The rights of special-needs young people cannot be allowed  to be eroded. In my preparation for today&rsquo;s debate, my first port of call was  the Assembly&rsquo;s Programme for Government. Page 4 of that document clearly  states:</p>
	        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Working together we can build a shared and a better  future for all &mdash; a society which is at ease with itself and where everyone  shares and enjoys the benefits of this new opportunity.&rdquo;</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">For the young adult with disabilities, and more importantly  for that young person&rsquo;s parents, there is a basic human right to a future; a  future that is equal in care, education and opportunity; and a future that  will, where possible, equip them with a skill, and, at its most basic, give  them a reason to get up in the morning and go to their job, no matter how  menial that job is.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Those young people are capable of much more than they are  often given credit for. My local supermarket employs a number of young people  with special needs, and they are more than capable of carrying out their daily  duties. Furthermore, they are often more open to change and the transition  process than would be expected.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Since last November, motions centred around young people  with special needs have been debated in the Chamber on no fewer than three  occasions, including today. That will illustrate the level of affirmation and  concern that the Assembly has for the issue. I have no doubt that the Minister  will give his full attention to the topic, as there is undeniable parental  concern about the issue, and I am sure that the ever-changing environment in  which we live will continue to evolve and be as uninviting as ever for someone  who is slightly different. However, within those differences, often there lies  an untapped source of richness and creativity that will improve the lives of  the young people concerned and help them to become valued by others beyond their  family boundaries.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The situation calls for a cross-cutting approach from the  Department of Education, social services, the Department of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety and the Department for Employment and Learning. The  problem cannot be solved by a single-Department approach. Although the Minister  for Employment and Learning is the obvious target of the motion, the solution does  not lie solely at his door. However, it is hoped that he will take the outcome  of the debate on board and do whatever he can to help our young disabled  people.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>: The  transition from special schools to post-school provision can be difficult for  the young leavers and their families, particularly due to the anxiety caused by  moving from a special school to a new and unfamiliar setting. The Alliance  Party welcomes the motion, and I congratulate Dr McCrea for moving it and for  setting out the related issues so eloquently in his speech.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Alliance Party welcomes the motion as a further reminder  to the Minister that there is a problem; although I am sure that he does not  need to be reminded. The motion follows on from a similar motion that was  tabled by Sinn F&eacute;in on 7 April 2008, which the Alliance Party also supported.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">If Members are serious about a shared future, a better  economy and a sustainable society, it is important that everyone has access to  the education that they require to enable them to contribute to that future,  economy and society. Furthermore, as my colleague Anna Lo reminded Members in  the debate on 7 April, there is already a legislative framework under the  Disability Discrimination Act 1995 for the protection of young people who wish  to exercise their right to be educated. There is, therefore, a moral and a  legislative requirement in place. In fact, there is also a moral and  legislative imperative to back our early contention that the objective for many  people with learning disabilities should be mainstreaming.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Special Educational Needs and Disability (Northern Ireland)  Order 2005 developed the right of children with special educational needs to  attend mainstream schools. That objective and the terms of the motion can, and  should, be transferred further up the system.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Approximately 80% of people with learning difficulties who  leave special schools in Northern    Ireland each year do not require day-care  provision. Therefore, mainstream further education is often an option for many  of them. That does not mean that the solution is to set up courses that are  aimed, specifically, at them, because that would be counterproductive and  hinder their access to mainstream society. The objective should be to improve  access to the existing courses while ensuring, as far as possible, that the  necessary support is available to ensure their full participation.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Building a fair and inclusive society must be the basis for  a future in which people are not prevented from accessing services or from  reaching their full potential by a disability, or any other reason.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I have no doubt that the Minister has sympathy for the  content of the motion, and I urge him to do everything in his power to ensure  the best possible provision for school-leavers with special needs and those  aged 19-plus. It is also hoped that the Minister&rsquo;s room for manoeuvre is not  restricted by any further extension of the current Executive impasse, which, I  accept, is not of the Minister&rsquo;s doing. I look forward to hearing from him  about any proposals that he may be able to offer the House today. I support the  motion.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Business Committee has arranged to meet at lunchtime today. I  propose, therefore, by leave of the Assembly, to suspend the sitting until 2.00  pm.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The sitting was suspended at 12.29 pm.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">On resuming (Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Molloy] in the  Chair) &mdash;</p>
	        <p class="TimePeriod">2.00 pm</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Newton</strong>: I  support the motion. It will unite the entire Chamber, and support for those in  need should be the motivation of all Members. In his opening remarks, Dr McCrea  said that more than one type of support was necessary, and I agree entirely.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Last week, I met a group of primary-school principals  representing east Belfast.  They expressed their concerns about primary-school funding and quoted the  differential in funding between primary schools and secondary-level education  as &pound;1,000 for each pupil. They were not saying that funding for secondary-level  education should be cut; rather that funding for primary education should be  upgraded. The funding package is not sufficient, given the responsibilities  placed on teachers, which include social and psychological care, and the need to  teach the three Rs. The principals stressed the impediments that that lack of  funding has on children with special needs. I refer to that fact because there  are children with special needs at primary school who are not in receipt of the  support that they need and deserve at the required levels. Early support is  necessary if children with special needs are to achieve their full potential.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">My comments are somewhat wider than the motion.  Nevertheless, all children with special needs deserve to have the educational  building blocks in place to assist them in leading a full and productive life  after school.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Although I believe that a holistic approach from all  Departments is necessary for pupils with special needs, the essential  preparation for a successful and complete life takes place in the  secondary-school years. School-leavers should be prepared with  careers-education lessons that will help them to make informed decisions about  their future; be provided with opportunities to take part in attractive work experiences;  and &mdash; in connection with what Dr McCrea said &mdash; have access to college-linked  courses that will allow them to attend local further education colleges on  vocational-linked courses to prepare them for leaving school. Such an approach  allows students to prepare for a quality of life that will be enjoyable and  profitable.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">There is no doubt that access to post-school education  should be available to all. Many students with special needs will not be able  to take up employment opportunities and, in such cases, after-school experience  in further education colleges must be satisfying and rewarding.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I agree with the Chairperson of the Committee for  Employment and Learning, who referred to the presentation given to the  Committee by a young man called Robert, representing the Northern Ireland Union  of Supported Employment. In many ways, the eyes of Committee members were  opened following his presentation.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I visited the Orchardville Society recently and was taken  to the Law Courts to meet a young man with special needs who had secured a job  in the post room. He is operating within the same terms and conditions as all  the other staff in the post room and is also attending a further education  college. The Orchardville Society provided him with in-house training, a wide  range of employment opportunities compatible with his abilities, a chance to  gain vocational qualifications, and support all the way through to his gaining  his own place to live.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee also received evidence from Ulster Supported  Employment Limited, which takes a different, but nonetheless valuable,  approach. It offers in-house skills training that will lead to employment on  site or outside its premises, vocational qualifications and supportive and  sheltered employment.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The support to enable people to live a fulfilling life from  early years &mdash; whether that leads to employment or gaining further experience at  an further education college &mdash; should be available to people at all levels.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I remind Members to switch off their mobile phones as they are  interfering with the recording system.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Butler</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Ba mhaith liom bu&iacute;ochas a  thabhairt do David Simpson agus do Willie McCrea as an r&uacute;n seo.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I thank David Simpson and Willie McCrea for bringing this  motion to the Assembly. As several Members have said, this is the third time  that we have discussed the difficulties that young people with learning  difficulties encounter in accessing further education.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The expectation is that most people who complete 12 years  of primary and post-primary education can make a transition to further  education colleges or university, and that also applies to people with learning  difficulties. In the debate on 7 April 2008, the Minister said that in the year  2006-07, almost 17,000 students enrolling in further education declared that  they had some form of disability. In the same year, around 1,400 students in  further education colleges declared that they had severe learning disabilities.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In the previous debate on this subject, I mentioned the  research that states that the percentage of people with learning difficulties  and disabilities in Britain  is much higher than it is here. The Minister may want to comment on that again.  Around 20% of people in further education have complex learning difficulties,  and that is an issue. In some ways, it is good that we are focusing our  attention on the matter. Many people with disabilities, and their families,  look to elected representatives to raise those issues in forums such as this,  because they do not have a voice.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister said in the debate of 7 April that a review  was to take place, and Mr McClarty said that the review has now been completed  by the Department. I am a member of the Committee for Employment and Learning,  and as the Chairperson of the Committee has said, the Committee has not yet had  sight of any report on the review. The review was to have been completed in  June, and it is now October. The Committee should be told of the outcome of  that review as a matter of urgency. The most important issue is how the  review&rsquo;s recommendations will be implemented in further education colleges. I  also appreciate that this matter does not just concern the Minister for  Employment and Learning; the Department of Health, Social Services and Public  Safety also has a role to play, as the Minister for Employment and Learning has  mentioned before.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Many parents want their loved ones to be educated or  trained in Health Service day centres because they know that their loved ones  are being looked after there &mdash; those centres provide a sense of security as  well as transport to and from the place. However, the disadvantage is that  according to some evidence, attending such centres can perpetuate social exclusion  &mdash; people with severe learning difficulties or disabilities are not mixing with  people in mainstream further education colleges and universities.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Willie McCrea mentioned the &lsquo;FE Means Business&rsquo; document,  which was drawn up the Department for Employment and Learning. The document  sets out how the Department sees the future of further education. It recognises  that students with learning difficulties should be given opportunities to gain  qualifications. However, I will raise an issue that I raised with the Minister  in Committee meetings and in the previous debate: further education colleges  are offloading courses that are aimed at people with special-learning  difficulties. I think that Willie McCrea made that point, too. The main thrust  of the document seems to be about gaining qualifications, perhaps at the  expense of people with learning difficulties.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">It can be difficult for many people to achieve success in  further education colleges, but it can be particularly difficult for people  with learning difficulties. I support the motion.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hilditch</strong>:  I thank my colleagues for proposing the motion. People with learning  difficulties have huge problems trying to find employment, as they are socially  and educationally disadvantaged. It is not only people with learning  difficulties who need more employment opportunities; disabled people also lose  out.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Little provision is made for people with special needs who  are unable to participate in further education, or who are unable to cope with  finding employment. Students who attend special-needs schools are expected to  leave at the age of 19, but no assistance is made for suitable follow-up  services to promote life skills and independent living. Children with moderate  learning difficulties are offered compulsory education up to the age of 16, and  those with severe learning difficulties are offered it up to the age of 19.  However, after that, young people and their families face a minefield, and we,  as elected representatives, regularly witness the distress that that causes. I  have spoken to many people in my constituency who struggle to deal with those  issues. Fewer than 10% of people with learning difficulties are in paid  employment, and it is very unfair that parents and carers are left to deal with  the responsibility of that situation.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Although there are both good and bad examples in my  constituency of East Antrim, I know of only one organisation in Carrickfergus  that is designed to cope with filling the gap between full-time education and  employment, and it is a fine example of what can be achieved. Kilcreggan Urban  Farm in Carrickfergus employs 36 adults with learning difficulties. Originally  set up to teach job skills to the residents of Kilcreggan supported housing,  the farm is now open to the public, and it teaches employability skills to  adults with learning difficulties, with the hope that those skills will lead to  employment. The farm has also been running a very beneficial pilot scheme in  which children with learning difficulties and mainstream children work together  on the farm in the evenings. I praise Kilcreggan Urban Farm for its work, and  urge the Minister to consider the situation and try to promote and assist  similar organisations so that young people get the appropriate level of  training and education.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">According to a representative from the Northern Trust,  Carrickfergus has no form of social enterprise, yet Larne and Newtownabbey  have facilities where people with special needs can learn the necessary skills.  We need more training establishments to offer those adults vocational  qualifications. It is a shame that there is no training organisation in  Carrickfergus to deal with the special educational needs of young people aged  16 and over.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Hawthorn Day Centre has an enrolment of 65 people from the  age of 19, and sometimes it is difficult to believe that there are no suitable  job opportunities for those people. Surely, given the correct support, there  could be opportunities in our ever-increasing service industries, for example,  for people to progress and to aspire to employment, with the help of  departmental supported training and further education.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I understand that the care of special-needs school-leavers  is a concern for the Department of Education and for the Department of Health.  It is not simply a matter for the Department for Employment and Learning &mdash; it  is a cross-departmental issue. Therefore, a multi-disciplinary approach to  supporting young people is needed to secure the necessary support that will  actively encourage social inclusion, challenge discrimination and inequality  issues, and develop personal control and choice.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I urge the Minister to take immediate action to provide  sufficient further education opportunities to ensure that young people with  special needs achieve their full potential. The health and social services  trusts must work together with the Department for Employment and Learning to  tackle that gap. The Departments must adopt a joint approach to address the  urgent issues that have been raised today. I support the motion.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Armstrong</strong>:  I support the motion. It is important that the needs of young people over the  age of 16 are addressed, and that the necessary systems are put in place to  support them, so that young people with complex, multiple disabilities are  guided in the choices that they make and that those choices can be achieved.  Everyone continues to learn throughout their adult lives, and that situation is  no different for people with special needs.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">However, we must appreciate that those people who come from  the special-needs schooling system cannot simply step into further education  and learn at the same pace, from the same curriculum or by employing the same  techniques as others.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">2.15 pm</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I appreciate that something could be done to improve  special-needs provision for those over 19 years of age, but I trust that before  any action is taken, the Minister and his Department will do their utmost to  ensure that individuals&rsquo; needs are catered for. Blanket provision for all  school-leavers with special needs is unrealistic, given the individual and  unique characteristics associated with the varied needs for which special-needs  schools currently provide.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Department for Employment and Learning is making great  strides in improving provision for this specific age group. I wholeheartedly  support the work that it has done to date and that which is planned for the  future. In my constituency of Mid Ulster, Kilronan  Special School  in Magherafelt and Sperrinview   Special School  in Dungannon cater for more than 150 pupils, who can stay at school until they  are 19 years of age. Those schools, through a combination of specialist  teaching and provision, give individual pupils the opportunity to move into  further education and employment.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Projects such as Skill Northern Ireland highlight the good work  that the Department and the Minister have undertaken in developing the  necessary provision for special-needs school-leavers. Skill Northern Ireland promotes opportunities to allow  young people and adults to achieve their potential in further education,  training and employment in Northern    Ireland. The good results that have been  seen in the pilot schemes in Beechlawn  School and Sandelford  Special School  will no doubt be applied to more schools in Northern Ireland.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I know that the Minister is aware of the challenges that  must be faced, and I am grateful for his ongoing commitment. In particular, I  look forward to hearing the outcome of his Department&rsquo;s review.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The young people at Kilronan Special   School, like young people  at special schools in all our communities, deserve opportunities that are  appropriate to their abilities. I am also aware of the good work that Parkanaur College has done. Many of its residents  are my constituents, and I encourage the Minister to continue to provide funds  for the people who attend the college. I thank the Minister for his ongoing  commitment to making that continued funding a reality, and I look forward to  hearing his response to the debate.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr Robert  Coulter</strong>: I declare an interest as chairperson of the board of governors of  the new special school in Ballymena.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">For the first time in Northern   Ireland, we have brought three special schools together,  and we are working closely with the Northern   Regional College.  Having worked with that section of our community for several years now, I am fully  conversant with the problems that arise.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We seem to be concentrating in this debate on one section  of those people with learning disabilities. However, there are two sections.  One section can undertake a certain kind of employment, but there is another  group of people who cannot do so. In that second section, there are people who  remain in a special school until they are 19 years of age; for example, those  who are afflicted with autism. When they reach 19 years of age, they are not  able to move on to further education or employment and are left in their  parents&rsquo; care. Their only outlet is to go to a day centre, where they are  grouped with older people who, very often, are suffering from some kind of  mental disability. In that context, we must examine both sides of the equation.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I support everything that has been said about employment  for people who are 19 years old, or even younger. That is something that we  have concentrated on in our new school, Castle Tower   Special School,  in Ballymena. We monitor those young people as they grow up through their  teenage years. Working in close co-operation with what is now the Northern Regional College,  we have had the pleasure of seeing so many of those young people enter some  form of employment, which has enhanced their quality of life.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">On that note, we should pay tribute not only to the  teachers in special schools &mdash; of whom I cannot speak highly enough &mdash; but to  those in the further education system who take on board the problems of those  young people, and to the lecturers who have given themselves the special task  of endeavouring to help those young people towards some form of normality in  life. We should pay tribute to those people who have done so much to help young  people with special needs.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We should also pay tribute to the Department for Employment  and Learning, and to the Minister, who has done so much. He is engaged in a  process of improving the opportunities and support that are necessary for young  people leaving special education to gain access to further education, and,  where appropriate, to meaningful employment. That is what we are talking about.  That is why, in every speech on this issue today, full support for the motion  has been expressed.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Although improvements have been made, it is recognised that  more can, and should, be done. In that context, we need to give support to the  Minister, and to help him in every way. However, as has been said on a number  of occasions today, it is not a matter for one Department. The problem is  surely a cross-departmental one, which must be tackled together by a team  effort. Together, we can enhance the lives of those young people who are in  need of our help. I fully support the motion.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Robinson</strong>:  I would first like to point out that the term &ldquo;special needs&rdquo; covers a wide  spectrum, and there are many unseen conditions that must be remembered in the  context of the debate. There are many positive aspects of the present further  and higher education structures. Provision is made for young people, especially  those with disabilities requiring them to use a wheelchair, such as: assistance  with travel costs; specially adapted university accommodation; the provision of  carers and note-takers for lectures; and the putting in place of special  arrangements for them during exam periods. Those provisions are very welcome,  but let none of us be fooled into believing that enough is being done to ensure  that young people with learning and physical disabilities achieve optimum performance.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Much is made of the potential of our young people, and the  role that they can play in the new prosperity that I believe Northern Ireland  plc will enjoy. However, we must also ensure that those children and young  people with a disability are permitted their chance to enjoy the proceeds of  Northern Ireland plc. There is much discussion of reskilling the workforce; let  us not forget that that includes people with a disability.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I feel that, perhaps, the opportunities for third-level  education are more restricted for disabled young people. Much has been done to  ensure that schools and campuses are wheelchair friendly and that rooms are  accessible, but there is a problem in the number of disabled people attaining  the necessary grades to access the secondary-level education necessary to  obtain university entrance. Stigma, whether real or perceived, can be a major  factor in a child&rsquo;s educational attainment at secondary level. That obviously  impacts on a child with a disability who wishes to enter further and higher  education. Perhaps the Minister of Education will think about how she will  address that problem.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I support addressing the problem as a matter of great  importance, because although much is being done, much more needs to be done, so  that Northern Ireland can utilise a home-grown workforce in rebuilding the  economy, whether individuals have a disability or not.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I urge the Minister for Employment and Learning to examine  closely what can be done to help disabled young people to achieve all that they  can. We must facilitate their desire to fulfil their potential. I am sure that  the Minister will seek to provide the facilities and courses that  special-needs, and disabled, students require to maximise their potential. I  support my colleagues and commend them for tabling such a worthwhile motion.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Irwin</strong>: I  welcome the motion tabled by my colleagues, which addresses an important issue  in Northern Ireland.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In my constituency of Newry and Armagh,  I am well aware of the difficulties faced by young people with special needs  who have left school and are seeking gainful and meaningful employment. In the  early part of the year, I was made aware of the funding plight faced by the  Appleby Trust in Armagh city; a crisis that almost closed the facility but for  the generosity of an anonymous sponsor and the match funding from the Southern  Health and Social Care Trust, for which we are extremely grateful.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Appleby Trust is a supported employment agency based in  Armagh city, and its team helps those with  learning disabilities to find employment and supports them during employment.  Another vital part of its work is Appleby&rsquo;s social firm, which specialises in  preparing people with learning disabilities to enter the workplace. The trust  does a marvellous job in the city and district and is to be commended. However,  its funds are only secure for the remainder of the financial year, and it is  unacceptable that it should face another episode of crisis and uncertainty when  that current funding runs out. Several meetings have been held in my  constituency between the Southern Health and Social Care Trust, the Appleby  Trust and local Assembly Members. I am conscious that time is running out and  that we could face another funding dilemma.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In several representations that I have made to the Health  Minister and the Minister for Employment and Learning, I have proposed  cross-departmental co-operation in funding provision as a potential solution.  Undoubtedly, the situation in my constituency is repeated across the Province.  We are failing those with learning disabilities, and although available funding  from the various health and social care trusts is stretched, programmes under  the remit of the Department for Employment and Learning are not suitably  structured to allow services, such as that operated by the Appleby Trust, to  attract funding. That must change.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In response to a question for written answer that I asked  earlier in the year, Minister Empey stated:</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Programmes funded by the Department, with the  exception of some of those that are match funded, are generic in nature and not  targeted at any particular disability category such as people with a learning  disability.&rdquo;</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I ask the Minister for Employment and Learning and  the Health Minister to consider a closer working relationship on the issue to  ensure that there is a coherent and meaningful support system aimed  specifically at those with learning disabilities. We must not short-change  young adults with learning disabilities.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning (Sir Reg Empey)</strong>: I am grateful for the opportunity  to speak. As always, the debate has been very interesting. It has also united  Members from all sides of the House, which we must take comfort from.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">As has been mentioned, provision for young people with  learning difficulties and/or disabilities has already been at the centre of two  debates in the Chamber. I reaffirm my commitment to do everything possible to  meet the requirements of young people with special needs and everyone with a  disability.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Those young people cannot be categorised neatly, because  each individual has different and diverse requirements, which, in many cases,  have to be assessed by a range of Departments and agencies. It is encouraging  that a key priority of the ministerial subcommittee on children and young  people is provision for children with special educational needs in mainstream  and special schools, including the transition to adulthood and the provision of  appropriate health and social care interventions.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The importance of collaborative working to deal with those  young people&rsquo;s needs cannot be overstated.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">2.30 pm</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">As with all school-leavers, young people who leave  special-education schools have different aptitudes, abilities and expectations.  My Department does everything possible to ensure that its support measures and  programmes are accessible to them, in order that they are fully able to fulfil  their potential and can, in the motion&rsquo;s words:</p>
        <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;aspire, where appropriate, to meaningful employment.&rdquo;</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">My Department assists young people who leave  special schools by offering several programmes, which include careers advice  and guidance; mainstream and specialised further-education provision; and  various training, employment and support programmes.</p>
        <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Speaker in the Chair)</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Careers Service Northern Ireland has been restructured, and  several careers advisers have been trained specifically to work with clients  who have statements of special educational need. Additionally, all careers  advisers are provided with basic training in that area. That is a new  development. Careers advisers attend transition-plan meetings for year 10  pupils &mdash; 14 year olds &mdash; who have special educational needs. They also attend  subsequent annual reviews. The advisers work with a range of professionals and  contribute to transition plans by providing impartial information, advice and  guidance on the variety of educational and training employment opportunities  that are available. That allows individual young people and their parents or  guardians to make informed decisions.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Department funds a range of training and employment  provisions through the Disablement Advisory Service, which works closely with  Careers Service to ensure that young people&rsquo;s transition from education to the  wider world is as smooth and effective as possible.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Participants on the Department&rsquo;s Training for Success and  Apprenticeships NI programmes are given every opportunity to overcome  difficulties and to develop using the most appropriate support mechanisms. In  order to enhance those programmes&rsquo; effectiveness, a group with expertise in  dealing with young people who have disabilities was established. The group&rsquo;s  recent report makes 30 recommendations that focus on disabled people&rsquo;s needs.  The Department will fully consider the recommendations, with a view to further  enhancing provision in those programmes.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Much has been mentioned about the interface with further  education. Colleges are required under the  Further Education (Northern    Ireland) Order 1997 to:</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;have regard to the requirements of persons over  compulsory school age who have learning difficulties.&rdquo;</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Furthermore, under the Special Educational Needs  and Disability (Northern    Ireland) Order 2005 (SENDO) colleges are  required to make adjustments in order to allow people who have learning  difficulties and disabilities to access their provision. Mainstream courses are  not always suitable for everyone. Colleges, therefore, collaborate with adult  day centres to provide customised training and development opportunities for  young people who have severe learning difficulties. Those may be offered in a  college, day centre or other suitable premises. It is not unknown for that to  include clients&rsquo; houses.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I am encouraged that a recent Education and Training  Inspectorate (ETI) report confirmed that colleges are making good progress in  collaborating with health trusts and other key players to improve further their  provision to those who have learning difficulties and disabilities.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">At this point, I want to respond to the Chairperson of the  Committee for Employment and Learning&rsquo;s remark on the review&rsquo;s lateness. The  Department received the ETI&rsquo;s part of the review on 24 September 2008. In fact,  that part is available on the ETI&rsquo;s website. In addition to the ETI&rsquo;s  contribution, my Department has carried out an internal review in consultation  with stakeholders, which we are currently considering. I hope that it will be  presented to the Committee for its deliberation in early November.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In the past, concerns were raised about the emphasis that  colleges place on provision to support the economy. Although they are being  asked to increase the proportion of their provision that is on the national  qualifications framework, it must be remembered that many courses already on  the framework are suitable for young people who are leaving special-needs  schools and will assist them to attain qualifications that they require to move  into employment. However, I fully accept that that is not the only way in which  to tackle those issues.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I want to raise a couple of other points that flow from the  report that the Department commissioned. The report concluded that college  provision had improved since a survey carried out in 2003-04 and noted that:</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Considerable progress has been made by the colleges  in introducing suitable accredited programmes, revising provision to focus more  strongly on the development of skills for independent living or employability  where appropriate.&rdquo;</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The report highlights many examples of good practice across  the further education sector, including examples of sound working relationships  between colleges and other statutory and voluntary agencies to support students  with learning difficulties or disabilities.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">One of the key points of the debate is that this is not  simply a matter for one Department &mdash; it is for several, and for a range of  agencies as well. I am pleased to say that I am a member of the Executive  subcommittee that deals with children and young people, and, through that work,  I have the opportunity to work closely with several Departments. I brought one  particular case to that subcommittee, which is chaired by the junior Ministers  and examines gaps in provision for young people throughout the governmental  system. We will have the opportunity to draw matters to the attention of that  subcommittee when we believe that collaborative activity is useful.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In his opening remarks, Rev McCrea &mdash; who has apologised for  his inability to be present this afternoon &mdash; raised a number of issues that I  wish to address. He asked me specifically about contacts with ministerial  colleagues, and I have indicated that the subcommittee is a forum that allows  us to raise all these matters. In addition, we work closely with the Department  of Education and with the Department of Health, Social Services and Public  Safety to develop joined-up services for disabled young people who are passing  into adulthood through the Disablement Advisory Service and the careers service  of my Department, which work with their counterparts in the Department of  Education and in the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety.  Cross-party and departmental co-operation can always improve, but I do not want  leave the debate without indicating that there is a already a significant level  of co-operation.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Rev McCrea also raised the issue of the links between  special schools and further education colleges. Some Members are familiar with  the vocational enhancement programme (VEP), which was piloted in a number of  schools, including those for young people with special needs. The VEP offers  advice on the curriculum, the needs of clients and other issues. That will be  extended through the entitlement programme and implemented across all schools  within the next few years.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Several Members referred to the unsuitability of links  between further education and pupils with particular difficulties. That is a  difficult interface &mdash; we must come clean about that. Rev Coulter made the point  that, when a college proves to be an unsuitable environment for a particular  individual, perhaps due to a pupil&rsquo;s medical needs, there has been a tendency  for that pupil to end up in a day-centre environment, which is not always  suitable. A younger person may be placed with a number of older residents who  have mental health and other difficulties. That is not ideal.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">As I have said, colleges are prepared to discuss the needs  of individual clients. In future, as part of its contract with the Department,  each college may have a requirement to produce programmes to satisfy us that  those issues are dealt with appropriately.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">At present, much of the weight on the issue is being carried  by South West College,  which provides services throughout the system. However, the Department will ask  all the colleges to draw up proposals for any new arrangements that it may  enter into with them. Colleges are prepared to be flexible, to look at each  client individually, and to teach off campus if required &mdash; and the degree of  flexibility is growing.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Several Members mentioned the issue of resources. The  Department has increased the amount of resource available to create  opportunities for school-leavers with special needs. However, the issue is not  always about money. The Department has provided the system with more cash. As I  said, if I felt that the problem was simply a lack of resources, I would  examine that. However, that is not the entire answer; it is more than that. The  solution involves examining the co-ordination of the systems, the Departments  and the agencies that already exist and, of course, the resources that flow  from that. We are improving the amount of resource available, but it is not the  entire solution.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I am confident that collaborative work has improved. The  Department expects that the reports that are due to published in a few weeks&rsquo;  time, along with the one that I already mentioned, will provide, by the end of  the year, a comprehensive picture of how the entire system is working.  Undoubtedly, improvements can be made.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Members will be aware of the system&rsquo;s weaknesses from the  experiences of some of their constituents. Although the focus is on the pupil,  we must remember that this issue also affects his or her family. As parents  grow older they perhaps become less able to cope and that may cause them to  have concerns about the future of their children. Parents want to give their  children the best possible start. From the experiences of friends, I know that  some people are seriously worried that they will not be able to maintain the  level of care that their relative will require.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I conclude by emphasising that the Department is doing much  to ensure that all programmes are accessible to school-leavers with special  needs. However, I agree that we must continue to strive to make programmes and  services even more accessible and, wherever possible, to support those young  people into employment. That is a worthy objective, and some Members have  highlighted the success stories.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I confirm that the Department will work with the Department  of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, and the Department of Education  to develop and to enhance services for children and young people making the  transition to adulthood. I will keep the Assembly informed of progress in those  areas. I am sure that my colleagues will do the same in the areas for which  they have the lead responsibility.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Simpson</strong>:  I thank all the Members who took part in the debate. I was encouraged by the  fact that no amendments were tabled. That shows a great degree of unity on the  issue. Prior to today, Members also debated the issue in October 2007, and in  April 2008. I was reassured by some of the Minister&rsquo;s points, and I know that  he is not unsympathetic to the subject. Sometimes there are financial  restraints, but, as the Minister said, the issue is not always about money.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">It is about systems, structure, management, and how things  are fed into the whole procedure.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I am sure that the vast majority of Members have families  and that they have watched their children grow from infants and go through  primary school, secondary school and on to college or university. All parents  take a degree of pride in seeing their children develop; how much more proud  must the family of a child &mdash; in many cases more than one child &mdash; with learning  difficulties be as they see that child develop through those early years.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Sue Ramsey raised the issue of equality for young people  and the lack of progress of the review; the Minister has answered that. Some of  that review has been finished, and we can examine it. Dr McCrea referred to the  Beattie Report and the Warnock Report, which indicated that young people with  learning difficulties should be seen, first and foremost, as learners. He also  mentioned the concerns raised by Clifton   Special School  and others.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Rev Coulter raised a very poignant point about children or  young adults being denied support beyond the age of 19, which is a bone of  contention for parents. In many cases a child&rsquo;s reaching adulthood takes  parents unawares. All of a sudden it dawns on them that their child has reached  the age of 16, and, when that happens, those parents ask themselves: what do we  do now?</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I am glad that the Minister outlined that there will be  more career officers who can go into schools and identify the tasks that young  people with learning difficulties can do or the future that they might have.  The Minister also mentioned funding. In my constituency of Upper Bann, I deal  primarily with two schools, the Ceara Special School  and the Donard Special School.  Other schools have special needs classes, and we visit them, but those are the  two main schools for children who have learning difficulties, and I will  outline some of the points that they have raised. I would like the Minister to  pay special attention to the funding aspect.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Changes to the funding of further education colleges have  resulted in considerable difficulties for young adults across the Province. The  courses that the majority of young people with special needs undertook have  been discontinued as they are not financially viable and do not attract funding  from DEL,  because they are below a specific academic level. We must address that issue.  Only a few days ago, I met with parents who were trying to get their young lad  &mdash; a sufferer of autism and a very bright individual &mdash; into the further  education college in Craigavon. He could not get into that college simply  because the course that he was used to doing at school was not on offer.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: Colleges have resources for courses that do not  lead to specific qualifications.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">If the Member wants to raise a particular case, he may  write to me, and I shall pursue that for him.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Simpson</strong>:  I thank the Minister for that, and I certainly will be in touch with him.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I thank all Members who contributed to the debate. Many  Members have attended events that have been held on behalf of those with  autism. Teaching children with autism is a major part of the work of, for  example, Ceara School in Lurgan. Members who visit special  schools will see the great work that is carried out by teachers, speech  therapists and occupational therapists. That work is a credit to those people;  they do a fantastic job. As Rev Coulter did, I pay tribute to those people.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In the Long Gallery in this Building, Members have heard  speeches from young people who, as children, were diagnosed as having severe  autism. Some time ago, a young man of 19 or 20 years of age spoke in the Long  Gallery and explained his background, and how he was diagnosed as having  autism, to the audience. He was able to stand up in front of an audience and  speak because of the courses that he attended and the help that he received  from his teachers.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister referred to parents of those with autism.  Although parents will be proud of their children, they also have a heavy burden  on their shoulders. I ask the Minister to do anything that can be done to  improve the situation for parents. I know that the Minister is sympathetic, and  I understand that he is doing his best to work within his remit. I urge him to  make every effort through his Department to make it easier for those young  adults to have a future, and to make it easier for their parents.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
        <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly calls upon the Minister for Employment and  Learning to provide the opportunities and support necessary to ensure that  young people leaving special-needs schools at 16 and over 19 years of age can  further their education and aspire, where appropriate, to meaningful  employment.</p>

        <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly calls on Invest NI, the Department of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment and the Executive Committee to develop  urgently, and implement, new and innovative measures for tackling the existing  patterns of regional investment inequalities; and to target resources and  efforts towards those in greatest objective need.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s decision to table the motion is part of a  necessary political campaign to fundamentally challenge Invest NI&rsquo;s corporate  mindset and to positively transform the existing patterns of inequality and  disadvantage in regional investment.

        <p class="B3BodyText">The irony of the Alliance Party&rsquo;s amendment is that that  party supposedly campaigns for the Executive to meet to address social needs,  yet the same party has called for the deletion of that Programme for Government  objective from the motion.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in will not allow that overarching commitment to be  sidelined or soft-soaped by the Alliance Party or by the vacuous statistical  contortions that have increasingly become the hallmark of Invest NI&rsquo;s  propaganda workshops. Sinn F&eacute;in supports indigenous small and medium-sized  enterprises, but that sector must be bolstered. Although Sinn F&eacute;in is conscious  of the effects of the global credit crunch, when it comes to the location of  foreign direct investment initiatives sponsored by Invest NI, there is,  undoubtedly, a major institutionalised problem in the Six Counties. Therefore,  Sinn F&eacute;in is not merely questioning or criticising, but actively lobbying for  major investment from overseas urgently to locate in the most deprived areas of  the Six Counties and the border corridor. That  will ensure that those who suffer most from the conflict do not get left behind  in the peace.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">A fine example of Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s efforts came during the US investment  conference in May 2008. Sinn F&eacute;in worked successfully, despite Invest NI, with  local communities and human rights activists to persuade the New York State  Comptroller, Tom DiNapoli, and representatives from the New York City Office of  the Comptroller to visit some of the most deprived areas in Belfast  and Derry to see for themselves the huge  potential for regeneration. For the record, Invest NI did not even put west Belfast or anywhere west  of the Bann on the golfing itinerary, never mind on the investment agenda.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">That is only one of many reasons that led Sinn F&eacute;in to step  up its campaign for a full inquiry and report from the Comptroller and Auditor  General and the Public Accounts Committee. Their focus should be on patterns of  investment distribution and, notably, Invest NI-sponsored foreign direct  investment across the Six Counties over the past decades.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Department of Enterprise,  Trade and Investment (DETI) is belatedly and as a consequence of the Varney  Review II organising a general review of Invest NI. As far as Sinn F&eacute;in is  concerned, the more scrutiny of Invest NI&rsquo;s failings, the better. Therefore, I  publicly invite every political party in the Assembly formally to support Sinn  F&eacute;in in its campaign for those two substantive reports on Invest NI.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">It is worth remembering that the last substantive report on  investment distribution patterns in the North was published by the Westminster  Public Accounts Committee some 10 years ago, and the areas of social economic  deprivation have hardly changed in the interim. That is what makes the patterns  of inequality that Sinn F&eacute;in uncovered over the past decade so shocking. For  example, one in three of all first-time inward investment projects promoted by  Invest NI was located in South Belfast &mdash; although not, I hasten to add, in the  Markets area or Donegall   Pass. Furthermore, one in  two of all new jobs promoted by Invest NI was created in the three  north-eastern constituencies of South Belfast, East Belfast and East Antrim.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Over the past decade, the constituencies of east Derry and North Antrim, both served by MPs from the DUP, received  no new first-time inward investment projects promoted by Invest NI. Using a  range of indicators, the amount of Invest NI jobs created and projects promoted  in South Belfast routinely exceeded the combined total for the entire border  corridor of Foyle, West Tyrone, Fermanagh and South Tyrone, and Newry and Armagh. Worst of all, Invest NI and DETI have refused to  provide Sinn F&eacute;in with detailed statistics of the number of jobs created or  lost either by parliamentary constituency or with specific reference to client  companies in Foyle. Its excuse was the absence of a so-called comprehensive  data set.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">3.00 pm</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Moreover, Invest NI and DETI have refused to provide Sinn  F&eacute;in with detailed statistics on the amount of financial assistance and overall  investment that has been secured in parliamentary constituencies and,  specifically, in client companies in Foyle. They claim that the cost of  publishing that information would be too expensive; however, I presume that  that refers to the cost of their own credibility.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">It is important to note that Invest NI&rsquo;s failure to collect  and collate that basic statistical information for public scrutiny contradicts  directly the clear recommendation that was contained in the respective reports  of the Auditor General and the Public Accounts Committee 10 years ago. Some  Members will, undoubtedly, seek to defend Invest NI by using empty buzz words  such as &ldquo;labour mobility&rdquo; or by referring to the type of creative accounting  that characterises Invest NI&rsquo;s bulging expenses sheets, which I recommend are  examined and held up for public scrutiny. However, I will leave it to some of  my party colleagues to tackle the spurious arguments that Invest NI has  creatively concocted to defend its maintenance of regional structural  inequalities. When scrutinising Invest NI&rsquo;s expenses sheets, the media could  perhaps investigate the close relations between the Assembly&rsquo;s business-class  membership and Invest NI&rsquo;s extended family.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Although parties might argue about the causes of the  existing regional investment inequalities, it is Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s firm view that the  reasons are structural and systemic. No party can credibly dismiss the  realities. The Alliance Party&rsquo;s attention-seeking amendment is merely a  spoiling exercise that, as usual, ignores the needs of society&rsquo;s most  vulnerable individuals. In contrast, Sinn F&eacute;in supports a modern economic  agenda that recognises the interdependency of sustainable economic growth and  sustainable social improvement. Therefore, unsurprisingly, we reject the  amendment.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">For those reasons, Invest NI, DETI and OFMDFM must  introduce new and innovative measures urgently to tackle existing inequalities  and target objective need. Sinn F&eacute;in will work with the Minister of Enterprise,  Trade and Investment to ensure that such measures promote new standards of  equality in regional investment patterns on the basis of efficiency,  effectiveness and economy. Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Neeson</strong>: I  beg to move the following amendment: Leave out all after &ldquo;inequalities;&rdquo; and  insert</p>
        <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;recognises that businesses will seek to make investment  decisions primarily for economic and financial reasons; and calls for action to  address the current barriers to labour mobility.&rdquo;</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Alliance Party welcomes the motion, given that it  highlights a relevant issue. The increasing numbers of visitors to Northern Ireland have not failed to notice that Belfast city centre is  booming. However, they have also noticed that such prosperity is not shared  across Northern Ireland or,  indeed, in Belfast.  In fact, the Belfast City Council area has the third highest gross domestic  product or gross value added per capita of any UK  city except Edinburgh and London.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Members are entitled to question why that strong  performance has not spread elsewhere; however, the issue cannot be resolved by  resorting to outdated ideology.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Neeson</strong>:  Sinn F&eacute;in has a particularly high representation in areas of greatest need.  However, the areas of Northern    Ireland that are in greatest need now are  the same places as 10, 20 and 30 years ago. That indicates that the Assembly  must try a new course, rather than seek Government intervention or allocate  Government resources, which will, certainly, be more limited in the future.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">One of the proposers of the motion represents West Belfast,  which is the most deprived constituency in Northern Ireland. However, almost  one third of all Northern    Ireland&rsquo;s employment lies within two miles  of the centre of that constituency.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Opportunities exist, but segregation, division and poor  services &mdash; particularly in housing, transport and education &mdash; disable people&rsquo;s  access to those opportunities.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">This issue needs practical solutions that are focused not  on increasing red tape and Government intervention, but on enabling people to  share growing prosperity by ensuring that they have access to jobs &mdash; wherever  those new jobs are located. For that to be achieved, it must be remembered that  businesses create wealth and high-quality employment. The role of Government is  that of an enabler. The costs of dividing our society are paid by the very  investors who should allocate all their resources to tackling exclusion &mdash; not  propping up artificial segregation. People must have access to jobs, both  physically, through sustainable transport and housing; and educationally,  through training and skills.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Ultimately, this issue &mdash; like so many others &mdash; is about  ambition. In our society, in our economy and even in this Assembly, we are  obsessed with looking after our own communities. Rarely are we interested in  looking after the community as a whole. As a result, we get the idea that what  is good for one community must be bad for another community, whether the  segregation is along the lines of religion, class, or whatever. It is time that  we got rather better at looking at the bigger picture &mdash; getting to a stage at  which training or job opportunities that are created anywhere are good for  people everywhere, not just in one small district.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The segregation of our society continues to come at a great  cost. It means that ongoing fear and distrust are present in society, in the  economy and even in the Executive. For our economy, it means that there are  severe limitations on labour-market mobility. In other words, it is time that  many people got on their bikes.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We live in uncertain economic times, but one economic  absolute is that prosperity comes to places with the highest levels of  labour-market mobility. If people cannot move house or workplace for fear of being  labelled by the other side, we will all be condemned to poor economic  performance and, therefore, to relative deprivation compared to our neighbours.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Segregation is a clear competitive disadvantage. It is to  the shame of this Executive that they have failed to tackle it, despite  claiming to make the economy their priority. The cost of division and the need  to rebalance the economy have an impact on the public services that potential  investors could use. During this Assembly term alone, the provision of  education, leisure and health facilities on a segregated basis has already cost  billions &mdash; money that could have been invested in our workforce.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The unbalanced economy means that the skills that are  available to businesses are limited because they are seized by the huge public  sector, or by the brain drain due to private-sector opportunities elsewhere. It  is no good saying that investment opportunities are limited in certain  locations when our investment potential is not being maximised in the first  place.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Other aspects of Executive policy have failed to tackle  levels of economic inactivity and exclusion. Nearly half of those who are  economically inactive in Northern    Ireland have mental-health problems. Despite  the budget for tackling such problems already being comparatively lower than  those of our neighbours, we find the Executive content to cut the health budget  in real, comparative terms.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Social exclusion can be tackled by reforming our education  system, delivering better social housing and investing in a much more ambitious  public-transport system, so that people have access to a range of job  opportunities. In that regard, the Executive are either gridlocked or blocked.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Although the Alliance Party welcomes its broad content, the  motion hints at the passive acceptance of a failed policy, rather than a  determination on behalf of one of the main Executive parties to put things  right.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The issue is not that investment is not going to certain  locations, but that people in certain locations are being denied access to the  jobs and prosperity that would result from such investment, which is limited  anyway due to the Government&rsquo;s failure to tackle the root causes of  segregation, division and exclusion in our society. It is time for change, and  it is time for Members of the Assembly to realise that it is time for change.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Although there is some value to this debate, the debates  that are being undertaken in the Chamber remind me of those in the Forum for  Political Dialogue in the Interpoint building. In other words, unless the  Executive meet again soon, the Assembly will be discredited not only in the  eyes of the public but in the eyes of the world.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Enterprise,  Trade and Investment (Mr Durkan)</strong>: On my own behalf, I welcome the motion,  and I commend the Member who proposed it.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">For some time, the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Investment has been  awaiting the answers to several questions about matters relating to the motion.  Last year, the Committee welcomed the fact that growing the economy was stated  as a top priority for the lifetime of the Programme for Government, which built  on the consensus that had been achieved prior to devolution in the Preparation  for Government Committee.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, the Committee welcomed the fact that DETI and  Invest NI had been given a high-profile budget to deliver on that commitment.  Accompanying that responsibility is a compelling need to address regional  investment inequalities, and the enhanced budget capacity provides an  opportunity for a properly planned subregional commitment, incorporating real  financial capacity, which the Committee has discussed on several occasions.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In the past, the Committee has expressed concern that the  Department&rsquo;s spending priorities did not include sufficient resources for the  social economy and offered only limited resources for local economic  development. Committee members were concerned that DETI appeared to be reducing  its budget in that area of growing importance, and having expressed concern, we  received assurances from Ministers and Invest NI about the suggestion of  psychological withdrawal from local social-economy initiatives.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee is also concerned about achieving the best  balance between the effort to attract foreign direct investment and support for  local businesses &mdash; both existing businesses and newer, more innovative  enterprises.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Committee members have continued to stress that, in order  to tackle social and economic inequalities and to add to the sum of opportunity  in the region, the Executive must provide joined-up support for local  businesses in areas of economic disadvantage.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">At Budget time, the Committee expressed concern about the  removal of the integrated development fund, which was a good means by which  local people could work to secure support from different parts of Government  and to attract identifiable funding for cross-cutting initiatives.  Unfortunately, the Budget did away with such means, which could, for example,  have provided the exact wherewithal for Limavady to respond to the challenges  that it faced after Seagate closed.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, questions arose in the Committee about Invest  NI&rsquo;s, and, indeed, DETI&rsquo;s, corporate plan. In the past, Invest NI encouraged  investment in targeted areas of social need, but in its 2008-11 operating plan  that goal was removed and replaced with a commitment to secure 75% of land  acquisition in areas of economic disadvantage. We have questioned that a number  of times. In particular, I have stressed concerns about the need to understand  the implications, and the real meaning, of that shift and what it represents,  and we have still to receive clear answers. The Member who proposed this motion  probably shares that concern.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Given that Invest NI always claims that that target was a  success, what is the rationale for doing away with it and replacing it with a  target that is about land acquisition rather than job creation and location?</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">On several occasions, the Committee raised the case for  Invest NI having a stronger subregional emphasis in its work. Last week, the  Minister met the Committee and told members about the review that she is  commissioning into Invest NI and wider matters of economic development. We  welcome that initiative from the Minister and her Executive colleagues&rsquo;  agreement of to it. She has offered the Committee the opportunity to contribute  to the terms of reference for the review &mdash; we will want to clarify some and amplify  others; not least, the final term of reference, which mentions:</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;the sub-regional distribution of inward investment  and the effectiveness of policy in encouraging the location of investment.&rdquo;</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee also wants to see a subregional element in relation  to indigenous business. The subregional issue should not only relate to inward  investment, it should relate to support for indigenous business also. Such  support is echoed throughout the Chamber.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee is also concerned about how the Start a  Business programme is being developed. We hope that the Minister, when  conducting her review, will reconsider some of the changes that are being made  to the programme, so that the new contracting system will not suffer from the  same problems that have affected some of the other DEL programmes.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Newton</strong>: I  support the amendment. It is the responsibility of all elected representatives  in this Chamber to do everything possible to ensure that there is prosperity  and that career opportunities are available in equal measure to all our  constituents. The question is how we can bring that about.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Had Members felt inclined to support the motion, the Member  proposing it may have put them off doing so. What came through during her  speech was a communist, or Stalinist, approach to the economy &mdash; the kind of  thinking that brought about collective farming in other areas of the world, and  we all know what that led to.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Obviously, a greater level of mobile, inward investment  must be attracted to Northern    Ireland. That will not be easy in the days  ahead, given the current economic climate. Although many people are talking  about it, we are not in a recession currently, difficult as times may be. Given  the current world economic downturn, there is limited potential in the banking and  finance sectors. However, in spite of the current difficulties, we must be  certain that Northern    Ireland is ready for an upturn when it  comes.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We must make Northern Ireland economically  attractive to investors &mdash; not only those from overseas but indigenous  businesses with the opportunity and potential to expand. In the area of  excellence in education, we must produce high-quality, motivated and qualified  students, especially students with qualifications in the science, technology,  engineering and mathematics (STEM) subjects. We must develop motivated and  entrepreneurial businesspeople, as well as a creative business culture that  embraces risk-taking and within which business failure does not carry a stigma.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Additionally, we must ensure that the skills base of our  labour force can be benchmarked favourably against the best in the world. That  can only be ensured if we start to embed business sense into the education  system during children&rsquo;s very early years, by incorporating it into the primary  curriculum. Primary-level education must encourage business thinking and  entrepreneurship, as is commonly found in other countries. We compete with such  countries currently and will do so in the future.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Secondary-level education must provide the opportunity to  gain meaningful vocational qualifications and the increased opportunity to gain  access to higher educational courses and attainment of vocational foundation  degrees or, where relevant, other types of degrees.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We must have apprenticeship training schemes that can be  measured against the best in the world, and not be found to be inferior, to  give our young people the best possible training options.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Road, rail and air links will be important features in the  future, and we must ensure that those links are available if businesses are to  locate in Northern Ireland.  Of course, technology links are no impediment to our business success. We are  fortunate in Northern Ireland  in having such technology links in place at present and a measure of that  success is readily apparent in the successful roll-out of broadband in Northern Ireland</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, as the proposer of the amendment suggested, we  must also encourage mobility in our working-age population: jobs cannot always  be guaranteed to be on the doorstep.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">If we can put in place our business culture, job skills and  support infrastructures, mobile investment will be attracted to &mdash; at the very  least &mdash; consider Northern    Ireland as a potential place in which to  invest.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I reject the narrow thinking that is implicit in the  motion. We all want to see prosperity and jobs located in our own  constituencies. However, it is the businessmen and women with funds to invest  who will make the decision whether &mdash; and where &mdash; to locate in Northern Ireland.  If we can create the right conditions, the whole of Northern Ireland will benefit  through business success.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>: The  motion under debate calls for the Executive Committee urgently to develop new  measures to address so-called regional investment inequalities. I will come to  the economic policy issues in a moment, but first I must examine the irony,  although perhaps much stronger terminology could be used. The irony is that  Sinn F&eacute;in Members have tabled a motion calling on the Executive Committee to  act urgently when that party has blocked all meetings of the Northern Ireland  Executive since the 19 June &mdash; 110 days ago.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In the midst of a global economic crisis that is seriously  affecting the economies of the United Kingdom  and the Republic   of Ireland, Sinn F&eacute;in has  brought the work of the Executive to a halt. Across the world, Governments are  striving to keep pace with the economic threats and challenges that appear  daily. What does Sinn F&eacute;in do? It vetoes any meetings of the Northern Ireland  Executive during the most serious economic crisis that the international  economy has witnessed since perhaps 1929 &mdash; I do not personally remember those  events, by the way. Sinn F&eacute;in now has the affront to table a motion calling on  the Executive urgently to address an economic policy issue. The motion simply  cannot and should not be taken seriously. After three months of vetoing  Executive meetings, amidst a global economic crisis, Sinn F&eacute;in has neither the  necessary political or moral authority to call on the Executive urgently to  address economic matters.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">If this motion were to gain the support of the House, how  exactly does its Sinn F&eacute;in proposer expect it to be implemented? How can the  Executive Committee urgently develop policies on regional investment when the  Executive Committee has not met for three months as a result of a Sinn F&eacute;in  veto?</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I, and my party, agree that there needs to be a debate on  regional investment policies. For example, there must be a debate on the role  of foreign direct investment in the present economic climate. Furthermore,  there must be a serious debate on whether we should reconsider our reliance on  foreign direct investment as the core of our economic policy or whether,  perhaps, we should move to a renewed emphasis on indigenous business start-ups.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">However, today is not the day for such a debate. Why? Because  of Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s intransigence in blocking any meetings of the Executive during  an economic crisis. The Northern Ireland public will, quite rightly, not take  the Assembly seriously if we are seen to support a Sinn F&eacute;in motion requesting  the Executive urgently to address economic policy while that party continues  its three-month veto on Executive meetings.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">That being the case, I, unfortunately but respectfully, see  no merit in engaging meaningfully in debating a motion that, in present circumstances,  has no meaning. Therefore I oppose the motion.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I support the amendment because it is rooted in the real world. My colleague  Robin Newton detected some Marxism &mdash; some old-style communism &mdash; in the comments  of the mover of the motion, Martina Anderson. Although I accept that she and  her party have a different ideology to mine on economic matters, her  contribution was another example of a speech that was more Groucho Marx than  Karl Marx.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Thankfully, I have no insight into republican thinking, but  I could have made a fairly good stab at guessing what the Member would say and  what her party colleagues will say later.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">However, I acknowledge and welcome Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s conversion:  its members are now calling for investment in Northern Ireland. I wonder, as I am  sure do other Members, where the fundamentals of our economy would be today had  it not been for Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s support for the IRA and the succour that that party  gave to it down through the years when that organisation did all in its power  to destroy businesses in Northern Ireland, to deter investment here and to  single out and murder members of the business community. Would the areas that  the Member and her party are trying to identify in the motion be as blighted  had they not been in the grip of terrorism for so long? Members should ponder  those questions.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I want to see the whole of the Northern   Ireland economy grow and develop, and I want to see every  area and everyone in every area do well out of a booming Northern Ireland  economy. That situation may not be easy to visualise at this time, when we are  facing the sort of financial crisis that Mr Cree talked about. Indeed, his  comments were valid. I want the worst areas and the people who are the worst  off in those areas to do well out of any investment, but one must live in the  real world. Businesses will base investment decisions on what is best for that  business, and they will seek to locate their business in an area in which they  will have an advantage.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly cannot do anything to make those decisions for  the businesses; that is not what we do. As a Government or, indeed, as an  Assembly, we are not in the business of making such decisions. The area that is  best suited for the location of a business may well be in the Member&rsquo;s constituency  or in the constituencies of the other Members who tabled the motion, or it  could be in my constituency of Strangford.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I hear one voice in support of that idea. If we wanted to go down the  whinging-and-whining route that we have come to expect from Sinn F&eacute;in Members  during debates on this type of motion, I could match them by whinging and  whining about Strangford.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">An Invest Northern Ireland publication, &lsquo;Invest NI at a  Glance&rsquo;, provides some details on the amount of inward investment and financial  assistance that has been made on each person in the population, and, it shows  that constituencies such as mine are among the worst off. I could stand here  and whinge and whine about how badly off my area is. The figures in that  publication show that the constituencies from which the Members who tabled the  motion come are doing well out of investment and financial assistance per  capita and also out of company visits that are organised by Invest Northern Ireland. They  are doing better than other constituencies, such as mine and those of my  colleagues. However, we do not whinge and whine about it, because we see the  whole Northern Ireland  economic picture. We acknowledge that Northern   Ireland will boom if Belfast is booming. Likewise, other places  will boom if their surrounding areas are doing well.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I do not accept the argument that people in north or west Belfast will not benefit  from investment unless it is made in their areas. I wish that the Titanic  Quarter development was within one mile of the boundary of my constituency.  That area provides one of the biggest employment opportunities in Northern Ireland&rsquo;s history, and it is within a  mile of west Belfast and is probably less  distance from the boundaries of north Belfast.  Huge employment opportunities have been created, and that is where the issue of  mobility, as mentioned in the amendment, is pertinent.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the review into Invest Northern Ireland, as did both Sean Neeson and the Chairperson  of the Committee for Enterprise,  Trade and Investment. I do not hold any torch for Invest Northern Ireland; it is  important that the work of that body is reviewed. Invest Northern Ireland  should be focused on doing what it can to develop the whole Northern Ireland  economy so that everyone benefits, rather than merely spreading the wealth and  investment around the country.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">3.30 pm</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McKay</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. This is not only a major issue for  members of Sinn F&eacute;in: it is a big issue for many of the small and indigenous  businesses across the North. During the past year, I met several business  owners in the north-east branch of the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB).  Their attitude to Invest NI is one of severe criticism, and they recognise that  regional inequalities must be addressed. That criticism deals not only with  regional inequalities, but covers dealing with Invest NI in general.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In its response to the Varney Review last year, FSB stated  that:</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Invest NI has not been a fully engaged partner with  the small business sector&hellip; Whilst its corporate plan pays lip service to the  desire to help develop small business in reality a large proportion of members  are unhappy with the outcomes from their dealings with the body.&rdquo;</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">There is not only a problem with regional  inequalities; there is a whole array of problems with Invest NI. I welcome the  fact that the Minister will carry out a review. It is hoped that that review  will be far-reaching and bring to Invest NI a degree of transparency that has  not been seen to date.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">My constituency has some very stark figures with regard to  the work that Invest NI has not done over the past 10 years. I listened to the  Alliance Party talk about outdated ideologies, etc. It is wrong for the  Alliance Party to turn a blind eye to the inequalities that exist in society  and the causes of those inequalities. At this time, people will understand the  need:</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;to target resources and efforts to those in the  greatest objective need.&rdquo;</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">as the motion outlines.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">However, the figures in my constituency speak for  themselves. My colleague Martina Anderson referred to the fact that there had  been 133 first-time Invest NI inward-investment projects over the past 10  years, along with 17,180 jobs promoted by those projects &mdash; none of which has  been in North Antrim. Over the same period,  almost 15,000 new jobs had been promoted by reinvestment projects from  externally-owned clients, and only 35 of those were in North   Antrim. Over the past five years, there were close to 700 visits  by potential inward investors, and only three came as far as North   Antrim. The issue affects not only republican and nationalist  areas; it affects unionist areas as well.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">When Sinn F&eacute;in says that it wants to deal with the  inequalities and target those based on objective need, it will do so regardless  of religion or political opinion. Sinn F&eacute;in wants to target and help those in  greatest need &mdash; and more people will come under that category over the next few  months as the recession kicks in.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s decision to review the workings of  Invest NI and the need for that to be transparent. We must ensure that regional  inequalities are addressed, and Invest NI has yet to demonstrate that it is  willing to address those inequalities. It must start to listen to some of the  criticisms levelled against it &mdash; not only by ourselves, but by small and  indigenous businesses. The response that they get is one of ignorance and  disdain. That approach is all wrong and it must be reviewed.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The opportunity exists to change the remit, policies and  direction of Invest NI so that investment is directed to areas of greatest  need, and investors are actively encouraged to locate in those areas. There is  a clear need for Invest NI to listen to what businesses say that it does, and  to change the way it does business. Only then will Invest NI be able to address  the extreme lack of confidence that many in the business and wider community  have in it. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  I support the motion. It is regrettable that the debate takes place against a  backdrop of an Executive that are unable to function.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The public, particularly the business community, expects  the social and economic interests of the people whom we represent to take  precedence over any narrow political interests, especially those obstructing  Assembly business.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I agree with Sean Neeson about the difficulties that we all  face in attracting investment to Northern Ireland &mdash; that is a fact.  However, my party colleagues and I oppose the Alliance Party&rsquo;s amendment  because it distracts from the main issue of addressing regional inequalities.  The amendment refers to labour mobility; however, to talk of labour mobility  is, in many cases, to let the powers that be off the hook. Some of my  constituents &mdash; who support the various parties in the Chamber &mdash; are losing  their jobs in the public sector, for example, in the Water Service, and their  options are not good: they are being asked to move to Belfast &mdash; that is the kind of labour mobility  that is being presented to them. Therefore, the SDLP cannot support the  amendment.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">There are difficulties across the board, but they are  particularly acute in Fermanagh and Tyrone because of the legacy of neglect of  the west. There are some clear priorities for addressing that legacy, not least  a step up in Invest Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  general approach and in the Department for Regional Development&rsquo;s approach to  roads infrastructure. I commend the Minister for announcing a review of the  activities of Invest Northern Ireland,  because that agency has so far failed to address the problems here,  particularly in the west.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Simon Hamilton mentioned visits that were organised by  Invest NI. In 2006 and 2007, Invest Northern Ireland  brought 230 possible investors to Northern Ireland, but none could be  brought to Strabane, the biggest employment black spot in the west; and only  one of them could be brought to Fermanagh, which is the second-biggest  employment black spot.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Devolution was supposed to make a difference to the lives  of people here. Since devolution, Invest Northern Ireland  has published a new strategy, the aim of which is to concentrate on directing  all investment towards Belfast and Derry. Labour mobility is hinted at, which does not bode  well for Fermanagh. I hope that the review of Invest Northern Ireland will  include an in-depth exploration of tourism. Much has been made of signature  tourism projects, but where are they based? They are in Antrim or Down &mdash; none  of them is based in Fermanagh and South Tyrone, areas that attract large  numbers of visitors.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Last week, the Bain Report on public-sector jobs  highlighted the poor roads infrastructure in the west. Enniskillen and  Cookstown, which are in the west, and Downpatrick, which is in Mr Wells&rsquo;s  constituency, were not chosen as locations for public-sector jobs because of  their very poor infrastructure and transport facilities. It is time that we  took the subject of the motion seriously. In parts of the North, and especially  in the west, the Department&rsquo;s record on inward and infrastructure investment &mdash;  and these are areas in which there is no alternative to roads &mdash; has, so far,  been very poor.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I ask the Member to bring his remarks to a close.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment (Mrs Foster)</strong>: I thank the Members who tabled the motion. I also  thank the proposer of the motion who, at the outset, was upfront about the  motivation behind it. She said that Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s decision to table the motion  was part of a political campaign against the corporate mindset of Invest NI.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">That is very upfront, and it lets us know where the motion  is coming from. Mr McKay tried to resile slightly from those comments in his  speech, but it is clear that one party wants to make a political campaign  against Invest NI. However, it is very upfront about that, and I thank it for  that.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the motion. First, it allows me to reaffirm the  commitment of the entire Executive team to fulfil their responsibility to  support the regions of Northern    Ireland that have deep-rooted and complex  social and economic problems. I should say at the outset that, as a  representative for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, I have a clear understanding of  the issues. Tommy Gallagher outlined our thoughts on the Bain Report and what  it had to say about roads infrastructure, not taking into account that, in this  modern era of technology, accessibility does not necessarily mean that people  have to travel by road. Secondly, the motion enables me to clarify the capacity  of my Department, via its policies, programmes and resources, to impact on  regional investment patterns. Thirdly, it affords me the opportunity to clarify  for the Assembly the regional investment patterns that have arisen as a result  of Invest NI&rsquo;s activity.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">As the motion acknowledges, the Programme for Government  recognises that achieving sustainable economic growth and improving prosperity  for all will require strong and determined action to address poverty and  disadvantage. However, the complexities and underlying causes of the problem  place an overarching responsibility on the Executive to address existing  patterns of economic and social disadvantage proactively. Therefore, a  co-ordinated cross-departmental approach is vital if we are to be successful in  helping the most vulnerable in our society and create strong, vibrant and  sustainable communities that we all desire.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">There are targets in the Programme for Government that  focus on delivering economic improvement, and they are supported by a number of  public service agreement targets that have an economic development focus.  However, Sean Neeson made the point &mdash; and it was reiterated by Robin Newton &mdash;  that those targets are the responsibility of other Departments, including the  Department for Employment and Learning, the Department of Education, the  Department for Regional Development and the Department of Agriculture and Rural  Development.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Economic development policies and initiatives, and the  investments that flow from them, are not the exclusive responsibility of one  Department, nor can they be substantially impacted on by the actions of one  Department acting in isolation. Through its focus on productivity growth and  increasing employment, my Department can, and does, make a significant  contribution to the overall objective.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The role of Invest Northern Ireland  is to contribute to the growth of Northern   Ireland&rsquo;s economy by helping new and existing businesses  to compete internationally and by attracting new investment into Northern Ireland.  I want to pick up on a point that was made by Mr McKay, who said that the FSB  had expressed discontent with Invest Northern Ireland. Invest Northern Ireland  does not deal with very small companies, and I have been examining that issue  to see whether there is a gap.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Invest Northern    Ireland deals with companies that have  potential for export or that already export. Mr McKay also commented that  indigenous companies were not being supported, but, over the past five years,  some 54% of all assistance by Invest Northern Ireland has gone to locally-owned  NI companies.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Inclusivity is the cornerstone of the approach for Invest  Northern Ireland.  As its corporate plan makes abundantly clear, its overriding objective is to  increase business productivity in order to create wealth for the benefit of the  whole community.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">DETI and Invest NI are primarily focused on business  development and growth &mdash; that is what we have been tasked to do by the  Executive. Indeed, we do not have powers to intervene on a social basis. At a  time of credit crunch and global economic difficulties, focus on business  development and growth is essential.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">However, our work is underpinned by the principles of  equality of opportunity, anti-poverty and social inclusion. DETI and Invest NI  are fully committed to contributing to the Government&rsquo;s objective of developing  a balanced regional company.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We have consistently demonstrated our commitment to  ensuring that services can be accessed by businesses and individuals throughout  Northern Ireland.  Invest Northern Ireland  uses its influence, where possible, to alleviate the problems of economic  disadvantage and to help narrow the gap in key indicators such as economic  inactivity.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">3.45 pm</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Invest Northern Ireland  seeks to ensure that its programmes and services can be accessed by businesses  and individuals throughout Northern    Ireland. It is scrupulous in ensuring that  it meets its equality of opportunity obligations and in its reporting of its  activities and their spatial impact in a transparent and detailed manner. Those  activities are published in Invest Northern Ireland&rsquo;s &lsquo;Performance Information  Report 2002/03-2006/07&rsquo;, which I commend to Members, and which is available on  the organisation&rsquo;s website.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">However, there is a limit to what Invest Northern Ireland  can achieve and influence, given its limited access to policy levers and  resources. In a resource allocation context, the annual Invest Northern Ireland programme  activity budget amounts to approximately &pound;150 million. To put it another way,  that amount represents less than 2% of the Executive&rsquo;s annual Budget.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Invest Northern Ireland has given a firm commitment that,  over a three-year planning cycle of its corporate plan, it will ensure that 75%  of new land acquired for the use of its clients will be located in  disadvantaged areas. Furthermore, it is important to note that we also ensure  that 70% of new foreign direct investment is located within 10 miles of an area  of economic disadvantage.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Those are well-judged, practical and sensible targets, and  they are a direct response to the travel-to-work patterns that characterise  modern economies, including that of Northern Ireland. It must be  recognised, however, that there are no longer any self-contained labour markets  for foreign direct investment projects. People are now much more willing to  travel to other areas in order to reach their place of work.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Invest Northern Ireland has the facility to offer enhanced  rates of assistance to projects that are located in disadvantaged areas and has  used that facility to good effect. Invest Northern Ireland has sought, with  some success, to encourage potential inward investors to consider locating in  disadvantaged areas. Between 2002 and 2008, for example, 71% of first-time  inward-investment projects assisted by Invest Northern Ireland were  located in such areas. In addition, 51% of all financial assistance offered by  the agency during the same period was to clients located in such areas, the  populations of which account for only 30% of the Northern Ireland total. By any  measure, that is a significant skewing of Government assistance to those in  areas of greater need, mainly in rural areas in the west of the Province.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">It is important to examine investment patterns, which are  the result of a wide variety and complex set of location decision-making  factors, of which the availability of serviced industrial sites and access to  financial support are secondary. Invest Northern Ireland&rsquo;s interventions  are by their nature largely demand-led and driven by private-sector clients &mdash;  both companies and individuals &mdash; bringing forward their proposals for growing  their businesses. That is important, because people are making commercial  decisions about what they are going to do.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">As I said earlier, a project that is assisted in a  particular location has significant potential to create benefits across a much  wider area. Many investors draw their workforces from areas beyond council or  constituency boundaries. Even the workforce of a hospital, large school or  Government office will show that pattern. Much has been made of the fact that a  large proportion of inward investment in Belfast  is located in the south of the city. In reality, however, 96% of inward  investment in Belfast was located within a  three-mile radius of the city centre, thereby creating employment opportunities  accessible to all in the greater Belfast  area. Indeed, it should be noted that almost three quarters of those who work  in South Belfast live outside that  constituency area.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Making judgements that are based on superficial comparisons  of performance across the different geographical areas of Northern Ireland  is highly and, undoubtedly, wilfully misleading. People should consider what  they are saying when they make those points.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">It is also important to consider the new companies that  have come to Northern    Ireland to do business in the manufacturing  and tradable service industries. Invest Northern Ireland has assisted projects  in a range of locations, such as Armagh, Bangor, Larne, Newry, Antrim,  Enniskillen, Strabane, Kilkeel and Carrickfergus. Recently, in the north-west,  significant project announcements have been made by key investors such as Du  Pont, Perfecseal Ltd, Firstsource Solutions and Fujitsu. It is important to  note that those companies have made investments in Northern   Ireland, and instead of using the anti-capitalist  rhetoric that we have heard here today, we should be welcoming those companies  to Northern Ireland  and encouraging them to invest more.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The amendment rightly recognises that businesses make  investment decisions primarily for economic and financial reasons.  Unfortunately, the days of philanthropic investments have long since  disappeared. Internationally-focused businesses, particularly those supported  by Invest NI, will first choose to invest in Northern Ireland, and secondly to  invest in specific subregional locations, only for sound economic and financial  reasons. They will only invest if they perceive the commercial risk to be  acceptable, and, after that, they will then consider whether they can generate  a sufficient return on their investment. The level of commercial risk is  determined after consideration of all location decision-making factors, such as  political and economic stability; labour and skills availability; roads  infrastructure; transportation linkages and affordability; accommodation; and  grant assistance.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The amendment also calls for action to address the current  barriers to labour mobility. The Department, through Invest NI, seeks to ensure  that it has sufficient land zoned for industrial use for the use of its clients  across Northern Ireland.  At the moment, Invest NI is targeting specific areas in which it needs to  increase its holding. Its land bank has been fast diminishing in recent years  as a result of strong client demand, and it only has approximately 750 acres  currently available for letting to clients. That is something that needs to be  addressed.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Arguments have been put forward concerning a perceived  neglect of the north-west, or an east-west bias regarding chosen investment  locations. The reality, when one considers the facts, is very different.  Investment secured per head of population shows that Invest NI-supported  projects in the north-west have resulted in the highest level of planned  investment per head of any part of Northern Ireland. That is not a  vacuous statistical contortion; those are the facts. They may not sit very well  with Ms Anderson&rsquo;s warped anti-capitalist view of Northern Ireland, but those are the  realities. If Ms Anderson wishes to make any specific allegations in relation  to the expenses of members of Invest NI&rsquo;s board, I firmly suggest that she  write to me, so that I may investigate everything that she produces.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">To repeat: although the Department and Invest NI seek to  fulfil their role in tackling regional disparity, they do not have all of the  policy levers and resources to materially influence spatial patterns of  investment.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, Members will be aware that I announced to the  Committee for Enterprise,  Trade and Investment last week that there would be an independent review of  economic development policies and programmes. That review will examine the  structure and remit of Invest NI, as well as the subregional distribution of  inward investment, and the effectiveness of policy in encouraging the location  of investment. I will, of course, keep the Members of the House informed of the  progress of that review.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, if the deep-rooted and complex social and  economic causes of disadvantage are to be successfully addressed, the  co-ordinated effort of all parts of the Executive, as well as the support of  the private, voluntary and community sectors, will be required to ensure that  investments are utilised to the maximum benefit of those in our society in the  greatest need. I can assure the House that the Executive is fully committed to  focusing on those important issues, and will continue to do so. The success of  the Programme for Government will depend on all Ministers and their Departments  working closely together to ensure optimum economic outcomes on an equitable  basis for all of Northern    Ireland. I can also assure the House that  the Executive, my Department and its agencies, including Invest NI, have been  playing, and will continue to fully play, their role in this important matter.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  welcome the fact that we are having this debate today, although I must express  regret at some of the thinking that has been expressed by the proposers of the  motion. Everyone in the House will agree that there is an issue to be discussed  regarding the distribution of economic opportunities across Northern Ireland,  but there is a profound disagreement as to the means of best addressing that.  The proposers of the motion have demonstrated outmoded economic thinking that  is a relic of centuries long ago. They are essentially speaking about a command  economy rather than a market economy. One would have thought that the lessons  that were painfully learned during the twentieth century would have  demonstrated the fallacy of a command economy, whether under national socialism  or communism.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Market economies are the only way to ensure that there is  maximum economic prosperity for societies around the world. That is accepted  internationally by most people. Sinn F&eacute;in seems to be more concerned about how  the cake in Northern Ireland  is divided, rather than its size.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>:  The honourable Member will be interested to know that, in the past six years,  there have been 165 inward-investment visits to the constituencies of the four  Members who tabled the motion. Considering that North   Antrim received three, South Down received five and Strangford  received nine, those Members can hardly complain that DETI and Invest NI are  not making an effort to bring inward investment to their constituencies.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  The Member makes a good point, which I will address shortly.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We must appreciate that there is a limit to how much we can  direct the location of investment. As the Minister clarified, businesses will  ultimately take decisions that are based on economic and financial reasons,  which she broke down into the competitive issues that they will examine, such  as transport and the local skills base. It is hard enough to attract investment  to Northern Ireland,  particularly of a high-quality and high value-added nature, without attaching  further strings to the location of that investment.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We have to acknowledge that investment has been made in  areas that are close to deprived communities across Northern Ireland. As Sean Neeson  stated, there is a high GVA and high employment in Belfast. However, those figures are largely  based on commuters coming into the city, which means that there are people who  live in Belfast  who miss out. For example, although the gasworks site is next to the Markets  and Donegall Pass areas, very few people from those  areas are employed there. Why is that?</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The investment that has been made in Belfast  is closer to people who live in West Belfast than it is to those who take most  of the jobs and commute from the suburbs of the greater Belfast area and beyond. Why are people in West Belfast not taking those jobs? Therefore, insisting  that jobs are created on the doorsteps of certain communities does not address  the fundamental problem, which goes much deeper. Forcing the issue will buck  the market for no reason, which is to the ultimate disadvantage of Northern Ireland.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We must address skills gaps and the levels of economic  inactivity, including issues that are linked to disabilities and mental-health  problems. We must invest in accessible and sustainable public transport and  address segregation caused by peoples&rsquo; fears of moving to an area because a  different side of the community is perceived as dominant there.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">An efficient and effective economy requires full and proper  labour market mobility, which we do not have in Northern Ireland. We have a  two-speed society, in which an advanced section has labour-market mobility and  is able to access jobs, and the remainder do not. The Executive must invest  their efforts in addressing the barriers that exist for some people to access  jobs, instead of micromanaging the economy, which has no discernible benefit &mdash;  and is potentially detrimental &mdash; to the economy in Northern Ireland. The  economic situation is fragile enough as it is.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I stress the Alliance Party&rsquo;s support for a review of  Invest Northern Ireland,  which I think will have support from all sides of the House. There is a range  of issues that must be addressed, but the motion is flawed. I urge Members to  support the amendment.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I make no apologies for whingeing and  whining, which Simon Hamilton accused me of, or for having outdated or outmoded  ideologies. The motion is not about whether people can travel to and from  employment; it is about helping people who live in disadvantaged areas where  there is deprivation and need.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The motion calls for investment to come into those areas,  provide employment for local people and help to grow the local economy. If that  is whingeing and whining, that is fine. Long-term economic development that is  stable, sustainable and socially beneficial to all is at the heart of the  motion.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">4.00 pm</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Invest NI has a long history of not delivering  publicly-sponsored investment to areas such as West Belfast and North Belfast,  which have some of the most deprived electoral wards and super output areas in  the North. For example, of 16 inward-investment projects for Belfast  that Invest NI offered &pound;20&middot;7 million of assistance to in 2006-07, none were  located in the west Belfast  and greater Shankill area. Some of my colleagues have already provided  statistics and mentioned the difficulty in getting those statistics from Invest  NI. During the past 10 years, the number of jobs that were promoted by Invest  NI-sponsored first-time inward-investment projects totalled 4,748 in South  Belfast compared with 1,302 in West Belfast, despite the fact that five of the  most distressed wards in the North are located in West   Belfast. The people of West Belfast  and of areas west of the Bann are entitled to have investment opportunities  come into their areas.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">During the debate, Leslie Cree, among other Members,  attacked Sinn F&eacute;in I do not know how many times. The previous leader of his  party brought down not only the Executive, but the entire Assembly. Therefore,  it is a bit ridiculous of him to lecture Sinn F&eacute;in on whether the Executive  meets.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The subject of the debate is the long-term corporate  approach of Invest NI and its predecessor, the Industrial Development Board,  which has damaged areas and groups that already suffer significant  disadvantage. Even in economic terms, that approach is outdated, incompetent,  wasteful and short-sighted. I have noted the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment&rsquo;s comments. She said that equality of opportunity and social  inclusion underpin Invest NI&rsquo;s corporate plan. However, she did not explain why  half of the assistance that it has offered has gone to clients that are already  located in affluent areas. It does nothing for people in disadvantaged areas.  That must be remembered.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">New and innovative measures to integrate sustainable  economic growth and social improvements on the basis of objective need are the  cornerstone of modern economic development. Mark Durkan and Tommy Gallagher  referred to that. The core of the issue is the compelling need to challenge  regional inequalities. Job creation must be targeted towards TSN areas. That is  the only way. People do ask to live in poverty or to be poor. Social  inequalities put people in that situation.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>:  I listened carefully to the Minister&rsquo;s comments. My constituents will be  disappointed that she defended Invest NI&rsquo;s abysmal record in Fermanagh and  South Tyrone.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Speaking in my capacity as MP and MLA for that  constituency, I ask whether the Member is aware that, according to figures that  have been published by DETI, my parliamentary constituency experiences an  economic inactivity rate of 36%, compared with 17% for East Belfast and 19% for  East Antrim. Is the Member also aware that the  number of new jobs that were promoted by first-time inward-investment projects  that were sponsored by Invest NI during the past decade was just 641 in  Fermanagh and South Tyrone, compared with almost 5,000 in South   Belfast?</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Does the Member agree that the Minister&rsquo;s strong support  for Invest NI is yet another example of the worst excesses of big-house  unionism, which rides roughshod over the objective needs of working-class and  socially deprived unionists, nationalists and republicans throughout my  constituency? The Assembly must stand up for people&rsquo;s rights. My party will not  be afraid to campaign against patterns of inequality, especially generational  inequality, which Invest NI has perpetuated.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  I thank the Member for her comments. It is also clear, regardless of whether  the Assembly agrees, that the areas that receive the lowest levels of financial  support and investment are predominantly nationalist areas. No matter what  statistics are quoted, that is the reality.<span class="Italic"> [Interruption.]</span></p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. The Member has the Floor.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  We must take every opportunity to ensure that those directly affected by social  and economic disadvantage are also directly targeted by the public  organisations responsible for creating and retaining employment. We may be  facing an economic downturn &mdash; or whatever Members like to call it &mdash; but there  are still opportunities for us to build for the future. Our priorities must be  to protect jobs and to bring forward planned funding for the delivery of major  infrastructure projects in roads, housing, education and health as outlined in  the investment strategy.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We must use procurement programmes by ensuring that all  public procurement expenditure &mdash; including that for services, works and goods &mdash;  integrates long-term economic and social sustainability through the development  of creative contract compliance measures in relation to corporate delivery.  That important measure could have a significant impact by targeting the  long-term unemployed and the economically inactive in the areas that I have  talked about. Through the creation of apprenticeships, we can collectively  develop a wider sustainable skills base.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We must ensure that local small-to-medium enterprises and  social-economy enterprises enter competitions for public contracts at a  tendering stage with the same level of expertise as other larger companies,  since that will positively impact on the local economy. That is what we are  talking about: building local economies.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  No.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We are not just talking about people travelling to and from  the city centre into work, but rather building local economies to produce  social outcomes and challenge poverty, disadvantage and need.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Invest NI has failed on several levels. In particular, it  has not delivered for areas of severe disadvantage, such as North and West Belfast &mdash; sorry for whingeing, Simon. Invest NI must  be held to account for that. The promotion of equality of opportunity in the  discharge of public funds is essential if people are to have confidence in  public bodies and organisations.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Members have talked about everything in this debate:  skills, technology and mobility, and Sinn F&eacute;in has been attacked quite a number  of times. The party opposite has talked about outmoded and outdated ideologies,  Marxism and communism &mdash; but we have not about regional inequalities. That is  what the debate is about.</p>
