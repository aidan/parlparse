    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The Assembly met at 12.00 noon (M Deputy Speaker [Mr  McClarty] in the Chair).</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Members observed two minutes&rsquo; silence.</p>
    <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="1"></a>Ministerial Statement</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Independent Review of Economic Development Policy in Northern Ireland  (DETI/Invest NI)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I have received notice from the Minister of Enterprise,  Trade and Investment that she wishes to make a statement regarding the  independent review of economic development policy in Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment (Mrs Foster)</strong>: I wish to make a statement on my intention to  launch a short period of consultation on the report of the independent review  of economic development policy, which was published last week.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Members will be aware that I invited Professor Barnett, the  vice chancellor of the University   of Ulster, to chair the  review into whether the existing Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment  (DETI) and Invest NI policies, programmes and resources are contributing  optimally to the delivery of the productivity goal in the Programme for  Government. I thank Professor Barnett and his review panel for the time and  effort that they put into producing their detailed and wide-ranging report.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The panel made a total of 58 recommendations. In summary,  it recommends that there is a need to promote a much greater emphasis on  supporting innovation as well as research and development; a need to provide  greater autonomy for Invest Northern Ireland in order for that organisation to  be more responsive and flexible in supporting companies; a need to improve the  way that economic policy is developed and co-ordinated in the public sector;  and a need to re-examine the way that we assess performance, in particular the  tendency to examine each individual decision rather than adopting a broader  portfolio-based approach.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The report outlines a number of recommendations in other  areas of government that help to deliver on the Programme for Government  productivity goal. Those include important areas such as skills, infrastructure  and planning.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is clear that the panel put a huge effort into  addressing those highly significant and complex issues. Its conclusions and  recommendations will require the most careful consideration, which is why I  will not be jumping to a conclusion on the report&rsquo;s analysis and recommendations.  I was exceptionally disappointed, but perhaps not surprised, by some of the  sensationalist coverage that followed the immediate aftermath of the launch of  the report last week. Much of that was at odds with the balanced tone of the  report, and, I believe, misrepresented the findings and conclusions of the  report.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That coverage was in marked contrast to the mature and  balanced discussion that took place during Question Time in the Chamber last  week. Following that lead, I urge everyone to give the report the mature  reflection that it needs and deserves.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The panel&rsquo;s analysis and recommendations will prove a  valuable stimulus for a thoughtful and wide-ranging consideration of what needs  to be done to grow the economy. However, there is also an urgent need for  action, which is why I am announcing today that there will be a short, six-week  period of public consultation on the report, ending on Monday 16 November.  Responses should be sent to the strategic planning division in my Department,  and further details can be found in the covering letter that accompanies the  commencement of the public consultation exercise.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My objective is to balance the need to draw in views with  the need to reach timely conclusions and to initiate purposeful actions on the  report and its recommendations. I commend the statement to the Assembly.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Enterprise,  Trade and Investment (Mr A Maginness)</strong>: I thank the Minister for her  statement and echo some of the comments that she made on the sensationalist approach  to the report by some members of the press, though not all.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The report is a substantial and complex piece of work, and  the implementation of its recommendations will require all of government to  work together. As the Minister rightly said, the report will require most  careful consideration and mature reflection. However, she also referred to the  urgent need for action. With that in mind, what consideration have the Minister  and her Department given to the involvement of other Depart&shy;ments and agencies  in the development of proposals for action on the findings of the report and to  the estimated timescale for bringing those proposals to the House for  implementation?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: I thank the Chairman of the Committee for his comments and his  question.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The report has been shared with my ministerial colleagues &mdash;  it was sent to them on the same day that I received it. It is important to take  the views of colleagues at high level, initially and later on, on how the  report could impact on their Departments. Although the review&rsquo;s terms of  reference only covered the policies of DETI and Invest Northern Ireland on the  economy, the point is well made in the report that there are many other  Departments that contribute to the success or otherwise of the Northern Ireland  economy. The main thrust of the report is about raising the productivity of the  Northern Ireland  economy, and Barnett points to a wide range of areas that do not fall under the  remit of DETI. Therefore, there will need to be engagement between me and my  Executive colleagues.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I wanted the consultation to last six weeks, and no longer,  because there is a need to gather the views of representatives from the  business community and other stakeholders before I hold my discussions with  ministerial colleagues. This piece of work will engage all my colleagues, which  is why I intend to take it to the Executive shortly after the consultation  finishes.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I welcome the proposal in the report to merge the Minister&rsquo;s Department with  the Department for Employment and Learning (DEL), or at least elements of that  Department that are economically focused and facing. That proposal will be  widely welcomed by the business sector and the community at large. If the  proposal finds favour in the Executive, how can it be taken forward so that we  receive the benefits of it that are underscored in the report?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment</strong>: It will come as no  surprise that I welcome the proposal to merge DETI and DEL so that there is a single Department of  the economy. That proposal was welcomed by the business community, which is  reflected in the evidence that its representatives gave to the review. However,  that is not just a matter for my Department; as the Member knows, it will have  to go to the Executive. Although I can take a view on the matter, the Executive  will have to come to a view on it and take it forward. The Assembly and  Executive Review Committee, which the Member sits on, will probably also have a  role.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, it is something that I welcome and that I am sure  will come up for discussion after the consultation.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I, too, thank the Minister for her  statement. Given some of the criticisms in the review of the performance of  Invest NI &mdash; to which the Minister referred in her statement &mdash; does Invest NI  not need to be made more accountable rather than given more autonomy?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment</strong>: I do not accept that at all, and that is  certainly not the finding of the Barnett review, which clearly says that Invest  Northern Ireland should be given more autonomy to allow it to be more flexible  and responsive to the needs of the business community and those seeking to  invest in Northern Ireland. The Member&rsquo;s assertion is not borne out by the  evidence and is not in the review.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The review is balanced in many ways, not least in its  assessment of the work of Invest Northern Ireland. It highlights areas of  good performance, and, yes, it does contain criticism. However, there is not  much point in me asking such a panel to carry out a review if it gives me only  good news. I wanted constructive criticism, which is very much in the review,  and I welcome that. I hope that we can have a mature debate on how we deal with  that criticism and move the discussion forward.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>: I  thank the Minister for her statement. It is good to have that review; there is  a lot in it. At this early stage, a lot more thought is needed before we come  up with broad questions on the way forward. However, one thing did catch my  eye: 55% of total programme costs for selective financial assistance was spent  on expanding businesses rather than growing new ones. Is the Minister happy  with that emphasis?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment</strong>: There is a good deal about selective  financial assistance in the review, particularly in relation to &ldquo;dead weight&rdquo;,  which involves giving money to a company that later says that it was going to  expand anyway. However, that is not known when dealing with a company up front,  and therein lies the difficulty. When you are dealing with someone across the  table who says that unless you give me assistance, I will take these jobs  elsewhere or not expand, do you take the risk and decide not to help the  company with those jobs, or do you step back and give it the money?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That is an issue that will come up again and again, and the  Member is right to point it out. However, selective financial assistance is on  a timeline, and that also gives us difficulties from a European perspective. I  am pleased to see that the review provides suggestions about how we can argue  with Europe to keep some of that selective financial assistance, because we  still need that help in Northern    Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Productivity versus jobs, and lower-paid jobs, is an issue  with which the Assembly will have to come to grips. I said it last week, and I  will say it again: should we continue to bring low-value jobs to a  constituency, even though I know that Members very much welcome those jobs in  their constituencies? The review clearly says that we should emphasise  innovation and research and development and that low-paid jobs should be able  to find their own way. That is a big decision for the Assembly and for Invest  Northern Ireland  and is for Members to look to in respect of their constituencies.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Neeson</strong>: I  thank the Minister for her statement. I welcome the publication of the review,  particularly in relation to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). One  recommendation is that SMEs should be integrated into the supply chains of  large companies. How does the Minister react to that? Secondly, Professor  Barnett and his team will appear before the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Investment this week.  Is six weeks long enough for the consultation?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: I will answer the second question first. Yes, a six-week period  is long enough I do not want to be accused of paralysis, apart from anything  else. Government are always accused of taking in reports and allowing them to  sit and not acting on them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I was determined that that would not happen with this  report, because it contains many good points. Some recommendations will take  longer to implement, but we can act on others now. In fact, Invest Northern Ireland is  already carrying out actions that have much synergy with the report&rsquo;s  recommendations.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">12.15pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I was pleased to see a section on small businesses in the  panel&rsquo;s report, because part of the criticism that I continually hear about  Invest Northern Ireland  is that it has a client base that it does not go beyond. The report talks about  doing away with the emphasis on client companies, and I welcome that as it will  allow Invest Northern Ireland  to engage with companies that it otherwise would not have dealt with,  particularly small businesses.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am pleased with how Invest Northern Ireland has  been working on some bigger contracts to bring in smaller companies and allow  them access, which goes back to the public procurement issue. For instance,  Invest Northern Ireland  is working with the team in the south west hospital to bring in small  contractors and allow them access to the work. Moreover, it allowed small  contractors to bid for work in Bombardier recently. We can do a lot for small  businesses that has not been done to date. I welcome that.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>: I  welcome the fact that the Minister has launched the consultation. She mentioned  small and medium-sized enterprises, which are the core of constituencies such  as mine, especially in places such as Ballymoney and Ballycastle. What will be  the implications of the report beyond the confines of Belfast  and Londonderry? There is much concentration  on issues around those two cities, but spreading the benefits of the economy is  surely an essential component in all parts of Northern Ireland, especially rural  areas such as those in the Minister&rsquo;s constituency.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment</strong>: It will not surprise  the Member to learn that I want Invest Northern Ireland  to operate in places other than Belfast and Londonderry. It is important that coverage spans Northern Ireland.  When I took up my ministerial post last year, I visited each Invest Northern  Ireland office in Northern    Ireland to encourage them to, as the Member  says, engage locally with councils, Chambers of Commerce and small businesses.  The report has validated that notion and encourages us to look beyond the  client company base.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As the Member knows, more than 80% of companies in Northern Ireland  are SMEs, and, therefore, a huge number of people are employed in such  businesses. As the Member said, they are the backbone of the economy in Northern Ireland.  I welcome that part of the report and look forward to taking it on.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr McDonnell</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her statement. Does she share my view that Invest  Northern Ireland has been strangled in many ways since its birth by petty  bureaucratic accountability rather than enjoying the meaningful accountability  that it needs? Is the Minister aware that, at the outset, Invest Northern Ireland was  intended to be fairly autonomous but that somewhere along the way, it became  strangled by the Department? How does she intend to reverse that position and  give Invest Northern Ireland  the space, freedom and autonomy to do the job that is required of it?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: The Member is right: a large section of the report mentions  governance. Governance issues between DETI and Invest Northern Ireland are very  good in so far as there are a lot them. There needs to be greater clarity about  their respective roles and responsibilities on economic policy. In other words,  DETI sets the economic policy, and Invest Northern Ireland has a role that is flexible  and responsive, but realising that it spends public money and must be  accountable for that expenditure. That is absolutely right and should continue  to be the case.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member might recall that in my first meeting with the  Committee for Enterprise,  Trade and Investment, I raised the issue of risk and the fact that Invest  Northern Ireland should be allowed flexibility. Instead of focusing on one  investment announcement, we should consider investments in a portfolio manner  and consider several investments together. Then, if one investment fails and  nine are successful, it would be a good story.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I must emphasise that that approach is not, as some commentators  have suggested, a way of allowing Invest Northern Ireland to waste government money &mdash;  not at all. It allows it to be more flexible, as a regional development agency,  and to get those high-productivity jobs that we so desperately need in Northern Ireland.  I welcome that; I hope that it encourages Members to debate the issue in the  Committee for Enterprise,  Trade and Investment and in the House to try to strike a balance between good  governance and the need to be flexible.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement. Will the Minister confirm that, in  determining a way forward, governance structural issues are secondary and that  the primary challenge is to increase productivity in Northern Ireland? Will she expand  on that and talk about the challenge of moving from an economy that competes on  the basis of low costs to one that is based on skills and quality? Selective  financial assistance, which is based on attracting people in with grants, is  not sustainable in the longer term.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: It is interesting that the Member should make that point. It is  the same point that I made to a potential Indian investor when I was in India. That  investor asked about tax breaks and corporate tax rules in Northern Ireland.  I answered by saying that investors need to look at Northern Ireland in a  holistic sense, taking account of our skills and our standard of living. We  must acknowledge that real estate here is a lot better value for money than  that in competing areas, such as London, Edinburgh, Dublin or Cardiff. From that  perspective, investment in Northern    Ireland is attractive, but we must encourage  investors to look at it as a whole.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member is right when he says that governance issues are  longer-term considerations than programme and policy issues, which we can deal  with quickly. That is why I wanted a short consultation that would allow us to  get on with things. Invest Northern    Ireland is already dealing with some of  those issues, particularly in the area of innovation and research and  development. The Member may know about a new research and development programme  that was launched last December. That has been welcomed by the business  community in Northern    Ireland. We need to intensify those  programmes, after which we can make progress on the discussion about  governance.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  congratulate the Minister for commissioning the report, and I welcome its  contents. I agree with her comments about the media response, some of which was  hysterical and did not do justice to the good work that Invest Northern Ireland  has done, as well as noting the improvements that need to be made.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The report made a recommendation on improving the way in  which economic policy is developed and co-ordinated in the public sector. Does  the Minister agree that, instead of the three economic policy units that we  have &mdash; one in her Department, one in the Office of the First Minister and  deputy First Minister (OFMDFM) and one in the Department of Finance and  Personnel (DFP) &mdash; it would be desirable to have a single unit, which would be  concentrated in her Department? We could readily achieve that; it would be much  easier than uniting two whole Departments.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Before I ask the Minister to respond, I remind Members to check  that their mobile phones are off. Not only do they disturb every other Member,  they affect the recording equipment in the Chamber.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: The Member has made that point in the Chamber on a number of  occasions. It will come as no surprise to him that the section of the report  that deals with core economic functions is in line with his thinking on this  issue. That is why it makes a point about a single Department of the economy  and a single, permanent subcommittee, which I, as the Minister, would chair. It  also mentions the running-down of the Economic Development Forum (EDF), and  that has not been discussed much. That, in itself, is a significant suggestion,  but it has remained largely under the radar; I am not sure why that has been  the case.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is a need to consider having a focused policy for the  economy. The economy is the centre of our Programme for Government and is our  number one priority. Therefore, all policies that flow from the Programme for  Government should be focused on that goal. We must streamline our approach in  that regard; that is one of the governance issues that Mr Farry mentioned that  will take a little longer to put into practice. However, I am keen to follow up  on it.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I welcome the report and the accelerated consultation period of six weeks,  which I feel to be appropriate. I look forward to the day when Invest NI is  much more than a Belfast-based agency. In fact, I look forward to the day when  it is not just a south- and east-Belfast-based agency, and extends not just  across the North but into north and west Belfast.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I return to the point made by my colleague Mr O&rsquo;Loan. Is it  not the case that, on the Government side of economic policy, too many cooks  spoil the broth? The head of the Civil Service told the SDLP earlier this year  that the responsibilities of the economic policy unit in OFMDFM are recession,  economic response and co-ordination of economic policy under the Programme for  Government. Does the Minister agree that that is duplication of effort, and  that those economic policy responsibilities and economic policy units should  only be part of her office?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: That was a good try by the Member to get me to confirm that.  The economy is a priority across government, as I said in response to his  colleague the Chairperson of the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Investment. It does not  only affect my Department. I accept that there is a lot in the report that  highlights the need to have a focus.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will bring the results of the consultation to the  Executive for a full discussion on that focus, as well as other issues. The  Member can look forward to what I will have to say after I have had that  discussion. He is right in saying that there is a need for a focus in economic policy,  and we will see how that comes out after the consultation.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McFarland</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her statement, and welcome the report. Invest NI was  set up as an amalgamation of IDB and LEDU, with a view to getting away from the  idea of LEDU being a poor relation. In October 2002, IDB and LEDU were  dissolved, and Invest NI unfortunately ended up going towards the old IDB  system.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Does the Minister recognise that this is an opportunity to  refocus Invest NI into an organisation seen by small businesses as being fair  to them? Will the Minister examine the way in which the Belfast Harbour Commissioners  were dealt with? In a previous mandate, there was a similar argument about  whether they should be given economic independence and allowed to float. As she  will see, they have done extremely well out of that freedom.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: I am happy to consider other examples of how organisations have  been dealt with by the Government, and I will take on board the Member&rsquo;s  comments about the Belfast Harbour Commissioners.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the early days of Invest NI, there was more of an emphasis  in getting foreign direct investment (FDI). That was done to try to raise  productivity, but it cannot be done in isolation from the indigenous firms in Northern Ireland.  I realise that, and judging from my conversations with its representatives, so  does Invest NI. I hope that smaller companies will feel a lot more comfortable  dealing with Invest NI. Invest NI has been doing more in that space over the  past two to three years, particularly in some of its programmes. Earlier this  year, I launched the &lsquo;Go for It&rsquo; programme, a growth accelerator programme.  Work in that field is ongoing. I accept that there probably should be more work  in that field, and I will talk to the chief executive of Invest NI about that  in the very near future.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Anderson</strong>:  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat. I apologise to the Minister for not being here at the  beginning of her statement. I was signing a petition outside.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Minister for her statement, and acknowledge that  she set up the review into Invest NI. My opinion is that the Minister got more  than just constructive criticism from its findings. As the report shows, almost  &pound;1 billion of public money was wasted. Almost one third of assistance went to  only 10 companies.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister is exceptionally disappointed at the media  coverage, and that is something that Declan O&rsquo;Loan and the SDLP seem to share  with her. Does the Minister not realise that, if ever there was an issue of  public confidence for the business community, this is it?</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">12.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The review was a damning indictment of Invest NI. Invest NI  rents out empty buildings in my constituency of Foyle, which makes a  contribution to the north-west. Will the Minister take a more robust view of  the findings of the report rather than simply leaving it to the consultation?  That consultation is appreciated, but people want to hear that the Minister  will deal with the recommendations in a robust way. They want Invest NI to have  a better working relationship with small and medium-sized enterprises and the  entire business community, rather than for it to deal with only a small number  of companies.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: I will deal with the recommendations, but I will certainly not  deal with the nonsense that the Member has just talked about &pound;1 billion being  wasted. Some &pound;4&middot;5 billion of investment came on the back of that &pound;1 billion, so  it was not wasted. Is the Member going to turn that investment away? Is she  going to turn away the 28,000 jobs that came from Invest Northern Ireland? Is she  going to turn away the 15,000 jobs that were sustained, particularly in manufacturing  companies? I am disappointed with the Member&rsquo;s comments, because I thought that  we would have a mature debate about the report. It is a balanced report, and I  urge the Member to read it if she has not already had the opportunity to do so.  The report highlights areas of good performance and calls for improvements in  other areas. The panel recognises many areas in which Invest NI has performed  well and pointed out areas in which there is a need for change. I do not know  what sort of message &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Anderson</strong>:  Scandalous.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. The Member has rightly asked the question, but the Member  must allow the Minister to answer that question.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: The Member spoke about Invest NI&rsquo;s concentration on the 10  largest companies, but those companies employ 14,500 people. Is the Member  saying that we should ignore those companies, or is she saying that we should help  them to increase Northern    Ireland&rsquo;s productivity? That is what I want  to do with those companies and, indeed, with all companies. I already said that  there is a need to deal more proactively with smaller companies in the  communities in Northern    Ireland. I will do that, but I will not take  what I have had from the Member today, which is simply not true.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member knows how hard Invest Northern Ireland works  on issues in her constituency, particularly the jobs at Stream. I am  disappointed with the Member&rsquo;s comments about Invest Northern Ireland, given that it is doing everything that  it can to bring work to that company in Londonderry.  I will deal with the recommendations based on what is in the report and not on  what others would like me to think is in the report.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Spratt</strong>: I  apologise for not being here for the start of the Minister&rsquo;s statement. The  report contains some radical recommendations. Did the panel fully consider the  views of the business community during its deliberations?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: The board had a good ongoing consultation relationship with the  business community. The panel comprised some experienced businessmen, something  which the press seems to have overlooked. The panel also frequently bounced  ideas about the recommendations off a practitioners&rsquo; panel. I am pleased to say  that the panel has spoken to and engaged with the business community and that  it will continue to do that during the consultation period.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for her  statement, and I welcome the approach to the consultation. Consultation and,  indeed, consultation within a short time span is important. We must send the  message that Executive Ministers can address such issues.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to express my disappointment about one matter. The  report is supported by extensive research and consultation, so would this  consultation not have benefited from the Minister&rsquo;s commentary on the report&rsquo;s  recommendations? That would have shortened the consultation process. The report  will have to be brought back to the Executive and the Assembly, and it seems  that, at this stage, we are over-consulting on a printed document. The  Minister&rsquo;s comments would have added substantially to the value of the public  consultation. The Minister may wish to comment on that.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: I imagine that anyone listening to the debate will hear my  comments and know my feelings on a wide range of issues. However, I am not  going to be prescriptive; I want to hear what others have to say about the  report. As I said, the report contains a lot of information, and, if Members  wish to speak to me about any aspect of it before the close of the consultation  period, I will make myself available. However, it is important to have a short  consultation period to take on board views from the business community and  other stakeholders.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: That concludes questions to the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment on her  statement.</p>
    <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="2"></a>Committee Business</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Employment Bill</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Extension of Committee Stage</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Employment and Learning (Ms S Ramsey)</strong>: I beg to move</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That, in accordance with Standing Order 33(4), the period  referred to in Standing Order 33(2) be extended to 9 November 2009, in relation  to the Committee Stage of the Employment Bill [NIA Bill 9/08].</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. The motion is  self-explanatory. The Employment Bill had its Second Stage on 30 June 2009 and  was referred to the Committee on 1 July. The Bill has eight clauses and two  schedules, which Members discussed at Second Stage. Some of the Bill&rsquo;s  provisions will amend the Employment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Order 1981,  which enhances the Department&rsquo;s powers to investigate and prosecute serious  offences by unscrupulous employment agencies. It also provides for amendments  to the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 and the Industrial Relations Order 1992.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At its meeting on 16 September, the Committee agreed to ask  for an extension to Committee Stage purely because the Assembly and society are  looking at the possibility of a swine flu pandemic, and Committee members are  concerned that we will not be able to reach a quorum. We know that the Bill is  important. The Committee has been working closely with the Department on the  Bill, and we want to ensure that an extension of Committee Stage is available  if needed. We are determined that the extension will be used only if other  issues emerge that are beyond our control. I ask the Assembly to support the  Committee&rsquo;s request for an extension of Committee Stage, which we will use  wisely.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That, in accordance with Standing Order 33(4), the period  referred to in Standing Order 33(2) be extended to 9 November 2009, in relation  to the Committee Stage of the Employment Bill [NIA Bill 9/08].</p>
    <p class="H5StageHeading"><a name="3"></a>Housing (Amendment) Bill</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Extension of Committee Stage</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Social Development (Mr Hamilton)</strong>: I beg to move</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That, in accordance with Standing Order 33(4), the period  referred to in Standing Order 33(2) be extended to 1 December 2009, in relation  to the Committee Stage of the Housing (Amendment) Bill [NIA Bill 7/08].</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Housing (Amendment) Bill had its Second Stage on 23  June 2009. As part of Committee Stage, the Committee for Social Development  received more than 40 written responses and heard oral evidence from 10 key  stakeholder organisations. Committee members have indicated that they very much  approve of a number of the Bill&rsquo;s provisions; for example, they have welcomed a  statutory requirement on the Housing Executive to produce a homelessness  strategy and provide related advice. Despite Members wishing to see that part  of the legislation move forward, the Committee asks for a little extra time to  consider related issues such as eligibility for homelessness assistance and contentious  issues such as the proposed changes to the definition of a house in multiple  occupation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">To allow sufficient time for the Committee to consider the  views that were expressed and to compile its report on the Bill, I ask the  House to support the brief extension of the Committee Stage of the Housing  (Amendment) Bill to 1 December 2009.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That, in accordance with Standing Order 33(4), the period  referred to in Standing Order 33(2) be extended to 1 December 2009, in relation  to the Committee Stage of the Housing (Amendment) Bill [NIA Bill 7/08].</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading"><a name="4"></a>Forestry Bill</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Extension of Committee Stage</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy  Chairperson of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development (Mr Elliott)</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That, in accordance with Standing Order 33(4), the period  referred to in Standing Order 33(2) be extended to 2 March 2010, in relation to  the Committee Stage of the Forestry Bill [NIA Bill 11/08].</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On behalf of the Committee, I seek the approval of the  House for an extension to the Bill&rsquo;s Committee Stage. To many Members, the  deadline may seem generous, but I assure the House that the Committee gave the matter  considerable thought before deciding on 2 March 2010 as a realistic target. If  the Committee can complete its formal scrutiny of the proposed Bill sooner, it  will, of course, do so.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Committee staff and officials from the Department have met  already to discuss the logistics of progressing the Bill, and that contact will  continue throughout the process. The chief executive of the Forest Service has discussed  the length of the extension with the Committee Clerk and has agreed to it. As  the Committee is not permitted to return to the House to ask for a second  extension, it is essential to get deliberations right in the first instance.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Given that the current legislation is more than 50 years  old, the Committee welcomes the opportunity to scrutinise it. Members will  recall, however, that great concern was expressed that the Bill does not go far  enough in respect of the social, economic and environmental benefits that could  be accrued. Stakeholders have been continuing to contact the Committee almost  daily. It is, therefore, right for the Committee to give stakeholders&rsquo; views  appropriate consideration.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The consideration of a Bill at Committee Stage involves  several logistical issues. The Committee must consult on the Bill, as must the  Department, and a public notice to that effect will be placed this week. In  contrast to the Department, however, the Committee must also consider any written  responses, decide which witnesses to call and hear their evidence. In addition,  it must examine the Bill clause by clause before producing a draft report. The  Committee intends to issue that report to the Department for consideration,  after which it must be printed before being laid in the Business Office and,  ultimately, considered by the House.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Given the importance of the Bill, the Committee feels  strongly that all those stages cannot be completed within the period defined in  Standing Order 33(2), particularly as the Assembly will be in recess for part  of that period. Given the amount of consideration that is required, the length  of the extension is realistic.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That, in accordance with Standing Order 33(4), the period  referred to in Standing Order 33(2) be extended to 2 March 2010, in relation to  the Committee Stage of the Forestry Bill [NIA Bill 11/08].</p>
    <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="5"></a>Private Members&rsquo; Business</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Grammar School Entrance Tests</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to one hour and 30  minutes for the debate. The proposer of the motion will have 10 minutes to  propose and 10 minutes in which to make a winding-up speech. All other Members  who wish to speak will have five minutes. One amendment has been selected and  published on the Marshalled List. The proposer of the amendment will have 10  minutes to propose and five minutes in which to make a winding-up speech.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly requests that the Minister of Education  establishes a statutory framework for the grammar school entrance tests,  effective from the beginning of the academic year 2010-11; and recommends that  this statutory framework should remain in place until the Council for the  Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment devises, pilots and introduces literacy  and numeracy tests compatible with the curriculum, alongside a robust pupil  profile, allowing academic criteria to have a role in the post-primary transfer  process.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Undoubtedly, some Members will be reflecting on the fact  that today&rsquo;s debate is the fifth on the subject. Given all the excitement  outside at the Prime Minister&rsquo;s arrival for discussions on policing and justice  and the speculation on how the deputy First Minister and First Minister are  getting on and on how the issues can be resolved and whether there will be an  election, Members may wonder whether the debate is relevant. However, in my  opinion, this is the issue that the people of Northern Ireland are talking about.  When we go out and meet people in our constituencies, they say that this is the  issue that they are concerned about.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">12.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is no surprise that the &lsquo;Belfast Telegraph&rsquo; has launched  a petition that urges all of us to come together and find a solution because,  put simply, the situation at which we have arrived is the worst of all possible  worlds. It satisfies no one, it puts huge stress on children and it takes an  awful lot of time away from teachers and headmasters, who, others will argue,  could be doing something else. In addressing this issue, one could consider  having a rant and a rave. I have been known to do such things in the past.  However, we are now at the stage at which we need considered reflection about  what we can do to find a way forward for our children and the people of Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to highlight the fact that we agree on many issues.  Although I am happy for people to take issue with what I say, we share the  common objectives of trying to tackle educational underachievement. We want to  increase social mobility, and we want people who are from not-so-favourable  backgrounds to be better educated, get better jobs and be better paid. Let us  lift everybody up. We want to eradicate poverty, which is one of the key issues  facing this Administration. Education is the only enduring competitive  advantage. We want to prepare our young people for their futures and for an economy  that is, of course, uncertain. The only certainty that we can give them is the  basis on which to compete.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We also have a common understanding of how we could address  those issues and of what it takes to make that a reality. There is consensus on  the basis of early intervention, even in the pre-primary sector. There is  consensus in the House on the importance of primary school education and the  critical role of good teaching. We have some of the best teachers in the world;  we certainly have excellent teacher training colleges. We agree about the huge  impact of head teachers as the overarching people who are responsible for  improving standards and giving our young people the future that they deserve. I  do not think that anybody here will disagree about the importance of parental  support. What a difference that makes to children in making their way through  life.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, we agree on the need for change. If there is  one certainty in this world, it is that change will happen. We also agree on  academic excellence. We want our young people to do as well as possible. We  support extended schools. All of us agree on the importance of the STEM  subjects. We recognise the importance of language skills and the benefits of  learning communities.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Members will highlight different issues. On the diversity  of provision, there are people in this House who will argue for the  Irish-medium sector. There are those who will argue for the integrated sector.  Others will argue for faith-based schools, and there are also people who will  argue for some form of academies. That shows that one size does not fit all. It  is most important that we find a way of giving our young people the best start  in life. Of course, that will require some form of area-based planning, whereby  we try to accommodate all of those issues.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We recognise all of that. We are together, and we agree  that we should try to find a way forward. At the risk of agreeing all day, we  even agree on where the challenges lie. We agree that there is a challenge in  respect of empty desks. We agree that falling rolls will put severe pressure on  the financing of some of our schools. We understand the difficulties of  maintaining and funding small rural schools, which make up a significant  proportion of our school estate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We acknowledge the strain on our head teachers, which is  due to excessive bureaucracy, red tape and overheads and which detracts from  their ability to do the job that they want to do. We agree about the iniquity  of funding delays that lead to schools not being built on time, and we know  about the financing challenges. I guess that we even agree about maximising  autonomy where possible at school level, if that is a school&rsquo;s wish.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">So where does the problem lie? If we agree on all those  issues, why is it not possible to get together and resolve them? The Ulster  Unionist Party has identified four issues, which it puts on the table in the  hope that the House will consider them and resolve to address them. There is a  difference of opinion about cause and effect. In the past, the Minister has  argued that the 11-plus, transfer test or whatever terminology one wishes to  use causes social inequalities and that it is iniquitous and unfair. There are  other arguments, not least of which is that the tests do not create inequalities,  rather, they reflect inequalities.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCrea</strong>:  If the Member is brief.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  I notice the growing warmth in the relationship between the Member&rsquo;s party and  the Tory Party. Consequently, does the Member agree with the Tory skills  spokesperson, David Willetts, who said:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;academic selection entrenches advantage, it does not  spread it&rdquo;?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I am grateful to Mr Bradley for bringing that matter up. In fact, I rather  hoped to engender some warmth between the UUP and the SDLP, because these are  devolved matters that we must discuss and find a solution to.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  So you do not agree with him.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Mr Deputy Speaker, I only have a certain amount of time &mdash; 10 minutes &mdash; so I  cannot deal with barracking. If Members want a solution, instead of making  cheap party-political points, they should consider the reality of the situation  that faces our children and their role in tackling it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Some people are not being represented. Parents who want to  send their children to particular schools are not finding support in this  House. The Minister says that my party is resisting change, but nothing could  be further from the truth. We know that change is essential; we embrace and  welcome it, and we want to see it. I want to tell the Minister that we are all  free to change our minds and choose a different future; some of us may even  want to choose a different past. I look to the Minister to see whether she is  prepared to engage in finding a solution to this problem, because, if she is,  she will find that the people of Northern Ireland will welcome it  with open arms.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I hear people speak about an equality issue. Everybody  wants equality, which is a word like &ldquo;justice&rdquo;. Everybody wants justice.  Equality is a meaningless term unless it is further defined. Equality for whom?  Equality in what? What is it that those people want to achieve? We are seeking  equity. At the end of the day, the UUP&rsquo;s fundamental position is that parental  choice is the bedrock of all democracy. We do not like the iniquity of our  children having to do five separate tests. Those who wanted to get rid of the  11-plus seem to have ended up with two tests. That cannot be the way forward.  Those who want to keep the existing system need to ensure that it is regulated  &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member should draw his remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  The UUP motion helps to do that, so I urge Members to support it.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>: I  beg to move the following amendment: Leave out all after &ldquo;Education&rdquo; and insert</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;instructs the Council for Curriculum Examinations and Assessment  to complete, pilot and introduce a literacy and numeracy test based on the  revised curriculum to be available to all schools in time for the 2010-2011  academic year, to be used alongside pupil profiles as one of the criteria for  post-primary transfer, for one year only pending an agreed solution following  inter-party talks.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I listened with interest to the proposer of the motion  speak to the motion for about the last 60 seconds of his speech; the rest  seemed to be a wide-ranging review of the education system in Northern Ireland.  Unusually, I find that I agree with much of what he said. I agree that it is  the fifth time that we have discussed this matter, and that this remains the  main issue that we face on the doorstep, if we perhaps leave aside the economy.  The most important issue is not policing and justice. This is much more  important to parents.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member spoke about social mobility, and I agree with  the various points that he raised. However, the motion is not about that: it is  about trying to legitimise the breakaway actions of the AQE and the grammar  schools. If I were involved in that movement, I would be glad to see legal  cover created by the Department of Education to protect me and my actions.  However, I am not involved in that, and as the AQE has sown so shall it reap. I  can well imagine the Minister&rsquo;s response to that request.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion also seeks to extend indefinitely the system of  academic selection. People can dress it up whatever way they like, but the  motion calls for the present grammar school tests to be legitimised and  extended for another year, while the Council for the Curriculum, Examinations  and Assessment comes up with an ongoing test. The Alliance Party proposed that on  the fourth occasion on which this matter was debated, in March. We proposed  that such a situation should be allowed to exist for two years, to give a  chance for the various parties and interests involved to hold further  concentrated talks to try to do something about the mess that we find ourselves  in. That suggestion was not taken up by the Minister or her party. For various  reasons, it was taken up by other parties represented in the Chamber but not  because they supported the Alliance Party&rsquo;s thinking on the issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly has been down this road so many times that the  outcome of today&rsquo;s debate is entirely predictable. The Ulster Unionist Party&rsquo;s  motion will probably be agreed to because it has the support of the two main  unionist parties. The Alliance Party&rsquo;s amendment, which merely seeks to  reinforce what it put forward in March, will certainly fail. Neither of those  decisions will be in any way binding on the Department or the Minister. I am  sure that the Minister will not change her position, and I do not see why she  should in the present circumstances. By way of response, we will probably hear  from the Minister of Education a speech very similar to that which she gave  during the last couple of debates on this subject. The Minister shares the  characteristic of Mrs Thatcher in that she is &ldquo;not for turning&rdquo;. I do not  expect her to turn now.</p>
    <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Dallat] in the Chair)</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The way forward on this subject is not through private Members&rsquo;  motions. I hesitate to call them irrelevant, but that is really what they are.  They will change nothing. Last week and the week before, the &lsquo;Belfast  Telegraph&rsquo; has drummed up support for its &ldquo;Sort it Out&rdquo; campaign. The Alliance  Party has called for all-party talks, and Mr McCrea also supported that idea.  Every party represented in the Chamber has expressed an interest in all-party  talks. I do not mean that the Education Committee should set aside time to talk  about this. The Committee does not have time to spend on this. However,  individual spokespersons, in a different forum, with support from senior party  figures, could make time and try to do something about this. It is the only way  forward.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in is not keen on participating in such talks.  However, I plead with that party, if not the Minister or Department, to  participate. I do not see what harm it would do to its cause by coming to the  table and putting its case along with the other parties. I encourage Sinn F&eacute;in  to think again about that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We often hear about the needs of the children. Mr McCrea  referred to that eloquently today, and this is all about the needs of the  children. As usual, the children are being left aside in this debate. This  year&rsquo;s P7s are going through a process that is disgraceful. The impasse should  never have got to this point.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">One point of view is to blame the Minister&rsquo;s intransigence;  another is to blame the actions of the AQE and the grammar schools. We can  blame whomever we want, but we have a situation in which kids of a tender age  are being put through the process, and that is simply not right.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">1.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Children in P7 are being asked to sit variable tests in  varying venues that are strange to them, probably on Saturdays. There is a  question of whether their families can afford for them to be coached or  prepared for those tests. Clearly, families with money will be able to afford  such coaching; those without money will not. I fail to see where the equality  is in that. The situation is putting enormous pressure on primary-school  teachers and, in particular, head teachers, who are under pressure from the  Department not to permit coaching and from parents to do exactly the opposite.  I expect that most of them will serve the needs of the pupils, and, from their  point of view, I cannot blame them. When Members say that it is &ldquo;all about the  children&rdquo;, it has a hollow ring, because this is the fifth time in a couple of  years that we are debating the issue, and we are no further forward.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Various bodies speak against academic selection; certainly,  the Alliance Party is in that section of society, as are most of the teaching  unions, the Churches, and academic professionals. I cannot identify many bodies  or, numerically, many people who still want to cling to an outdated system.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to read from a resolution passed by the Belfast  Synod of the Methodist Church in Ireland, which I expect that the  spokesperson has received in the past few days. It states:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;It is the opinion of the Synod that the current  impasse regarding the method of transfer from primary to secondary schools is a  national disgrace. The Synod also is of a clear mind that the division and  labelling of children as academic and non-academic at the age of 11 is erroneous,  outmoded and self-defeating. It is the view of the Synod that much excellent  research carried out through the years, not least in Craigavon.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The Dickson plan that operates there is the example  to work on. When the Committee for Education visited Craigavon and the Dickson  plan was explained to it, it found favour with, I think, every party, not  necessarily to simply accept it as is, but as a terrific model to work forward.  However, it has been ignored.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The resolution continues that the:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Synod remains deeply concerned that the present  system of transfer has resulted in an appalling poverty of aspiration among  many sections of our community, with the consequential waste of latent skills  and talents, these remaining untapped.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The word &ldquo;synod&rdquo; could be replaced with unions,  teaching professionals, various political parties, and, I believe, no matter  what the polls say, the majority of parents.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Here we are again on the merry-go-round. I am glad that Mr  Basil McCrea gave us a reasoned explanation of his party&rsquo;s thinking, rather  than a rant. However, nothing has changed. The Ulster Unionist Party wants to  reinstate and extend academic selection; society and the world have moved on.  For that reason, I propose the amendment, with no expectation that it will be accepted.  We will be opposing the motion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education (Mr Storey)</strong>: Following on from the comments  of Mr Lunn, who is a member of the Committee, I assure him and the House that  the Committee for Education took time to consider this particular issue. I want  to place on the record, as the Committee&rsquo;s Chairperson, the consideration that  the Committee gave to what it saw as a very important issue and, of course, to  the concerns that were raised with it about an unregulated system.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On 20 February this year, the Committee for Education  agreed that I, as Chairperson of the Committee, should write to the Minister to  request that she reconsider the use of the CCEA-commissioned test as an interim  compromise arrangement, with no conditions attached. The Committee&rsquo;s letter,  which is on the Assembly website, highlighted that there were concerns across  the board that an unregulated system of transfer was not the preferred option.  At that time, the Schools Transfer Option for Pupils (STOP) group of primary 6  parents petitioned the Committee and the Minister to the effect that an  unregulated system of transfer was the least desirable outcome for children,  parents and schools, and that the only immediate solution was for the Minister  of Education to reinstate an interim CCEA exam to be adopted by all schools  that proposed to introduce their own exam.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At the time, the Committee also highlighted to the Minister  that the Northern Ireland Commission for Catholic Education, the Catholic Heads  Association and the Governing Bodies Association had recently made it clear  that they were concerned by an unregulated system of transfer, and stated that  some interim solution using the test commissioned from CCEA was necessary to  allow time to develop a properly regulated transfer system. The Minister came  to a Committee meeting on 10 March 2009, however, and, shortly after her  arrival, said:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;There will not be a CCEA test.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I recall the Minister using similar words on 24  March 2009, when responding to an Alliance  motion, which has been referred to. She said:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The train has left the station. Transfer 2010 is  departmental policy.&rdquo; <span style="font-style:normal; ">[Official  Report, Vol 39, No 5, p253, col 2].</span></p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">To end my comments as Chairperson of the Committee for Education,  it is right to inform the House that the Education Committee received a  delegation from all five teachers&rsquo; unions at a meeting on 17 June at which they  expressed their grave concerns in relation to transfer 2010 arrangements and  called for agreement on the transfer process.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will use the time that I have remaining to speak as a  private Member, and I will be as brief as I can, given the time that has been  allotted to me.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We require a lot longer to deal with this issue. I agree  with what Basil McCrea said: the most important issue facing Northern Ireland  is not the devolution of policing and justice; it is the need to maintain and  protect an educational system for the future of which all of us can be proud.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have a Minister who has consistently refused to change.  I could almost write her speech. She will talk about how many times the DUP has  refused to discuss the issue at Executive meetings, and she will go over the  same rhetoric as she always does. I remind Members that almost 13,000 parents  in this country have decided that, for the best interests of their child, he or  she will go to a school that sets an entrance test. They have made that choice  because there are parents, professionals and educationalists in society who  believe in the merit of having academic assessment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will be fair and honest and admit that there are also people  &mdash; even those whom I have met over time &mdash; who say that there is no justification  for having academic criteria for selection purposes. However, the reality is  that Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s Martin McGuinness, the Assembly&rsquo;s first Education Minister,  and Caitr&iacute;ona Ruane, the second, have refused to listen to what people are  saying.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I ask the Member to bring his remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education</strong>: That is the reality. It is unfortunate that  Members have only five minutes in which to speak on an issue that is of such  importance.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education</strong>: I assure the Minister that if she thinks  that this issue is over and done with, she has another thing coming.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member had five minutes and 14 seconds in which to speak.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs O&rsquo;Neill</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. As the proposer of the motion  said, this is the fifth time that the House has debated academic selection. I  am not sure how many of those five debates have been proposed by the Ulster  Unionist Party in an attempt to hold on to a system that has failed so many children  in the past. That system protects a select number of children, and to hell with  the rest.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs O&rsquo;Neill</strong>:  Is it a point of order?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  No. Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs O&rsquo;Neill</strong>:  Yes.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  Members from the opposition have repeatedly referred to the issue of failure  and the fact that that failure is proven. Indeed, the Minister has made the  same point in her official statements. However, there is no empirical evidence  that clearly demonstrates a link between transfer and underachievement. Where  is the evidence?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Will the Member please moderate her language?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs O&rsquo;Neill</strong>:  I thank the Member for his intervention, but I remind him that Sinn F&eacute;in is not  the opposition; it is part of a coalition Government.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in is committed to ensuring that no child will be  disadvantaged and that no child will be left behind while others are nurtured  to achieve. It wants to ensure that every child in the education system  receives all the support that he or she needs to achieve his or her best. It  appears from the UUP&rsquo;s contribution that that party is totally ignoring  society&rsquo;s position on academic selection. The mentality and sentiment behind  its motion appears to be one of burying its head in the sand.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I recently met with a number of primary-school principals,  and the mood among primary-school principals and teachers is one of wanting to  get on with the new system. They support the direction of travel that the  Minister has presented in transfer 2010. Furthermore, they want to get on with  teaching the curriculum, so that all children will be prepared to enter the  next level of education, having been taught right to the end of primary 7,  without the interference of having to teach according to the requirements of a  test. Primary schools are happy to be divorced from the selection process, and  it is time for the Ulster Unionist Party to wake up and realise that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion refers to the establishment of a statutory  framework, and its proposer discussed the various areas on which we have  agreement. I remind him that the Minister agreed to commission a test for three  years, on a phasing-out basis, as a compromise way forward. However, despite  numerous engagements throughout the education sector and the tabling of those  proposals at the Executive, the parties refused to discuss them. That left a  need for decisive action, and decisive action was taken.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  The fact that the Minister envisaged, quite rightly, a temporary testing period  and then withdrew that suggestion gave rise to a non-regulated system, which  has caused great anxiety to many parents. Does the Member agree that the  Minister made a mistake in doing that and that she should have persevered with  that approach to get through the transition period?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs O&rsquo;Neill</strong>:  I thank the Member for his intervention, but I do not agree with him. When the  Minister put that compromise proposal &mdash; it was a clear compromise &mdash; on the  table, she gave it a definitive end date. It was a three-year period in which  to phase out testing. That proposal would have allowed people time to adjust,  but there was no agreement on it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Everyone would prefer a regulated system, but, as there was  no agreement on the compromise proposals, we had to move forward, and the  Minister had to publish her transfer 2010 guidance, which, if followed by all  schools, will create a more effective and fair system of post-primary transfer.  When that guidance is coupled with the other changes in education, such as  area-based planning and the entitlement framework, the future looks bright for  all children in the education system. In its tenure in the Department of  Education, Sinn F&eacute;in will ensure that no child is disadvantaged.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Alliance Party&rsquo;s amendment calls for the introduction  of a test for one year. I listened very carefully to the proposer of that  amendment, and it is a genuine attempt at a constructive way forward. However,  it ignores the political reality that, to date, there has been no agreement  between the parties and that they are entrenched in their positions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mervyn Storey said that he could predict what the Minister  would say at the conclusion of today&rsquo;s debate and that what she would say would  be all rhetoric. However, there is rhetoric across the board, because all  Members will say the same things that we have heard so many times before.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs O&rsquo;Neill</strong>:  No. I am just about to finish.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">1.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Alliance Party&rsquo;s amendment says that a CCEA test will  allow for a solution following inter-party talks. However, that has been tried  and tested and has failed. Numerous attempts have been made to move forward and  seek agreement with Executive colleagues, but they are unwilling to look at  that. We need an education system that is fit for purpose and fit for the twenty-first  century, based on meeting the needs of all children in a fair, open and  transparent manner. The vast majority of schools support the Minister&rsquo;s  position. Sinn F&eacute;in will not be deterred in what it has to do and it will be  opposing the motion and the amendment.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. It is well known that the  SDLP sees academic selection as educationally unsound and socially  unacceptable. However, we realise that movement from one system to another  cannot be done overnight and requires a planned and structured transition so  that parents, teachers, pupils and schools know the various steps involved.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  Will the Member clarify something that has been confusing me for a long time? I  am not hard to confuse, but how does the Member marry what he has already said  with the grammar schools in his constituency in the city of Newry, which he  knows well? Has he now bought into the vision of the bishops, which is to bring  those schools under their control if they get their way with the ESA Bill? We  will come to that debate very soon. Where does the Member stand in relation to  those schools that have a very defined grammar ethos? Has he dumped them  because it is politically convenient to do so?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I remind Members that interventions should be short and to the  point. Members have only five minutes in which to speak.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Of course I value the contribution to education made by all the schools in my  constituency, both selective and non-selective. However, many selective schools  now realise that their position is untenable in the future and are beginning to  make arrangements to admit a wider range of ability. That will happen not  overnight but gradually, and I welcome that very much.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I was saying before Mr Storey intervened, the  non-binding guidelines from the Minister have created difficulties for both  primary and post-primary schools. Already, I see evidence that accommodation  addresses are being used to help pupils to get into some non-selective schools  rather than others. That situation will only get worse, and it will add to the  pressure on schools that have to police that situation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister and her colleagues abolished the 11-plus, but  they did so without any clear and planned process of transition. Our duty as  politicians is to protect children from an unregulated system and to ensure  that their needs are met through a planned process of transition. A firm and  acceptable solution will be found only when all parties agree on a long-term vision  for the future of education in the North.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As Basil McCrea pointed out, there is already agreement on  major issues, and we must take the further step. The SDLP wants an education  system, based on fairness and equality, that guarantees parental choice. It  wants to see high academic standards maintained in schools. Patterns of  investment in education need to be reassessed, and massive investment must be  made to raise standards in all schools. Reform of our education system takes  time. The argument should not only be about deciding how our children transfer  from primary school, it should involve long-term investment and significant  restructuring of our whole education system to meet the demands of the  twenty-first century.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We need to ensure that pupils leaving school do so with  qualifications in the subjects that our economy needs, and which will be the  basis for the skills needed to create the wealth that will improve the lives of  all our citizens. The context for change is education reform, yet area-based  planning has not been developed to the extent needed, and, although local  learning communities have done good work, there is much that needs to be done.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In March, the SDLP put forward sensible proposals to avoid  imminent chaos and to provide certainty for primary-7 pupils. Had our proposals  been supported, the current confusion and stresses for pupils and parents could  have been avoided. The educator-led group that we proposed would not be tasked  with finding a short-term solution; it would be asked to assess all available  solutions for achieving compromise in the context of long-term development of  our education system, taking into account the future needs and demands that  will be placed on our schools. Such a solution would give us a framework for  the future delivery of an education system that is based on non-selective  transfer and achieving excellence for all.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The four main Churches backed a proposal similar to ours.  We still believe that it is the only sensible solution to have been proposed,  and we urge parties to back our proposals. We also encourage them to outline  their proposals for a way forward &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member must bring his remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  &mdash; on the basis of all-party talks to break the deadlock.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We ask the Alliance Party to clarify its amendment.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Will it mean that all schools use a transfer test? Will any school be allowed  to select its full intake by testing?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>:  Sorry: the Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  If we receive answers to those questions &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I call Miss Michelle McIlveen.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  &mdash; we will consider supporting the amendment.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Miss McIlveen</strong>:  One would think that we would have learned by now that the Minister is  operating on the &ldquo;Caitr&iacute;ona knows best&rdquo; principle, despite the will of Members,  schools, both controlled and Catholic maintained, and the people. I am not in  the business of defending the Ulster Unionist Party, which is fit to defend  itself, but perhaps it is not the Members who tabled the motion who have their  heads in the sand, but the Minister.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Despite this being the fifth occasion on which we have  debated transfer, any debate on this vital subject should always be welcomed  and should not be dismissed, as it keeps the issue firmly on the agenda. It has  not gone away, and it is imperative that the Minister is constantly reminded of  that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have told the Minister of our wish for parental choice,  and that we want a three-year interim CCEA-run transfer test. We have even  reminded her of the position of the Catholic maintained schools that have opted  for the unregulated test. Now, we are in a position where children have signed  up to it and are ready to sit those unregulated tests. As I, and others, have  said before, it is not the chaos that some had predicted, but it is far from  ideal. I have always been of the view that a permanent solution needs to be  reached regarding post-primary transfer, but that solution requires the wishes  of those who want to retain academic selection to be respected.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Lunn was unable to quantify the people who wish to  retain academic selection in Northern Ireland, but today there are  approximately 13,000 children signed up and ready to sit the transfer test this  autumn.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  Does the Member also accept that the Minister repeatedly talks about a minority  &mdash; I am sure that we will hear it today &mdash; and states that she will not be held  to ransom by that minority? She makes derogatory comments about the grammar  sector. Does the Member agree with me that that sector educates 42% of children  in post-primary schools? That is certainly a lot more pupils than are educated  in the Irish-medium sector, which is on the decline, despite what the Minister  tells us.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Miss McIlveen</strong>:  I agree with the comments made by Mr Storey. That statistic should set the  alarm bells ringing with the Minister that her vision is not shared by a  sizeable proportion of this year&rsquo;s cohort. It tells me that parents want  equality of opportunity, not equality of outcome. Equality of opportunity  brings out the best, whereas equality of outcome suppresses it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As Basil McCrea said, we found ourselves in the middle of a  campaign by a regional newspaper asking us to find a solution. It is unfortunate  that the &lsquo;Belfast Telegraph&rsquo; has used such emotive headlines urging us to &ldquo;sort  out transfer chaos&rdquo;, but it is good that it has decided to keep the matter in  the public domain. Sadly, the newspaper has not been brave enough to express a  viewpoint or to point the finger of blame where it truly belongs: it decided to  tar all Members with the same brush.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Miss McIlveen</strong>:  No, I do not have much time.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The majority of Members are willing to discuss the subject  in a logical and measured manner. However, one party is not willing to sort out  the issue. That party is burdened by ideological dogma, and it is the one party  that did not sign the &lsquo;Belfast Telegraph&rsquo; petition. That tells us everything  that we need to know about the political will that is needed to obtain a  resolution.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The DUP has sought to be constructive in its contributions  to the debate on academic selection. We believe that a solution can be obtained  if political dogma is left at the door. If the criticisms that were made about  the old 11-plus test were dealt with, a way could surely be found to resolve  matters.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have sympathy with the Alliance Party amendment, because  inter-party talks and, ultimately, agreement, are the only way forward.  However, it is up to the Minister to set aside her prejudices, and, for the  good of parents, pupils and the education system in general, to provide a  greater degree of stability and certainty by allowing a CCEA-regulated test in  the interim. On previous occasions, the Minister has made it clear that such a  test is possible. It would be a sign of goodwill and of a willingness to seek  consensus on her part if she were to take the next logical step and announce  the introduction of a CCEA-regulated test for 2010-2011.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The absence of any movement on the Minister&rsquo;s part will  signal that she does not care what anyone thinks, believes or wants and that  she is happy for the current situation to continue. She has talked about  seeking consensus. Now is the time for her to walk the walk, not just talk the  talk.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have concerns about the motion and the amendment regarding  the role of pupil profiling. However, I support the motion as it stands.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I wonder whether I will get my  name in the &lsquo;Belfast Telegraph&rsquo; if I mention it. Some people have no  self-respect.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am surprised that the SDLP criticised the Ulster Unionist  Party motion, because the SDLP tabled a similar motion on the no-day-named  list, calling for the reintroduction of a test. That is a mistake &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>: I  will not. I will let the Member in later.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Alliance Party amendment is well meaning. The  difficulty with the entire debate is that people who are well meaning and who  wish to be constructive are being used. They are being used by a very effective  lobby that comes from certain grammar schools. The top-level, elitist grammar  schools are using all their influence, whether through the media or through the  Chamber, to lobby for the return of the 11-plus.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The issue is not about introducing a CCEA test for one, two  or three years; it is about bringing back the 11-plus. The debate has been  going on not only for the past 18 months or since the time when Martin  McGuinness was the Minister of Education but for 50 years. For 50 years, there  has been a strong lobby and an educational argument in favour of removing  selection at age 11. However, on every occasion that selection was about to be  removed, the grammar schools got an eleventh-hour reprieve and the 11-plus was  saved. I have lost count of the number of people over the years who told me  that they would be the last to sit the 11-plus. There was always another year  after that, another year after that, and so on. Listen to this: there will not  be another one. The 11-plus is gone, and it will not return.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  If what the Member is saying is the case, then we are to assume that the  Minister will not budge or bend to lobbies. What budging and bending did the  Minister do to the Catholic bishops during the summer in relation to control of  their schools, which they felt that they would lose? Will the Member provide  detail of that lobbying and how successful it was?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  When the Member comes to discuss the Education Bill, to which that matter  refers, I will be more than happy to discuss the issue. He will realise that  issues around control of schools affect all sectors not only the Catholic  Church.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">1.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will return to the subject of the debate. The other part  of the motion that disturbs me is pupil profiling. Mr McCrea and the Ulster  Unionist Party tell us that they have been out talking to sectors, parents and  teachers. Obviously, they have not talked to primary school teachers. Again and  again, the primary school sector has said that it will not be involved in pupil  profiling. Therefore, from where will pupil profiling come? That matter has  been ruled out already; not just by the Minister and Sinn F&eacute;in, but by the  teachers who would be involved in that process.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>: A  number of people have asked me to give way.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is a chance for a new beginning for education. Those  well-meaning groups and parties in the Assembly need to focus on that. Although  it comes naturally in the cut and thrust of political debate, they must remove  their political bias and look at the end goal. There is an opportunity to move  education forward. Such well-meaning motions and amendments only give succour  to the grammar school sector. Attention must be focused on the small number of  grammar schools that have insisted that they will continue with academic selection.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It has been claimed that 12,000 to 13,000 pupils are  prepared to sit the test. There has been some double-counting. However,  regardless of how many sit the test, it has not been mentioned that, of those,  say, 12,000 pupils, 5,000 will be told that they are not wanted by those  schools. They will be told that they have failed. For those children, a wee  letter will drop onto the mat that will tell them that they are failures at 10  years of age. Does the Assembly want that situation to continue?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Will education be an event or a process? Sinn F&eacute;in believes  that it is a process. Therefore, let us focus on where attention is needed: on  that small group of grammar schools which, in the past, used its influence in  the corridors of powers to ensure that change did not come. It is now time to  stand up to them and say that change has come, the 11-plus is gone and will not  return. Those schools need to realise that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The rest of society has moved on. The Catholic maintained  sector has said that it will remove academic selection within two years. That  is progress, and it shows that the process is moving. I have no doubt that  there will be resistance to that. However, as regards the entitlement  framework, area planning and all that goes with it, schools that sit out on  their own will no longer be able to survive. They will not be able to provide  the wide range of courses that is required to produce the talent and skills  that are needed in the twenty-first century economy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, the ball is rolling down the hill. Change is  here. Let us stop throwing lifelines to the grammar school sector. Let us not  be dissuaded by the latest editorial in one of the Belfast morning newspapers,  which has been pro-selection all along. Let us stand up to them and say that,  after 50 years, the game is up. It is over. There will be no more selection; no  more testing children at 10 and 11 years of age. Let us move forward to an  education system that brings the best outcomes for all children.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member must bring his remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>: I  will leave it there. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>: I  am finished.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  As other Members said, the debate is the fifth that the Assembly has had on  post-primary transfer. The Ulster Unionist Party has tabled three of those  motions, which reflects its desire to find a solution to the current impasse.  That solution must be found in order to bring relief to teachers, parents and  children throughout the entire education system.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My party is realistic about what is needed to achieve a  sustainable solution that is in children&rsquo;s genuine interests. For that reason,  although I recognise the logic behind the Alliance Party&rsquo;s amendment, I cannot  support it. The amendment will create another sunset clause, which will block  long-term agreement. I understand that, at present, the Alliance Party supports  sunset clauses. Such clauses do not make for good government or for good  long-term solutions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is strange that the Alliance Party tabled the amendment  when, in proposing it, Mr Lunn said what a big waste of time the whole thing is  anyway. Despite that, he was able to speak about it for 10 minutes.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I will, briefly.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  am grateful to the Member for giving way.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I ask Mr McCallister to reflect that the motivation behind  our amendment is a call for all-party talks, that those talks must be without  prejudice, and that the Ulster Unionist Party&rsquo;s motion directs the outcome of  any talks towards a preordained outcome. If we are to engage genuinely with  Sinn F&eacute;in in particular, we must bring that party to the table, and we must be  able to discuss all the issues and be open to the direction in which such talks  may go.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Mr Lunn did not make any of that clear; I did not catch that from his opening  remarks.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion is to give us a breathing space to get a  solution from all the parties.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I thank the Member for giving way; he is probably the only Member who gives way  to me.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Does the Member agree that people are not listening to the  fact that the Ulster Unionist Party is saying that it is prepared for change;  that it agrees with many of the points that Members have made about the  transitional nature of the way forward; and that it wants to find common ground  for a common solution?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I am grateful to my honourable friend for his intervention. Members across the  House made those points. There is broad agreement on some of the issues and on  building a future for the education system. People want an education system  that meets the needs of all children and reflects what parents want. Nobody  objects to that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The difficulty is that the Minister is going ahead with her  view regardless of whether there is agreement. Her view does not recognise the  fact that Northern Ireland has a coalition Government with a power-sharing  Executive, because the Minister&rsquo;s view excludes completely any form of power  sharing and the idea of building a shared future. The Minister is not listening  to any other parties in the Assembly. She has chosen to ignore the majority of  parties in the Assembly &mdash; the SDLP, the Alliance Party, the DUP and my party &mdash;  and a significant proportion of the population of Northern Ireland. Her view  does not take into account power sharing or a shared future. We must find a  common way through our difficulties.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister&rsquo;s course of action does not interfere merely  with the sensibilities of politicians; it is having a real effect. Several  Members, including Mr Lunn, Mr Storey and Basil McCrea, said that education is  the top issue that parents want sorted out. Parents regard that issue as much  higher up the political agenda than policing and justice, yet it is not being  addressed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Across Northern Ireland, parents, children and teachers are  preparing themselves for a very uncertain, chaotic and potentially damaging  year. Children aged 10 and 11 now face multiple transfer tests to determine their  future, and no one is quite sure how an unregulated system will pan out. The  current situation is in no one&rsquo;s interest.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is a definite pattern in the Minister&rsquo;s policies.  Most educationalists are moving towards a demand-led education system that  takes into consideration the different needs of children, parents and teachers  and which will reflect abilities, beliefs and ethos. However, the Minister  seems to be moving in the opposite direction to a one-size-fits-all centrally  controlled and overly bureaucratic educational system that does not reflect the  world that we live in, either economically or socially.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member must bring his remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I support the motion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  As my colleague Dominic Bradley is the party spokesperson for education, I have  no intention of reiterating the valid points that he made. However, I feel that  it is incumbent on all of us to work together to solve this problem. We should  not be put off by the souring of a political romance that was kept buoyant by  the political pundits and an insatiable media thirst.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Over the past week, I was saddened to read some of the  comments from local people and, not least, those of journalists who are tarring  us all with the one brush. Headlines and media reports tell of mass confusion;  parties dithering over talks to end the logjam; politicians playing party  politics with the education system of Northern Ireland; and, worst of all, the  issue having gone right to the Assembly Floor and the message still having not  got through.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I assure the House that the SDLP is not dithering. We want  to see an end to this fiasco. However, it is unhelpful for the Minister and her  party to simply reiterate that a decision has been made and that is that. If the  stance of the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in in education is anything to go by, we can only  assume that political agendas are their priority, not the 13,700 children who  are being forced to sit not one but as many as five tests to gain a grammar  school place.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">No matter what the Minister thinks, the decision should at  least have been properly discussed with the parents and teachers of those  children. As we have heard from the Minister, one size does not fit all. Where  the education of a child is concerned, decisions that are made are very private  and pressured and are not taken lightly. Ramming through transfer 2010, with  nothing to replace it, has disadvantaged many children. I refer to children who  have academic ability but, because their parents cannot afford to pay the fees  for some of the selection tests, are being left behind.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have heard all about the &lsquo;Every School a Good School&rsquo;  policy, but the Minister is obviously not listening to the people of Northern  Ireland. Parents are totally disillusioned; they cannot even tell their  children how this is going to work out for them. It is a parent&rsquo;s duty to be  able to console their child and explain the road ahead. However, this process  has left everyone frustrated and confused. Parents and teachers alike are  feeling let down and very resentful.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Huge pressure is being placed on teachers and principals to  coach the children who want to sit the entrance tests, yet the Department  states that they cannot do that. Thus, we have another strained relationship  between teachers and parents.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Educational reform is all very well when there is an  equitable and beneficial proposal for change. I am sorry to say that I see  neither in the midst of this fiasco. Let this year be the only year that  children, parents and principals are confused and generally distrusting of this  place and its proposals for a better system. I ask the Minister, &ldquo;Better for whom?&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I urge the Minister to show the compassion that she tells  us she has for the children of Northern Ireland and sit down with all the  parties represented in the House, as well as the appropriate educationalists,  and settle the situation once and for all. The Minister can do that, and I urge  her to please take that step.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education (Ms Ruane)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I have  always stated my preferences for a new, regulated system of transfer from  primary to post-primary education that will ensure that all children can access  the high-quality education to which they are entitled as a right. The motion,  however, offers no prospects of such a system. Although it is predictably  vague, the motion demands a statutory framework for academic entrance tests to  be put in place while the CCEA devises a slightly different testing regime to  facilitate the use of academic admissions criteria by grammar schools.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">T&aacute; s&eacute; i gceist ag an r&uacute;n seo roghn&uacute; acad&uacute;il st&aacute;turraithe  agus teist aistrithe a thabhairt isteach ar&iacute;s go buan. T&aacute; an r&uacute;n seo ag &eacute;ileamh  orainn filleadh ar ch&oacute;ras teipthe na teiste aistrithe. Deirim go soil&eacute;ir ar&iacute;s:  t&aacute; an teist aistrithe imithe, agus n&iacute; bheidh s&iacute; ag teacht ar ais ar bhealach ar  bith.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion seeks the permanent reinstatement of  state-sponsored academic selection and a permanent 11-plus. The motion demands  a return to the failed 11-plus system. Let me be absolutely clear and  unambiguous: the 11-plus is gone. The 11-plus is not coming back in any shape  or form. The motion demonstrates extreme naivety and a total failure to recognise  the changing realities in our education system.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The proposers of the motion believe that, somehow, we can  develop an acceptable and less traumatic version of the 11-plus. I want to be  absolutely clear: there is no acceptable way of designating the majority of our  children as failures. There is no acceptable form of academic rejection.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">1.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion implicitly demands that the past should continue  unchanged into the future and demonstrates a totally closed mindset by denying  that there should even be a debate about the future of post-primary transfer.  It denies the presence of any demand for change. It denies the fact that there  was consultation on transfer 2010 guidance. We received 3,195 responses, of  which 95% supported change. It denies the fact that the number of children  entered for entrance tests may show, for the first time, that the majority of  parents have rejected academic selection.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Through the motion, those in favour of the old system  demand that everybody else falls into line with them. The proposers of the  motion appear to have their hands over their eyes and ears, which is no basis  for making decisions on the future of our education system and on how we meet  the needs of our children. In contrast to that approach, I spent two years  developing compromise proposals and repeatedly sought engagement on them.  However, as with the content of the motion, the response to those proposals was  a refusal to consider anything but the status quo and a refusal to discuss any  change.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">T&aacute; g&eacute;argh&aacute; le d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht dhearfach agus f&oacute;cas ar an  todhcha&iacute;, ach caithfidh muid n&iacute;os m&oacute; n&aacute; mian aineolach filleadh ar an am at&aacute;  thart a bheith againn m&aacute; t&aacute; an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht sin le bheith againn.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A constructive debate and focus on the future is urgently  needed, but that needs to be more than an ill-informed desire to return to the  past. Our future system of post-primary transfer must be seen as an integral  and important part of a wider reform agenda. A focus on the future must  consider the need to ensure that half our children do not leave school without  five good GCSEs, including English and maths or Irish and maths, depending on  the language through which children are learning.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There has been much inequality and injustice in 2008-09 and  in previous years. The most recent figures profiling our grammar school  population show that the rate at which a low-income or  free-school-meal-entitled child gets a grammar school place is one in 18. The  rate for other children is one in two. It is important that we deliver an  undistorted and revised curriculum to nine- and 10-year-old children that is  welcomed and valued by our primary schools. I applaud many of our primary  schools for standing up for the rights of children.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The process of post-primary transfer cannot be viewed in  isolation. We must also help to deliver on curriculum reform not only in  respect of the revised curriculum but the entitlement framework. I seriously  doubt that the proposers of the motion understand or even consider the social  and economic needs of our young people. We cannot slavishly continue with an  outdated and discredited model of post-primary education that envisages two  crudely separated routes: the academic and the sub-academic.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Our education system needs to serve our children and  produce young people with diverse and flexible skills. We cannot accept a  system that suppresses opportunity for those who are less well off and  demoralises up to two thirds of our children every year. We cannot continue to  waste up to two years of each child&rsquo;s primary education because of a crude and  educationally unsound child-sorting process.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The 11-plus system is a failed system. Academic selection  is a failed system. Any education system that judges even one child to be a  failure at the age of 11 is wrong, unjust and indefensible. Every stage in a  child&rsquo;s education is important. The way in which we move children from one  stage in their education to another is equally important, but it is only one  part of the jigsaw that will result in the total reform of our education  system. My vision is to elevate our education system from one that is admired  for the successes of only its highest achievers to one in which all children  have the opportunity and support to be high achievers based on their unique  talents and abilities, academic and otherwise.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">N&iacute;l aon &aacute;it don roghn&uacute; acad&uacute;il n&aacute; don di&uacute;lt&uacute; sa ch&oacute;ras sin.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is no place in that system for academic selection and  rejection. The proposers of the motion and those who support them seem unable  to grasp that change is taking place and will leave them behind. We already  know that denominational grammar schools intend to abandon academic selection  in the next few years. The number of children entering this year&rsquo;s entrance  test shows that parental opinion is moving in exactly the same direction. In a  short time, academic selection will be a fringe activity, sustained only if  entrance tests survive the many dangers that accompany them. Within view is a  critical point when the significant majority of parents will feel that they do  not need to put their child through the agonies of entrance testing in order to  secure the high-quality post-primary provision to which they are entitled.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">D&rsquo;fhoilsigh m&eacute; an leagan deiridh den treoir ar aistri&uacute; 2010  ar 5 Meitheamh 2009. Is &eacute; aistri&uacute; 2010 an beartas at&aacute; ag mo Roinn d&rsquo;aistri&uacute;  p&aacute;ist&iacute; &oacute;n mbunscoil go dt&iacute; an iarbhunscoil.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I published the final version of the transfer 2010 guidance  on 25 June. Transfer 2010 is my Department&rsquo;s policy for the transfer of  children from primary to post-primary schools. I consulted widely on that  policy earlier this year, and, by the closing date, I had received 3,195  responses, the majority of which supported the position set out in the  guidance. The guidance, if followed, will deliver an effective and fair system  of post-primary transfer. It will also deliver a system of post-primary  transfer that helps to answer the wider and desperately urgent reform agenda,  embracing demographic decline and school sustainability, the delivery of the  entitlement framework and under&shy;achievement.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The guidance strongly recommends that schools should not  use academic admissions criteria. I have urged grammar schools to follow that  recommendation, both on equality grounds and because of the risks of  dysfunction. I have warned that any entrance test operating outside the  guidance is, I believe, a legal minefield.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The amendment tabled by members of the Alliance Party would  put in place a test for one year pending a solution arrived at through  inter-party talks. Although I welcome that attempt to be constructive, it is,  nonethe&shy;less, a naive attempt. I have already brought forward compromise  proposals that would have resulted in a transition test for three years,  supported by a legislative framework. Other parties would not even discuss  those proposals. I will not introduce an official test for even one year  without a legislative framework first being in place.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That brings us back to where we are today, with a lack of  willingness on the part of others to even discuss a compromise. There will,  therefore, be no return to the failed system of academic selection. The 11-plus  is gone; it is not coming back. The new arrangements are now in place; they  will not be reversed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Bh&iacute; deis ag an gCoiste Feidhmi&uacute;ch&aacute;in ar thr&iacute; &oacute;c&aacute;id le dh&aacute;  bhliain anuas pl&eacute; a dh&eacute;anamh ar na socruithe don aistri&uacute; agus le teacht ar  chomhsheasamh ar an gceist. D&rsquo;iarr m&eacute; an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht sin tr&iacute; huaire, agus  chuir an DUP bac ar an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht sin tr&iacute; huaire</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive had three opportunities over the past two  years to discuss and come to an agreed position on transfer arrangements. Three  times I asked for that discussion; three times the discussion was blocked by  the DUP. As Education Minister, I could not accept ongoing uncertainty and  deadlock. The debate is now closed. The policy of the Department of Education  is that transfer should not involve academic testing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The small number of schools which have broken away from the  education system need to rethink their position, and they need to put the  interests of children before their perceived institutional self-interest.  Academic selection is educationally unsound; it does not meet the needs of a  modern society; it generates and sustains inequality; and it has no place in  our education system.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  The Alliance Party has been accused by most parties of being well-meaning.  People have the greatest sympathy for our amendment. Obviously, we accept the  charge of being well-meaning.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The flipside of that coin is that we have been accused of  being naive in our approach to trying to reach agreement. Our approach is  extremely hard-nosed and realistic. Given the status quo, no one can be proud  of our current post-primary transfer system. It is not a sustainable long-term  way forward. Society needs leadership, and we are showing leadership, not  naivety.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the Chamber, there is a clear difference of opinion  about the way forward on post-primary transfer. There is a range of views among  parties and, indeed, within parties about which model offers the best way  forward. In a sense, that is not what today&rsquo;s debate is about. Our amendment is  based on two points. First, an interim measure is needed to see us through the  anarchy of an unregulated system that is the worst possible outcome for our  society. Secondly, parties need to come together and discuss the way forward  without prejudice.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The difference between our amendment and the Ulster  Unionist Party motion is that the motion will, in a sense, legitimise the  grammar school lobby&rsquo;s breakaway on testing. That is wrong and should not have  happened. It is counterproductive.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  The Member refers to a &ldquo;breakaway&rdquo; and uses the term &ldquo;legitimise&rdquo;. We are  talking about legal reality. I know that the party opposite has a problem with  law and order and complying with the law, but schools are entitled, under the  law, to set tests. That must be the basis on which we move forward. It is  dismissive to label lobbies as breakaways and subsequently ignore them.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  They are making a solo run. We support a single framework for post-primary  transfer throughout Northern Ireland into which all schools fit. It is not  productive for schools or sectors to do their own thing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Ulster Unionist motion prejudices the outcome of any  talks. Although that party claims to support talks, it is counterproductive to  have a preordained solution. By contrast, our amendment is open-ended, and we  accept the need for discussions. In particular, if Sinn F&eacute;in comes to the  table, it should know that those discussions will be without prejudice and that  all views will be taken into account. To date, Sinn F&eacute;in is the only party that  has failed to support the &lsquo;Belfast Telegraph&rsquo; campaign and the notion of  interim tests.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  All-party talks are one thing, but our party will not allow the editorial staff  of any news organisation to dictate our policy and timetable.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  remember the days when Sinn F&eacute;in used to campaign at elections by demanding  all-party talks. We have moved on. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>:  Order. I am sure that all Members will agree that, in school, children are not  allowed to shout across the classroom. The same rule applies in here.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  recognise that no party will allow editorial policy to determine its stance.  However, I believe that it is in Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s interests to come to the table to  discuss the matter with other parties. The fact that Sinn F&eacute;in picked the  education portfolio has put it in a powerful position. However, its view is out  of line with the vast majority in our society. Moreover, for Sinn F&eacute;in to claim  that it has got rid of the 11-plus is not a sustainable argument. It is also  washing its hands of a situation in which academic selection is continuing in  an unregulated manner and causing the risk of even greater inequality entering  the system. Students and parents will experience more stress, and students will  sit even more exams. That cannot be right.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will respond to some of the comments that have been made  during the debate. Dominic Bradley sought clarification of our amendment. I  assure him that it is about making an interim test available to schools as part  of a range of different selection criteria.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Such a test would not be compulsory, nor would it  be the only way open to schools to proceed. However, it should be part of a  menu, as an interim measure, that would get us over the hurdle as an  alternative to an unregulated system, which is the worst possible outcome.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">2.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will follow up on a point that was made by Michelle  McIlveen about the numbers of people who are signing up for the entrance tests  as proof of the interest from parents. I have to urge caution about reading too  much into what parents are doing. Some parents may well support academic  selection, while others may have got the message that they will not get their  child into a particular school if he or she does not sit those tests. It is not  out of choice that they are doing so; it is out of fear. It is important that  we recognise the range of motivations that parents have.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Our amendment is geared towards trying to find consensus in  the House on the way forward. I urge parties to unite behind it and to send  out, for once, a united message on this issue to parents and children.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  It is interesting to hear the views of others. I attempted to get involved in  some of the discussions, but, sadly, that was not possible. Frankly, that shows  what is wrong with the entire process.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We brought forward our proposals with good intent, but some  Members simply did not listen to what we had to say. Had they listened, they  could have taken a view as to whether they agreed or disagreed. Instead, in  pursuit of their own petty, party political process, they chose to have a rant  on their own terms. The proposals that we brought forward are not against  change; we want change. We are prepared to see change happen and we are  prepared to work with anybody and everybody to achieve it. However, as SDLP  colleagues said, we simply cannot achieve such a magnitude of change in one  year. Such a degree of change requires planning, consensus and genuine  consultation, not just papers that are put out to encourage Sinn F&eacute;in Members  to write in. Such change must genuinely address the concerns of the people of  Northern Ireland, and there are different views on all the issues.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I was disappointed in the language that was used by the  Alliance Party&rsquo;s contributors to the debate. Dr Farry said that they were  bringing forward their proposals with good intent. However, Mr Lunn, who  proposed the amendment, seemed to be saying that no one will back it, but here  it is anyway. The use of words such as &ldquo;breakaway&rdquo; does not appear to be  egalitarian. The use of phrases such as &ldquo;needing protection from the law&rdquo; sends  out a certain message, as does talking about the wrongs of the process. That  does not suggest that the Alliance Party is entering the discussions without  preconditions or without taking a particular position.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have not engaged previously with the Alliance Party on  this issue, but it seems to be riding two horses. On the one hand, it says that  it is strong and wants to achieve things, but on the other hand, its Members  have a go at the Minister and say that she cannot do away with entrance tests  without having an alternative. That is a confused, incoherent and incomplete  message. The Alliance Party seems to be saying that its position on the tests  is pretty close to what others want to do, but that they should go on for only  one year. That position serves only to transfer the pain to the children in P6,  P5 and P4. Sunset clauses, whether on policing and justice or on education, do  not work. We need something to keep us going until we can all agree to come up  with something different. That was a deeply disappointing contribution from a  party that seems to have a paucity of ideas about how to move forward.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  The answer is no.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We share the concerns expressed by SDLP colleagues, and Mr  O&rsquo;Dowd, on certain issues. Our position is not prescriptive.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I was struck by Mary Bradley&rsquo;s contribution in particular;  I hope that she does not mind me singling her out. She said that education is a  &ldquo;private and pressured decision&rdquo; and that the Minister&rsquo;s attempt to ram  transfer 2010 through is at the bottom of all that is wrong in this debate.  Quite simply, the Minister of Education is not listening.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Some Members mentioned the &lsquo;Belfast Telegraph&rsquo;. Indeed,  Michelle McIlveen said that it is a pity about some of the headlines that have  appeared. I could agree; however, the reason for having the debate is to show  the people of Northern    Ireland why we cannot reach a consensus, why  we cannot get round a table and sort this out, and why we are failing to reach  agreement.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  The Minister referred repeatedly to responses to transfer 2010. However, her  party organised those responses. Mr O&rsquo;Dowd referred earlier to double counting,  but they double counted the responses to the Department. Therefore, it was a  fix. That is the only reason why the Minister could stand up and say that she  had responses in favour of transfer 2010.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I thank the Member for his intervention. The point is well made and well reiterated.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have attempted, on behalf of my colleagues and my party,  to table a motion that would encourage genuine debate. Instead, I have been met  with people who heckle from a sedentary position, who will not take  interventions, who will not engage with the issue &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  The answer is no.<span class="Italic"> [Laughter.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  If we are serious about resolving the situation, it will take change, and it  will require the Minister to change. Change is not something that comes easily  to the Minister. I have seen no change in her demeanour, speeches, or in the  way that she comes forward. She will not engage with anybody; she gets Mr  O&rsquo;Dowd to do that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At the risk of proving that the Minister is entirely  predictable, I prepared some notes. Sadly, I do not think that I have to change  any of them, because I knew what was going to be said. I want to make it  absolutely clear that her strategy to try to paint parties on this side of the  House as parties that will not change is absolutely wrong. She is wrong in  that, she is wrong in her educational strategy, and she is wrong in the way  that she misjudges the people of Northern Ireland. The failure of  this Department of Education is down to her and to her alone.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On this issue, we will change. We recognise the need for  change. Changes are necessary because demographics are shifting. In finding an  acceptable way forward, we have not argued for the retention of the 11-plus. We  have not said that we want to go back to that system. Instead, we have said  that some form of academic credentials must be used. We are open to those  professionals who wish to give us advice. I have been accused of being naive,  although I have been accused of worse. However, I am not sure on what basis a  tennis professional makes that accusation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have been through the Northern Ireland education system.  I have studied the STEM subjects. I have the qualifications, and I come from a  family that valued the opportunities that were available for me to get them. In  looking around this House, I see nothing but disappointment. The people of Northern Ireland  have said repeatedly that we must find a solution. Issues were agreed at St Andrews, and although I was not party to the discussions  that took place, it is clear that academic selection was one such issue and  that an agreement was reached on it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">You have torn up that agreement for your own selfish  political ideals. There is room for compromise, and there is a way forward.  Even now, it is not too late.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My SDLP colleagues asked for clarification on the Alliance  Party amendment because they may be minded to support it. I say to those  Members that the issue is about finding some time and about giving us some  space. I will put on the record, and I will say on behalf of the party, that I  promise that we will engage seriously to try to find an acceptable solution. It  is not the way forward to stick with a totally unregulated system that,  according to the Minister, is full of legal minefields and puts stress and  strain on children and parents.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I ask the Member to draw his remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  If the amendment falls, which I expect that it will, I ask the SDLP to support  the motion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>

    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. As we move to questions to the Office of the First Minister and deputy  First Minister, Members may be aware of today&rsquo;s visit to Parliament Buildings  by the Speaker of the House of Commons, the Rt Hon John Bercow MP, and guests.  They have taken their seats in the Gallery, and they are very welcome to the  Northern Ireland Assembly this afternoon. On behalf the Assembly, I extend my  warmest welcome to our distinguished guests.</p>

    <p class="H3SectionHeading">OFFICE OF THE First Minister &nbsp;and deputy First Minister</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Fair Employment and Treatment &nbsp;Order 1998: Teachers&rsquo; Exemption</p>
    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">1. <strong>Mr  Storey</strong>asked the First Minister and deputy First Minister if the  Equality Commission has made a recommendation to their Department to bring  forward a legislative amendment to remove the teachers&rsquo; exemption from the fair  employment and treatment legislation. (AQO  135/10<a name="AQO13510"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister (Mr M McGuinness)</strong>: The Equality Commission&rsquo;s recommendation to  narrow the scope of the teachers&rsquo; exception in the Fair Employment and Treatment  Order 1998 is one of six recommendations for equality legislation reform that  the commission made to the Department.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">For Members&rsquo; benefit, I will briefly outline the scope of  the other five recommendations. It should be noted that the commission&rsquo;s recommendations  are not ranked in any order of priority. First, age discrimination legislation  should be extended to protect people from unjustified age discrimination  outside the workplace. Secondly, race relations legislation should be amended  to ensure that protection from discrimination on the grounds of colour and  nationality is afforded the same level of protection as on other racial  grounds. Thirdly, sex discrimination legislation should be amended to prohibit  unlawful discrimination by public authorities when exercising their public  functions. Fourthly, disability discrimination legislation should be amended to  secure greater protection for disabled people. Fifthly and finally, the  monitoring requirements under fair employment legislation should be extended to  include the collection of information on nationality and ethnic origin.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I shall now return to the Equality Commission&rsquo;s  recommendation for the teachers&rsquo; exception in the Fair Employment and Treatment  Order 1998. As Members may be aware, in effect, the exception allows schools to  lawfully discriminate on grounds of religious belief in the appointment of  teachers in schools. It also means that teachers&rsquo; employers are not required to  monitor the religious composition of their employees or those who apply for  such positions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Equality Commission recommends a two-stage approach to  the removal of the teachers&rsquo; exception. First, it recommends that the exception  is removed with respect to the recruitment of teachers in secondary-level  schools. The second part of the commission&rsquo;s recommendation is that early  consideration be given to whether the exception should also be removed with  respect to primary-level schools.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The teachers&rsquo; exception is a sensitive issue, and I wish to  make it clear that no decision has been taken on the recommendation to remove  it with respect to the recruitment of teachers in secondary-level schools.  Indeed, any decision by a Minister to amend or completely remove that exception  will require Executive approval, because the Minister of Education is  responsible for teacher recruitment policy.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>: I  am disappointed that the deputy First Minister, unlike his colleague the  Minister of Education, cannot come to the House and tell Members about his  commitment to equality. It seems that he is only committed to partial equality.  Given the repeated claims about equality made by the deputy First Minister&rsquo;s  party, what assurances can he give Members that, if the education and skills  authority (ESA) were to be established, Protestant teachers in Northern Ireland  will be treated fairly and with equity and that the discrimination that already  exists as a result of the exemption will be abolished once and for all?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: As the Member will no doubt be aware, on 23 July, the junior  Ministers met a delegation from the Equality Commission to discuss its  proposals to reform equality legislation. The delegation included the Equality  Commission&rsquo;s chief commissioner, Bob Collins, and its chief executive, Evelyn  Collins. I understand that that meeting was very positive. However, it was  pointed out to the Equality Commission that we would need to carefully consider  how its raft of proposals for legislative reform could be taken forward.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I have said, the teachers&rsquo; exception is a sensitive  issue. <em>[Interruption.]</em></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: Any proposal to amend or remove the exception will draw strong  responses &mdash; both from those opposed to it and those who support it. In view of  this, we must move cautiously on this matter. Members should note that the  Department of Education will shortly commence a review of recruitment  opportunities in the teaching sector. Officials will work closely with the  relevant stakeholders, including the Equality Commission, and it would be prudent  for us to await the outcome of that review before taking any decisions about  the future of the teachers&rsquo; exception. Clearly, the Office of the First  Minister and deputy First Minister (OFMDFM) and the Department of Education  must liaise closely on this matter.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member should not be concerned about my commitment to  equality, or that of my party. Our commitment is absolute, but some situations  of a historical nature have to be dealt with. Many of them were in place prior  to devolution and our taking office. It is now our responsibility to deal with  them. I have outlined the methodology by which we will approach it and I hope  that we can see it resolved.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Is it not the case that those  exemptions were made largely at the behest of the Protestant Churches, which  sought to ensure that the ethos of Protestant schools that transferred, and  succeeding schools, would be protected?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: We all know that the teachers&rsquo; exemption was allowed so that  Catholic maintained schools could insist that any teachers whom they recruited  held a certificate in religious education.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The vast majority of primary schools and some post-primary  schools insist on a certificate in religious studies. The Department of  Education&rsquo;s proposed review of recruitment opportunities in the teaching sector  will specifically consider issues in relation to the certificate. The review  will seek to estimate the proportion of those vacancies for which a certificate  in religious studies is likely to be an eligibility criterion. It will identify  the routes by which teachers may obtain a certificate, either as part of  initial teacher education or subsequently, and it will also seek to identify  any barriers to obtaining a certificate that could give rise to inequality.  That is a pointer in the direction of the contributions made by both Members  who spoke in the last few minutes.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The new education and skills authority will be the single  body responsible for employing teachers. However, responsibility for drawing up  the requirements for particular posts will rest with boards of governors in  schools. Even if the teachers&rsquo; exemption were to be removed, a board of  governors could legitimately view possession of a certificate in religious  education to be a requirement for certain posts.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is a mistake for Members to sectarianise discussion of  these highly sensitive issues. We must deal with the legacy that we have been  handed. Given the opportunity, many people would change things done in the  past. However, we have to deal with the outcome of the past. Members must  recognise that this is an issue on which strong views are held on either side  of the argument. As always in such matters, the secret is to find a solution. I  hope that we can do that.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  I notice how closely the deputy First Minister sticks to the script.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">With schools increasingly sharing facilities, buildings and  teaching staff in local partnerships, has not the ability of certain schools to  use religious criteria in the appointment of teachers become an anachronism?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: I certainly represent my own views on how we move forward. When I  was Minister of Education, I was a strong supporter of integrated education and  of all education sectors. I recognised that our education system was going to change  and that it faced huge challenges, not simply in response to economic forces,  but in recognition of the practical sense that it makes to increase sharing  among schools. Inevitably, that brings about a situation where consideration  has to be given to the removal of obstacles to ensuring that all teachers have  a level playing field. That is important, and the Member&rsquo;s point is well made.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have to move forward with the agreed processes to  resolve that. The Department of Education will conduct its review in the next  while, on the other side of which I hope that we will see a solution that is  acceptable to all.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Question 2 has been withdrawn.</p>
    <p class="H5StageHeading">Cohesion, Sharing and Integration Strategy</p>
    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">3. <strong>Dr Farry</strong>asked the First Minister and deputy First Minister what steps are being  taken to resolve political differences relating to the strategy for cohesion,  sharing and integration to enable an agreed consultation document to be  released as soon as possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 137/10<a name="AQO13710"></a>)</p>
    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">5. <strong>Ms  Anderson</strong>asked the First Minister and deputy First Minister to  detail the public service agreement and the objectives which provide the  context for the cohesion, sharing and integration strategy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO  139/10<a name="AQO13910"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: With your permission, Mr Speaker, I will answer questions 3 and 5  together.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The draft programme for cohesion, sharing and integration  was originally to be brought forward before the end of last year. That and  subsequent commitments on timing were made in good faith; it was our  expectation that they would be met. However, it was not possible to meet that  date. Reaching agreement on the cohesion, sharing and integration (CSI)  strategy remains one of the top policy priorities of OFMDFM.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Our commitment in the Programme for Government under PSA 7  is:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Making peoples&rsquo; lives better: Drive a programme  across Government to reduce poverty and address inequality and disadvantage&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">It includes a number of actions under objective 5,  which is to:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Promote equality and the enforcement of rights&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">We are determined to honour those, including the  implementation of a programme of cohesion and integration for a shared and  better future for all.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The CSI strategy is important, and we will continue to work  at it until we have honoured that pledge. While we continue to work intensively  towards an agreed strategy that will benefit all our people now and over the  longer term, work to promote community relations and good race relations has  continued over the past two years, led and supported by the First Minister, me  and the whole ministerial team.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Let me repeat: there are many examples of that commitment.  We have invested &pound;29 million in good relations work in the current  comprehensive spending review (CSR) period to build a shared and better future;  that is not insubstantial. Additionally, we provide match funding to EU funding  under the Peace III programme. As the Department accountable for three of the  programme&rsquo;s priorities, we are strategically placed to ensure co-ordination of  activities at the local level. Junior Ministers continue to chair the north Belfast working group, focusing on interface issues in Belfast and across the  North. We have spent &pound;500,000 this summer on resourcing work on the summer  interventions programme. Overall, since devolution in 2007, we have spent &pound;1&middot;5  million on that intervention work.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In our district councils&rsquo; community relations programme, we  have spent &pound;4,372,000 since May 2007 and have committed a further &pound;2,759,000  this financial year. In Coleraine, we have been working proactively with our  key partners, both statutory and non-statutory, following the killing of Mr  Kevin McDaid in May, and we have provided an additional &pound;23,000 to Coleraine  Borough Council for diversionary work on top of the &pound;86,000 awarded to it for  good relations activities. Junior Ministers have met our key partners twice as  part of our ongoing commitment to the area. Similarly, in Craigavon, the junior  Ministers have been chairing meetings with all our key partners on the issues  and tensions there that we have seen recently on our TV screens. We are  supporting and facilitating diversionary work on a multi-agency basis.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Flags monitoring has been undertaken on our behalf by the Institute of Irish Studies at Queen&rsquo;s University  since 2006. The last survey will be conducted at the end of this month, and we  expect to receive the report by the end of this year.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  thank the deputy First Minister for his detailed answer. What specific actions  are the First Minister and he taking to address the outstanding gaps, in order  that we can have a draft strategy? In particular, given that I am led to  understand that it is one of the areas of dispute, can the deputy First  Minister give the House an assurance that there is no contradiction whatsoever  between the concepts of equality and good relations and a shared future, and  that, indeed, developing both in tandem is to the benefit of the entire community?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: I agree with the Member&rsquo;s last statement. From our perspective,  in recent weeks, we have had people stating their position in the public domain  on how that should be taken forward. That is old news. What we must do now is  recognise the importance of the work of getting our officials together and  facing up to the challenges that clearly exist as a result of the inability to  agree a way forward thus far. I will not stand here and recite all the  difficulties, because that in itself could exacerbate the situation, and I have  no intention of doing that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As we move forward, it is important to ensure that our  officials are working on the issue, and I can confirm that we have officials  working on a draft of the strategy paper, to address my and the First  Minister&rsquo;s concerns. We are both committed to resolving the issue as soon as  possible. It will not be easy, but the effort has to be made. With goodwill on  all sides of the House &mdash; not only from the First Minister and me &mdash; we can get  to where, I think, all of us want to be.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Anderson</strong>:  Go raibh mile maith agat. In the context of cohesion, sharing and integration,  does the joint First Minister believe that recent comments by Members,  including a Minister from the party of the First Minister, Peter Trimble &mdash; or  Peter Robinson, I should say &mdash; stating that they would not attend a service in  a Catholic church &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. I ask the Member to quickly come to her question, please.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Anderson</strong>:  Some Members have said that they would not attend a service in a Catholic  church and that they oppose a visit by the Pope. Does the Minister agree that  such comments have no place in a modern society in which we are trying to  establish a shared and better future that was signed up to by Executive  Ministers in the Programme for Government?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: Although I stand by the rights of Members to hold personal  religious views, those views must be consistent with our role as public  representatives, and we can give no cover to sectarian beliefs or actions. It  is a serious mistake for Members to, on their websites, describe the Pope as  the Antichrist and to say that the Pope is not welcome here. Many across  society were shocked at those comments and hold no truck with them whatsoever.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  In his response to an earlier question, the deputy First Minister mentioned  community relations at council level. How can community relations at council  level be developed? Can they be developed on the budget that the deputy First  Minister mentioned, which I think was &pound;4&middot;5 million? Should that budget be  enhanced to allow the central community relations unit the opportunity to do  more at council level?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: People have a huge responsibility at council level to contribute  to the lessening of tensions in our society. All of us, regardless of what  party we come from, what position we hold or what authority we have on district  councils, have a huge responsibility to work with each other in a joined-up way  to ensure that the messages that go out from councils and elected  representatives make it clear that hate crime of any description &mdash; sectarian or  racist &mdash; is totally and absolutely unacceptable.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have given substantial funding to the councils, and our  ongoing reviews of those situations make it incumbent upon us to recognise the  importance of dealing with the issue in such a fashion that will see a return  for the money that is spent, because it is citizens&rsquo; money. The announcement of  funds for projects in different parts of the North, whether it be Coleraine,  Craigavon, the Derry area or the north-west,  is money well spent. However, it is well spent only if political leaders are  prepared to lead. The fact that we have uninterruptedly come together in the  House over the past two years sends a message to people that it is only by  working together in a spirit of co-operation that we can hope to resolve the  problems that exist.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are problems in many different council areas, but  none of them will be resolved without the goodwill and commitment of locally  elected representatives. I am not pointing the finger at any particular party.  All of us, as elected representatives, have a responsibility to work together,  and that is happening in many parts of the North.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  On the radio this morning, the deputy First Minister&rsquo;s party leader called for  the canonisation of the deputy First Minister. Does the deputy First Minister  care to respond to those comments, given the fact that canonisation normally  follows one&rsquo;s death and does not occur during one&rsquo;s lifetime?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">With respect to cohesion, sharing and integration, does the  deputy First Minister agree that his personal exchanges with the First Minister  in recent weeks and the various insults and putdowns that have passed between  them are anything but evidence of a shared society and a shared approach &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Is the Member coming to the end of his question?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I am. Furthermore, does he agree that those exchanges are very bad examples to  set for the people of Northern    Ireland?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: I must say that I was a little concerned when I heard the call  for my canonisation &mdash; <em>[Laughter.]</em> Not only did Gerry say it once, he  said it twice, and I told him when I met him at 9.00 am today that he was  totally out of order, as one can only be canonised by the Catholic Church after  one has died.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>:  He did not have to work with the DUP. <em>[Laughter.]</em></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: Obviously, people will have watched with interest what has  happened over the past couple of weeks. I will not disguise the difficulties  that exist, but I will not labour those difficulties either. Instead, we must  recognise the enormous achievements of putting together the Assembly and the  Executive given the different allegiances.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The First Minister and I are well able to stand up for  ourselves, but I do not want to be in a confrontational situation with anyone  regarding how we take the process forward. Our duty to ensure that policing and  justice powers are transferred is a responsibility to deliver for our citizens;  not for Catholics, republicans or nationalists, but for everyone. Establishing  a policing service that commands the greatest allegiance in our society is one  of the most important things that we can do over the coming weeks and months,  and that will be good for everyone. A policing service that has the  overwhelming support of the community will be more efficient and effective as  we face down the criminals, gangsters and drug pushers who try to take  advantage of the fact that in some parts of the North, they believe that they  can survive.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have watched the activities of the protest groups, even  though they are only micro-groups, that have grown up recently. Indeed, I was  walking along my street just a few weeks ago and witnessed two adults and a  child handing out anti-Sinn F&eacute;in leaflets, and my driver pointed out that one  of the adults had been convicted of drug dealing eight years before.  Furthermore, when one looks closely at those who burst into district policing  partnership meetings, in Derry or in other parts of the North, it is evident  that some elements in those groups are gangsters and criminals who wish to use  the issue of policing to destroy everything that has been built up in the past  number of years.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, there are huge challenges ahead, and the First  Minister and I have a responsibility to lead in a positive and constructive  fashion. I am determined to do that.</p>
    <p class="H5StageHeading">Policing and Justice Powers: Budget</p>
    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">4. <strong>Mr  McNarry</strong>asked the First Minister and deputy First Minister to detail  the budget transfer required from Whitehall  to operate devolved policing and justice powers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 138/10<a name="AQO13810"></a>)</p>
    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">6. <strong>Mr  Hamilton</strong>asked the First Minister and deputy First Minister to  provide an update on the negotiations with HM Government in relation to the  financing of any future devolved policing and justice powers.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO  140/10<a name="AQO14010"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: With your permission, Mr Speaker, I will take questions 4 and 6  together.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Preparations for the devolution of policing and justice  powers have progressed in line with the process paper, which the First Minister  and I made public following our attendance at the Assembly and Executive Review  Committee meeting of 18 November 2008. One of the essential steps identified in  that paper was the need for a satisfactory conclusion to financial discussions  involving the First Minister and me, the NIO, the Treasury and the Prime  Minister.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Over the course of the past 10 months, the First Minister  and I have met with senior Whitehall Ministers on a number of occasions to  discuss financing issues in relation to the devolution of policing and justice  powers. Those talks intensified recently when the First Minister and I met the  Prime Minister on 16 September 2009 and 21 September 2009 in London  and on 23 September 2009 in New York.  Members will be aware that each of the parties met with Gordon Brown earlier  today, and I believe that others will be meeting him later. The First Minister  and I will meet him together in Stormont   Castle immediately after  Question Time.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, officials from OFMDFM and the Department of  Finance and Personnel have engaged in detailed and lengthy discussions with  Whitehall Departments, including the Treasury, the NIO and the Court Service,  to establish the financial implications of devolution.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">A series of meetings has also been held with front  line policing and justice agencies to examine the pressures that they will face  in delivering services in the coming years.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Substantial progress has been made in identifying the  pressures that a Department of justice would face in this comprehensive  spending review and beyond. However, those issues have not yet been fully  resolved, and further ministerial discussions are planned. Consequently, it  would be premature and inappropriate to comment on the funding details at this  time.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The First Minister and I remain firmly of the view that  devolution should be accompanied by adequate resources to meet the challenge of  those new responsibilities and to deal with financial pressures. We also  believe that a locally accountable Minister would be better placed to set  priorities and manage the policing and justice budget than a Minister based in London.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  I accept that the Minister cannot divulge figures, and I appreciate that  negotiations are ongoing, even as we speak. Nevertheless, will he say whether  the agreed final settlement will be based on a final sum for an agreed period  and how long that period will be likely to last? What contingency elements will  be built in or guaranteed to be made available to counter an upsurge of  violence from dissidents, or whatever one wants to call them? Will all the  negotiated sums be fully proofed against efficiency savings imposed by the Treasury?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: Members will be aware that we are at a very sensitive stage  regarding the way forward. The First Minister and I will go back to talk to  Gordon Brown, and he indicated at our meeting this morning that he might need  to see us during the coming days. We are talking about huge sums of money:  hundreds of millions of pounds.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  Will you not tell us what they are?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText"><strong>The deputy First Minister: </strong>I will tell you what they  are: they are for hearing loss, legal aid, equal pay and a range of other  issues. We want to ensure that we have a policing service that is supported by  a Department of justice that has the essential funding required to make it fit  for purpose. The issue that we have been discussing recently has brought us to  a point where Gordon Brown has made it clear, at the meeting that I have just  left, that he wants to ensure that the issue of finance does not block the  process from moving forward. He is saying that he will not fail, and we are  going to keep him to his commitments.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We are concerned about some issues. It is vital that the  centre of excellence for the emergency services &mdash; the Fire and Rescue Service  and the Police Service &mdash; is commenced as quickly as possible, and not just  because it is in my constituency. That, in itself, sends a powerful message to  people about how we will move forward. We have raised that issue and a whole  range of others during our discussions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am taking the British Prime Minister at his word. He is  saying that this process &mdash; this negotiation &mdash; will not fail on account of the  funding issues. After meeting with him today, I believe what he says: the  process will not fall down because the British Government do not recognise the  importance of funding the requirements that we have identified to enable us to  move forward.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Obviously, we are in the mouth of the next British general  election, and I do not know what Government will be returned: it will be either  a Labour Government or a Conservative Government. I noted with interest this  morning that David Cameron made it clear that he is prepared to honour whatever  agreement Gordon Brown makes. However, I remind Members that when Peter  Robinson and I, along with Ian Paisley, Gerry Adams, Mark Durkan and Reg Empey,  went to Downing Street prior to the establishment of these institutions, the  British Government walked out to the microphones and told the world&rsquo;s media  that the Budget for the next 10 years in the North would amount to almost &pound;60  billion and that that was ring-fenced and guaranteed. Have we learnt a bitter  lesson since then?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  Have you?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText"><strong>The deputy First Minister: </strong>We all have. We all  recognise that, no matter what agreements we make as a result of our  negotiations with this British Prime Minister, we are dealing with a British  Government that could, at any time, cut any aspect of our Budget through the  Barnett formula. That is an occupational hazard that we have to live with. Our  job as politicians is to fight that battle. Obviously, the negotiation that we  are involved in is not one that will just tide us over for the next number of  months; it will take us right through the next comprehensive spending review.</p>

    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: First of all, I am not &ldquo;the deputy&rdquo;. I am the deputy First  Minister in a Department where there is equality between the First Minister and  myself, and don&rsquo;t you ever forget it. <em>[Interruption.] </em>Secondly, as we  move forward, we do so on the basis that everybody in the House wants the  process to work. I was very interested to hear Lord Trimble during the last  couple of hours, telling the Ulster Unionist Party to get on with it, as he  sauntered down &mdash; I do not think it was on a yacht, but it was on a punt of some  description &mdash; towards the Conservative Party conference. The Ulster Unionist  Party would be well advised to heed his advice.</p>

    <p class="H4StageHeading">PPS 5</p>
    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">1. <strong>Mr  Savage </strong>asked the Minister of the Environment to provide an update on draft  PPS 5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 150/10<a name="AQO15010"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment (Mr Poots)</strong>: My Department is still awaiting the outcome of  the judicial challenge to draft PPS 5, which was heard in the High Court in  January 2009.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. Members who are leaving should do so quietly.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I have finished my response, but in case it was not heard  I will give it again. My Department is still awaiting the outcome of the  judicial challenge to draft PPS 5, which was heard in the High Court in January  2009.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Savage</strong>:  The absence of a robust planning policy statement governing retail and town  centres is putting our town centres at risk. Minister Campbell announced a  review of PPS 5 in 2000, and the draft PPS was published in 2006. Can the  Minister explain why, some 29 months later, the review and the new PPS 5 have  not yet been adopted?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I thank the Member for his question. I could almost be as  tetchy as the deputy First Minister in my response on this issue, because it  irritates me greatly that the judicial challenge has been sitting with the High  Court since January this year and that developers would take this House to  court on the issue for their own pecuniary interests against the interests of  the wider public in Northern Ireland. The PPS 5 document is ready to go. It  will help to secure our town centres, and it is repulsive that developers would  challenge that document purely for their own personal gain against the public  interest.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s answer so far. I also find it unacceptable that  developers would take such action on such an important issue. Does the Minister  agree with me that the delay due to the legal proceedings has put town centres,  especially local businesses, in danger?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I absolutely agree. Town centres are being put at risk,  and jobs are being lost. Although it may suit some individuals to carry out  such actions, and I have no control over how courts do things, I wish that a  decision could be made as quickly as possible so that we can move on, whatever  decision the court makes.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  Does the Minister agree with me that multinational companies have enormous  economic power and that policy must therefore aim at ensuring a level playing  field? Will he therefore ensure that draft PPS 5, when it emerges, will protect  local independent business and, in particular, will minimise the obstacles to  new local businesses starting up?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: That is the idea behind PPS 5. However, it must always be  recognised that, in a democratic state, we cannot control who chooses to invest  or where that investment is made. We must make our region as attractive to  investors as possible, and I want to do that through how I deal with planning.  I will encourage a process that is quick, efficient and fair.</p>
    <p class="H5StageHeading">Waste Repatriation</p>
    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">2. <strong>Mr  Moutray </strong>asked the Minister of the Environment when the repatriation of  waste to the Republic   of Ireland is due to  commence.&nbsp; (AQO 151/10<a name="AQO15110"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: The first meeting in the process to let a contract under  compulsory EU procurement rules took place in Dublin on 8 September 2009. Dublin City  Council has the lead responsibility for procurement under the framework  agreement. The next meeting will take place on 7 October. The procure&shy;ment  process will take at least three to four months, and work will commence as soon  as possible after a contractor has been selected.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Moutray</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his answer thus far. Why has it taken so long to reach  this point, and what has the Environment Agency done to stop the illegal  activity that is involved?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: During direct rule, the response was too slow, and the  issue was ignored for many years. As an MLA with a particular interest in the  matter, I wrote to the then Minister with responsibility for the environment,  Angela Smith, and received an unsatisfactory response. Eventually, I had to  take the case to the European Commission, which demanded that the Republic of Ireland Government respond to it. As a  result of the actions of the European Commission, the Republic of Ireland  authorities have to take back the waste and deal with it under due process. I  will seek to move the matter forward as quickly as possible. I trust that the  sites can be restored to the way that they should have been; they should not  have been allowed to have been damaged in the way that they have been.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  Is the Minister aware that, on 29 June 2009, his predecessor as Minister of the  Environment told me in a written answer that the tender process would take  between three and four months? Given that the current Minister is using the  same form of words that was used at the end of June, will a specific date for  the commencement of work be issued after the contract is put in place?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I trust that a date will be given. When one is working  with another body, one can work only at its speed. Ultimately, we need an  agreement with Dublin City Council on the issue. Meetings have taken place,  and, as I said, another meeting will take place later this week. If full agreement  is reached at that meeting, the procurement process will take three to four  months from then. In the event of procrastination, the entire process will take  longer. I implore everyone to get the business done this week and to resolve  the situation in a way that is satisfactory to all.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  I thank the Minister for those answers. Does he have up-to-date figures on the  estimated cost of repatriating the waste? Have any criminal prosecutions been  made as a result of the matter?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: There is a site at Slattinagh and one at Trillick. The  cost to the Department of the remediation work is around &pound;600,000. That is 20%  of the overall cost of the remediation and excavation work. Dublin City Council  and the Republic   of Ireland authorities  will be responsible for the entire cost of dealing with that waste and for 80%  of the cost of excavation and remediation. The cost is a serious issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Since January 2009, the Environment Agency has overseen 27  successful prosecutions, which have included one suspended prison sentence and  almost &pound;120,000 in fines against illegal waste offenders. Trained and  accredited financial investigators make use of greater powers that are  available to them through the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 and have obtained  confiscation orders that total more than &pound;1 million.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Question 3 has been withdrawn.</p>
    <p class="H5StageHeading">High Hedges Legislation</p>
    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">4. <strong>Mr Irwin </strong>asked the Minister of the Environment to outline the timescale for the  introduction of the high hedges legislation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO  153/10<a name="AQO15310"></a>)</p>
    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">11. <strong>Mr P  Maskey </strong>asked the Minister of the Environment when he plans to introduce  legislation on high hedges and clean neighbourhoods.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 160/10<a name="AQO16010"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: With your permission, Mr Deputy Speaker, I will answer  questions 4 and 11 together.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have already announced that I intend to bring forward  separate Bills on high hedges and clean neighbourhoods within the current  legislative programme. The precise timetable will depend on political  co-operation in the Executive and the Assembly. I am hopeful that the  legislation can be in place by the time that the new councils are formed in  2011.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Irwin</strong>:  Will such legislation cover all types of trees and hedges?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: The legislation will cover mainly the fast growing,  evergreen types of hedges, although it will not be exclusive. It will also  cover other types of trees and hedges that can cause nuisance. Its main focus  will be evergreen trees; for example, leylandii such as the Castlewellan Gold.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>:  What preparatory work will the Minister do with local government, so that when  that much-welcomed legislation is passed, councils are ready to act on it? Many  people have waited for a long time for that legislation. They are grateful that  it will be introduced.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: Now is an appropriate time to legislate. New councils are  being formed that will have greater responsibilities as a result of legislation  that will be put through the House. The Department will put the matter out for  public consultation. Obviously, local government will give its response.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Should the legislation be enacted, councils would not act  as negotiators in disputes; rather, they would be required to investigate  complaints and to reach decisions on whether a hedge adversely affects a  complainant&rsquo;s reasonable enjoyment of his or her property. If a complaint is  upheld, the council would serve a notice on the hedge&rsquo;s owner, which would  require him or her to reduce the size of a hedge within a specified deadline. Failure  to do so would be an offence.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That is what happens in England. I suspect that the  Department will replicate that closely. However, if there are any means to do  it better, the Department is happy to look at them and to listen to any  suggestions that might come from local government, in particular.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  Did I hear the word &ldquo;consultation&rdquo; in the middle of that response? The  Minister&rsquo;s illustrious predecessors went to consultation on at least two  occasions. That is one reason why the problem has dragged on for so long. I am  delighted to hear that the matter of disputes between neighbours could be  resolved through the legislation. Will the matter be put out to consultation  again?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: Yes; my intention is to consult on the matter. I will take  it to the Executive and then to consultation. Hopefully, with the will and  support of the Assembly and the Executive, consultation will move forward as  quickly as possible, and legislation will be brought to the House. Some people have  suggested that that should be done quickly. If the House co-operates with me  and it wants the legislative process to be the fastest possible, the House will  find that the Minister will also co-operate. Therefore, I look forward to help  from the members of the Environment Committee who have spoken about the issue  to ensure that the measures are delivered quickly.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Will the Minister develop that  legislation alongside clean neighbourhoods legislation? Is there any thinking  on that issue? The SDLP has lobbied the Department on that issue for some time.  It would be interesting to hear what cognisance or recognition there is of that  suggestion, which would give local councils stronger powers to deal with  environmental issues.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I will take the clean neighbourhoods legislation forward  separately. I do not want to blur the issues. There will be two separate pieces  of legislation. Departmental officials are already working on both aspects of  legislation. The Member is quite correct: the SDLP has lobbied on the issue. I  am glad that, at last, that party has been useful for something.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Questions 5 and 6 have been withdrawn.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
    <p class="H5StageHeading">Plastic Bag Levy</p>
    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">7. <strong>Mr  McCartney </strong>asked the Minister of the Environment if he plans to introduce a  levy on plastic bags.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 156/10<a name="AQO15610"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I do not have any immediate plans to introduce a levy on  plastic bags.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCartney</strong>:  Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire as an fhreagra sin. I note that the Minister said  that he does not have any plans to introduce a levy. However, will he outline  how he intends to address the issue in the future? Does he wish to introduce a  levy, or is he categorically refusing to address the issue in the future?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I used the word &ldquo;immediate&rdquo; deliberately, because we first  need to identify how successful we have been in reducing the number of plastic  bags. Since the voluntary approach was announced in July, there has been a 38%  reduction in plastic bags in Northern    Ireland. That does not compare favourably  with the rest of the UK,  in which there has been a 48% reduction. However, supermarket sales in Northern Ireland  have gone up. That is good news and is largely to do with the fact that people  from the South are coming to Northern    Ireland to buy goods. It is, therefore,  harder to reduce the amount of bags in a rising market.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The option of doing away with plastic bags altogether  raises other issues. First, in the Republic, there has been a larger take-up of  plastic bin bags. Therefore, people are not using plastic shopping bags, but  they are replacing them with a different type of plastic bag. Secondly, the  potential use of paper bags is a problem because they are heavier and their  production has more of an environmental impact. Therefore, the issue is not  just as straightforward as doing away with all plastic bags.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Nonetheless, we have been successful thus far in reducing  the number of plastic bags by 38%. I want to keep the pressure on supermarkets  and, indeed, smaller shops, because they have work to do to reduce the  percentage further. I will make a decision later, once the voluntary approach  has been carried out fully.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  I ask that the Minister does not make a rash decision about the price of  plastic bags, because last week the media were very interested in the fact that  I spent &pound;2 on plastic bags for my office last year, and I do not want to  increase that cost to the taxpayer.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: If you lived in the Republic of Ireland  &mdash; you do not, and I suspect that, like me, you never will &mdash; you would have had  to pay 44 cents a bag. That is not a lot of money to many people; however, to  those living on the breadline it is. Therefore, I do not want to impose a levy  that will hurt people in a struggling sector when we can introduce a successful  voluntary approach instead. The 38% reduction is a success story, but we need  to go further. We wish to push that figure up, but if we cannot do that, we  will look at introducing a tax on plastic bags.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P J Bradley</strong>:  Does the Minister agree that a levy on plastic bags would discourage their use,  lead to the use of more environmentally friendly options and reduce the total  amount of domestic waste?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: In my response to Mr McCartney&rsquo;s question, I tried to  explain that there are no easy solutions and that no solution is purely  environmentally positive. All of the solutions have negative connotations.  Although we want to discourage the use and the multiplicity of plastic bags, there  is a good success story to be sold and told. Lots of people now buy the  reusable bags for life. I encourage more people to use them, and I encourage  shops to be more reluctant to give plastic bags to customers. I will indicate  to shopkeepers that I expect that to be the case. The levy is the stick, but  let us continue to use the carrot to see whether can get the outcome that we  are looking for. <em>[Interruption.]</em></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I remind Members to switch off mobile phones.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr Robert  Coulter</strong>: As it is now about four months since the Minister raised the issue  of a plastic bag levy, will he detail the expected amount of money such a levy  would raise? Does he agree that any money thus raised should be spent on green  issues in local areas?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I have not investigated the amount of money that a plastic  bag levy would raise. I would be looking to use such a levy as a deterrent, not  as a tax-raising measure. Our party is a party of low taxation, and it is one  that allows people to spend their money as they wish. It is also in favour of  the Government providing services that are fit for purpose. Therefore, I am not  looking for a tax-raising measure; I am looking for and we are working towards  the best environmental outcome.</p>
    <p class="H5StageHeading">Planning Decisions</p>
    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">8. <strong>Mrs M  Bradley </strong>asked the Minister of the Environment what assurance he can give  that the reformed planning policy will contain a strong governance framework to  ensure that, where one political party dominates a given council, this party  will not have undue influence over planning decisions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 157/10<a name="AQO15710"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: The draft local government reorganisation Bill, which my  Department is in the process of taking forward, will facilitate the majority of  local government reform proposals. The Bill will make provision for the  governance arrangements that will apply to the new councils. Those will include  the introduction of a system of checks and balances in each council to allow  the call-in of a decision. The criteria for call-in will cover procedural  matters and any issue that relates to the protection of political minorities.  Legislation will state the triggers that are required for the implementation of  call-in and how matters will be decided.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill will provide for a new ethical standards system  for local government. That will include a mandatory code of conduct for elected  representatives of district councils, with associated processes for  investigating and adjudicating on alleged breaches of the code. Appropriate  governance arrangements and codes of conduct will be essential in the post-RPA  planning system, not only to provide assurances to the public that the system  is open, fair and transparent and that decisions are made in accordance with  all relevant considerations but to protect councillors and planning officers.  Planning officials will continue to work with NILGA and DOE local government  colleagues through the RPA implementation of structures on those issues.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his answer. Will he be working with the transition  committees to develop those governance standards and safeguards? Does he agree  that, by failing to introduce a governance framework, he is leaving the planning  system open to abuse?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I am very happy to work with the transition committees,  and I intend to visit each of them. Two weeks ago, I started in the north-west,  visiting the transition committee of Coleraine Borough Council, Limavady  Borough Council, Moyle District Council and Ballymoney Borough Council. That  committee is working well and is doing good work in the circumstances in which  it finds itself.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We are setting up a regional transition committee that will  have representatives from all the main political parties. We are working very  closely with the strategic leadership board, another meeting of which will take  place next week. That all demonstrates that a very strong train of thought  exists between the Department and local government on identifying the best  solutions for going forward.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I do not think that public representatives are any more  likely or, indeed, any less likely than people in the public service to accept  bungs or bribes. It does not reflect well if we are suggesting that public  represent&shy;atives are of that ilk. Across the parties, I have found that public  representatives are, by and large, there to serve the public. Although there is  always potential for a rotten apple to be in the barrel, that is the exception  as opposed to the rule.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  Does the Minister agree that regardless of which party runs which council,  planning policies will have been laid down and agreed and that the Minister and  his Department will expect councils to abide solely by those policies?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: Absolutely. However, planning policy is not a perfect  science. Building control is an engineering process that demands that, for  example, a flight of stairs run at a certain gradient with so many centimetres  between each step. Planning is more judgemental. There will be very clear cases  in which planning applications are refused. In such cases, a councillor saying  that they have known the applicant&rsquo;s family for 30 years and that they are  great people in the neighbourhood will not be a good enough reason to challenge  the decision. That is not a planning reason. If a councillor does not have a  planning reason with which to challenge the planning officer&rsquo;s recommendation,  that officer&rsquo;s decision or recommendation will stand. Councillors are the  decision-makers, but they will have to make their decisions on the basis of  prevailing planning policy.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Boylan</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. The Environment Committee, of  which I am a member, has no problem working with the Minister if he wants to  legislate in a hurry, especially legislation that deals with clean  neighbourhoods and high hedges.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Does the Minister have sufficient resources to fully implement  the recommendations in the review of public administration, such as those on  planning reform?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: All of this is a continual process. For example, last week  the Executive were considering the allocation of additional resources to deal  with swine flu. There are always challenges and difficulties. We are moving  forward and have the ability to continue to move forward apace; there is no  reason to stop.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I intend to ensure that the funding follows the function  and that there is no separation of the funding from the function; that is, I  will ensure that the Department does not keep a portion of the money for a  different purpose, leaving local councils to carry the burden. If the  Department gives local councils work to do, it should give them the money that  it is getting to carry out that work.</p>
    <p class="H5StageHeading">Irish Hare</p>
    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">9. <strong>Mr Burns </strong>asked the Minister of the Environment what protection will be given to the  Irish hare in the review of the Wildlife Order. (AQO  158/10<a name="AQO15810"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: The review of the Wildlife (Northern Ireland) Order 1985  considered statutory protection for the Irish hare in the longer term. The  consultation exercise demonstrated that the existing protection in the Wildlife  (Northern Ireland)  Order 1985 was satisfactory because, as a game species, the Irish hare is  protected each year during the close season for hunting. There was also  agreement from respondents that efforts to maintain and restore a suitable  habitat offers the best means of achieving long-term sustainability of the  Irish hare population. That is the approach that I propose to pursue.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burns</strong>:  Does the Minister intend to keep funding the Irish hare population study at  Queen&rsquo;s University after 2010?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I cannot make a decision until I see the outcome of the  study and see how the figures are faring. The Irish hare is an animal that is  worthy of our concern. It is worth continually looking at the population of the  Irish hare to ensure that it is not just maintained but actually grows. Many of  the actions that are being carried out through the countryside management  scheme will increase the habitat of the Irish hare and could have a much more  positive impact than anything else that we do.</p>
    <p class="H5StageHeading">Permitted Development</p>
    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">10. <strong>Dr W  McCrea </strong>asked the Minister of the Environment what steps he is taking to  allow minor works to be categorised as &lsquo;permitted development&rsquo; to reduce costs  and speed up the backlog in the planning system.&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 159/10<a name="AQO15910"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: My Department will shortly bring forward three public  consultation exercises that will seek views on proposals to extend permitted  development rights for development within the curtilage of a dwelling house;  introduce new permitted development rights for small-scale renewable energy  development; and extend rights for a number of other development types,  including agriculture, industry, commerce and retail, community and leisure and  utilities and minerals. It is anticipated that the proposed changes will  significantly reduce the number of planning applications required for a minor  development. The consultation period will run until January 2010.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr W McCrea</strong>:  What specific proposals does the Minister have for introducing changes to  non-householder permitted development?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: We are looking at policies on microgeneration for  situations in which people are engaged in developing small-scale  renewable-energy technologies, including micro wind turbines, heat pumps,  biomass plants and solar panels for both householder and non-householder use.  We are looking at opportunities in agriculture, such as products made from  produce grown on farms, farm shops that sell local produce and storage and  distribution uses. We are also looking at industrial warehouse development for  extensions of premises by up to 1000 sq m and of free-standing buildings by up  to 100 sq m; quarry development for plant or machinery associated with an  existing quarry; new buildings up to 1000 sq m; and the development required  for health, safety and welfare, such as the provision of chemical toilets and  hygiene facilities for staff, safety structures and temporary structures for  shelter. In commercial development, shop extensions of up to 50 sq m are being  considered, as is the construction of stores for trolleys and bins. In offices,  extensions of up to 50 sq m are being considered. That covers a wide range.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have put together a file of papers that will be going to  the Committee for the Environment. It is five inches thick and will involve a  lot of reading by the Committee staff before they can advise members. I look  forward to the consultation and the results of it.</p>

    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I am sure that the Member will be delighted to learn that  last week the subcommittee agreed to the proposals going forward to the  Executive, and I will put a paper to the Executive in the very near future. I  trust that all the parties on the Executive will come to a swift conclusion on  this matter, and that we have agreement to move forward for all those whom we  represent in rural communities.</p>

    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The next item of business is the motion on migrant workers. The  Business Committee has agreed to allow up to one hour and 30 minutes for the  debate.<em> <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]<strong></strong></span></em></p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">If Members are leaving, they should do so quietly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The proposer will have 10 minutes to propose the motion and  10 minutes in which to make a winding-up speech. All other Members who speak  will have five minutes.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: I beg  to move</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly notes the  economic, social and cultural contributions from migrant workers; and calls on  the Executive to review the migrant workers strategy and to re-establish the  Racial Equality Forum to consider further support for immigrants.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The UK  was one of the three original states that opened their labour markets to the  eight accession countries from eastern Europe in the wake of the EU expansion  in 2004. As a result, after decades of negative migration &mdash; more people leaving  than coming in &mdash; Northern Ireland suddenly faced an influx of thousands of  migrant workers to fill vacancies arising from our skills and labour shortages.  However, statistics have shown that numbers of migrants are decreasing, due, in  part, to the economic downturn but also to a natural decline in the supply of  workers, which is not inexhaustible, the opening up of labour markets in other  parts of the UK and unfavourable exchange rates.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA)  estimated that, at the end of 2008, there were 30,000 migrants from the A8  countries in Northern    Ireland, comprising around 5% of its  workforce. The majority of the migrant workers live in Belfast, Dungannon,  Craigavon and the Newry and Mourne areas and have jobs in administration,  manufacturing, food processing, hospitality and construction. Research from the  European Commission and the UK  shows that migrant workers have had a generally positive impact on the economy.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">3.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I was a member of the promoting social inclusion working  group on race, which became the Racial Equality Forum, whose aim was to  formulate, implement and monitor the racial equality strategy that was  eventually published in 2005. Since 2006, the forum has not met once, and the  strategy has been dead in the water, awaiting publication of the cohesion,  sharing and integration strategy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The most productive outcome of the forum has been the  migrant workers strategy, which was produced by its thematic subgroup and has  now reached the end of its stipulated lifespan of three years. That strategy  requires a review, but there is no forum to determine its future.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department for Employment and Learning has lead  responsibility for implementing the strategy&rsquo;s action plans, together with  other subgroup members from statutory and voluntary agencies, all of whom  should be complimented on achieving many of the set targets.There is now a  range of information packs and materials on websites to provide migrant workers  with a better understanding of their employment rights and available services.  The Equality Commission has also produced guidance for employers who hire  migrants. There is better employment inspection and enforcement to protect  migrant workers and prevent exploitation, particularly with the imminent passing  of the Employ&shy;ment Bill to strengthen employment agency law and the  investigatory powers of the Department for Employment and Learning.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, the strategy has so far been focused totally on  economic issues. It is essential that it considers the wider integration and  social needs of migrant workers from EU and non-EU countries. The voluntary  sector has reported a high percentage of destitution among the migrant  community because of the economic downturn and the problem of their having no  recourse to public funds.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The rights and entitlements available to migrant workers  vary a great deal under the Home Office points scheme depending on whether the  person is from a long-standing EU country, the A8 accession states, the more  recent A2 countries or elsewhere. A8 nationals must register with the Home  Office workers&rsquo; registration scheme when they arrive and find work in the UK to get the  right to reside and to access in-work social security benefits, such as tax  credits and housing benefit. However, if they lose that job within the first  year &mdash; for example, because of the seasonal nature of the work &mdash; and cannot  find alternative employment within 30 days, the right-to-reside status is lost.  Generally, they are not asked to leave the UK, but they cannot access  unemployment benefit and are no longer entitled to access public housing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Many migrant workers do not have a lot of savings and, when  they lose employment, the consequences can be dire. At a time when they most  need help, the safety net is not there. Those from outside the European  Economic Area who hold work permits are also in a tenuous position, at risk of  being exploited or made unexpectedly redundant or becoming undocumented for  reasons beyond their control.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It can be extremely difficult to transfer a permit to a new  employer, and that has created a rights vacuum. The Republic of Ireland  recently addressed that issue by introducing a bridging visa scheme that  provided a four-month buffer for people who find themselves in that situation.  I dealt with such a case in my constituency, and it would have been hugely  positive and helpful to know that a temporary safety net existed for someone  who may have already been subjected to mistreatment or exploitation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The voluntary housing sector and church groups often try to  provide some assistance. The Council for the Homeless Northern Ireland reported  that 955 foreign nationals sought shelter between June 2008 and June 2009 and  that 619 of those people were accommodated.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A2 nationals from Bulgaria  and Romania  face even more restrictions. They are either self-employed or recruited under a  work permit scheme, and the jobs that they fill must be proven not to have  attracted any local applicants. They have no recourse to public funds and,  therefore, are not entitled to emergency housing. That was the case with the  Roma families who were intimidated out of their homes in south Belfast last June. In Craigavon, Roma  families and children have had difficulties in registering with GPs. Both the  Law Centre and the Human Rights Commission have advocated a government support  fund that could be accessed by voluntary organisations on a grant-aid basis to  provide accommodation, support and other assistance for migrant workers who  face destitution.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive must consider the scope of the gaps in  welfare provision and fill them through greater flexibility in statutory and  voluntary services in crisis situations. In Scotland, nationals from A8 member  states have the same rights to housing and homelessness assistance as nationals  from long-standing EEA states. The Home Office is proposing to extend the  workers&rsquo; registration scheme for another two years. The Executive should oppose  that proposal, because it discriminates against A2 and A8 nationals.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is also a great need to help new migrant communities  to build their capacity to provide self-help and advocacy for their community  and to network with the wider community. I call on OFMDFM to re-establish the  Racial Equality Forum; to review the strategy; and to allow the thematic  subgroup to extend its actions to meet the wider social and integration needs  of migrant communities.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Buchanan</strong>:  The motion calls on the Assembly to note the economic, social and cultural  contributions made by migrant workers in Northern Ireland. That is something  that we can all associate ourselves with. We all witness the valuable  contributions that have been and continue to be made by migrant workers in  various employment sectors. It must be recognised that some of those jobs would  have fallen off the ladder had it not been for the migrant workforce that took  those jobs and ensured the economic viability of small and medium-sized enterprises  by keeping industrial costs to a minimum.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">During the economic boom, migrant workers were vital in  filling Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  skills gap, especially in the construction industry, which was one of the  largest growing sectors. The industrious base of migrant workers helped to  facilitate the expansion of the services sector by taking on posts that would  otherwise have been difficult to fill. We can see the contribution that migrant  workers make right across our Departments, whether Health, Agriculture or any  other Department.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important to note that, between May 2004 and June 2007,  there was an influx of some 25,600 applications to work in Northern Ireland  from foreign nationals from eight different countries. That equates to 24  applications per thousand of Northern    Ireland&rsquo;s working-age population. That is  much higher than the UK  average, which was 18 applications for each 1,000 people of working age.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The increase in the number of migrant workers has created  various difficulties with employment rights, the minimum wage, maternity leave,  holidays and so on. I know that the Committee for Employment and Learning  fought extremely hard for migrant workers&rsquo; employment rights to be respected.  The Committee also engaged with other organisations, including Citizens Advice,  to publicise those rights more widely in migrant workers&rsquo; languages. Those  workers were being exploited badly and abused by unscrupulous employers.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As part of the migrant workers strategy and in the light of  the difficulties that such workers were facing because of the activities of  gangmasters, in October 2007, the Department for Employment and Learning  appointed an inspector to ensure compliance with the regulations governing  employment agencies, with a second inspector being appointed in June 2008. The  most recent figures up to November 2008 show that 80 inspections have been  carried out. Further loopholes will be closed when the Employment Bill, which  has been agreed, as drafted, by the Committee, goes through the House. The Bill  will allow for DEL  inspectors and Revenue and Customs minimum wage compliance officers to share  data. Migrant workers have also been exploited in that regard.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion calls for the re-establishment of the Racial  Equality Forum. That body has been lying dormant for some time, and I am not so  sure that its re-establishment could be justified or be shown to the best use  of financial resources. I wonder whether any work that the body might carry out  would be a duplication of the work that has been done already by the Equality  Commission and all the individual migrant workers&rsquo; welfare groups, which engage  continually with the various Departments. I ask the Minister to first give  serious consideration to the work that the commission and the other groups have  done, otherwise we could end up with a plethora of bureaucratic duplication.  That is not what we want; rather, we want to ensure that we have in place  something that works.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We must face reality. As a result of the recession, a  number of migrant workers have returned to their own countries. A practical and  sensitive approach must be taken to calls for jobs to be retained for our own  local workers. Although we are aware of the immense contribution that migrant  workers make, nevertheless, in the middle of a recession and in the face of  increased unemployment, we must get our priorities right in securing employment  for our local people.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I ask the Member to draw his remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Buchanan</strong>:  We must encourage more of our economically inactive people into the workplace  and equip industry with the necessary skills and incentives.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Anderson</strong>:  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat. Ba mhaith liom taca&iacute;ocht a thabhairt don r&uacute;n.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I support the motion. Unfortunately, the exploitation of  migrant workers is very much a reality in our society. That exploitation  manifests itself in a wide variety of situations in which workers are taken advantage  of and denied their rights under domestic and EU law. Exploitation can range  from discriminatory practice in pay and conditions to forced labour. Such  exploitation is particularly prominent in sectors that are poorly regulated.  Many of the staff affected are domestic workers, cleaners and restaurant and  hotel staff.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Migrant workers here are exploited and abused routinely.  They are paid poor wages and denied basic rights and entitlements such as sick  pay, holiday pay, overtime and rates of pay equivalent to those for other  staff. That is why there was support among migrant workers for the Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development&rsquo;s decision to retain the Agricultural Wages  Board. The issue does not affect only migrant workers; the exploitation of  agency workers, migrant or not, is also on the increase. More and more  employers are using agency workers to avoid the responsibility to comply with  established terms and conditions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I highlight that because it is a pressing issue in my  constituency, where employees of Stream International, most of whom work for  agencies, face redundancy and have virtually no compensation to which they can  look forward.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Four years ago, the shocking story of Oksana Sukhanova from  Ukraine  illustrated the full horror that migrant workers experience here. She was 23  years old when she was found freezing on the streets of Coleraine during the  Christmas period in 2004. She lost both legs to frostbite. Oksana had been  employed by a factory in Rasharkin but became homeless when it laid her off.  The company did nothing wrong and met its few legal obligations, but Oksana was  thrown out into the cold. We must ask ourselves what that says about us as a  society. What does it say about the lack of legal protection for migrant  workers?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in has always stood shoulder to shoulder with the  workers and will continue to do so. That is why we support the motion. It is  also why Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s &lsquo;Rights and Respect&rsquo; document, which was launched a couple  of weeks ago, proposes the establishment of a multi-agency partnership between  indigenous, multi-ethnic, and migrant workers&rsquo; communities to embed further in  society a culture of rights and respect and the celebration of diversity.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It would be remiss of me not to address two related issues.  Whatever political ideology one supports, it becomes irrelevant when minority  ethnic and migrant workers need legislative protection, such as could be provided  within the framework of a robust bill of rights. We are also under the  obligation, through a single equality Bill, to put in place an equality  framework that looks to the future of a developing and increasingly complex  society, and we have the power to do so.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At present, the North has a fragmented array of legislative  instruments that apply different standards of protection to the various strands  of society that face discrimination. That fragmentation has proved difficult  and confusing. It is often costly for individuals, particularly migrant workers  who seek to assert their rights, but also employers and service providers who  seek to understand and observe their legal obligations.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in endorses the motion&rsquo;s call for the  re-establishment of the Racial Equality Forum and a review of the migrant  workers strategy. Sinn F&eacute;in also recognises the contribution that migrant  workers have made to communities. They are not, as some suggest, spongers. I  find some of the comments that have been made about migrant workers disturbing.  They did not come here to live on benefits or to steal other people&rsquo;s jobs. In  fact, the figures from DSD show that the vast majority of migrant workers  register for National Insurance numbers &mdash; when they are permitted to do so by  their employers. They are intent on making an honest living and contributing to  society. Their contribution should be recognised, respected and cherished, not  abused or exploited.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">For all the reasons that I outlined, and for many more  besides, Sinn F&eacute;in supports the motion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  I thank Anna Lo for tabling the motion. As Dungannon is part of my  constituency, I am aware that migrant workers are important to that area and to  its industrial base. For many years, the large influx of migrant workers has  been important to industry there. Migrant workers also help to fill the skills  gap in the Province&rsquo;s Health Service, and I am pleased that many of them have a  high skills base.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I know about many of the frustrations being experienced  because many migrant workers visit my constituency office in Dungannon. I am  only too willing to try to help in any way that I can, but sometimes that is  difficult. As it can be tricky to get to the bottom of many issues, it is not  easy to overcome them. Therefore, there needs to be a one-stop shop to try to  give those migrant workers the assistance that is clearly needed, whether that  be in revenue services, basic translation services or, indeed, in other  services, such as education and health.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are rights and responsibilities for everyone  concerned. Economists, businesspeople and employers recognise the importance of  those workers&rsquo; skills. They recognise that those people have something huge to  offer society in Northern    Ireland, which is evidenced by a number of  those individuals who move up the promotional ranks very quickly in businesses  in our community.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Local people in the areas in which migrant workers live  have a responsibility to accept those workers and to allow them to live, with  respect and dignity, in a peaceful society. Migrant workers also have respons&shy;ibilities:  they need to recognise and accept local cultures and traditions in the areas in  which they live. To be blunt: all the issues that I have highlighted often  garner diverse opinions among the locals and the migrant workers. That  sometimes brings conflict, which is a huge difficulty. Often, the workplace is  the best place for migrant workers to be.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is an educational process that must be taken up by  the communities and by the migrant workers. Otherwise, if we are not careful,  we will have constant conflict, which could become the new sectarianism of Northern Ireland,  in which the traditions of locals and migrants will be pitched against each  other instead of the old Protestant and Roman Catholic traditions. It is  important that, in areas that have large numbers of migrant workers, there is  an educational process. In Dungannon, good work is being undertaken in areas  such as Cunninghams Lane,  where locals and migrant workers integrate well. That is helped by the positive  attitude of local communities.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Until we have that co-operation and support from one  another, we will have conflict, which there has been in certain areas. Migrant  workers should be respected, but, equally, migrant workers should respect local  people and local traditions.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Hanna</strong>: I  thank Anna Lo for tabling the motion because it is important that we recognise  the contribution that migrant workers make to life in Northern Ireland  in relation to our economy, society and culture.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP believes that all migrant workers, like all  citizens, are entitled to civil rights and the protection of interests. The  Human Rights Commission has defined those rights in advice guides for migrant  workers. I find those documents useful in my constituency office in South Belfast, a constituency in which a considerable  number of migrant workers live. Many come to my office for advice on a range of  issues, including housing, employment, education and social protection.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, the rights of migrant workers are complicated  within the law. At times, the law is unclear, especially when EU law meets  domestic law. Migrant workers pay tax and National Insurance and should,  therefore, expect to receive their entitlements to services and support. Most,  but not all, migrant workers do. It is essential that migrant workers are made  fully aware of the administration that is required to ensure their entitlements  should they become redundant.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Many migrant workers end up jobless, particularly A8  nationals, such as those who are from the Czech   Republic, Estonia,  Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania,  Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia. Further clarification is  needed for those whose status is often unclear. It is unclear what support is  available to those who are unable to work but who have been deemed economically  inactive; for example, pregnant women. Further clarity is required.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is a particular problem with foreign women who get  pregnant while they are employed in Northern Ireland. Many of them end  up jobless, homeless and in a women&rsquo;s refuge, so there needs to be far more  clarity and transparency to enable them to access services, as, indeed, there  must be for professionals who work with migrant workers, particularly those in  social services.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The summer was a bleak time in South   Belfast, when, as we all remember, the Roma families in Belgravia Avenue  and Wellesley Avenue  were attacked. That situation generated such negative publicity that it is  essential that it does not happen again. Again, it was about the clarity of  those people&rsquo;s status and entitlement.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Communities such as ours definitely and desperately need  diversity. We need new thinking and ideas to enable us to open up to the rest  of the world. The Poles, with around 40,000 people in Northern Ireland,  make up the largest number of migrant workers. There are about 15,000  Lithuanians and 10,000 Slovaks. It is important that those migrant workers&rsquo;  needs are met. Therefore, in light of recent events, the migrant workers  strategy must be looked at again, and the Racial Equality Forum must be  re-established. I hope that the Executive will agree.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department for Employment and Learning published  &lsquo;Attitudes to Migrant Workers: Results from the Northern Ireland Omnibus  Survey&rsquo;, and it would be an understatement to say that the results were mixed.  Members who have read the report will know that 49% of respondents agreed or  strongly agreed that migrant workers are generally good for the local economy.  However, 45% of respondents felt that migrant workers take jobs from people who  were born in Northern    Ireland. In addition, 59% of respondents  agreed or strongly agreed that migrant workers are harder-working than local  workers, but 63% of respondents felt that the number of migrant workers coming  to Northern Ireland puts a strain on services. The public&rsquo;s attitude to migrant  workers is at best ambivalent, so we need to work on providing good civic  education.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP is keen for the UK Government to sign up to the UN  Migrant Workers&rsquo; Convention, the main aim of which is to foster respect for  migrant workers&rsquo; human rights. Migrant workers are not just workers, they are  human beings, and the convention does not create new rights for them. It aims  to guarantee equality of treatment and the same working conditions for migrants  as nationals.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">All visitors to our country, long- and short-term, must be  treated with respect and signposted to the help, support and advice that they  require. The SDLP has broad humanitarian intentions towards migrant workers,  who have chosen to come to our country to work hard in order to make a life for  themselves and their families. They contribute to the economy and to the  community in general, and they have become as much a part of the country as any  national citizen.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member should draw her remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Hanna</strong>:  Therefore, they are entitled to the same rights and dignity.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hilditch</strong>:  I also support the motion, as most right-thinking and decent people would. I  think that everybody in society recognises the economic, social and cultural  contributions that migrant workers have made.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank Ms Lo for tabling the motion, which does not give  me any great cause for concern. However, I need to be a little more convinced  that re-establishing the Racial Equality Forum to provide further support for  migrants would help to eradicate the problems that surround the issue. We do  not wish to create a vacuum that can be filled by the unscrupulous.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I know from first-hand experience that migrant workers have  had a positive impact on our economy and make a valuable contribution. They  fill vital jobs in healthcare services, the hotel and catering industry and  many more hard-to-fill vacancies. My personal circumstances meant that, in the  past year, I had to visit a local hospital to complete a procedure. The theatre  was completely filled with Filipino doctors and nurses, and there is no doubt  in my mind that I would still be on a lengthy waiting list if the hospital had  not employed those people. Furthermore, in my constituency, a large car  electronic components factory is a major employer, and it would not be there if  it were not for migrant workers. That company also provides support and jobs  for local people.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Many recruitment agencies rely on foreign immigrants to  fill urgent daily work placements. That is because people have arrived in Northern Ireland  solely to look for work. They register as temporary workers with agencies and  are available for short-term positions, and they can turn up at very short  notice.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">For many of our local unemployed, it is not financially  viable to accept temporary placements, involving a day here and a day there.  That would mean that they would have to arrange childcare, and their benefits  would be interrupted. Sometimes, because of family commitments, they are unable  to travel to work at only a few hours&rsquo; notice. A void has been filled by  migrant workers, who are very welcome.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We are extremely concerned at the rise of unemploy&shy;ment  figures in Northern Ireland.  Since the economic downturn, the annual increases in unemployment have been  extreme. The latest figures reveal that there are around 49,000 people in Northern Ireland  without employment. That is totally unacceptable. Those people, too, should be  given every opportunity to avail themselves of jobs, and they are worthy of  further support from the Executive.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Internal and global migration have been economic realities  for a long time and we have no issue with today&rsquo;s global economy, the flow of  labour around the world market, or the fact that people want to improve their  living standards. That is why the rights of these folks must be seriously  considered. Nevertheless, we have an unemployment crisis that also needs to be  addressed urgently. For that reason alone, I urge the Executive to provide  further support for migrant workers, who are present throughout our communities.  I have no hesitation in supporting the motion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  I also support the motion. I thank the Members who tabled it and who have  enabled us to express our support for its sentiments.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are three parts to the motion. First, it acknowledges  the contribution of people from many different communities who have come here  as migrant workers. Secondly, it requests a review of the migrant workers  strategy, and we support that. The third element is a request for the  re-establishment of the Racial Equality Forum.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I represent South Belfast,  which is one of the most demographically diverse constituencies. A manifestation  of the richness of that diversity, and a recent addition to our physical  landscape, is the Chinese Welfare Association&rsquo;s centre on the Ormeau Road. That  is a great addition to the local community. However, that facility was not  easily won by the local Chinese community, and I commend the members of that  community who have come here, generation after generation, in various waves of  immigration. Many of them are now members of the indigenous population. They  have brought an additional richness to the local community. By dint of their  hard work, their contribution and the respect that they have gained, we now  have that centre: a physical manifestation of their presence. That is to be  warmly commended.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">All Members who have spoken so far have testified that they  have come into contact, through local constituency offices, the Health Service  or many of the other sectors in which they are engaged, with people from  different backgrounds, nationalities and countries, all of whom have made  massive, important and positive contributions not only to our local economy,  but to local cultural and community life. That has enriched us all.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As Carmel Hanna has said, in the past few months we have  had some difficulties in South Belfast that have brought shame on the  constituency and on society as a whole. I do not wish to detract from what she  has said. Unfortunately, not for nothing was South Belfast  called by some a capital of the world for race problems. However, that is not  to minimise the tremendous work that is ongoing in that area by many  individuals.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I look forward to hearing the Minister speak on the migrant  workers strategy shortly. A number of commit&shy;ments were made, and there have  been improvements in monitoring and regulation. However, some of the statistics  are quite scary. A lot of migrant workers are employed by agencies. Across the island of Ireland, there are about 600 employment  agencies for a population of three million people. In Poland, at the  other end of the scale, there are fewer than 800 agencies for a working  population of 40 million. The potential for difficulties arises when such a  large scale is involved.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I support the motion, from the point of view of our local  experience and against a backdrop in which the UN Committee on Economic, Social  and Cultural Rights recorded, in May, its continuing concern at what it  described as the de facto discrimination experienced by many people,  particularly those from disadvantaged and marginalised groups and communities.  The UN Committee&rsquo;s report went on to cite people who are disadvantaged workers,  and, unfortunately, many migrant workers fall into that category.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The third element of the motion concerns the  re-establishment of the Racial Equality Forum. Having been a member of the  all-party working group on black and ethnic minority communities, I know that  there were always arguments about whether the forum was a good or bad thing. I  consider it to be a good thing, because it is one more way of bringing in  people who have direct experience and who are key stakeholders. It is important  that their voices are heard and that government institutions work for all the  communities contained in the sentiment of the motion. Therefore, on that basis,  and given what Members have said during the debate, I support the motion in its  entirety.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Irwin</strong>: I  welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate. I state at the outset my  support for the right of migrant workers to come to Northern Ireland for employment and  to do so without fear of racial attack.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A number of unsavoury incidents and attacks on migrant  workers have been reported in the press recently. There have also been  inter-racial attacks, including some very serious incidents. One such incident  occurred in my constituency recently, in which an employer who tried to stop a  disturbance between two groups was driven over by a car belonging to one of the  groups. His legs were broken and he was very seriously injured. I can think of  instances in recent months in which migrant workers have been subjected to  abuse by a small, narrow-minded minority in the community. Everyone in their  right mind condemns such activity.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As the motion suggests, migrant workers have, indeed,  contributed to the economic, social and cultural growth of our Province. They  have filled employment gaps and provided a boost to our skills base, for  instance, in the manufacturing sector and the construction industry. No one can  deny the contribution that has been made. That has also been the case across  the United Kingdom.  Since the terrible tragedy in which cockle pickers died in Morecambe Bay  in 2004, the Government have done much to improve the rights and prospects of  migrant workers and to safeguard them through the Gangmasters Licensing  Authority and the stringent requirements that it brings with it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Ms Lo argues that in the print media today words come easy  in condemning attacks, and that she wishes to see delivery and implementation.  I agree that it is easy to say the right thing. However, one must not forget  that Northern Ireland  is emerging from its own long period of inter-community strife. I argue that  with respect to today&rsquo;s attitudes towards migrant workers and people of  different races, Northern    Ireland is by no means a horror story. There  have been some unsavoury incidents. However, on the whole, our people, our  employers, and our local and regional authorities have welcomed migrant workers.  As a local councillor, I know that my local authority has been particularly  proactive in accommodating and improving prospects for migrant workers through  a number of schemes spread across the full spectrum of nationalities and that  the feedback has been positive.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I ask whether we need the return of another forum when many  facets of administration are already delivering their own initiatives for  improving the prospects of migrant workers.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  I commend Anna Lo and Naomi Long for proposing the motion. It focuses our  attention on the increase in the number of migrant workers who have come to  this part of the country, particularly over the past decade. That has presented  us all with many challenges to our approach to accepting difference. Most migrant  workers make a positive contribution to our economy, but I will return to that  issue later.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is a great pity that more work has not been done on &lsquo;A  Shared Future&rsquo; and the triennial action plan in particular, which would have  put in place a strategy on racial integration. We all understand how important  it is to have a strategy for such important work.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Without a strategy, there is a vacuum, and that can work in  a couple of ways. First, the statutory services and voluntary organisations,  which work to promote racial integration and to help migrant workers to settle  into the local community, are at a loss as to what direction they should be  taking.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, the problem with a vacuum, as Members know, is  that it is sometimes filled by people who like to stir up hatred, and we have  seen that manifest itself in racial attacks that have been carried out in most,  if not all, the constituencies of Northern Ireland. I am sure that  Members will agree that the actions of the small number of people who engage in  such activities are reprehensible and bring disgrace on us all.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are significant numbers of migrant workers in Fermanagh  and South Tyrone, particularly in Dungannon and Enniskillen, and they engage in  various activities; in Dungannon, they are involved in food processing in  particular, and, in Fermanagh, construction and engineering. Many of our  significant Indian community are involved in health work. However, in the  absence of a strategy from OFMDFM, the councils in that constituency, as is the  case with councils everywhere else, are doing tremendous work in focusing  attention on tolerance and in promoting cultural activities in which many of  the new workers in those parts of the constituency actively engage. I commend  all those who promote that work, because it is often left to the councils and  non-statutory organisations to look after such matters as benefit entitlement  and employment rights.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Much good work is being done in delivering those  programmes, which further good relations and which are beneficial to migrant  workers. However, much of the help is on a stop-go basis, because, in the  absence of a strategy, funding often comes from peace programmes. At this time,  when we are waiting for Peace III applications to be dealt with, the  organisations involved in the delivery of such programmes feel that their future  is uncertain. That is why the triennial action plan needs to be looked at again  by OFMDFM. The strategy needs to be put in place, and it must be supported by  sufficient resources to ensure that the programmes work effectively.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I support the motion. There is no doubt that migrant workers can and do  integrate well and that the service that they provide in many areas of the  Province is beneficial.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I declare an interest as a member of Ards Borough Council,  which recently agreed to hold English language classes for Polish workers in  the Ards borough through the South   Eastern Regional   College. No doubt the  Minister will also mention that. Research carried out in the Ards borough has  shown that the number of Polish workers has increased significantly, with many  working in industries there, and the problem of speaking English has been  identified as the main training need for those migrant workers. That need was  identified and, through those language classes, it was responded to.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As there was no direct contact between Ards Borough Council  and the large Polish community in that area &mdash; although there was contact with  the Lithuanian community &mdash; it was agreed to put on a 12-week class of two hours  each week through the South   Eastern Regional   College. The council&rsquo;s  good relations budget was used to help to fund the classes, and it had the full  backing of the Ards Intercultural Forum. There are also plans to replicate the  courses in Comber and Portavogie, where there are also large numbers of Polish  workers.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Tha raisin fer this wus that fer tha real cumin tha tither  o&rsquo; migrant woarkers intae oor cummunitees, ther haes tae be tiem aside fer  takkin things iver tae heft tae git aa&rsquo; troo unnerstaunin. Aa&rsquo; wus at tha lanch  o&rsquo; tha Oardinary Leevs exhibitshun at Stormoont fer migrant woarkers, whuch  showed tha impoartin an vital roul they play in oor modrin society.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Aa&rsquo; hae aften visited Poalish groups an ither migrant  woarkers leevin in tha Airdes area, whau left Englan an whau noo wroucht in  Huddleston Engineerin&rsquo; an in tha fish factories an they aw play an impoartin  pert in oor woarkforce.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The reason for the classes is that for the real integration  of migrant workers into our communities, good communication is required to  enable true understanding to develop. I attended the launch of the Ordinary  Lives exhibition at Stormont for migrant workers, which underlined the fact  that those workers play a vital role in our modern society.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have often visited groups of Polish and other migrant  workers living in Ballywalter, who left England and who work locally in  Huddleston Engineering and in the fish factories and who are an important part  of our workforce. They have integrated into society, they pay their taxes like  everyone else and they add their culture and language to the brogues of the Ards Peninsula.  There, Ulster Scots is mingled with Polish, Latvian and Lithuanian, and the  message has gone out that we must reach out to all our European neighbours now  living in the Province. I am not sure whether there is anywhere else in the  Province where one will find those languages mixing with Ulster Scots, but it  is found in my neck of the woods because all the migrant workers there are  learning to speak it. That adds to the multicultural society here and to the  smiles and the humour, which are infectious.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There was an initiative by the citizens advice bureau  called the imagine project for migrant workers. Following the receipt of a  &pound;83,000 grant, the citizens advice bureau brought together all the government  bodies that support migrant workers in the Londonderry room in Newtownards Town  Hall, and a large number of migrant workers living in the Ards borough, from  places such as Lithuania, Latvia and Poland attended. They were young men and  women who were eager for work, and some of those whom I spoke to lived in  Portaferry, Killinchy and Ards and worked as tilers, bricklayers, in the local  restaurants and for Willowbrook Foods. They were just ordinary folk from  foreign lands doing hard work in local factories and on the fishing boats. The  need for English-language classes was top of the agenda, and I am sure that the  Minister will want to raise the fact that the local South Eastern   Regional College  responded to that need.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Society has recognised that there are a great many ethnic  minorities in the Ards borough that contribute to society, create employment  and interrelate with everyone. There are a large number of migrant workers  across the Ards area working in farms and factories. The work is hard, but they  work hard and do well, and their hard work is recognised.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is no doubt that some of the old division lines still  exist in the Province, and some new division lines have appeared with the  increase in migrant workers and new prejudices rising to the fore. However,  much work has been done in the community to combat that, and I extend my  congratulations to the community workers who have worked so hard to ensure that  all are included in their schemes and who, in some cases, go as far as  arranging cooking lessons to help the migrant workers to get used to our food.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I believe in all the projects that are taking place in my  constituency, which are essential. I support those projects, as they enable men  and women from all countries to come here and make their contribution, pay  their taxes and enhance our country. It appears that a great system is already  in operation, certainly in my constituency, and I congratulate all those who  are involved in that work.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I support the motion, I support the spirit of the motion,  and I appreciate the role that those who work in our country play.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning (Sir Reg Empey)</strong>: I welcome the opportunity to speak  on this important motion, and I thank Members who spoke on these increasingly  important matters.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion covers a broad range of issues concerning not  only migrant workers but migrants generally. New communities in our society are  very welcome for the economic benefits, skills, new ideas and fresh  perspectives that they bring. Evidence suggests that migrants fill skills  shortages and do jobs that indigenous people are reluctant to do in times of  economic growth. It has been pointed out in the past that, as Members have  said, our Health Service would probably come to a stop overnight without the  many internationally recruited nurses and doctors. Without them, it would not  be possible to deliver vital front line services.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In their Programme for Government, the Executive committed  to deliver:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;a peaceful, fair and  prosperous society &hellip; with respect for the rule of law&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Furthermore, the Executive agreed to drive a  programme across Government to reduce poverty and address inequality and  disadvantage in order to make people&rsquo;s lives better &mdash; PSA target 7. The  commitment of objective 5 under PSA target 7 is to promote equality and the  enforcement of rights, including the commitment to implement a racial equality  strategy. In delivering that for all the people here, we need to take into  account the enormous changes that have occurred over the past few years.  Growing diversity is a sign of our modernity and the progress that we have  made. It also offers us a unique, exciting and never-to-be-repeated opportunity  to change the way in which people living here have viewed one another for too  long.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Because of migration, it is no longer possible to talk, as  so many have, of the two communities in Northern Ireland; there are many  communities now, each with different faiths, beliefs, cultures and interests.  That growing diversity has transformed our cultural paradigm, and we must  approach the future with a new perspective.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That growing diversity can have a genuinely leavening  effect on a society that has long been frozen into a two-traditions divide, and  it has the potential to act as a powerful lever on the old attitudes to difference  that have maintained that divide. Put simply, the growing richness of our  diverse society in Northern    Ireland has the power to help healing.  Government and the public sector have a central role to play in facilitating  and encouraging integration between minority ethnic people and indigenous communities.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, we cannot address the challenges alone. Local  action will be the cornerstone of that work; real change will take place at  local level, and we are all partners in building a better future. Migrant  workers are boosting our economy and making great contributions to our social  and cultural lives. Just as they are learning about our cultures and  traditions, there is much that we can learn from theirs.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion calls for a review of the three-year-old migrant  workers strategy. It was recognised in 2005, after the number of migrant  workers arriving in Northern    Ireland had increased dramatically following  the accession of the eight countries into the European Union, that migrant  worker issues were significant and that a co-ordinated approach needed to be  adopted. In June 2006, the Racial Equality Forum established the migrant  workers thematic subgroup. That subgroup of about 40 members, including most  Northern Ireland Departments, relevant UK Departments and other key  organisations, and which is chaired by my Department, developed a draft  strategy and action plan that were endorsed by the Executive in June 2008. Both  documents are reviewed annually. The last annual review was completed in March  this year, and the revised documents were published on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The action plan identifies four key strands of required  action, on which significant progress has been made. One of the main purposes  of the employment, inspection and enforcement strand is to enhance cohesion and  the sharing of information among enforcement bodies, something that is often  overlooked.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Some of the recent successes with regard to violations of  the national minimum wage and recovery of money for individuals have happened  as a result of joint working between Her Majesty&rsquo;s Revenue and Customs, the Gangmasters  Licensing Authority and my Department&rsquo;s employment agency inspectorate. I  anticipate that there will be an even greater degree of lawful information  exchange facilitated through provisions contained in the new Employment Bill,  which is at Committee Stage. The Bill will seek to enhance the Department&rsquo;s  powers of investigation into private recruitment companies to ensure that the  most vulnerable workers, including migrants, are not exploited by unscrupulous  agencies. In taking forward the information strand in the strategy, member  organisations have produced guides and leaflets that are available in various  languages.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The information working subgroup, led by the racial  equality unit in OFMDFM, is considering proposals for the effective collation  of core data to enhance consistency and to allow the development of an  effective signposting tool for all relevant organisations and individuals. The  &lsquo;Northern Ireland Direct&rsquo; website could act as a portal for that information.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A pivotal need existed for the developing best practice  strand, as organisations had produced, or were in the process of producing,  high-quality material and models through on-the-ground initiatives. Thirteen  key best practice principles have been developed, against which potential new  best-practice information, services and systems should be designed and existing  samples assessed. A welcome pack template has been created, which aims at  achieving consistency in the range of topics covered at central and local  level. Separate guidelines on the use of interpreters and translation have been  produced.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At present, a framework for migrant worker awareness  training for staff is in the final stages of completion, and guidelines on  organising events for, or to include, migrant workers are almost complete. Work  has started on the final topic: foreign qualifications equivalents.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The fourth and final strand relates to research and data  gathering. As inward migration for employment purposes on any substantial scale  was a recent phenomenon, little research had been carried out, and data systems  had not been designed to fully capture information on the topic. Questions on  public attitudes to, and perceptions of, migrant workers, which were raised by  Mrs Hanna and others, were included in the &lsquo;Northern Ireland Omnibus Survey&rsquo; in  2007 and 2008. The results were published in my Department&rsquo;s &lsquo;Labour Market  Bulletin&rsquo;. That was repeated in 2009, and the results will be published on my  Department&rsquo;s website.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Two pieces of research on the experiences of migrant  workers in Northern Ireland  and the economic labour market and skills impact of migrant workers here were  commissioned. Detailed reports of the findings of both are expected to be  published shortly and should inform future policy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will now turn to the review of the migrant workers  strategy. The strategy contains terms of reference for the thematic subgroup,  which include a requirement for its work to be reviewed after three full years  of operation, and an assessment of the need to continue its operation to be  made by the Racial Equality Forum, taking account of the views of the subgroup  itself. I want to consider the way forward very carefully, bearing in mind the  achievements of the subgroup and the nature of the tasks that continue to need  to be addressed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The First Minister and the deputy First Minister have  instructed OFMDFM officials to reconvene the Racial Equality Forum as soon as  possible. I expect that to take place in November. OFMDFM officials will now  consult the sector to agree appropriate membership and structures for the forum  and to develop a suitable work programme. When those deliberations have been  completed and a work programme agreed, OFMDFM officials will reconvene the  forum.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will now turn to provision for more support for  immigrants. The crucial role played by minority ethnic groups is recognised and  valued. OFMDFM has awarded more than &pound;1 million under the minority ethnic  develop&shy;ment fund to 27 organisations here for the financial year 2009-2010.  The funding package represents a further increase of 10% to minority ethnic  groups on top of the increase announced last year, which will mean more  organisations spread across society here will be funded to do the hard work  that needs to be done. We recognise, of course, that that work cannot be left  to the voluntary sector alone. Immigration is not a transferred matter, and  responsibility for policy issues remains with the Westminster Government.  Although sometimes we are constrained by UK-wide legislation, OFMDFM is  determined to examine what support can be given to people facing a genuine  crisis.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will now turn to some of the issues raised during the  debate. Alex Maskey said that the Chinese community centre was a hard-won  achievement. I point out that &pound;250,000 of funding was provided by OFMDFM toward  that centre, which illustrates a level of commitment. With regard to the rights  of vulnerable workers, I remind the House of the vulnerable workers&rsquo; helpline,  which was a key recommendation of the recent GB vulnerable workers forum  report. That helpline went live in May 2009; it is based in GB but answers  calls from Northern Ireland  on the national minimum wage and on gangmasters licensing. Queries from Northern Ireland  regarding other enforceable rights such as health and safety, working time,  employment agency standards and the agricultural minimum wage are signposted by  the helpline to appropriate agencies here.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Martina Anderson asked about the unfortunate issue of the  Ukrainian woman Oksana Sukhanova. The Ulster Unionist Party lobbied Downing  Street to prevent her deportation back to Ukraine, but, unfortunately, events  overtook us.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Carmel Hanna referred to signing the International  Convention on Migrant Workers. That is a matter for the UK Government, but it  is worth noting that no migrant-importing countries have, so far, signed up to  the convention. That is a significant piece of information.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Anna Lo said that there is no safety net for migrant  workers. That is a matter of UK Government policy, which is set down in  legislation by the Home Office. However, following experience from Scotland, the  Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister has sponsored the Law  Centre to arrange a seminar for January 2010 that will explore whether, inside  the Home Office&rsquo;s legislative framework, some of the gaps in the safety net can  be blocked.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Northern Ireland Racial Equality Forum is being  reconvened, and the thematic subgroup of that forum is still functioning. The  question of the review remains. As I said, the Office of the First Minister and  deputy First Minister is very active on a range of issues.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Some people have been unhappy &mdash; and no one could feel  otherwise &mdash; about the image that Northern Ireland displayed to the  world during the summer. Tom Elliott, William Irwin and other Members referred  to those incidents, which cannot be swept under the carpet. The issue requires  a co-ordinated approach, not only across Departments, but across society in  general. Everyone has to play a role, including local authorities and the  voluntary and community sector. Employers have a role, and the Government have  a role. Although we cannot be responsible for the actions of every person in  the community, we have a duty to establish the right tone and the right  framework in which action can be taken.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Recent events have shown the need for Departments and  relevant statutory bodies to provide co-ordinated and effective leadership and  responses on those issues. Therefore, officials from OFMDFM have recently taken  part in a multi-agency review on the response to the attacks on, for example,  the Roma families. The review, which is being led by Belfast City Council, will  produce a series of recommendations that will help to inform the response to  similar scenarios, should they arise in future.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, significant progress has been made. We cannot  enter in to any complacency, because we know that certain groups of people have  their own agendas. Everyone must behave responsibly, and I believe that the  Government are doing so. The actions that OFMDFM has proposed will have a  positive effect. However, the failure to deal with the issues around a shared  future casts a certain pall over the matter. I believe that the problems that  arise from that will not inhibit the actions that OFMDFM has promised.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My Department will continue to be active on the issue. The  enactment of the Employment Bill, which is before the House, will be another  contribution. We will continue to lead the thematic subgroup of the Racial  Equality Forum and ensure that, as far as possible, we are in a position to  implement policies, subject to the availability of resources.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>: I  thank all Members who participated in the debate. Traditionally, Ireland has  been a country of emigration rather than of immigration. For that reason,  people here have found it difficult to come to terms with the notion of inward  migration. We are much more used to waving people off from these shores than to  welcoming them to our part of the world. From that perspective, how we deal  with those important issues presents a challenge for us all.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">During the past few weeks, I attended a conference at which  the former Scottish First Minister Jack McConnell talked about how Scotland&rsquo;s  Government aimed to grow its economy. He said that because they had made  economic growth a priority, they accepted that they had to reverse the decline  in population. The population had to grow. He said that there are two ways of  doing that: first, attract emigrants back; secondly, attract new people to come  to live in Scotland.  He focused on how that had successfully reversed Scotland&rsquo;s population decline.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That is also the case in the South. About one quarter of  the working-age population is made up of people who, at some stage, lived  outside the state because they were either born elsewhere or went abroad to  work. Most people would reflect that that one quarter or one fifth of the  population in the South represents some of the people who have been the drivers  of its economic regeneration.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important to recognise that the matter is not just  about having hands to do work: it is about having minds to think new thoughts  and people to challenge how we do business. All those factors contribute to  change and economic growth.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although people may be migrant workers, their contribution  is way beyond what they do in the workplace and their economic contribution.  They bring cultural, artistic and social wealth and generate new ideas and  challenges for change. That is healthy if society is to transform and move  forward. On all those fronts, migration is positive. It is not, however, always  sold as positive because, like all change, it brings challenges. People focus  more on the challenge and less on the end product.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">People are not simply economic units; they are individuals  who have hopes and aspirations, with families and futures. Therefore, when  migrant workers choose Northern    Ireland, often, they are also deciding that  they want to make a long-term contribution to our society. Therefore, it is not  simply the case, as it was in the past, that people move from one country to  another simply to go where there is work. In many cases, people make the choice  that they want to make Northern Ireland  their home for the long term.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That is hugely welcome. However, Northern   Ireland needs to prepare for that change; it needs to be  ready to support communities and local people as migrants move to Northern Ireland  so that that can be a success.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The economic downturn has brought a change in the flow of  workers to Northern Ireland.  Indeed, some Members said that there has been a flow out of Northern Ireland  by certain communities. In many countries, that is not entirely the case. Much  depends on the economic circumstances in people&rsquo;s home countries and where they  believe their future is best placed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That leads to certain challenges when people lose their  jobs. Some Members, such as Martina Anderson and Anna Lo, talked about people  who lose their jobs and are left without a temporary safety net, nowhere to go  until they can find another job, and, often, no time to make big, life-changing  decisions. When their visas and employment have run out, their choice is either  to leave or to become illegal immigrants. Something needs to be done that will,  at least, give people breathing space, in the same way that each of us wants,  to make decisions about their lives.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Anna Lo mentioned the bridging visa scheme in the Republic of Ireland, which provides a temporary  safety net. Of course, the Minister pointed out that immigration issues are  dealt with at Westminster.  I am heartened to hear that the Executive are engaged on those issues and are  looking at how the Assembly can use its legislative powers to fill those gaps  locally without breaching Westminster  legislation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">During recent months, economic changes have resulted in  people&rsquo;s vulnerability becoming more acute. One day, someone will have a job;  the following day, he or she will not. Often, people live a hand-to-mouth  existence.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have also seen the differences in status among different  classes of EU immigration being exposed in a way in which we had not  previously. Members mentioned the differences between A8 nationals and A2  nationals from different accession states. Those two groups comprise a hugely  complex mix of different people with different rights and responsibilities.  Welfare gaps exist, and that issue needs to be looked at. We need a coherent,  compassionate and financially sustainable solution to those challenges. That  requires a review of how we do business, and that is what the motion calls for.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We also have to recognise the fact that the Racial Equality  Forum has a role to play in addressing many of those issues. Alex Maskey said  that people who have direct experience must be given a voice at the table. It  is hugely important that we do that, because the picture is changing  constantly. If we measure the level of immigration at a given point in time, we  would see a very different picture of how communities are constituted and how  people flow in and out, compared to that which we would see if we measured it  again in a few months&rsquo; time. Therefore, it is important that there are people  at the table who can bring their experience to bear.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Thomas Buchanan said that he recognised the fact that there  are employment rights issues and minimum wage abuses, and that migrant workers  need to be protected from those. He also said that many of the people who come  to Northern Ireland  in very vulnerable circumstances are not only exploited by local employers and  landlords, but gatekeepers and gangmasters who bring them here and who seek to  profiteer from their misery.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In responding to the debate, the Minister said that he  wants additional powers to investigate employment agencies, and that is a  welcome development. It is important that there is transparency in how people  are dealt with to ensure that the minimum-age requirements that apply to  everyone else in society also apply to those who come here.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A number of Members made reference to the situation of the  Roma families. That situation raised issues about how the host community copes  with immigration, as well as huge issues about the moral responsibility that we  have for the people who live in overcrowded conditions, who are clearly not on  the minimum wage, and who are really struggling on the margins of society. That  presents a challenge not just to those who throw a rock through a window, but  to the rest of us, particularly elected representatives who have a  responsibility to try to direct how society works.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Like the Minister, David Hilditch questioned the need for  the Racial Equality Forum and said that he was concerned about the risk of  duplication. I do not think that there is a risk of duplication. We need a  forum to drive forward a lot of the work and to co-ordinate actions. Many  Members mentioned the fact that good work is happening in the areas concerned.  However, the problem is a lack of co-ordination.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will come to the issue of the CSI strategy later, because  many Members would be surprised and disappointed if I did not. I will get there  eventually.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We need to be aware of the impact of the recession. Some  people may leave of their own volition and chose to return home. That is fine,  and that is their choice. However, I was slightly concerned by the fact that  some Members talked about local jobs for local people. When times get difficult  and when the competition for resources becomes more acute, there is a tendency  for people to blame all their woes on those who are from outside Northern Ireland.  We must be conscious of that. During a recession, we need to be clear about our  legal obligations, so that people are dealt with fairly, and about our moral  obligations, so that people are treated with respect and dignity.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>:  Normally I would, but I cannot because my time is almost up.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to tie up those last few points in relation to the  CSI strategy. A number of Members talked about the good work that is going on.  Jim Shannon talked about the issue of language integration and about how  important it is that people can speak the language so that they are able to  access services and protect their rights. A number of other Members, including  Tommy Gallagher, spoke about how we deal generally with the fear of difference.  We need a more coherent strategy to deal with all those issues. We must find a  way of dealing with differences in Northern Ireland that is more  constructive than the way in which we have dealt with our traditional  differences.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Many people from this part of the world have family members  who emigrated overseas to make a new life for themselves. We should be very  proud that the tide has now turned and that people see this as a place where  they wish to make a life for themselves. However, we must take responsibility  for the fact that we need to support those people in doing that.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">5.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Minister for his comments, and I wish to  highlight the work that he is doing on foreign qualification equivalents. There  are often skills shortages, and many of the people who come to work here have  the skills that we need but struggle to get placed because of problems with  their qualifications. Those people are working well below their capacity. I  would like to see that addressed, and I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s indications that  he will do so.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText"><em>Question put and agreed to.</em></p>
    <p class="B3BodyText"><em>Resolved:</em></p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly notes the economic, social and cultural  contributions from migrant workers; and calls on the Executive to review the  migrant workers strategy and to re-establish the Racial Equality Forum to  consider further support for immigrants.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText"><em>Adjourned at 5.02 pm.</em></p>
