<p class="H2DocumentStartTime">Members observed two minutes&rsquo; silence.</p>
<p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="1"></a>Assembly Business</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane</strong>: On  a point of order, Mr Speaker. I put in a question to the Minister of the  Environment on 27 May which was due for answer on 7 June. To date, I have not  received a response. I understand that it is a new term and that people are  busy. However, I think that that is an inordinate amount of time for me to wait  to receive an answer.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I thank the Member for her point of order. Let me take it up with the Minister  and the Department, and I will come back to the Member directly.</p>
<p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="2"></a>Ministerial Statement</p>
<p class="H4StageHeading">British-Irish Council: Summit Meeting</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I have received notice from the Office of the First Minister and deputy First  Minister (OFMDFM) that the First Minister wishes to make a statement to the  House.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson  (The First Minister)</strong>: In accordance with the requirements of the Northern  Ireland Act 1998, I wish to make the following report on the sixteenth summit  meeting of the British-Irish Council (BIC), which was held in Lancaster House, London, on 20 June. All Northern Ireland  Ministers who attended the summit have agreed that I should make this statement  to the Assembly on their behalf.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The United Kingdom Government hosted the summit, and the  heads of delegations were welcomed by the Deputy Prime Minister, the Rt Hon  Nick Clegg. The Irish Government delegation was led by the Taoiseach, Enda  Kenny. The Scottish Government were led by the First Minister, the Rt Hon Alex  Salmond. The Welsh Government were led by the First Minister, the Rt Hon Carwyn  Jones. The Government of Jersey were represented  by the Deputy Chief Minister and Minister for Treasury and Resources, Senator  Philip Ozouf. The Government of Guernsey were  led by the Chief Minister, Deputy Lyndon Trott. The Isle of Man Government  delegation was led by the Chief Minister, Tony Brown.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">In addition to the deputy First Minister and me, the  Northern Ireland delegation consisted of the Minister of the Environment; the  Minister for Employment and Learning; the Minister of Justice; the Minister of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment; the Minister for Regional Development; the  Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure; and the OFMDFM junior Ministers.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">A full list of participants is attached to the copies of  the statement that have been provided to Members.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The London  summit again underlined the British-Irish Council&rsquo;s unique and important role  in furthering, promoting and developing links between its member  Administrations through positive, practical relationships, and in providing a  forum for consultation and co-operation on east-west issues. The Prime  Minister, the Rt Hon David Cameron MP, addressed delegates at the commencement  of the conference and, in particular, drew attention to the need for member  Administrations to work closely together. Member Administrations continue to  consult, discuss and exchange information with one another on a wide range of  matters of mutual interest.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The summit afforded Administrations an opportunity to  provide an update on their respective economic situations and a substantive  discussion on their shared objective of promoting growth and its related  challenges and opportunities. The Council discussed how best to achieve strong,  sustainable and balanced growth that could be more evenly shared across member  Administrations. It considered measures to promote economic growth, including  incentives to start, finance and grow businesses; the encouragement of  investment and exports as a route to a more balanced economy; and the creation  of a more educated, skilled and flexible workforce. The Council agreed that  member Administrations should continue to learn from one another&rsquo;s successes  and identify synergies between them.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">For our part, we highlighted our particular challenges.  While welcoming the encouraging signs of growth and our success in attracting  investment at a time of deep recession, we emphasised that continuing effort  and improved approaches will be needed to grow the economy back to full health  and to rebalance it over the longer term. This may, as the Assembly is aware,  include a change to the rate of corporation tax. We highlighted again, as we  did at the North/South Ministerial Council (NSMC) plenary meeting on 10 June,  the difficulties that Northern Ireland  faces through the exposure of its banking sector to developments in the Republic of Ireland. There was also a shared concern  among the Administrations about the continuing constraints on the availability  of finance for homeowners and businesses.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The Council considered and welcomed a discussion paper on  an all-islands approach (AIA) to energy resources which was tabled by the  United Kingdom Government. It agreed the vision for an approach to energy  resources across the British Isles that would  enable opportunities for commercial generation and transmission; facilitate the  cost-effective exploitation of renewable energy resources; increase the  integration of markets; and improve security of supply. The Council agreed  principles to underpin that vision and launched a programme of joint work  spanning the potential for renewable energy trading, as well as work streams on  interconnection and market integration.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The Council discussed the progress of the work to establish  a standing secretariat for the British-Irish Council. The Council will receive  a further progress report on that at the next summit meeting in Dublin later this year;  however, it agreed a target start date for the operation of the secretariat of  1 January 2012, subject to all details and outstanding issues being finalised.  This Administration is fully involved in the work necessary to establish the  secretariat.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The Council also noted the progress described in update  reports provided to it on each of the 11 work sectors of the BIC.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">We took the opportunity, under &ldquo;any other business&rdquo;, to  register our continuing concern with the other Administrations about the United  Kingdom Government&rsquo;s proposals for Her Majesty&rsquo;s Coastguard and its potential  implications for Northern    Ireland.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">At the conclusion of the meeting, the Council agreed that  the next BIC summit will be hosted by the Republic of Ireland  in the autumn.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott (The  Chairperson of the Committee for the Office of the First Minister and deputy  First Minister)</strong>: I thank the First Minister for his summary of the BIC  summit meeting, much of which comes back to financial issues. I note that there  was a discussion about the financial aspects of all the member Administrations  and that they all provided an update on their respective economic positions.  Given that a significant financial contribution was made to the Government of  the Republic of Ireland by the European Union and a  separate contribution was made to them by the UK Government, what is the  up-to-date financial position of the Irish Government and of the Irish state?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  The Government of the Republic   of Ireland gave a  detailed exposition of their position and indicated that they felt that a  number of the fiscal issues that had caused concern were now under control.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Of course, they emphasised the fact that they had not asked  for the bailout but that it had been provided. Those of us who have looked at Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  position have recognised that the assistance that has been given by the  European Union and, indeed, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), as well as  that which has been given by Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government, has presented us with a  conundrum. To some extent, corporation tax levels in the South have been held  down because of a subvention by the United Kingdom Treasury. Therefore, we have  placed the onus on the Treasury to rectify the imbalance that we now have with  our neighbour in order to ensure that we are able to reduce Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  corporation tax levels as well.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Hale</strong>:  How does the BIC&rsquo;s work complement other east-west relationships?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  It is worth pointing out that the number of meetings of the British-Irish  Council, in plenary and other forms, has substantially increased during the  past four years. Work has also been carried out by the Joint Ministerial  Committee (JMC), which does not involve the Isle of Man, Guernsey, Jersey, or,  indeed, the Republic of Ireland. We also have North/South relationships.  Therefore, a range of interconnecting networks assists us in seeing how things  are done best elsewhere and, indeed, in learning from mistakes that have  occurred elsewhere. It is a growing east-west relationship, with which, I  believe, everybody in the House feels comfortable, just as the North/South  relationship has increasingly been one that has improved relations with the  Republic of Ireland to an all-time high.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Go raibh maith agat as an r&aacute;iteas. T&aacute;  ceist agam don Aire, agus is &iacute; an cheist seo &iacute;.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Given high energy costs and the importance of developing  renewable energy, can the First Minister provide more information on the  all-island approach to energy development?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  Of course, what the BIC discussed was not an all-island approach but an  all-islands approach &mdash; an approach throughout the British   Isles. We recognise that we have a link with the Irish Republic,  which I hope works well for both jurisdictions. We also have a mainland  connection. As regards the all-islands approach, we are looking in particular  at what renewables can do to augment the conventional energy supply that we  already have on the grid. Northern    Ireland is well placed with regard to its  contribution towards EU targets. We hope that, with the above-average level of  wind around the island, we might be able to make a continuing contribution  towards renewables, not only through wind energy, but through wave and tidal  energy.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  Bearing in mind the scarcity of indigenous energy resources, can the First  Minister confirm that the energy work stream covers the vital area of security  of energy supply? With regard to the economy, can he also confirm what  discussions have taken place about the need to reduce VAT on tourism services  from 20% to a rate comparable to the 9% rate that will exist in the South from  1 July?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  We already have the North/South grid link. We have the link with Scotland.  Therefore, not only do we have an indigenous supply, which relies largely on  coal and gas, we could, clearly, increase that supply with renewables.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">We have an excellent opportunity through the all-island  approach to exploit our resources commercially. There is also a spin-off:  Belfast Harbour Commissioners&rsquo; proposal to bring DONG Energy into the harbour  estate. The more we exploit the wind farms in the North Sea and elsewhere, the  more it will help jobs in Northern    Ireland.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">As for VAT, the honourable lady is in a better position to  raise that matter in the House of Commons, as it is clearly a matter for the  United Kingdom Government.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lyttle</strong>: I  thank the First Minister for his statement. He said that there was &ldquo;a  substantive discussion&rdquo; on economic growth and, specifically, that:</p>
<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;the creation of a more educated, skilled and flexible  workforce&rdquo;</p>
<p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">was identified. Given that the First Minister said  that the higher education and student finance budget should receive a light  touch, did he take the opportunity to discuss regional variations among the  member Administrations in the funding of higher education and student finance?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  Students will be more content with the policies of this Administration on  student fees than with those elsewhere in the United Kingdom. The Member&rsquo;s  colleague the Minister for Employment and Learning is bringing proposals to the  Executive on how we deal with those issues and their impact on universities.  The Member&rsquo;s colleague spoke during the BIC on higher education and skills, and  he reflected the views of the Executive as a whole.</p>
<p class="TimePeriod">10.45 am</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  I thank the First Minister for his statement, one of the headings of which is  &ldquo;The Economy&rdquo;. Will the First Minister outline what discussions took place and  give us some detail on them? This Administration faces problems similar to  those of other Administrations.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Many Ministers from Northern Ireland attended the BIC.  Will the First Minister look at that to ensure that, in comparison to other  Administrations, Northern    Ireland reduces the number of Ministers who  attend?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  The same economic problems face every part of the British Isles to a greater or  lesser extent; we all know the difficulties that there have been in the  Republic of Ireland. With the possible exception of some of the smaller islands  that have special and peculiar circumstances, everyone has had considerable  difficulty with the reduction in public expenditure and pressure from a reduced  job market. Those issues are common throughout.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Northern    Ireland will be slower to come out of  recession, as has always been the case in economic downturns. All the analysis  of the economy indicates that unless there is&mdash; I hate using the word  &ldquo;game-changer&rdquo; &mdash; a factor that gives us a new fiscal instrument that stimulates  the economy, we will have a very slow rate of growth and a long time before we  narrow the gap between levels of gross value added (GVA) in Northern Ireland  and those elsewhere in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">In relation to the number of Ministers, I would have  expected the Member to rejoice that there is a desire in all parts of this  House to be part of the east-west relationship to such an enthusiastic extent  that we were the largest delegation. A question about the number of Northern Ireland  Ministers was asked at the press conference afterwards. Although there is a  wide-ranging agenda and Ministers want to contribute on their subject, there is  perhaps a need for us to look at how we might curtail the numbers attending. At  the same time, we have to recognise that, unlike any other Administration in  the BIC, we have a mandatory coalition Government and, therefore, we have five  parties, all of which wish to know what is going on at those levels.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">So, we have peculiar circumstances, but I am sure that, as  we normalise our processes here, we will be able to reduce our numbers.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat. I thank the First Minister for his statement. I will ask  two questions, the first about corporation tax. Was an understanding of the  other regions&rsquo; approach to corporation tax gained in the discussion? What were  their general opinions of it? Secondly, is there a plan for planning  authorities so that they can deal with applications for energy resources and  make sure that they are used properly? Is there a plan to make the likes of  wind energy more acceptable to the community at large?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  The Member and I will both be glad that the Speaker was distracted when he said  that he would ask two questions. I think that it is clear that other parts of  the United Kingdom  feel that they, too, should benefit from the ability to vary the level of  corporation tax.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The deputy First Minister and I have been very forthright  in indicating that we have unique circumstances in Northern Ireland. We share a land  border with a state that has a much more attractive level of corporation tax  for foreign direct investment and, indeed, a level that helps its indigenous  growth. Also, we have come out of a very long period of division and conflict.  Our infrastructure has not received the level of attention and investment that  it should have. Therefore, we have a historic legacy that requires us to have  something that gives our economy a boost. We also face a number of difficulties  because we are on the periphery of Europe. So,  we have argued that our uniqueness means that Northern Ireland has a special  case.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I believe that the consultation paper produced by Her  Majesty&rsquo;s Government indicates that they, too, recognise that Northern Ireland  has quite different circumstances to those that prevail elsewhere. We hope that  that will lead to the Government&rsquo;s allowing us to have the power to vary  corporate tax.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">On the question of energy, one purpose of the AIA is to  look at a range of issues, including regulation, planning, research and  development, and any environmental gaps that there may be. It will also  consider how we might be able to better commercialise and exploit the  resources. So, planning is clearly required, although when the Member was  asking the question, I got the sense that he was referring more to on-land wind  farms than those offshore. I will resist making a personal comment about what I  think of on-land wind farms; suffice it to say that I would rather have them  offshore.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dunne</strong>: I  understand that the issue of the closing of Her Majesty&rsquo;s Coastguard station at  Bangor was  raised at the summit. Will the First Minister indicate the nature of those  discussions?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  Colleagues charged the deputy First Minister and me with raising that issue at  the summit, and that was duly done. It was, of course, outside the remit of the  BIC, but that has never stopped us in the past. The Government acknowledged the  concerns that we expressed. We had both been down to Bangor to see the work that is being done. We  recognise that this is not just a financial matter, nor should it be considered  as one; we are talking about people&rsquo;s lives and the very clear need for us to  have a service that is close to hand and that can provide us with the best  possible safety, not just around the coastal areas but on the loughs. That  point has been well made to the Government.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I note that one of the Liverpool MPs indicated yesterday  that they had had a very good meeting with the Minister on the issue. I hope  that the Minister is moving away from the either/or attitude, which describes  the choice as either Belfast or Liverpool. The Government should be looking again at  their overall proposal for coastguard services for the whole of the United Kingdom.  This is something that you cannot play about with for just financial reasons.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Overend</strong>:  I thank the First Minister for his statement. I note the discussions on the  electricity grid infrastructure. Will the Minister detail any discussions there  may have been regarding the recent takeover of NIE by the Irish  Government-owned ESB?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  There was no discussion on that matter. The leader of the Member&rsquo;s party and I  have jointly written on this issue, expressing some concerns. There clearly are  many advantages in respect of the availability of the market and what the  commercial market can do. We have expressed some concerns, but, wearing my  First Minister&rsquo;s hat, I cannot comment on them.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I, too, welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement.  The Minister referred to the discussion on the continuing constraints on the  availability of finance for homeowners and businesses. Was any update given on  the legislation going through Westminster on credit unions that will bring  forward alternative sources of revenue and finance for people?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  No, there was no discussion on that issue. The Member has made her point, and  it is a matter that my colleagues can take up. Credit unions have played a  significant role in Northern    Ireland, and the deputy First Minister and I  have been working with them as part of the team that was brought in to look at  a joined-up approach to dealing with the downturn in our economy.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">They have asked for certain things to be done. The Minister  of Enterprise, Trade and Investment is responding to those issues, and I hope  that that will make that area of activity a lot easier. As it gets more and  more difficult to get loans from the banks, it is all the more important that  we give every assistance we can to credit unions.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his statement.  Given the multi-billions of pounds of public money for bailouts for the banks,  and the pivotal role that they have in the growth of the economy, was the  matter of banks raised at the meeting? It is crucial to any re-growth there may  be, especially for first-time homebuyers but also for the recovery of small and  medium-sized enterprises, which are heavily dependent on banks in supporting  them through this and helping them into the new growth that hopefully will  come.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  I think the Member is right. I do not think we have had over the past number of  months a meeting of the BIC, the JMC or the North/South Ministerial Council  when we did not discuss the role of the banks. The deputy First Minister and I  also met the Chancellor and raised again the issue of our reliance on our main  four banks, two of which are based in Dublin  and clearly have difficult issues to face.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">One of our other banks is a subsidiary of a bank that is  now effectively under Government ownership in the United   Kingdom, and the other, Danske Bank, is outside Northern Ireland  as well. We asked at the JMC meeting that the Chancellor second one of his  officials to look at the peculiar banking circumstances of Northern Ireland.  I think I am right in saying that he agreed that he would do that.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Robinson</strong>:  Now that the dates have been agreed for the British-Irish Council standing  secretariat, what further action will follow to get the secretariat up and  running, and will Northern    Ireland contribute to it?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  Yes, of course Northern Ireland  will contribute to it because the push to have a standing secretariat came from  Northern Ireland.  The target date of 1 January 2012 has been set.</p>
<p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">At the previous BIC summit, we agreed that Scotland would  be the home of that secretariat. The Scottish Executive have indicated that  they will cover the set-up costs. Our contribution will be about &pound;15,000 a  year, so we are getting pretty good value. Staff will be co-located at the  facility, which we expect to be in Edinburgh,  but that issue has to be resolved between now and 1 January. The Scottish  Government have to determine and provide us with details of the accommodation  that will be available. We will then have to look at staffing issues,  procedures and other issues that relate to it, so there is quite a lot of work  to do between now and 1 January.</p>
<p class="TimePeriod">11.00 am</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Allister</strong>:  Given the telling contrast between the speed and lavish nature of the  secretariat that was established for the North/South bodies and the feet  dragging over the secretariat for the east-west dimension of the Belfast  Agreement, and now the revelation that we will contribute &pound;15,000 to that  secretariat even though we contribute over &pound;1 million per annum to the  North/South Ministerial Council, does the First Minister, who is now such an  enthusiastic operator of the Belfast Agreement, have any explanation as to why  the east-west link is so patently the poor relation? Why has it taken the four  years that he has been in office to get even to the point of a start date for a  secretariat for the east-west dimension?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  I suppose that that is as close as we will get to congratulations from the  Member for succeeding where others have failed in getting to the stage at which  we have a start date. Some day, the Member will shock us all and silence the  House by coming out with one word that is positive or constructive to the  Assembly, but we might have to wait some time for that.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Maybe he has not worked it out, but I will give him the  pure maths for his own sake, and he can work it out in his own time. If two  countries are sharing the cost of a secretariat, their contributions will be  larger than they would be to a secretariat in which a whole range of countries,  including the United Kingdom Government, incurred the cost. I would have  thought that that is fairly basic maths, but clearly it is beyond the Member. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
<p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="3"></a>Assembly Business</p>
<p class="H4StageHeading">Principal Deputy Speaker</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The next item of business is the nomination of a Deputy Speaker to act as  Principal Deputy Speaker. The process will be conducted in accordance with  Standing Order 5A. I will begin by asking for a nomination. Any Member may rise  to nominate one of the Deputy Speakers to act as Principal Deputy Speaker. Only  a name should be proposed at that point, as I will return to the proposer to  speak first in the debate. When I have confirmed that the person nominated is  willing to act as Principal Deputy Speaker, a debate relevant to the nomination  will take place.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The Business Committee has agreed that only one Member will  speak on behalf of each party in the debate. At the end of the debate, I will  put the Question on the nomination. The vote will be on a cross-community  basis. If the proposal is not carried, I will ask for a further nomination, and  the process will be repeated until a nomination is approved by cross-community  consent.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">If that is clear, do I have a proposal for a Deputy Speaker  to be nominated to act as Principal Deputy Speaker?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I propose Francie Molloy.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Allister</strong>:  Shame.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order, order.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Mr Molloy, do you agree to act as Principal Deputy Speaker?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>: I  do.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Standing Orders provide for a debate to take place on the nomination. I remind  Members that they may speak only once in the debate. I also advise Members that  Standing Order 5(7) requires the debate to be relevant to the nomination. I  will not allow Members to stray into any other area.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Members will have up to three minutes in which to speak.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  It gives me great pleasure to nominate Francie Molloy. Francie has been a councillor  for 26 years, held the position of mayor for two terms and was president of  NILGA (Northern Ireland Local Government Association). In his six years with  NILGA, he held a number of positions, and has proved his ability to be  independent. In 2007, he was nominated as Deputy Speaker and elected from the  Floor of the Assembly. Over the past four years in that role, he has carried  out his duties in an impartial manner and ensured that Members from all parties  were respected and had their say. With that, I wish to nominate Francie Molloy  as Principal Deputy Speaker. I am very pleased to do so.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  It is interesting to hear Ms McCann speak of Mr Molloy in such a way. I do not  think that she and her party always had that opinion of Mr Molloy. It was only  a few years ago that he was suspended from that party for some of his actions.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The Ulster Unionist Party has clearly opposed the position  of Principal Deputy Speaker, or deputy principal speaker, whichever way round  it is. I am surprised at Sinn F&eacute;in, and, in particular, Mr Molloy, taking up  such a post as a job for the boys in the Assembly. They seem to have bought  into this entire process. We will be opposing the nomination.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Mr Speaker, I know that you are aware of Mr Molloy&rsquo;s  conduct last week in the Committee for the Office of the First Minister and  deputy First Minister, at which he totally disregarded the ruling of the Chair.  That is why I believe that Mr Molloy is unfit to hold the position of Principal  Deputy Speaker. Therefore, I look forward to witnessing how he will carry out  the role, because I am sure that it will go through on a cross-community vote,  thanks to the two main parties supporting each other. I will wait, and judge  his performance in days to come. Mr Speaker, in holding your office, you would  not allow people to stray off the mark and away from what is being discussed in  such a way as Mr Molloy has shown that he is capable of in Committee.  Therefore, we oppose this.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lyttle</strong>:  My party has endeavoured to be co-operative throughout this proposal. However,  in the final analysis at the last stage, we saw no demonstrable need for the  change in title and voted against the proposal. It is for that reason that we  will be voting against the nomination.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Allister</strong>:  Some of the first business of this Assembly when it came back after the  election was the first stage of the sordid deal between the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in,  which, today, reaches its climax. On this, the last day of this sitting, we  will see elevated to the totally unnecessary and pointless position of  Principal Deputy Speaker Mr Francie Molloy.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">We heard something of his CV from the proposer. We  certainly did not hear it all. Other places have heard much more about the CV of  Mr Molloy. Those on the DUP Benches, when they go to elections, pretend &mdash; yes,  pretend &mdash; that they are returning to Stormont to resist the Sinn F&eacute;in agenda. I  have been here only a few weeks, but, every day, I see, hand in glove, the  co-operation between the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in. When those Members troop through  the Lobby to my right to vote for Mr Molloy, as they inevitably will as the  Lobby fodder that they are for DUP/Sinn F&eacute;in rule, may the words of their  colleague Mr David Simpson ring in their ears.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I remind them what he said of Mr Molloy in the House of  Commons when he implicated him in the murder of Eric Lutton. Yet today, people  like David Simpson&rsquo;s colleague Stephen Moutray, who once said that he would go  back to his shop before he would support Sinn F&eacute;in in government, will troop  through that Lobby to elevate the very man who David Simpson told him all  about.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Rev William McCrea addressed the House of Commons and told  it that Francie Molloy should be arrested for war crimes against the people of  the UK.  May that salutary lesson ring in the ears of those who today troop through, and  prick whatever conscience remains, as they do the bidding and show obeisance by  taking whatever action it takes to keep Sinn F&eacute;in happy in this House.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Will the Member bring his remarks to a close?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Allister</strong>:  So, I say to each one of them: shame on you for the action you are about to  take.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>

<p class="Q3Motion">That the nomination of Deputy Speaker Molloy to act as  Principal Deputy Speaker be approved.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I offer my congratulations to Principal Deputy Speaker Molloy and look forward  to working with him. I ask the House to take its ease as we move to the next  piece of business.</p>
<p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="4"></a>Executive Committee Business</p>
<p class="H4StageHeading">Welfare Reform Bill</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCausland  (The Minister for Social Development)</strong>: I beg to move</p>
<p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly agrees that the provisions in clauses 122  and 123 of the Welfare Reform Bill, as amended at Committee Stage in the House  of Commons, dealing with the transfer of tax credit functions and the supply of  information by a Northern Ireland Department, or by a person providing services  to a Northern Ireland Department, should be considered by the UK Parliament.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The Welfare Reform Bill was introduced in the House of  Commons on 16 February 2011; it contains provision for the introduction in Great Britain  of an integrated working-age benefit to be called universal credit. It will be  paid to people in and out of work and will replace a range of means-tested  benefits and tax credits such as income support, income-based jobseeker&rsquo;s  allowance, income-related employment and support allowance, housing benefit,  working tax credit and child tax credit. It will provide support for people  between 18 and the age at which the claimant becomes eligible for state pension  credit. The Bill also contains provision for the introduction of personal  independence payment to replace disability living allowance, changes to housing  benefit, employment and support allowance and to the forthcoming child  maintenance scheme. The proposals in the Welfare Reform Bill that I have just  outlined apply only to Great    Britain at this stage. I am considering the  position in relation to Northern    Ireland and will bring forward proposals to  the Assembly in due course.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The areas of the Westminster Bill that apply to Northern  Ireland and which require this legislative consent motion deal with the  transfer of tax credit functions and the supply of information by a Northern  Ireland Department. The motion asks the Assembly to agree that those  consequential provisions may be considered by the UK Parliament since they  could change the functions of three Northern Ireland Departments and the  legislative competence of the Assembly.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">By way of background, I should explain that the intention  is that there will be no new claims for tax credits after the introduction of  universal credit, which is planned for October 2013, after which existing tax  credit claimants will be transferred to universal credit through a managed  transition process. It is expected that, by October 2017, there will be no  remaining tax credit awards. To enable the Department for Work and Pensions to  manage the transition process, it may be desirable to transfer tax credit  functions from HM Revenue and Customs to that Department.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The Welfare Reform Bill contains an order-making power to  allow for the transfer of tax credit functions from Her Majesty&rsquo;s Revenue and  Customs to the Department for Work and Pensions. It also contains an  order-making power to allow for new functions to be given or functions to be  removed from HM Treasury, HM Revenue and Customs and a Northern Ireland  Department.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The power to allocate or remove functions is purely  consequential on the transfer of tax credit functions to the Department for  Work and Pensions. It is intended that tax credits will remain an excepted  matter and that the Department for Work and Pensions will administer tax credits  for Northern Ireland  until the last tax credit claimants have been migrated to universal credit.  That will involve new arrangements for investigating tax credits cases in Northern Ireland,  as the Department for Work and Pensions does not have a presence here. It is  proposed that the Department for Work and Pensions might seek to enter into an  agency agreement with my Department &mdash; in practice, the Social Security Agency &mdash;  to appoint authorised officers who would then be able to carry out the relevant  investigations.</p>
<p class="TimePeriod">11.30 am</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Following a transfer of functions, the Department for Work  and Pensions will need to be able to access certain HMRC data and to provide to  other Departments data relating to tax credits. The Bill includes provision for  a wider single two-way data-sharing gateway between the Department for Work and  Pensions, HM Revenue and Customs and relevant Northern Ireland Departments, so  that information can be shared to facilitate the discharge of their respective  functions. That provision is not without precedent. It builds on existing  gateways that already extend to Northern    Ireland to enable information to be shared  and reused for the exercise of functions in relation to social security, child  support, war pensions and employment and training.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I expect that Members will have reservations about the  wide-ranging proposals in the Westminster Welfare Reform Bill, but I emphasise  that they relate to Great Britain, are not a matter that the Assembly has any  power over and do not have any bearing on the motion. The legislative consent  motion deals with the much narrower technical issues of the consequential  changes to the functions of the Department for Social Development, the  Department of Finance and Personnel and the Department for Employment and Learning  as a result of the proposals dealing with the transfer of tax credit functions  and the supply of information relating to Northern Ireland Departments  contained in the Westminster Bill. On that basis, I ask the Assembly to support  the motion.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey (The  Chairperson of the Committee for Social Development)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat,  a Cheann Comhairle. As Chairperson of the Committee for Social Development, I  support the motion. At its meeting of 16 June 2011, the Committee agreed a  short report on the legislative consent motion. That report concluded that the  Committee will support the motion as it applies solely to clauses 122 and 123  of the Westminster Welfare Reform Bill. The report was e-mailed to every  Member, and copies of my letter drawing attention to the report on the  Committee&rsquo;s web page were provided to all MLAs.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">As the Minister explained, the provisions relate simply to  the transfer of tax credit functions and the sharing of information by  Departments here, the Department for Work and Pensions, Revenue and Customs and  the Treasury. DSD officials described the provisions as largely minor and  technical in nature. As the sharing of information includes the Department of  Finance and Personnel, the Committee also wrote to the Committee for Finance and  Personnel and received confirmation that DFP is content with the provisions of  the legislative consent motion that relate to it.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Although the Committee for Social Development supports the  specific provisions that the motion refers to, the Committee&rsquo;s report notes  that the Westminster Welfare Reform Bill contains numerous other provisions,  such as the introduction of universal credit and changes to industrial injuries  benefit, housing benefit, pensions credit, DLA and so on. The Minister referred  to that a moment ago. No doubt, those provisions will come before the Assembly  in a welfare reform Bill later this year or in the early part of next year.  That will be a completely different matter for many of us and will merit much  more detailed scrutiny of its impact on the poorest people here.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">In my role as a party representative, it is important to  say that we have been advised by the Department that, over the next number of  years, the consequence of what has been described as the British Government&rsquo;s  Welfare Reform Bill will be that somewhere in the region of &pound;450 million to  &pound;500 million will be taken out of the local economy. I believe that various  Committee members share that concern. We believe that those will be stealth  cuts masquerading as welfare reform. That will require much more scrutiny  because, undoubtedly, many of the cuts that will result from that legislation  will have a serious, negative impact on many of the most vulnerable people,  while taking a considerable amount of money from the local economy. That will  add to the &pound;4 billion of cuts that the British Government have already taken  from the block grant.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Copeland</strong>:  I speak as a member of the Social Development Committee. I am content that the  matters have been discussed in Committee, and the representations that we have  had have been useful and formative.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">To any of us who have been involved in trying to assist  constituents through the morass that is the benefits and welfare system, it is  patently obvious that it is burdensome, cumbersome and difficult to operate as  it is. No matter what legislation appears at the far end, there are, for us &mdash;  for me &mdash; three principles that need to be reflected if not enshrined:  simplicity in the legislation itself; compassion in the way in which it is  interpreted; and respect in the way in which it is implemented. A benefits  system that makes it more difficult for people to conduct their life in work  rather than out of it cannot in any circumstances be considered compassionate, and,  as has been said elsewhere, this legislation is fundamental to the day-to-day  life of many of our citizens.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>:  We also support the motion. These are two pretty innocuous clauses in an  otherwise draconian Welfare Reform Bill. Although we support the acceptance of  those clauses, we do so without prejudice to our party&rsquo;s position on the  Welfare Reform Bill, many elements of which we oppose due to the negative  impact that they will have on the most vulnerable people in our society.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCausland</strong>:  I thank Members for their contributions. As has been said, we will return to  the issue of welfare reform in the autumn. However, the matter before us today  is minor and technical in nature, as the Chair of the Committee observed, and  relates to just two clauses in the Welfare Reform Bill. So, I thank Members for  their contributions and commend the motion to the House.</p>
<p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
<p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
<p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly agrees that the provisions in clauses 122  and 123 of the Welfare Reform Bill, as amended at Committee Stage in the House  of Commons, dealing with the transfer of tax credit functions and the supply of  information by a Northern Ireland Department, or by a person providing services  to a Northern Ireland Department, should be considered by the UK Parliament.</p>

<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Ramsey</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
<p class="Q3Motion">That the following Members are appointed as the trustees of  the Assembly Members&rsquo; pension scheme: Mr John Dallat, Mr Ross Hussey, Mr Trevor  Lunn, Mr Mickey Brady and Mr Jim Wells.</p>

<p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
<p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>

<p class="H4StageHeading"><a name="6"></a>Corporation Tax</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  This item is a joint motion from the Committee for Finance and Personnel and  the Committee for Enterprise,  Trade and Investment. The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to two  hours for the debate. The proposer will have 10 minutes to propose the motion  and 10 minutes to make a winding-up speech. All other Members who are called to  speak will have five minutes.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy (The  Chairperson of the Committee for Finance and Personnel)</strong>: I beg to move</p>
<p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly supports, in principle, the case for the  devolution of corporation tax powers to the Northern Ireland Assembly; and  looks forward to the outcome of the HM Treasury consultation on &lsquo;Rebalancing  the Northern Ireland Economy&rsquo;, the provision of further information on the  associated costs and benefits, and the development of more detailed proposals  for implementing and exercising the powers.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. In its emergency  Budget in 2010, the British Government signalled that they intended to examine  mechanisms for rebalancing the economy here, including, among other things, the  possibility of allowing a more competitive corporation tax rate. The resultant  consultation was launched by the Treasury in March 2011 and was extended to 1  July. The initial closing date of 24 June did not afford enough time to bring  forward a co-ordinated response on behalf of the Assembly. The joint motion  has, therefore, been tabled by the Finance and Personnel and the Enterprise, Trade and  Investment Committees to help to inform any response that they or any other  Committees or individual Members may wish to make to the Treasury consultation.  Moreover, by agreeing the motion, which proposes cautious support for pursuing  the devolution of corporation tax powers, the Assembly will send a collective  message to the Treasury at this important point in the ongoing negotiations  over the possible terms on which such powers could be exercised.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Members will be aware of the fundamental weaknesses in the  local economy, which have been well documented and include, for example,  greater reliance on the public sector, higher rates of economic inactivity,  relatively low incomes, high rates of poverty and a legacy of capital  underinvestment. Some of those issues were touched on in the Treasury  consultation paper, not least and significantly the lower productivity in terms  of gross value added (GVA) per capita compared, with a few exceptions, with  regions in Britain.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">There is no question that a new approach must be taken to  the economic challenges that face us. An economic strategy based simply on more  of the same will not achieve the step change that is needed in the economy or  go far enough in closing the productivity gap. In its recent report, the  Westminster NI Affairs Committee noted that many of those who gave evidence to  its inquiry considered:</p>
<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;that previous policies had not had the desired effect  and a significant reduction in corporation tax would be the dramatic change  that business&rdquo;</p>
<p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">here needs.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The case for a more competitive rate of corporation tax and  the impact that such a step would have on the local economy has been fairly  extensively examined over recent years. As well as that recent NI Affairs  Committee inquiry, investigations have been undertaken by, for example, the  Economic Research Institute, the Economic Reform Group and, more recently, the  Economic Advisory Group (EAG), which advises the Minister of Enterprise, Trade  and Investment. The evidence from those investigations points to the potential  net gains from a more competitive corporation tax rate. The issue was also  examined in previous Assembly mandates, including by the previous Finance and  Personnel Committee, which tabled a joint motion, again with the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and  Investment, on the Economic Reform Group&rsquo;s report. The Assembly debated and  unanimously supported that motion in May 2010.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">There can be no doubt that attracting investment here will  have a positive impact on the local economy. Among the key benefits of an  attractive corporation tax rate that is cited in various reports is an increase  in foreign direct investment (FDI). The Economic Advisory Group has highlighted  that experience in the South as suggesting that low corporation tax is an  important factor in attracting FDI. It also notes that corporation tax  incentives in countries such as Estonia  and Singapore  are one of a number of policy measures that have attracted increased FDI and  contributed to significant increases in output and employment.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">In its report, the NI Affairs Committee noted that the rate  of corporation tax is considered by many to have been a &ldquo;game changer&rdquo; in  reviving the Southern economy. It also pointed to the Dublin Government&rsquo;s clear  belief that an attractive corporation tax rate remains an &ldquo;important tool&rdquo; in  helping the South out of its present difficulties.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">A Department of Finance and Personnel (DFP) briefing paper  issued to all Members in advance of the debate advises that the mid-point  estimate for a gross FDI increase is &pound;160 million in year 1, rising to &pound;310  million by year 10. Domestic investment would increase by an estimated &pound;110  million by year 10. The DFP paper also notes that a study undertaken by Oxford  Economics on behalf of the Economic Advisory Group estimated that an average of  4,500 net additional jobs a year will be created in the longer term and that  the measure would go some way towards creating a more private sector-oriented  economy.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Although considerable effort has gone into examining and establishing  the theoretical case for a competitive corporation tax rate, it must be  recognised that a number of practical issues require more detailed exploration.  In a paper commissioned by my Committee, the Assembly Research and Information  Service sets out a series of questions to which the Department responded in its  own paper. Further clarification is needed in some areas, not least with regard  to the implications for the block grant. Members will be aware by now of the Azores judgement, which is an EU ruling that requires  that a region bear the cost of any reduction in tax revenue and states that it  cannot be compensated by the member state authority.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">There appears to be a lack of clarity or agreement on  precisely how much corporation tax is collected locally. Therefore, it is  difficult to predict what the cost may be. Most assumptions are in the region  of &pound;200 million to &pound;300 million a year, although the Assembly Research and  Information Service paper notes that DFP has suggested in the past that the figure  may be in excess of &pound;400 million by year 5. In its paper, DFP states that:</p>
<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The public expenditure implications of this are  significant and it is vital that we know precisely how much corporation tax is  collected&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Perhaps the varying estimates arise from different  calculation methods, but, nonetheless, I call on DFP to press the issue with  the Treasury as a matter of urgency.</p>
<p class="TimePeriod">11.45 am</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">In oral evidence to the Committee, Kate Barker, the  chairperson of the Economic Advisory Group, reminded members that, at the same  time as the public sector bears the cost, there will be immediate benefits to  the private sector. Kate Barker also said:</p>
<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;it is sometimes put as a gamble &hellip; To be blunt, doing  nothing is much more of a gamble.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">By that, she was cautioning that it would be a  gamble to simply expect that the block grant will continue at the same rate as  at present and that we would have:</p>
<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;passed up ... an opportunity to change the game.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">It should also be noted that the Economic Advisory Group  report considered that it would be important for the Executive to retain yield  from other taxes that would be expected to increase, such as income tax and  National Insurance contributions. The NI Affairs Committee called on the  British Government to provide clarity on the issue. If that were possible, it  could evidently help to mitigate some of the costs that are associated with the  rate of reduction. That aspect should, therefore, form a critical part of the  negotiations with the Treasury.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Concerns have also been raised that a reduction in  corporation tax here would encourage brass plating, profit shifting or tax  evasion and that relocation from Britain would result in a net loss  to the Exchequer. I do not seek to minimise such concerns. However, the NI  Affairs Committee stated that its evidence suggests that that risk:</p>
<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;is sufficiently well mitigated against for it not to  present a persuasive argument.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">DFP also stated that it expects measures to be put  in place to minimise profit shifting.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Members will be very mindful that, by itself, a competitive  rate of corporation tax would not be enough to rebalance the local economy.  Rather, it is one strand in a strategy that should include, among other things,  investment in research and development, innovation, education and skills. It  should be accepted now, however, that a strong theoretical case exists for the  devolution of corporation tax powers. It is clear that much more detailed work  has to be done, and much will depend on the outcome of ongoing negotiations  with Treasury on how attractive the measure would be in practice.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The motion has been crafted to maximise support among  Members. It is vital that the Assembly sends a strong message to the British  Government, in particular that fair and reasonable working arrangements for  devolving corporation tax powers need to be agreed with the Executive. The  negotiations must have the central aim of rebalancing the local economy and  must not result in terms that are skewed purely in the self-interest of Treasury.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">For my own part, I feel that, as I said, the motion was  crafted to ensure a broadly positive response from the Assembly, even in the  context of ongoing negotiations. It is recognised that there are concerns, but  they echo those that we had in the previous mandate with the devolution of  policing and justice powers, when it was felt that the issue was too complex  and sensitive for the Assembly. Quite clearly, we have demonstrated since then  that the Assembly is well capable of handling those powers.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">As has been suggested, this is not the silver bullet to  address all our economic woes, but it begins to give us control of the fiscal  levers that allow us to shape our own economic destiny, recognise our  particular circumstances and not be subject to the whim of ideological changes  brought about by a Tory-led Government in Britain. As is evident from the  business community across the island, it would also allow us to begin to  strengthen the all-Ireland links so that we could harmonise an all-Ireland  approach to economic recovery. That has been accepted very publicly by  business. Indeed, it has been accepted publicly and privately by many in the  Chamber. It affords us the opportunity to begin to seize some measure of  control over our economic destiny and to try to shape economic recovery, both  in this region and on the island as a whole, and to decide our economic future.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">On behalf of the Committee for Finance and Personnel and  the Committee for Enterprise,  Trade and Investment, I commend the motion to the House.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I call Mr David McIlveen. The Member has five minutes.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D McIlveen</strong>:  I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on the subject, and I support the  motion wholeheartedly.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Less than two weeks ago, I had the privilege of visiting  Wrightbus in my North Antrim constituency. In  the presence of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Minister of Enterprise,  Trade and Investment and other representatives from the business community, we  heard, one by one, the CBI, the FSB and the Chamber of Commerce speak with one  voice. It said that the Assembly should be given the powers to set its own rate  of corporation tax, which, although not a cast-iron guarantee of success, is  the best &mdash; perhaps the only &mdash; way that we can reinject some life into the Northern Ireland  economy.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">There have been many debates surrounding budgets and cuts  to public spending in this short term of the Assembly. However, on this issue,  talking must be coupled with listening. That means listening to the members of  the private sector, on whom to a large extent, most of us agree, the success or  failure of our economy relies.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Of course, the cynical among us will say that asking a  business owner whether they want to pay less tax will not provoke an entirely  surprising response, but we must remember that the majority of small businesses  will not benefit directly from a reduction in corporation tax, if we choose to  reduce it. However, even the small businesses support it, because they know  that the secondary spend that comes from jobs created through foreign direct  investment will benefit small retailers also.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">If we reduce corporation tax, we must not be unmindful of  the cost. We cannot be complacent about that. If public services suffer as a  result of a reduction in corporation tax, we, as elected representatives, will  have considerable explaining to do. However, the most conservative estimates of  economic growth as a result of a reduction in corporation tax see our economy  rising by something in the region of 6% a year. Given that the most optimistic  forecasts see our current output at around 1&middot;9%, the gains in revenue would  comfortably mitigate any losses that we would incur through a reduction in the  block grant.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">There are huge challenges ahead for Northern Ireland  in rebalancing our economy. However, with challenges come opportunities. The  Celtic tiger economy in the Republic  of Ireland was built predominantly on  foreign direct investment from the USA. Given the investment that we  have put into the US  markets, we should continue to work hard to attract further investment from  that area. However, with emerging economies becoming ever stronger in India, China  and other parts of the Far East, we are  extremely well placed to attract investment from those areas if corporation tax  powers are devolved to the Executive. In that regard, there is a huge strategic  advantage to our being part of the UK,  as it enables foreign businesses to set up a much-coveted base in Britain. If we  can further incentivise those companies with a lower rate of tax than the other  devolved regions, we will have an opportunity to move Northern Ireland  forward to a new level of economic growth.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I conclude by paying tribute to Invest NI, which has  exceeded pretty much every target that has been set before it in the past four  years. In particular, I pay tribute to Alastair Hamilton, whose leadership,  vision and passion for business in Northern   Ireland has been and, I believe, will continue to be a  major contributor to rebalancing Northern Ireland&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>: I  welcome the opportunity to speak in the debate, as the devolution of  corporation tax to Northern    Ireland is such an important issue. I also  welcome the fact that the two Committees, the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Investment and the  Committee for Finance and Personnel, have brought the matter before the House  today. The Committee for Finance and Personnel has looked at the issue and  received representation from the Finance Minister. The positives for the  devolution of corporation tax to Northern Ireland are well documented.  They are increased economic growth; the attraction of foreign direct  investment; an increase in jobs, leading to lower unemployment; and the  rebalancing of the Northern    Ireland economy, which is over-reliant on  the public sector.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I want to focus on how a reduction in corporation tax would  be implemented, should we have the power to alter the tax devolved to Northern Ireland.  Any reduction in corporation tax should be done incrementally. That can be seen  through the actions of the coalition Government, who announced major reforms to  corporation tax with four 1% reductions to the main rate. The rate was reduced  to 26% in April of this year and, by 2014, will be reduced to 23%. In Northern  Ireland, we should look at a similar system, whereby we gradually reduce the  rate of corporation tax with a view to competing on a more equal playing field  with the Republic of Ireland&rsquo;s rate of 12&middot;5%.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">There are a number of reasons why I believe that  corporation tax should be lowered incrementally. First, due to the Azores ruling by the European Court of Justice, regional  differences in direct taxation must satisfy fiscal autonomy. That means that Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  block grant would have to be adjusted to reflect the cost of a reduction in  corporation tax. In order to ensure that we do not inflict too severe a cut on  the block in one go, an incremental lowering of the tax would mean that the  reduction of the block grant would be spread over a longer time and would have  the minimum impact possible on the provision of services to the people of  Northern Ireland.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, incrementally lowering the rate of corporation  tax would allow the Executive to respond flexibly to any change in the economy.  The economic landscape is unclear in Northern Ireland, especially with a  questionable four-year Budget that fails to protect front line health services  and includes revenue-raising methods that lack sufficient clarity. I knew that  the Minister would appreciate that comment. In those circumstances, it is vital  that we have the ability to react to the particular challenges that the economy  will present. Altering the rate of corporation tax on an incremental basis will  allow us to do that.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Finally, it is essential that the devolution of corporation  tax powers be used as one of a basket of measures to increase economic growth  in Northern Ireland.  The Treasury consultation sets out proposals such as research and development  tax credits, an enhanced annual investment allowance, training credits and even  a National Insurance holiday. All those measures need to be explored because  only a combination of mechanisms will lead to a successful rebalancing of the Northern Ireland  economy.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Bearing in mind the points that I have raised, I support  the motion.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. In my party&rsquo;s view, lowering the rate  of corporation tax in Northern Ireland will be a major tool in helping to  rebalance the economy here, which is over-reliant on a public sector that is  all too often at the mercy of the political whims of whoever is in power at  Westminster. The current tools that we have to develop the private sector are  useful and necessary but have not been successful in bringing about the growth  that we require. We need to develop the private sector in order to generate  more employment and spending and to deliver the revenue that we need to provide  the best possible public services.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Foreign direct investment will be a major influence in  rebalancing the economy, and a lower rate of corporation tax will be a major element  in attracting it and closing the productivity gap. Indigenous businesses will  also benefit from a lower corporation tax rate, and it will provide our SMEs  with additional capacity to invest to grow their businesses.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">If the powers are devolved, we should not rush into  reducing the rate without knowing the full fiscal implications of that  decision. At present, we do not know how much corporation tax is taken in Northern Ireland.  There are varying estimates from DFP and the Treasury, and we need an accurate  baseline figure so that we can assess the true impact on the block grant and  manage the shortfall. We know that corporation tax is volatile and that its  take can vary greatly from year to year. To offset the costs associated with  the devolution of corporation tax powers, it is important that Northern Ireland  is in a position to avail itself of any indirect benefits that result from  increased economic activity, such as receipts from increased income tax, VAT,  National Insurance, excise duty and, indeed, corporation tax itself.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Although the devolution of corporation tax powers and the  lowering of the rate here is not a magical mist that will cure all our economic  ills, it is an essential tool in rebalancing the economy, making Northern  Ireland a more attractive prospect for foreign direct investment and enhancing  indigenous economic activity, which will result in a more prosperous Northern  Ireland for all our people. We need the House to unite with enthusiasm behind  the motion to ensure that we send a positive message on the issue. Those who  negotiate on our behalf on this matter must put forward the strongest possible  case for the devolution of corporation tax powers. It is an essential tool in  advancing the prosperity of this region, and the SDLP fully supports the  motion.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>: I  support the motion as proposed, particularly as it specifies the words &ldquo;in  principle&rdquo; in stating that the Assembly supports the case for the devolution of  corporation tax powers.</p>
<p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I feel that the next time we come to this matter,  when we have the outcome of the Treasury consultation and all the cost-benefit  information available to us, we will have a major decision to make. However,  for today, I am happy to support the motion in principle, although I have some  misgivings about the best way to proceed in the long term.</p>
<p class="TimePeriod">12.00 noon</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">If we have a lower corporation tax rate, what will the  benefits be, and will it work? I heard the Committee Chair mention that 4,500  jobs would be created per annum over the next 10 years. That figure at least  sounds realistic, unlike some of the figures that have been bandied about in  the past year. The other day I heard that there would be 90,000 jobs. We would  have to find more immigrants from somewhere to fill those jobs &mdash; it is just not  possible. However, 4,500 sounds like a figure worth going for.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">There is no doubt that the overwhelming weight of opinion  in Northern Ireland  advocates the measure. Indeed, the Northern Ireland Economic Reform Group said:</p>
<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;it is, without exaggeration, the only means we know  of comprehensively changing the economic environment, within a timescale of  years rather than decades.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">It is fair to say, however, that there are also  well-informed voices, including some who would benefit from a reduction in the  corporation tax rate, who take the opposite view. I wonder what the most  important criteria are for an industrialist or an investor when deciding where  to locate worldwide. I wonder where corporation tax ranks on the list of  priorities. That list would include the availability of skilled labour;  political stability; good infrastructure; closeness to markets; energy costs;  wages levels; and the amount of government support available to establish  incoming business. Some of those criteria we meet and some we would struggle  with. However, I have heard it argued that no level of corporation tax would  compensate for not ticking most of the boxes on that list.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The argument is forcefully made that, to compete for inward  investment, we need a rate comparable with that of the Republic of Ireland.  Compared with us, Ireland  has certainly benefited from a level of inward jobs, but, again, given the  present circumstances, what will happen to the Irish corporation tax rate? The  pressure is on from big hitters in the EU for Ireland to come more into line. It  is a pressure that Ireland  has so far resisted manfully, but is that position really sustainable? If the  Irish have to go back to the EU for a further bailout, one condition will  certainly be a rise in their corporation tax rate. The further argument is  which line of investment to prioritise. Should it be this initiative,  investment in our universities and further eductaion facilities &mdash; we had a good  discussion about that yesterday &mdash; or support for small indigenous businesses? I  imagine that the way forward is a cocktail of all three.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I can think of some people who started small in this  country and went on to great things. I remember Allen McClay starting his  business, Galen, in Portadown as a one-man band and where it led to. I think of  Fred Wilson of FG Wilson, part of Caterpillar. Corporation tax was not a big  factor for them when they started their businesses. Eddie Haughey of Norbrook  is another example. As a young insurance man, I was famously asked to insure  Norbrook when it first opened, but the company that I worked for decided that  it did not like the look of it and that it would not go anywhere. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span> Mr Speaker, I can tell you that, if that  company had made a different decision, I would not be here now, that is for  sure.</p>
<p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Principal Deputy Speaker &nbsp;[Mr Molloy] in the Chair)</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">We are right to support a full investigation of the costs  and benefits of devolving corporation tax powers. The final decision regarding  public expenditure will require the biggest leap of faith that we in the  Assembly have ever had to make. We should not rush our fences on this matter;  it is far too important, and there is no reason for haste. Other Members have  said that we should take it as it comes. Let us make a balanced, well-informed  decision at the end of the day. So, with the caveat that I expressed and those  contained in the motion, I support the motion.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I listened to the Member talk about a leap of faith, but I am not sure which  side of the classic Alliance  fence he wants to leap to. Having listened to his five-minute contribution, I  am still not sure whether he is in favour of devolving powers.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>:  Just to be clear: I said at the beginning and at the end of my speech that I  support the motion.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  Very good. The Member&rsquo;s use of &ldquo;in principle&rdquo; was key, though.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the debate, not least its timing, which allows  the House to offer its support, I hope, to the Treasury consultation,  &lsquo;Rebalancing the Northern    Ireland economy&rsquo;. It is a very timely debate  to have to allow the Assembly to endorse in principle, or however we want to do  it, the devolution of corporation tax powers.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">In the general chorus of positivity on the motion, many  Members have said that we would be naive in the extreme to think that devolving  corporation tax powers would be an instant panacea to all our economic ills and  that looking at corporation tax levels would be the only consideration that an  investor would make before investing. Even with 0% business taxes and a low-cost  regime across the board, foreign direct investment will not come to Northern Ireland  unless we have the infrastructure, the skills and the telecommunications in  place. Indeed, businesses will not come here unless we have golf courses,  theatres and so on. There is a cocktail of measures that we must have.  Companies such as Citigroup and the New York Stock Exchange have come to Northern Ireland,  while HBO is making films and TV programmes here. Such things would never have  been considered possible 10 years ago. Therefore, Northern Ireland already has huge  attractions for investors. We have an almost unbeatable product, but the  addition of a low rate of corporation tax would take that almost unbeatable  product to a whole new level.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Campbell</strong>:  I thank the Member for giving way. He outlines some of the very positive  advantages, which I think are recognised across the House. Does he agree that  the competitiveness that we could gain versus the cost is something that we  will have to analyse? We need to concentrate on the rate &mdash; 15%, 10%, 12% or  whatever it might be &mdash; and be sure that we are concentrating on its  competitiveness. The one rate that has a political connotation, and about which  people would have very strong reservations, is the 12&middot;5% rate, because some  people would use that as a harmonising tool rather than as a competitiveness  tool.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Principal  Deputy Speaker</strong>: The Member has an extra minute.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  Thank you, Mr Principal Deputy Speaker. The Member&rsquo;s point is an important one.  If we get the powers to reduce the rate of corporation tax, we need to strike  it at a rate that is right for Northern    Ireland. There is a whole other discussion  to be had on how we reach that figure, but the Member is absolutely right. We  need to get the right rate for Northern    Ireland to allow us to be competitive in  what is an increasingly difficult global market.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Quite a few naysayers have said that we should not be  discussing the issue at all. As Mr Lunn said, this may be, if not the biggest,  one of the biggest policy decisions that we will ever face in Northern Ireland,  and we should not face that decision lightly. We should be very careful and  considered in our approach. Therefore, I welcome the naysayers&rsquo; contribution to  the debate, although I do not necessarily agree with what they say. However, we  should be cognisant of the concerns raised.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">In some ways, though, this is a simple decision to take.  Whenever I look into the cupboard of possible policy interventions that would  allow a step change to occur in our economy to right the imbalance between the  public sector and the private sector here and that would close the gap in  living standards &mdash; we sit at only 80% of the UK standard of living &mdash; the  cupboard is pretty bare. In not going after a reduction in the rate of corporation  tax, given the positive changes that its introduction might make to bringing  investment and jobs to Northern Ireland, making indigenous companies  beneficiaries in the process, we will be consigning Northern Ireland to more of  the same &mdash; a sort of as-you-were economic future. That is not acceptable. We  should not be looking at simply trundling along, with more of the same for ever  and a day in Northern    Ireland. We should be looking at something  different and something better for our people.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The benefits are well known: jobs; foreign direct  investment (FDI); and spin-offs for local companies. Although colleagues and I  have laughed at and ridiculed the basket case that is the Irish economy in some  respects over how the bubble down there has burst, I did note that &lsquo;The Irish  Times&rsquo; last week reported that the Central Statistics Office in Dublin has said  that the export market in the South is now at a record high. Irish exports in  the first quarter of 2011 were up some 3&middot;8% on the final quarter of 2010, and  up 20&middot;6% &mdash; valued at &euro;1&middot;5 billion &mdash; over the past year.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">In spite of that bubble bursting, the Irish export market  is doing well. That success is driven by the companies attracted by lower  corporation tax. Why do the Irish jealously guard their power to have low  corporation tax? We must consider the cost, but our approach must be that we  want a lower rate. After that, we can discuss how. Mr Cree left out the issue  of skills. If we reduce the rate, we need to have people available to take up  the jobs in any number of years&rsquo; time. There are a lot of things to be  discussed but, in principle, we should respond very positively to the  consultation. We should tell the Treasury that we want those powers and make  our own decisions thereafter on the future.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I welcome the debate and the  momentum for change that has built from a fairly lethargic beginning some five  or six years ago. We have followed a trajectory that followed the all-party  agreement during the Preparation for Government discussions and brought us to  this point. The change of Administration at Westminster and the coalition Government  taking a different approach from that of the previous Labour Administration  have also contributed.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">During every debate on the economy here, and we have  debated it during much more benign circumstances than exist at present,  everyone commented on, lamented or criticised the imbalance in the economy. It  is a simple statement of fact: the economy is out of balance. Consequently, it  is uncompetitive, underdeveloped and more vulnerable to the global and  international economic trade winds. Up to now, the Assembly has experienced extreme  difficulty, within its powers and resources, in responding appropriately to  grow the economy, which was the number one priority established early in the  previous mandate. The difficulty in addressing that was that the Assembly  simply did not have the economic and fiscal tools in its toolbox.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I have heard comments on the dangers of harmonised tax  regimes on the island   of Ireland. That is a  particular, sectional view. My opinion is that there are significant advantages  in being able to market the island economy and its harmonisation of rates as an  economic opportunity for inward investment. The island could be marketed on the  basis that it would be location indifferent because no fiscal advantage would  apply on any part of the island. Up to now, the one-way street placed one part  of the island at a significant disadvantage. However, a race to the bottom does  not bode well for any economy, as we have seen over and over again.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I note that the Finance Minister has been careful to say  continually to the Assembly that we must be responsible and careful. At times,  he came across as negative, but he has done a service to the debate, because  lowering corporation tax is not a risk-free option. No MLA will approach the  decision not having been alerted to the possible downsides. A lower rate is not  a silver bullet, and the decision requires a careful and, in my view, informed  judgement. There has been considerable debate, study, research and  consultation. Many exchanges have taken place, particularly between business,  economic leaders, academia, trade unions and stakeholders. At the end of the  day, all recognised the opportunities as well as the dangers.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I want to respond briefly to the warning about incremental  change. That is a prudent and correct approach, and I do not argue against it.  However, I do argue against &mdash; this is not a party political point &mdash; taking too  conservative an approach. If we go for a lower rate of corporation tax but are  afraid to be bold or imaginative, it could deny people the ability to produce  early evidence that it is the correct strategy for growing and rebalancing the  economy.</p>
<p class="TimePeriod">12.15 pm</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Although we should continue to be vigilant of the steps  that we take if the power is devolved, there is as much danger in being too  cautious and careful as there is in overreaching. Were we given the additional  powers, the collective wisdom in the Assembly and the experience and support of  Ministers would ensure that &mdash;</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Principal  Deputy Speaker</strong>: Bring your remarks to a close.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>:  &mdash; we could deliver on the number one objective of growing the economy.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Girvan</strong>: I  speak in favour of the motion, on the understanding that a reduction in the  rate of corporation tax is only one of a number of measures to try to rebalance  Northern Ireland&rsquo;s economy, albeit that I believe that it is one of the  greatest opportunities that we will have to attract inward investment. If used  correctly, it could reduce the Northern    Ireland economy&rsquo;s reliance on public sector  employment. It would be a great revenue generator, not only through the taxes  received but for the wider economy, particularly the retail end, which would  benefit from the money generated.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">A reduction in the rate would give Invest NI a great  opportunity to go out and sell Northern    Ireland on the world stage. Like my  colleague Mr Campbell, I fear our going down the route of setting a target of 12&middot;5%.  We should not be aiming to be on a par with what is a small economy of five  million in the Republic of Ireland, given that the United Kingdom has a population of  more than 60 million.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  The Member warns the House about establishing a rate of 12&middot;5%. Does he agree  with the First Minister, who has espoused the view that a 10% rate might be  appropriate?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Girvan</strong>:  Our manifesto states that our ultimate goal is 10&middot;5%. I am happy enough to say  that if that were to happen, we would be an even more attractive region in  which to invest, I hope and pray. It is not just about inward investment; a  number of local companies would take advantage of and benefit from that rate.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">There is a fear that we would end up with a number of  companies coming in and brass plating, as it is known. I appreciate that  measures would have to be put in place to ensure that that did not happen. Look  at what the Exchequer in London  has done: it has already made changes to the way in which corporation tax is  worked in that economy. There is a view to bring it down to 23%, and hopefully  that will help there.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Northern Ireland  is the gateway to Europe, and I appreciate that America is one of our key markets.  The UK  has a population of more than 60 million, and I think that we have to look at  the strength of the British economy. We know about the fears of all those in  the euro zone at present, and we need to take those fears into account. Northern Ireland has the opportunity to look not  only to America for inward  investment but to one of the world&rsquo;s leading economies, China. We have  a wonderful workforce and a great skills base here. The universities gave a  presentation in the Long Gallery yesterday that showed off some of the  innovation and ability that Northern    Ireland as a region can sell on the world  stage. We have to look at that, too.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Corporation tax is only one tool in the box, so we need to  consider others, such as how to work with the Planning Service to encourage  investment. One of the problems in the past was that businesses were put off  because of the protracted experience that was planning process bureaucracy. There  was some reform in that area and that is the sort of area that we need to  encourage, to open up our economy to a large extent.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I appreciate that the consultation is under way. I have  received many positive messages from local businesses, not only from small  businesses but from some larger employers such as FG Wilson and other companies  that are based in my constituency. It is vital that we encourage them and give  them the confidence that we are using every tool in the box to grow our economy  and to encourage the creation of jobs in Northern Ireland.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Nesbitt</strong>:  I also support the motion. We in the House are here to make the big decisions.  Those decisions do not necessarily have a right answer, an exact formula or a  scientific equation such as E=mc&sup2;, and that is the case when it comes to  something like corporation tax. The only wrong decision would be to do nothing.  The world is moving on, and I know that the Minister of Finance and Personnel  will tell the House that all the models and the predictions are based on a  fundamental assumption of all other things being equal. I also know that he  could tell us that in English and in the original Latin.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">There is another Latin phrase that is appropriate; it  translates into English as &ldquo;buyer beware&rdquo;. As we consider taking the power to  set our own rate of corporation tax, there are uncertainties that must be  resolved, such as whether Europe will support  us or whether we will end up in the European Court of Justice. We must also  consider whether we can agree with HM Treasury on the exact current tax take  from corporation tax and its implications for the block grant, and whether we  can agree with Treasury on what will happen to additional tax revenues and  receipts from sources such as National Insurance contributions and VAT.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The world is moving on, not least with Europe ending  selective financial assistance (SFA), which was the main tool used by Invest  Northern Ireland and its predecessors to attract foreign investment here. For  me, corporation tax is not just a replacement for SFA; it will represent a  transformational change. SFA traditionally tended to attract cost centres and  operations that do not necessarily make a profit for their parent company, and  which, therefore, do not find themselves liable to any form of tax, never mind  corporation tax. Corporation tax is more likely to attract profit centres, such  as those that deal in manufacturing and tradable services, and that will  attract taxation.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">For me, corporation tax is a starting-line tax. Without the  power to set that tax, FDIs will look elsewhere to do business, but having it  gives us the opportunity to get them to the starting line and encourage them to  delve deeper into our offer. We have heard from other Members about that offer  and the package, toolbox and elements that are needed, including improved  planning and taxation law, the removal of red tape, and, above all else, the  creation of the necessary skills base. Indeed, in a debate yesterday, we talked  about the need for our further and higher education colleges to ensure that the  ever-widening demand for highly skilled workers is met in the coming years.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I would like to remind the House of why we want the power  to vary the corporation tax rate and why we want to lower it. It is not to make  the fat cats of business any fatter; rather, it will address some fundamental  flaws that have been in our economy for decades. Those include  under-productivity and lagging behind the UK average in our prosperity. It  will make our citizens better off by creating the environment in which  businesspeople can generate the jobs that create the income that yields the  taxes that fund excellence in our public services.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, this is an opportunity to show the  indigenous and international business communities that we, as an Assembly and  an Executive, are up to the challenge of transmitting the message of political  cohesion and confidence that they are looking for. Finally, if I may refer back  to Mr Lunn&rsquo;s contribution and his honesty in admitting about the one that got  away, I am interested to know what he first thought when he heard the Beatles  and whether that is why he is not the Alliance Party&rsquo;s music spokesman.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Principal  Deputy Speaker</strong>: Order. As this is the first debate in which the Assembly  will hear from Mr Lynch, I remind the House that it is the convention that a  maiden speech is made without interruption.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lynch</strong>: Go  raibh m&iacute;le maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Ar dt&uacute;s, ba mhaith liom mo  bhu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il le muintir Fhear Manach agus Th&iacute;r Eoghain Theas as deis a  thabhairt domh bheith i mo Chomhalta den Teach seo. I would like to take the  opportunity to thank the people of Fermanagh and South Tyrone who elected me as  a Sinn F&eacute;in Member of the House.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">In thinking about my speech, I was interested in what a  Member from the opposite Bench Mr David McIlveen said in his maiden speech a  number of weeks ago. He dedicated his victory to his grandmother, an Irish  republican, Mrs Evelyn Margaret McIlveen, who hailed from Bailieborough in County Cavan.  My grandmother Margaret Hogg came from the Protestant tradition. She was a  Methodist, but she changed her religion when she married at the time of  partition. She suffered as a result, and it is from her side of the family that  I get my republican beliefs. Mr McIlveen said that he was glad that he could be  found on the side of the House on which he sits. T&aacute; m&eacute; an-bhr&oacute;d&uacute;il a bheith ar  an taobh seo den Teach mar phoblacht&aacute;nach. Equally, I am proud to be on this  side of the House as an Irish republican.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Our stories highlight the fact that we are not that far  apart despite our histories. If we go back a few more generations to the late  1700s, when the United Irishmen and United Irishwomen fought for separation  from England,  we see that they consisted mainly of people from the Protestant tradition. It  is my hope and vision that we all converge on the same path and build an Ireland that we  can be proud of and which reflects our traditions. I dedicate my speech not to  any one individual but to my family, particularly my parents, who are in their  eighties and nineties and are currently in Donegal, and to my friends and  comrades who placed their trust in me during many years of personal struggle.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I move to the motion. Devolution of corporation tax powers  is a complex issue. I am not an economist. However, many stakeholders believe  that it is one of the key economic levers that can rebalance and kick-start the  economy in the North of Ireland. Some experts estimate that over 90,000 new  jobs can be created over 20 years by reducing the rate of corporation tax.  Central to the argument for reduction is the premise that the probability of  attracting foreign direct investment will be enhanced. Attracting FDI is seen  as the way to create high-skilled and high-wage jobs. It is also assumed that  lower corporation tax will encourage businesspeople to reinvest.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">However, I have spoken to businesspeople in my constituency  and attended a recent conference on the issue in Enniskillen. To say the least,  many are not convinced that all boats will rise with the tide of FDI,  particularly in a county that has to rely on indigenous business to sustain the  local economy. Fermanagh could be further disadvantaged due to the fact that it  relies mostly on the public sector. Any move on corporation tax should be used  not as a tool to downsize the public sector but a lever to rebalance the  private sector with the public sector.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I contend that, at the macro level, a lower corporation tax  level can be an advantage in driving the economy forward but it should not be  viewed in isolation. High levels of educational attainment, an increased skills  level, increased research and development spending, and increased investment in  training all have a part to play in developing a sustainable economy. We must  continue to support and, indeed, increase our efforts with regard to small and  medium-sized enterprises.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I support the motion, in principle, as a first step towards  taking responsibility for influencing the future sustainability of our economy  and harmonising corporate tax rates throughout the island of Ireland,  particularly for border constituencies, such as Fermanagh and South Tyrone.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  I very much welcome the debate, which is extremely timely. Our thanks are due  to the two Committees that have set it up. The debate comes at a time when the  Treasury consultation on devolving tax-varying powers to the Northern Ireland  Executive is drawing to a close. It comes just before the time when really  detailed engagement on the cost of lowering corporation tax in the North is due  to begin.</p>
<p class="TimePeriod">12.30 pm</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I have made it clear many times that the SDLP&rsquo;s position is  one of strong support for the devolution of tax-varying powers to the Northern  Ireland Executive and for the subsequent lowering of corporation tax, although  I recognise the fact that there is a downside in the cost, which I will come to  later. We also believe in varying other taxes, and we have argued repeatedly  that, if we are to move our economy out of recession and onto a new growth  trajectory, we need to take control of more economic levers.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The ability to vary taxation in the North is a major new  economic lever, and even though it comes at a price, it must be cost-neutral to  the Treasury, and, therefore, we have to grab it with both hands. Given our  failure to do much for the economy using the only other economic lever  currently available to us, which is public expenditure, with our, I suppose,  policy-lazy and unimaginative Budget, we must surely try to make the most of  this opportunity.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Happily, the vast majority of public representatives and  the five parties in the Executive are fully behind a lower rate of corporation  tax. However, although some of the trade unions and the MP for South Down &mdash;  sorry, North Down, I hasten to correct myself &mdash; are opposed to a lower rate of  corporation tax, I am particularly concerned about one politician, our Finance  Minister, Mr Wilson. Not only has he stated his scepticism on numerous  occasions but he has made it clear that he does not share his party&rsquo;s  enthusiasm for a lower rate of corporation tax. I will go further. On a  spectrum of support for lowering the rate of corporation tax, Mr Wilson is closer  to the outright opposition of Lady Hermon than to the unequivocally in-favour  position of his DUP colleague, the Enterprise Minister, and he is completely at  odds with the position of his colleague and party leader, the First Minister,  who not only supports the lowering of corporation tax but argues that it should  go below 12<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; ">&#8729;</span>5% to 10%, a  point already referred to by my colleague Mr Bradley.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I know that the DUP is an increasingly broad church, which  we welcome. However, in this case, the problem is that the dissenter is the  Finance Minister, and he is the person whose job it is to lead the team that  will negotiate the terms and, ultimately, the cost to all of us of lowering the  rate of corporation tax. How can he lead a successful negotiation for a concession  that he does not believe in? How can he make sure that the cost is closer to,  say, &pound;100 million than &pound;500 million if he does not believe in the project in  the first place? I believe that his opposition is fundamentally misplaced. As  with the Budget, there is a policy-laziness and a lack of imagination at work  in DFP. His position is one of excessive caution and fear of change,  masquerading as prudent management. So who should lead the negotiation on the  ultimate cost of this proposition?</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Let me immediately correct myself and tell you that, when I  raised the matter with the Chancellor of the Exchequer at our meeting last  week, he told me that there would be a price but not a negotiation. The cost of  lowering the rate of corporation tax would be determined independently by the  Office for Budget Responsibility. However, although the Chancellor has kindly  described the process, he is wrong about the negotiation because no instant  calculation can objectively determine the correct cost to the Treasury of lowering  the rate of corporation tax in Northern    Ireland. Too many fundamental assumptions  are open to question, and there are many complex and debatable variations in  that calculation.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Ultimately, the bottom-line figure will be arrived at  following intensive discussions between economists and their political masters  from all sides, and that is effectively a negotiation. It is not only prudent  but vital to our interests that we put forward the strongest possible economic  argument for the lower end of the range of possible costs, and the only people  whom I have heard put forward a credible argument here are from outside the  government service.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Let us be clear: we fully support the lowering of the rate  of corporation tax, while recognising the downside.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Principal  Deputy Speaker</strong>: Will the Member please bring her remarks to a close?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  We believe that Northern    Ireland must put its best foot forward.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dunne</strong>: I  welcome the opportunity to speak to the motion.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">There is no doubt that there is a real need to grow the  economy in Northern Ireland,  as the current balance is considered overly dependent on the public sector. Our  economy needs to be driven more by the private sector. With a vibrant private  sector, Northern Ireland  would benefit greatly from more wealth and prosperity, economic opportunities  and jobs through new investment. A reduction in corporation tax would encourage  investment and provide a much-needed boost to our local economy, which has,  unfortunately, become too dependent on the public sector.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Much of the current infrastructure is already well placed  to complement a competitive and vibrant private sector. Northern Ireland  enjoys good transport links, a modern telecommunications framework and, thanks  to our two leading universities, an excellent skills base. Although there is  always room for improvement in those areas, we currently have a good base from  which to start as we seek to grow Northern Ireland and make this  country the best place to do business.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Foreign direct investment (FDI) has the potential to be  highly successful in achieving the required rebalancing of the economy.  However, it also depends on a corporation tax rate that will enable Northern  Ireland to close the gap with the rest of the UK and compete for investment  with the Republic of Ireland, which currently has a tax rate of 12&middot;5%. That  rate looks set to continue long into the future.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">A reduction in the rate of corporation tax is a long-term  policy, as it is a long-term economic plan designed to benefit this country and  ensure a prosperous future. It is inevitable that such a reduction in  corporation tax will have short-term effects. One such impact that we will have  to face is a reduction in the block grant. This is a central issue, and it is  important to have clarity on it. It is imperative that we do not create an  extra burden on ourselves by reducing public spending. It would be foolish  significantly to reduce public spending in areas that help to attract and  maintain a good business-friendly environment. It is essential that we are not  short-changed and that we get a good deal.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">There is clear evidence that a reduction in the rate of  corporation tax would attract FDI to Northern Ireland. We require more  direct manufacturing jobs. Northern    Ireland must return to being a place where  engineers carry out research and development on future projects, which they  take through to development, production and manufacturing in a competitive  marketplace. Having listened to the views of important professional bodies,  such as Invest NI and the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB), who are  undoubtedly better placed than many of us in the House today to assess the  benefits of reducing corporation tax, I feel that this is an opportunity to  bring real and lasting benefit to our economy.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Allister</strong>:  The Member said that he had listened to views. The one report not mentioned in  the debate &mdash; doubtless, the Member has read it &mdash; is that by  PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC). Will he comment on the fact that it states that  there is no clear evidence of a correlation between low corporation tax, per  se, and high levels of FDI? The Member seems to think that it is a magic  formula for increasing FDI. What about the PWC report?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Principal  Deputy Speaker</strong>: The Member has an extra minute.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dunne</strong>:  Throughout the world, the evidence is that a reduction in corporation tax leads  to significant improvements. Some like to regard it as a tax reduction that  will benefit only the large multinational companies. However, the FSB&rsquo;s recent  survey in May 2011 concluded that the overwhelming majority of owners of small  businesses in Northern    Ireland believed that the lowering of  corporation tax would have a positive impact on the local economy. It concluded  that that would help to improve the conditions for a competitive, business-friendly  environment.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">For too long, our manufacturing has been unable to compete  against the rest of the world. We now seek to compete with countries in the Far  East, such as China.  I am aware of a large manufacturing company in Belfast that is involved in government  contracts. It sources material locally, sends it to Vietnam  for sub-assembly, and returns that to Belfast  for final installation in the completed product.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">It is important that we do all we can to expand and advance  our already well-established aerospace and pharmaceutical industries and  further help to promote our proud reputation for innovation and invention  across the spectrum of industries. We need to be able to compete competitively  again in the world market and see an increase in foreign investors who will  develop our skills, grow our economy with increased productivity, increase  employment &mdash;</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Principal  Deputy Speaker</strong>: Bring your remarks to a close.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dunne</strong>: &mdash;  and help to create a more prosperous future for our country. We need to  demonstrate to the world that Northern    Ireland is open for business. I support the  motion.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Flanagan</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat. Comhghairdeas, a Phr&iacute;omh-LeasCheann Comhairle, as do phost  nua. &Eacute;ir&iacute;m le taca&iacute;ocht a thabhairt don r&uacute;n.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I support the motion and the plans to devolve corporation  tax to this Assembly. For many years, we have argued that fiscal powers should  be transferred to this Assembly and that decisions on the rates of taxation  that should be set need to be taken by locally appointed Ministers.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The potential for devolved corporation tax is only one  small part of this. This debate is not about a reduction in corporation tax but  the devolution of the powers to set the rate. Whether or not one agrees with a  reduction in corporation tax is not the issue at hand. If we manage to get  these powers devolved, then we can begin a discussion on what the actual rate  will be.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">There is a corporation tax rate of 12&middot;5% in the South. That  has often been heralded as the main reason why so many foreign investors  decided to locate there. It may have been one reason, but it surely was not the  only one. Huge multinational companies decided to locate in the South as a  result of a wide range of factors, including a high number of skilled people  willing to work, a young and educated population, widespread use of the English  language, and a decent level of infrastructure investment.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I listened carefully to what the Member said. He referred to the skills base in  the South and a young, well-educated population. Does that description not  exactly suit our own situation here in Northern Ireland? However, the one  thing that is different is the corporation tax rate. Is that not really an  argument in favour of a reduction in corporation tax and the centrality of that  in transforming the economy?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Principal  Deputy Speaker</strong>: The Member has an extra minute.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Flanagan</strong>:  I am quite baffled by the question. There was quite a bit in there that I  missed, but I will go on, and if the Member wishes to intervene again, he can.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">A lot of the jobs that were created have now disappeared,  and we have seen how quickly that can happen. Those measures that I referred  to, and to which the Member referred as well, are the kind of things that we  need to put in place to ensure that our economy, in particular our private  sector, is enabled to grow sustainably.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">We also need to work on the basis of co-operation, as  opposed to competition, to grow our all-island economy. For too long, the  argument has been put forward that in the North we are over-reliant on our  public sector and handouts from the British Government. Yet the British  Government tell us all this without the knowledge of how much tax, including  corporation tax, is accrued here.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Before the Assembly can take a decision on what any future  rate of corporation tax will be, we need full clarity on what the implications  may be for the block grant and our public services. At present, those  implications are unclear. The future of our economic success is not simply a  matter for DFP or DETI. As we all know, growing our economy is the  responsibility of many Departments and of the Executive as a whole.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">We rely on our education system to ensure that young people  receive the right training, advice and support to equip themselves for a  fast-moving and challenging economy. We need proper investment in our road  network and telecommunications infrastructure to ensure that businesses can  compete, transport goods and communicate effectively. We also need to see  reform on how procurement takes place so that small and medium-sized  enterprises can have access to public contracts, limited though they may be at  present.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">In the past, much of the focus was on attracting foreign  direct investment to create jobs and grow our economy. We, as an Assembly, need  to realise that the people who will grow our economy in a sustainable way are  those who live here and those who have an entrepreneurial spirit. Those are the  people who require our help.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Mr Nesbitt referred to Invest NI, and there has been a lot  of focus on its work. It is clear that it is going to have to change its  tactics for attracting foreign direct investment, as a result of the abolition  of SFA from 2013.</p>
<p class="TimePeriod">12.45 pm</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">We also need to ensure that any additional revenues that  are generated from increased taxation &mdash; income tax, VAT and National Insurance  contributions &mdash; are retained by the Executive. That is particularly important  given the threat of a cut to the block grant, although, as I have said before,  the British Treasury has no idea what size any cut might be.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">This debate has been going on for quite a while, and  opinions have been mixed across society. Mr Lynch referred to some of the  scepticism in Fermanagh. I look forward to this debate gaining momentum and to  a full and frank discussion taking place from this point on.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Whether any potential reduction in corporation tax would  benefit our small and medium-sized enterprises, particularly in areas west of  the Bann, is questionable. We need to see a wide range of measures being put in  place to sustainably grow our economy. Those must include a job creation  strategy and continued investment in education, skills and infrastructure. We  must focus on supporting our indigenous businesses as well as growing our tourism  and agrifood sectors and putting measures in place to ensure that the benefits  of any reduction in corporation tax are felt across our society and not just  within big business. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>:  There has been recognition from virtually everyone that lowering the rate of  corporation tax in Northern    Ireland will not be the silver bullet to  transform our economy. Mr Hamilton, in his opening comments, said it would not  be a panacea. Ms Ritchie was unfair on the Finance Minister when she said that  he was reluctant to take this step. He is right to inject some realism into  this and say that it is not going to be a panacea. In 2007, the Finance  Minister spoke about how devolution would not be the panacea for all our ills,  even though it would be significantly better for us than direct rule. Lowering  corporation tax would be significantly better for us by transforming our  economy, rather than us continuing as we are. Although all of the Ministers  have been careful to say that it is not a silver bullet, we have agreement that  the devolution of corporation tax powers will be a significant lever in our  economic toolkit.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I listened to the Chairman of the Finance Committee, and I  must disagree with him, because this is not about harmonisation of taxation across  Ireland;  it is very much about competitiveness. Just as businesses in Northern Ireland are at a disadvantage when it  comes to air passenger duty because we share a land border with another EU  region, this is another prime example of how business in Northern Ireland  is at a disadvantage, due to the adjoining nation having a lower rate of  corporation tax.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I look around the world to places where there are lower  rates of corporation tax. The Secretary of State is always very keen on  pointing to Canada  and the results that it saw when it reduced corporation tax. In Europe, we can  look at Estonia; we can look  at Singapore.  All of those areas have had lower rates of corporation tax and have been  successful in attracting more investment. Indeed, the national Government at Westminster have modestly reduced the rate of corporation  tax for the United Kingdom,  which is recognition from Treasury that it can have a positive impact in  stimulating the economy.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Of course, lowering corporation tax must sit alongside  other fiscal and economic levers that this Executive can operate. It will  attract further foreign direct investment in coming years, but there are other  things that businesses will look at. Yesterday, I spoke about university  funding and making sure that we continue to have a highly skilled graduate  workforce. After companies look at the rate of corporation tax, they will look  at the quality of the education system and the type of graduates that are  coming out of our universities. Indeed, they will look at the quality of our  universities, as well as at telecommunications, infrastructure and all those  sorts of issues.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">One of the key points is that having a lower rate of  corporation tax gives Northern    Ireland a unique selling point. When Invest  NI or businesses look for investment, the lower rate of corporation tax will be  a very attractive proposition for companies before they look at some of the  other things that Northern    Ireland has to offer. It is very much about  our getting a foot in the door.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">It is telling that lower corporation tax is supported not  only by Members, but, as Mr McIlveen said, by members of the business  community, including small businesses. Although small businesses might not  directly benefit from a lower rate of corporation tax, they recognise that  further job creation in Northern    Ireland will have a knock-on effect down the  supply line, and everyone can benefit from that.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">There is a need to grow the private sector in Northern Ireland  so that we become less reliant on the public sector. Lowering the rate of  corporation tax could well be the tool that we need to help rebalance our  economy and ensure that, in future years, the gap in the standard of living  between people in Northern Ireland  and those in the remainder of the United Kingdom is closed. I fear  that if we do not do something quite dramatic, that gap will continue to be as  wide as it is today.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">We said that corporation tax can increase FDI. An  independent economic advisory group suggested that there could be up to 58,000  new jobs created by 2030. That would be around 3,500 to 4,500 new jobs a year.  We need to make sure that we are ready for this. As I said, it is not just the  high-end graduate jobs but jobs further down the supply chain and local  indigenous businesses that can benefit.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">As Members have said, it will also help us to become more  of an exporting economy, which is something that Northern Ireland needs to move to  in future years. Indeed, even the more modest projections and assumptions point  to the reduction of corporation tax as having a positive impact on the Northern Ireland  economy.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">It is important to say that, although it will stimulate the  local economy, it is important that we get a fair deal from Treasury in getting  the powers to lower corporation tax. Of course there will be a cost to the  Executive, and that has to be taken into account, but I believe that that can  be managed. It should not be viewed as a barrier but as an investment in our  economy and in this country to grow our private sector and create more jobs in  the future.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I believe that, if we can get the power to do that &mdash;</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Principal  Deputy Speaker</strong>: Bring your remarks to a close.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: It  is important that the Executive plan it carefully and that we can see the  realisation of a more vibrant private sector in Northern Ireland.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hussey</strong>: I  begin by commenting on the many languages that have been used here today. We  have had Irish, Latin and English, and it was good to hear one of the Members  on the other Benches comment that one of the strong selling points of the Irish  Republic is the ability of people there to use the English language. It is good  to see that the ability to speak English is something that we should be taking  forward.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">In the past, the Minister suggested that my speech was  written by Owen Paterson. I can assure him today that the only Owen in my  speech is T&iacute;r Eoghain, and County   Tyrone at that. I hope  you can understand my Tyrone accent today, Minister; I will speak slowly for  your benefit.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the opportunity to speak in the debate. As a  member of the Finance and Personnel Committee, I thank all those who spoke  before me, and I thank the Committees for bringing the issue to the House. The  rebalancing and growth of the Northern Ireland  economy is the number one priority for the Assembly throughout this mandate,  and we must work to make sure that we deliver for the people of Northern Ireland  on that front. Let me state from the outset, as my colleagues have done, that  the Ulster Unionist Party is in favour of devolving the setting of the rate of  corporation tax to Northern    Ireland. We recognise the unique situation  that Northern Ireland finds itself in, with a vast over-reliance on the public  sector and a land border with the Republic of Ireland, which has a very low  rate of corporation tax at 12&middot;5%.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Devolving corporation tax powers has been at the forefront  of discussions around addressing the economic problems before us. It has been a  much-debated topic, and it has received support from the majority of the House.  However, today I want to deal with two main issues that are imperative to the  success of the devolution of corporation tax powers: the effect that a decrease  would have on the Northern    Ireland block grant, and how a decrease  would be administered.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">First, the devolution of corporation tax powers will have  obvious consequences for the Northern Ireland  block grant, given the Azores ruling. At  present, the cost to the block grant that is being mooted is far too high.  However, there seems to be some disagreement as to what the figure actually is.  The estimates provided by her Majesty&rsquo;s Treasury differ significantly from  those provided by the Department of Finance and Personnel. Last year, DFP  calculated that the cost to the block grant would be in the region of &pound;400  million by year 5, whereas the two estimates by the Treasury put that figure at  between &pound;225 million and &pound;270 million by year 5. Although I appreciate that  those figures are estimates that have been done at a fairly early stage in the  process, further work must be carried out to find out precisely how much our  block grant would be reduced by should a decrease in corporation tax be taken  forward.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, I want to deal with how the devolution of  corporation tax powers would be administered. That is an area that we need to think  about now, as it impacts heavily on the cost of devolving corporation tax  powers. The two obvious options would be that the corporation tax is charged so  that it is administered by the Department of Finance and Personnel through Land  and Property Services, or it could remain as it is now, and continue to be  administered by Her Majesty&rsquo;s Revenue and Customs.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The advantages and disadvantages of both options need to be  given serious thought. However, the main issue with the administration of the  tax is that Northern Ireland  should have the ability to decrease the rate of corporation tax without taking  the final decision on by how much it should be reduced. That would give the  Northern Ireland Executive the time and latitude to consider what is best for  the Northern Ireland  economy and to react to an ever-changing economic environment.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Finally, I want to reiterate what a number of Members have  said already in the debate, which is that the devolution of corporation tax is  neither a silver bullet nor a panacea for the Northern Ireland economy. It needs  to work in conjunction with a number of other initiatives. Nevertheless, the  benefits that it can bring will be tangible for the people of Northern Ireland,  in the form of more jobs and greater economic growth. I, too, was an insurance  official, but, unlike Mr Lunn, I would have thought a little bit harder about  Norbrook, and I might have taken the risk and gone with it. However, that  decision has passed us by. I look forward to greater economic growth in the Province,  and, for that reason, I support the motion.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  I have listened intently to what Members have said in the debate. I do not want  to be the Job among everyone, but I suspect that I may be, because I do not  share the total enthusiasm that has been demonstrated today. The old adage of  the need to be careful of Greeks bearing gifts is very appropriate in this  case. We have some very good examples, at which we should take a long, close,  hard look.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I am pleased in two respects. First, that the motion  contains the phrase, &ldquo;in principle&rdquo;. I am glad that that is there. Secondly, I  am glad that the leader of the SDLP brought it to our attention that the  Finance Minister is cautious. I congratulate him on that. That is a sign of  maturity, not of weakness, and it demonstrates to me that, in fact, he is not  going to jump in with both feet and say that everything is well and wonderful  because we have got corporation tax down to 12&middot;5%. Let it be clearly said that  there is no such thing as a free lunch. We will learn that very shortly, if and  when the powers are devolved.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I would like the Minister, when he sums up today, to tell  us exactly what this is going to cost to get corporation tax down to 12&middot;5%. I  have no doubt that he will, because he is more than capable of doing it. I hear  and read about all sorts of figures. I have heard &pound;400 million, &pound;300 million  and &pound;200 million mentioned. I do not which of those is true, or, indeed, if any  is true, but I suspect that the figure of &pound;300 million may not be far away.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Very recently, the computer company Dell withdrew its  entire operation from its base in Limerick and relocated to Poland. We all  know that the corporation tax rate in the Republic of Ireland  is 12&middot;5%. We also know that the rate in Poland in 19%, but that did not  stop Dell from uprooting and taking its whole operation there. The rate of  corporation tax in Poland is  50% higher than that in the Republic   of Ireland. The lower  corporation tax rate did not keep Dell in Limerick.  It may have kept it there for a while, but Dell saw other opportunities in Poland and  moved there.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Not every Member said that the devolution of corporation  tax is a panacea for all our economic troubles. It is anything but. If we were  to speak to 10 different economists about corporation tax &mdash; I will not name  them or embarrass them &mdash; and ask them the specific question of where on a scale  of one to 10 they would put the importance of lowering the rate of corporation  tax, they would put it at six or seven.<span class="SectionMarker"><span style="font-size:14.0pt; "> </span></span></p>
<p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">In other words, at least six other issues are more  important than corporation tax. I wonder what they could be. I believe that the  cost of labour is certainly one of them and that educational attainment is  another, as is a stable society. Those are three things that will help to move  our economy in the right direction.</p>

<p class="B3BodyText">It also has to be said that a major international computer  company recently selected Northern    Ireland as its European research base. Its  managing director confirmed that tax was not an issue. So, I say to the House  and to the Minister &mdash; I do not think that the Minister needs it said, but I  will say it anyway &mdash; that we need to be cautious.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Principal  Deputy Speaker</strong>: The Member should bring his remarks to a close.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  I am happy that the Minister is in that mode, and I have no doubt that he will  bring a common-sense approach to all this.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr McDonnell</strong>:  The SDLP&rsquo;s position on corporation tax is clear and has been consistent not  just for a few years but for 15 or 16 years. Indeed, many years ago, when some  of us went to Pittsburgh  for the second White House conference, it was the famous Tony O&rsquo;Reilly who  convinced me on the matter. If the Executive are serious about governing in an  effective and efficient way and about creating effective and efficient economic  benefits for businesses here and for the people of Northern Ireland, I would be  in favour of devolving not just corporation tax powers &mdash; that should be done  first &mdash; but all tax powers locally, so that we can have much greater influence  on what we do and how we do it.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">To maximise the impact and create a level playing field  across the island   of Ireland, the rate  should be set at 12&middot;5%. The power to devolve tax cannot be separated from the  level of the tax, and to focus on devolving powers without reference to setting  a competitive rate would be to render this debate meaningless. There is  absolutely no point in taking the power if we do not use it. I believe that  that rate would dramatically change our economic landscape in a relatively  short time.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">All too often here, whenever we discuss our economy, we  talk about the block grant and how we might tweak it a bit here or there.  However, there is much more to our economy than working with the block grant.  Only this morning, I was at a business breakfast seminar in Belfast City Hall.  The focus of the event was on enhancing Belfast&rsquo;s  competitiveness, and, time and again throughout the discussion, economists,  businesspeople and other political representatives brought up the importance  and value of a lower rate of corporation tax. It is clearly seen as a tool with  which to build a bigger and better private sector.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Far too often in Northern Ireland, we have a habit  of knocking ourselves, encasing ourselves in silos or restricting ourselves  under a glass ceiling, with a cannot-do as opposed to a can-do attitude.  However, we should not lose sight of the fact that Northern Ireland has lots of  positives to offer to investors. To ensure that we build a bigger, stronger and  better private sector, as well as reducing corporation tax, we must bundle  those positives. We have a large pool of skilled, cost-effective labour.  Although it may not be as cost-effective as some inward investors would like,  compared with the labour markets in London, Dublin and the main  European cities, it is relatively cost-effective. Beyond labour costs, we have  a relatively low cost base. We are in a prime location for trading and for  exports. Our tourist industry has huge potential. We have a very strong IT  sector, and we have the devolved Assembly and Executive.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">We have the powers to make choices and decisions for the  benefit of Northern Ireland.  The devolution of corporation tax powers is one decision that we must make. In  a relatively short time, it will enable fair competition and dramatically  increase the economic attractiveness of Northern Ireland. Corporation tax  at a competitive rate will, as the evidence overwhelmingly indicates, speed up  economic growth. It will bring in foreign direct investment and increase the  number of people in well-paid, sustainable jobs. Some people estimate 90,000  new jobs over 20 years. That may be a slight exaggeration, but most  commentators talk about more than 64,000 jobs.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The ability of reduced corporation tax to speed up inward  investment and economic growth in Northern Ireland is important  against the backdrop of the clear intent of the Treasury to slash the block  grant. The fact is that a reduced devolved corporation tax will, in the medium  to long term, increase tax revenue for the UK and, in turn, help to offset any  reduction. That is why it is important that we debate the details of  implementing the tax change &mdash;</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Principal  Deputy Speaker</strong>: Bring your remarks to a close.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr McDonnell</strong>:  &mdash; and make a strong, persuasive case to the Treasury.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Allister</strong>:  Not for the first time, and, I suspect, not the last, I am somewhat out of step  with the consensus in the House. However, I feel a little less lonely since  Lord Morrow&rsquo;s contribution. In the Budget debates, the Minister liked to refer  to me as Elijah. Well, Elijah and Job probably had quite a lot in common. If  the Job of the DUP Benches would like to volunteer as a Teller, I could give  him some useful employment in a few minutes. I hope that he proves more stoical  in his resistance to corporation tax powers than he did having started down the  same road in respect of policing and justice.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">People in the House like to talk about game-changers. The  game-changer in regard to corporation tax was the Azores  judgement. At a stroke, it revolutionised the debate and made it abundantly and  irrefutably clear that, if you go for corporation tax, you must, because of the  fiscal autonomy requirements, adjust your block grant. We in Northern Ireland,  whether we like it or not, have a huge fiscal deficit, and the block grant is  the one thing, as the Minister well knows, that gives certainty to our  budgeting. Going down a road where you play fast and loose with the block grant  and take risks with it in a state of total blindness because you have no idea  of what the actual working figures will be seems to be the absolute height of  folly.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Remember, there is no reverse gear when it comes to  corporation tax devolution. Therefore, there is supreme danger in sleepwalking  into a situation in which we devastate the block grant for the sake of some  sort of aspiration. All that I have heard in this debate is aspirations; I have  not heard any reality talked at all. The volatility of the receipts from  corporation tax makes anyone who thinks seriously about it back away pretty  fast, just as the Welsh have. It is on the point of the volatility.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Much nonsense has been talked about the impact that it  would have on foreign direct investment. I remind the House that the Irish Republic  had low corporation tax from 1958. That did not do it any good in the 1950s,  the 1960s, the 1970s and most of the 1980s. It is not the panacea; it is not  anywhere close to the panacea. Those who think that it is are sleepwalking &mdash;</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Allister</strong>:  Certainly.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  Thank you. It is now Job speaking. I hear what the Member says. I made it clear  that some Members said that it was not the panacea or silver bullet. Does the  Member accept that it is imperative that the Northern   Ireland economy is always competitive and that our  nearest rival is the Republic   of Ireland?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Allister</strong>:  Of course. I want to see the economy totally rebalanced in Northern Ireland.  I am not opposed to that at all &mdash; far from it. What I am opposed to is taking  steps that we then regret and taking steps that distance us from the centrality  of our equal citizenship as part of the United Kingdom. There is an  ideological issue, which is that common taxation lies in close relationship to  common responsibilities and benefits. That is why the party that sits over here  &mdash; Sinn F&eacute;in &mdash; is suddenly so ideologically wedded to the reduction in  corporation tax. It is not because that party believes in low corporation tax.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I sat in the European Parliament for five years and  listened to Bairbre de Br&uacute;n and her Marxist clique constantly demand soaking  the corporations and higher corporation tax. That is their ideology. In the  Irish Republic, they fought elections saying that they would introduce higher  corporation tax, but, suddenly, because it happens to fit with an overriding  political ideology &mdash; harmonising taxation on the island of Ireland &mdash; they are  now the prophets of low corporation tax. They are no such thing. They are the  economic illiterates of the House.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I have heard the Member say what he is against. We are well used to hearing  what he is against. If he genuinely believes in the rebalancing of the Northern Ireland  economy, will he tell us what he is for? In all this bluster, we have not heard  him suggest anything that would make the step change in the economy that the  rest of us are in favour of.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Allister</strong>:  I suggest that the Member studies the economy of Germany. It has relatively high  corporation tax, but it has one of the best success rates in foreign direct  investment. Why? Because &mdash;</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Principal  Deputy Speaker</strong>: Bring your remarks to a close.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Allister</strong>:  &mdash; it has multiple aspects to its attraction package that make it an attractive  place to invest.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Agnew</strong>: I  support the motion. Like Trevor Lunn, I support in principle the devolution of  corporation tax powers and other fiscal powers. We should look at the powers  that we have on the whole. However, the real question for me is what we should  do with those powers. For that reason, I want to voice the many concerns that I  have about some Members&rsquo; apparent willingness to rush head first into reducing  corporation tax to 12&middot;5% or less.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Yesterday, the Assembly passed a Budget that was decimated  by cuts passed down from Westminster.  Indeed, the Finance Minister seemed to suggest that we should praise him for  being able to present any kind of Budget. He even went further and suggested  that those who criticised it were nothing but whingers. I do not subscribe to  that view, as I opposed the Budget, but I agree that, given the cuts that we have  had to face, it was a very difficult Budget to produce. For that reason, I am  astonished that we are seeking to voluntarily reduce our block grant further in  order to cut corporation tax, which PricewaterhouseCoopers ranks as seventeenth  in the list of factors that influence companies that are looking to invest.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">A question that the Finance Minister often asks of those of  us who dare to propose amendments to his Budget is &ldquo;Where will the money come  from?&rdquo;. Well, where will the money come from if we reduce corporation tax and  have our block grant reduced? We have not had that question answered, and I  have yet to hear what cuts to services and job losses will result from that  potential cut to the block grant.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">There are other potential costs that have yet to be  outlined. How much will the administration burden be? I put that question to  the Minister, and, as yet, there has been no estimate. Therefore, Members are  supporting the reduction in corporation tax without the full facts. My  understanding is that the administration costs will be quite significant.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Varney estimated that brass plating could cost us in the  region of &pound;80 million in further reductions to the block grant. Another concern  that has been raised is that, if the power to reduce corporation tax were  devolved and receipts were to drop, would we then seek the introduction of  borrowing powers that might be necessary to mitigate that possibility, given  that we do not have those powers?</p>
<p class="TimePeriod">1.15 pm</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">We know that there will be costs. The costs are guaranteed,  but the benefits are purely speculative. Many Members have talked as though the  various projected figures on new jobs are guaranteed. They have said that they  do not know how many jobs will be created but it will be tens of thousands. We  do not know that. At this point, it is speculation.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I welcome Simon Hamilton&rsquo;s contribution that we must  consider the matter seriously and look at all aspects of it. In doing so, we  should look at the alternatives. I am a member of the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Investment,  and I asked departmental officials what alternatives the proposals were being  marked against. The only alternative that they have been marked against is  doing nothing. I agree with Members that we should not do nothing; we have to  address the state of our economy. I propose that we should at least mark the  proposals against investment in the green new deal. The costs are similar, so  why not see which has the better outcomes? The green new deal will help not  only to boost our economy but to move us towards a lower-carbon economy and to  reduce our reliance on ever-diminishing fossil fuels, the prices of which are  rising. Let us look at the two proposals and compare them. The benefits of the  green new deal are not speculative. There are guaranteed benefits, and, if we  invest in it, we will create jobs.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Although I am willing to support the motion &mdash;</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Principal  Deputy Speaker</strong>: Draw your remarks to a close.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Agnew</strong>: I  implore the Finance Minister and the Enterprise Minister to explore the  alternatives before we rush head first into a potentially very damaging tax  cut.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Principal  Deputy Speaker</strong>: The Minister of Finance and Personnel, Mr Sammy Wilson,  will have up to 20 minutes to respond.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wilson (The  Minister of Finance and Personnel)</strong>: It will be 20 minutes. I thank everyone  for contributing to the debate on a very important issue. In fact, it is  probably one of the most important policy issues that we will debate,  contemplate and, finally, have to make a decision about in this mandate. The  issue will have very long-term consequences, potentially positive and negative.  Therefore, it is important that the debate be considered and that we have as  much input into it as possible.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">From my party&rsquo;s point of view, the parameters of the debate  and the objectives of the policy are all about what we will do to make the  Northern Ireland economy more competitive; it is not about making our economy  more like that of the Irish Republic and converging with that economy. Mr  Allister sees it as some kind of plot by Sinn F&eacute;in to drag us into a fiscal  united Ireland.  Indeed, he pointed out that Sinn F&eacute;in spokespeople in the European Parliament  used to be ranting, left-wing communists. Lots of biblical characters have been  mentioned. We have had Job here and Elijah here, and we have Saul of Tarsus  over here. They have had a Damascus  road experience. They have been converted. I would have thought that Mr  Allister would welcome that and not condemn them for it. I would have thought  that, in Mr Allister&rsquo;s book, a consideration of more mainstream economic  thought would be a benefit rather than something to be criticised for.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Let me make it clear that, as far as we are concerned, this  is about what we should do to change the face of the Northern Ireland economy. Member  after Member said that. We cannot go on with a situation where we, on average,  have 80% of the average GDP in the United Kingdom. We cannot go on  with a low-productivity economy. We cannot go on with an economy that is  dominated by the public sector. Even the activities that go on in the private  sector are very heavily dependent on public sector spending and on  low-wage-type activities. We cannot go on that way, and, therefore, we need to  look at change.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The economic theory behind it is that one way in which we  might do that is to look at how we give fiscal incentives to the private sector  to expand. I accept a lot of the points that were made by those who were more  sceptical during the debate. It would be foolish of me, as Finance Minister, as  an economist or as an observer of real life, to do otherwise. Indeed, many of  those who support the change have made it clear that they understand that there  is no silver bullet and no panacea. People can pull evidence out from different  sources, and some people will point at reports and economic theories that  suggest that, if you reduce the tax burden and reward people for the activities  that they undertake, they will have an incentive to undertake more of those  activities and, if you let them keep their profits, they will have more money  to invest and, therefore, to expand their firms. Therefore, there is an  incentive effect.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Mr Allister pointed out that the PWC report indicates that  that is not necessarily the case, and it is not. You could look at some low-tax  economies and find that there has not been that stimulus. As Mr Nesbitt pointed  out, when economists look at all those things, if they want to isolate the  impact of one variable on the economy, they have to make an assumption that  rarely applies in real life. Ceteris paribus &mdash; I have got the Latin in as well  &mdash; or all other things remaining equal is not always the case. Hence, what Mr  Allister said about the situation in the Republic is quite true: for a long  time, it had a 10% tax rate, and that had no impact. Then it had a 12% tax  rate, and that did have an impact because other things changed as well.  Therefore, anyone who says with certainty that this will suddenly make the  economy grow magically does not understand or has ignored many of the economic  complexities.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">One thing that we do know is that there are lots of modern  examples of how a reduction in corporation tax and in taxes on profits has had  a dramatic impact on the rate of growth, not least in the country that is next  door to us. For that reason at least, we have to consider it. We cannot simply  write it off, as some did during the debate, and say that there are other ways  and, therefore, we do not have to consider it. It would be remiss of us to do  that. Indeed, if we want to rebalance the economy, we have to look at that.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The second point that I want to make is that, no matter how  you look at this, there will be costs involved. Let us not pretend to ourselves  that there will not be. I know that some Members said that, in the long run, it  will give us more revenue than it will cost us. That depends on what you wish  to include in that revenue. We know from all the reports, whether from the  Treasury or the EAG, that, in 10 years&rsquo; time, even with the best of  circumstances, we will only break even. The worst report shows that, in 20  years&rsquo; time, we could still have a negative fiscal impact on this economy, so  we have to bear that in mind. Even if it creates 4,500 higher-paid jobs in each  of the next 20 years, resulting in a thriving economy that enables young people  to stay here, get the rewards that they want while living in a healthier,  happier, more prosperous economy that employs more people with a better  lifestyle, not much of it, apart from the tax take, will register on our fiscal  balance. However, it will change the face of Northern Ireland, which is what the  Assembly is here for. It will give the people whom we represent better  prospects and enable us to hold on to the best of our talent. For that reason,  when we look at the costs and benefits of lowering corporation tax, we cannot  look at the fiscal benefits and costs alone and decide that, because of them,  we will not go down that route.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">That does not mean that we recklessly imperil in the short  and medium term our ability to provide public services. The job creation  models&rsquo; predictions vary from 1,500 additional jobs a year to 4,500 a year.  Anybody na&iuml;ve enough to believe that a model can project economic activity and  the impact of a policy 20 years in advance does not know a great deal about  economic modelling. Many models are lucky to survive two years in our changing  circumstances. Those who say that there is an element of faith or gambling  involved in economic models are absolutely right. That is why it is imperative  that we scrutinise the corporation tax policy to the nth degree in making our  decision. That is why a debate such as this &mdash; I hope that there are many more  like it &mdash; is so important.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">We have to consider the immediate fiscal burden. People  have said that I differ from other Ministers on this, but I do not believe that  at all. Ministers have differing responsibilities: some are interested in job  creation, and others look at the wider benefits to society. As Finance  Minister, my responsibility is to look also at the impact on public finances,  because I must produce a Budget every year and we must ensure that Departments  do what we want them to. That is why it is important that we consider the  costs.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Ms Ritchie said that I was not fit to lead the negotiations  because I brought some of those issues to the debate. Indeed, she tried to make  me choose between two women: Lady Hermon and Arlene Foster. However, I tell you  one thing: had she put herself in that bunch, I would have told her which of  them I would not choose. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.] </span>The puppyish  devotion that she &mdash;</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I am going to tell Arlene.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wilson</strong>: I  am going to be told on, and I have to fly to London with her later. I will probably get it  in the ear.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Adopting a puppyish, wide-eyed devotion to this without  bringing to bear any critical faculties is certainly not how to go into  corporation tax negotiations with the Treasury.<span class="SectionMarker"><span style="font-size:14.0pt; "> </span></span></p>
<p class="TimePeriod">1.30 pm</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">When we go to the Treasury, it is important that we are  aware of all the pros and cons and that we go in cautiously and go in hard,  because there is much to be gained. I cannot remember, but I think that it was  Mr Allister who asked what the upper limit of the cost would be. In any report  that I have seen so far, the upper limit is about &pound;355 million a year. If we  had to take that as a deficit for the next 20 years, it would, of course, be  absolute folly to say that we should go down that route, given all the  uncertainty surrounding job creation, etc. Despite what Ms Ritchie said about  the Chancellor stating that there would be no negotiation, there will be  considerable negotiation. She was correct to say that there would be no  negotiation on the amount of income tax. As several Members pointed out, once  the amount of income tax has been established, the Azores  ruling is that we have to pay whatever the bill happens to be. However, there  is considerable variation.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Allister</strong>:  On that very important point, once that figure is negotiated, is it set in  stone? David Gauke, the Exchequer Secretary, told the Northern Ireland Affairs  Committee that, if corporation tax receipts were less than expected, the  Northern Ireland Executive would have to deal with that. Clearly, that  indicates that you are on your own. Once you set the figures, is that the  long-term consequence?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wilson</strong>: I  am glad that you raised that point, because I wanted to come to it. I noted the  issue of volatility raised by Mr Allister and Mr Agnew. One danger would be  that, if receipts went up and down, the block grant would become more volatile.  As far as I am concerned, one area of negotiation that would be open to us is  where those variations occur, and there will be variations. Over the past five  years, the percentage of corporation tax collected in Northern Ireland has  varied between 1&middot;6% and 1&middot;1% of the United Kingdom total. Therefore, there is  considerable variation over the economic cycle. Although we would have to pay  the bill, there would be an acceptance that those variations could be evened  out through adjustments to the block grant. Therefore, in the good years, we  would probably pay back, and, in the bad years, we would take in. Although it  is not impossible to deal with that, it is an issue, and the Member was right  to raise it.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Of course, other issues are open to negotiation. The  Treasury assumed a profit movement of, I think, &pound;70 million. The Azores ruling does not require that to be attached to the  bill. Although the Treasury assumed that profit movement, it might never  materialise. Indeed, in discussions that DETI officials had with Europe, it was  made clear that any profit movement would, of course, come under the Azores ruling, but that it could be decided after the  event, rather than being anticipated and added to the bill. We want to  negotiate that with the Treasury.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">If the investment were to succeed, the other thing that  could help to offset the cost would be counting in the additional receipts from  National Insurance contributions, additional VAT receipts and PAYE, because  more people would be employed. That could have a considerable offsetting effect  &mdash; up to 20% of the total bill &mdash; which would reduce the impact of the reduction  in the block grant.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The administration figure has not been decided, although we  have received some indicative figures. However, given that I know that a tax  should not cost a disproportionate amount of money to collect, either in  administration or compliance, the figures struck me as very high. That is  another area that we would want to negotiate with the Treasury. When trying to  reduce the size of the public sector here, it would be ironic to set up in Northern Ireland  a parallel tax-collecting system, which would not have the benefit of economies  of scale, etc. Anyway, firms would not want to deal with two different tax  offices. So, I would rather see it kept with HRMC and the cost set at a  realistic level.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Other suggestions have been made as to how the cost might  be reduced. I am glad to see that the Ulster Unionist Party has demurred from  its past position on how to reduce the costs. In its manifesto, it had a rather  enigmatic phrase; it said that we could offset the cost by looking innovatively  at business rates. I do not know what that means. I see Mr Cree in the Chamber,  so he might want to tell us what it means. The only way that I can see how you  would look innovatively at business rates is if you said, &ldquo;For the reduction in  corporation tax, we are going to put up business rates.&rdquo; If we were to do it,  and we had the maximum figure, you are talking about a 60% increase in business  rates, which would apply even to those small businesses that do not benefit  from corporation tax changes. I suspect that that is one of those policies that  the Ulster Unionist Party thought was clever at the time but which it has  decided it does not want to pursue any longer. It is surprising that three of  its Members who spoke in the debate never mentioned it. Maybe that is another  one that it has dropped from its manifesto.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">It has also been suggested that a new rate could be  introduced incrementally. I am not so sure that I agree with that, because all  the evidence so far shows that corporation tax is not an end in itself; it is  simply a means of getting the door opened when we go to talk to foreign firms  to try to get them to invest in Northern    Ireland. It is the appetiser. Then, when the  real tax accountants in the firm get to it, they look for such things as tax  credits, the cost of labour, etc. If it is the door-opener and simply the means  of getting listened to, why would we reduce it incrementally? A reduction to  18% will cost us but will not get the door open; a reduction to 16% will cost  us but will not get the door open; and a reduction to 14% will cost us but will  not get the door open.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Principal  Deputy Speaker</strong>: Will the Minister draw his remarks to a close?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wilson</strong>: I  will.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">You would be paying the cost, but you would not be getting  the benefit.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I have not got to deal with all the points that were raised  in the debate. It has been a useful debate. I am sure that there will be many  more debates about the issue. It is one that the Executive, the Assembly and  Committees are going to have to address.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Principal  Deputy Speaker</strong>: The Minister is out of time.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wilson</strong>:  Therefore, it is important that there is a debate not only among the wider  public, but in the Assembly, so that we come to a considered decision on what  will have long-term consequences, good or bad, for the economy of Northern Ireland  long after many of the Members who are sitting in the Chamber are gone.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness  (The Chairperson of the Committee for Enterprise,  Trade and Investment)</strong>: Thank you, Mr Principal Deputy Speaker. I welcome  the debate and thank the Chair of the Finance and Personnel Committee, in  particular, for proposing the motion. I apologise to him for being late into  the Chamber. I did not hear all of his remarks, because I was held up at a  Justice Committee meeting.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I echo what the Minister has just said. This has been a  very useful debate. It has also been a very mature debate, and the consensus in  the Chamber was quite properly challenged by those who reserve a more sceptical  position on the devolution of corporation tax powers and the reduction of  corporation tax. Those interventions were useful in challenging a consensus in  the Chamber, because it is important that we examine and address all the issues  that arise. There are many difficult issues involved in, first, the transfer of  the tax and, secondly, the lowering of the tax, which is the ultimate  objective.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I welcome this opportunity to speak as Chair of the Enterprise, Trade and  Investment Committee on this very important and pressing issue. It has been  just over a year since the two Committees co-sponsored the first debate on  corporation tax in the Chamber. There has been much discussion on the matter  since, and much has been written on the issue. As Mitchel McLaughlin said, it  has taken time to gather momentum, but we have reached the stage at which there  is an air of expectation both within and without the Chamber that the powers  will be devolved to the Assembly.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">In opening the debate as Chair of the Finance Committee, Mr  Murphy highlighted the obstacles that we will have to overcome and the  practical concerns on which we require clarification and agreement before  corporation tax is devolved. We need to know where we stand on the impact on  the block grant; on compliance with the Azores  ruling; on the level of corporation tax collected here; and on the measures to  be put in place to counter so-called tax tourism, which is an important issue.  Very importantly, we need clarity on the mechanism to be developed to ensure  that we retain the benefits of any increase in revenue from other taxes.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">There will be costs in the short term to pay for this  opportunity. It is an opportunity, and that is how we should view it. As  Mitchel McLaughlin said, it is not risk-free, but if we are to move forward, we  have to take some risks. We should recognise the opportunities that exist.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">It is appropriate that I concentrate on the longer-term  future and on the opportunities and benefits that a reduced rate of corporation  tax can bring. It is sometimes said that corporation tax is not the only  factor, or, in many cases, the most important factor in determining where a foreign  company will invest. That point was made by Simon Hamilton and others. Factors  such as transport, logistics, infrastructure, labour costs, productivity,  telecommunications infrastructure, education and skills are considered equally  or even more important. However, as the Prime Minister, David Cameron, said in  the Chamber earlier this month about us:</p>
<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;You have excellent transport connections to the rest  of the UK, to Ireland and to the rest of Europe.  You have the English language; great educational results; two brilliant  universities; highly competitive operating costs; 100% broadband access;  Project Kelvin, linking north America, Northern Ireland and western Europe; a  strongly pro-business climate&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Those are important factors to remember, and it was timely  that the Prime Minister reminded us of them.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Although having a competitive rate of corporation tax is  not the only important factor, it is one of the few for which we currently do  not possess responsibility. That is the point that I was attempting to make to  Mr Flanagan in my intervention. That is why it is so important that those  powers be devolved as soon as possible. We need to rebalance our economy  through growing the private sector. We must develop an economy that is driven  by the private sector and that creates more wealth, more economic opportunities  and more jobs through new inward investment. We need an economy that provides  opportunities for our indigenous businesses, large and small, to grow and  prosper.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Dominic Bradley said that the current tools are simply not  working. That was echoed by David McIlveen and other Members. Albert Einstein  was quoted earlier in the debate in respect of E=mc&sup2;, but I will quote him  again:</p>
<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking  we used when we created them.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Let us think on that. Control over corporation tax is an  example of the new type of thinking that we need to embrace if we are to solve  the economic problems that we face today. Perhaps this is the &ldquo;something  better&rdquo; that Simon Hamilton referred to in his speech. He emphasised the point  that we cannot have more of the same but must move on. I listened carefully to  Mr Allister, but the point must be made that we are moving to a situation  post-2013 when we will not have state aid for many business enterprises coming  here. What do we do in such circumstances? We must have some alternative  strategy.</p>
<p class="TimePeriod">1.45 pm</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Attracting business and more investment, and providing  opportunities for businesses to grow, will, inevitably, bring jobs. Treasury  estimates for domestic investments are up to &pound;65 million in the first year  alone. That is considerable. Treasury estimates for foreign direct investment  are for an increase of up to &pound;200 million in the first year. Again, that is  very substantial. The Northern Ireland Economic Reform Group estimates up to  90,000 new jobs over 20 years. In a statement, Almac, one of our leading and  most respected indigenous businesses, said that it would double its workforce  of 2,000 if corporation tax were reduced. That is not only encouraging but, if  mirrored by other companies, suggests that the figures are not simply  aspirational or optimistic but achievable. It begs the question: what would Sir  Allen McClay have achieved with a 12&middot;5% corporation tax in Northern Ireland?</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">As was mentioned by Mike Nesbitt, another key reason for  decreasing the rate of corporation tax is the need to narrow the productivity  gap with Britain.  That is a key aspect of the previous Programme for Government and DETI&rsquo;s  regional innovation strategy. We have got to narrow that gap. This is one way  of doing that.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Although some short-term sacrifice may be associated with  decreasing the rate of corporation tax, as we attract investment, grow the  economy and create more employment, there will be increased tax benefits  through additional revenue from increased income tax, National Insurance, VAT  and excise duty. Those benefits will be realised in the long term, but it is  important that we, who are charged with planning for the long term, look beyond  the horizon and plan for a brighter, more prosperous time for future  generations. A lower rate of corporation tax can make an enormous contribution  to that.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I recognise the scepticism expressed by Mr Allister and Mr  Agnew. Mr Agnew referred to the green new deal. The green new deal is not  incompatible with lower corporation tax. The green new deal and the devolution  of corporation tax are not mutually exclusive.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Principal  Deputy Speaker</strong>: Bring your remarks to a close.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I commend the motion to the House.</p>

<p class="OralAnswers-H1Heading"><a name="7"></a>Oral Answers to Questions</p>
<p class="OralAnswers-H2DepartmentHeading">Culture, Arts and Leisure</p>
<p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Arts: EU Funding</p>
<p class="OralAnswers-Question">1. <strong>Dr  McDonnell </strong>asked the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure to outline the  uptake of EU funding by arts and cultural organisations in the 2010-11  financial year. (AQO 207/11-15<a name="AQO207/11-15" id="AQO207/11-15"></a>)</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n  (The Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure)</strong>: I thank the Member for his  question. My Department delivers arts and cultural services through  arm&rsquo;s-length bodies such as the Arts Council and the Armagh Observatory. The  Arts Council proactively encourages its funded organisations to make use of  European funding. It also works closely with Visiting Arts, the managing  authority for the EU culture programme, hosting workshops to assist the  application process. However, information on uptake will not be available until  September this year, when the results of the Arts Council-funded organisations  survey are complete. I am aware that, in recent years, arts organisations have  used funds under the culture programme and the lifelong learning programme. In  2010 and 2011, the Armagh Observatory obtained EU funding of &pound;250,000 for three  projects. That will help the observatory&rsquo;s offering to primary schoolchildren.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr McDonnell</strong>:  Has the Minister got any plans to take action, and, if so, what action will she  take, to encourage local arts and cultural organisations to better access  funding from the EU and elsewhere?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  I am aware that, recently, some groups, particularly in the Member&rsquo;s area of  south Belfast,  have asked to meet me to discuss how smaller groups can have better access to  European funds. The Member will be aware that larger groups with international  partners have successfully achieved funds on their own. However, I will talk to  the Arts Council to ensure that smaller groups, single artists and artists&rsquo;  collections will have better use of European funding in the future. I welcome  the Member&rsquo;s advice or views on any particular issue.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Does the Minister think that the Office of the Northern Ireland Executive in Brussels could do more to  help her Department to access potential funding?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  My Department liaises with the Office of the First Minister and deputy First  Minister&rsquo;s (OFMDFM) office in Brussels  to try to access better opportunities for European funding. I know that the  creative industries in particular have been very successful in securing funding.  As regards reviews and lessons learned, sure there is always room for  improvement. I am quite happy with progress to date. I am concerned about  smaller groups&rsquo; access to funding. That is primarily my arm&rsquo;s-length bodies&rsquo;  responsibility, rather than OFMDFM&rsquo;s.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Flanagan</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Will the Minister undertake to  increase the level of engagement by her Department and arm&rsquo;s-length bodies in  the EU, including establishing a greater presence in the bureau in Brussels and  applying much greater focus on the potential of the EU culture fund?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  I thank the Member for his question. It is similar to the question that John  McCallister asked. I will keep a watchful eye on specific programmes, including  those relating to fisheries and creative industries, and even on better use of  structural funds or funds for culture, arts and leisure. Although there may be  different programmes and progress in some areas and sectors, clearly, the  perception exists that a lot of money is distributed from Europe  but that local people cannot access it. Therefore, through liaison with the Brussels end of things  and even with groups on the ground, I will, certainly, keep a watchful eye on  the issue and will bring it back in the new term.</p>
<p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Commonwealth Games 2014</p>
<p class="OralAnswers-Question">2. <strong>Mr Ross </strong>asked the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure whether she has held, or  intends to hold, meetings with the Northern Ireland Commonwealth Games Council  about the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. &nbsp;(AQO 208/11-15<a name="AQO208/11-15" id="AQO208/11-15"></a>)</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  With the Deputy Speaker&rsquo;s and Alastair Ross&rsquo;s permission, I will begin by  congratulating Rory McIlroy on his fantastic achievement in the US Open golf  championship. This is the second year in a row that one of our local golfers  has succeeded. It would be remiss of me to not acknowledge that today on behalf  of the House.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Since taking up office last month, I have not yet had the  opportunity to meet the Commonwealth Games Council to discuss the 2014  Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I can confirm that engagements and discussions are ongoing.  I have not received an invitation from the council as yet, but I am keen to  meet it to discuss the Commonwealth Games or any other issue.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: On  this side of the House, we too congratulate Rory McIlroy. Indeed, we conveyed  our congratulations last week.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Does the Minister agree that it is important that we get as  many teams as possible from Northern Ireland  to compete in the Glasgow  games? Will she ensure that the governing bodies of each sport, Sport NI and  the Northern Ireland Commonwealth Games Council are appropriately funded so  that we can build on the successes of Delhi?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  I concur with the Member&rsquo;s sentiments. It is important that the successes  achieved in Delhi  be our benchmark, and they are in my Sport Matters strategy. It is not easy for  any athlete to compete under the pressure of bringing medals back home. The  target that was set for Delhi  was five and that was exceeded. The same target is set for the Commonwealth  Games in 2014.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The Member is right: support and resources must come from  the sporting bodies to ensure that we give our athletes every possible  opportunity to achieve success.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  It is an opportune time to congratulate athletes and to look forward to the  next games, when, no doubt, the boxing fraternity here will excel again and  achieve more medals than all the other sports put together. However, I do not  mean to be ungracious about anyone else&rsquo;s success.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Can the Minister give us any further information on whether  discussions are under way between Sport NI and the Commonwealth Games Council?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  I thank the Member for that question, and fair play to him for getting the  boxing in. You are on record. Well done, Alex.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">As I said to Alastair Ross, discussions are under way and  will continue. They will take on a new focus as the time grows near. In the  Sport Matters strategy, there are two targets for Commonwealth Games, including  the number of medals to be won in Glasgow.  Sport NI, along with the sporting organisations, needs to ensure that every  opportunity and all support is made available to all the athletes. I believe  that the discussions are going fairly well. It is expected that any revision of  the strategy would have to be concluded and any views from those bodies taken  on board, I would say, by October of this year, in preparation for the games.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs McKevitt</strong>:  Can the Minister confirm whether discussions have taken place with other  nations to utilise Northern    Ireland&rsquo;s training facilities in preparation  for the Commonwealth Games in 2014?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  To be honest, I am not aware of that in relation to the Commonwealth Games. I  am sure that the Member knows that intense discussions are ongoing, led by  Sport NI, to attract other countries to come here for their pre-games training  for the Olympics. I will obtain that information for the Commonwealth Games and  send it to the Member.</p>
<p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">DCAL: Regional Language Strategy</p>
<p class="OralAnswers-Question">3. <strong>Mrs  Overend </strong>asked the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure whether she will  bring forward an indigenous or regional strategy rather than an Irish language  strategy. (AQO 209/11-15<a name="AQO209/11-15" id="AQO209/11-15"></a>)</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  It is my intention to prepare separate strategies for the Irish language and  the Ulster-Scots language, heritage and culture. That reflects the wording of  the St Andrews Agreement and the Northern Ireland (St Andrews  Agreement) Act 2006 and the different needs and stages of development of each  language.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Overend</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her answer. Does she agree that the St Andrews  Agreement called for a regional minority language strategy and not solely an  Irish language strategy?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  I am clear as to what the St Andrews Agreement means. It is also provided for  in the agreement that I can take the strategies separately, and that is what I  intend to do. I have had some discussions with some of the stakeholders, but  not with all of them. Discussions and consultations with the stakeholders will  intensify over the summer. I met some stakeholders in Derry  on Saturday who are affiliated the Apprentice Boys. Their emphasis was not  solely on language but on heritage and culture. However, it is within my gift  to take forward separate strategies, and that is what I intend to do.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane</strong>:  Will the Minister provide information on what previous consultation was  undertaken by the Department in the North on Acht na Gaeilge?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  My Department has undertaken two formal public consultations and an equality  impact assessment on proposals for Irish language legislation. The first, which  sought views on legislative approaches, took place in December 2006 and lasted  until March 2007; the second, which was from March 2007, sought views on  possible draft clauses. I intend to seek Executive agreement to a further  public consultation about renewed proposals for legislation.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire  as na freagra&iacute; a thug s&iacute; go dt&iacute; seo. Ba mhaith liom a fhiafra&iacute; den Aire cad iad  na pr&iacute;omh-eilimint&iacute; a cheapann s&iacute; a ba ch&oacute;ir a bheith mar chuid de Acht  Gaeilge.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">What key elements does the Minister consider should be part  of an Irish language Act?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  I thank the Member for his question and his ongoing commitment to Acht na  Gaeilge and the Irish language strategy. I have many ideas about what key  elements the legislation should contain; however, I think it appropriate that I  wait for the consultation before sharing them. Nevertheless, the Member will  know, as I told the Committee and repeated in public, that a rights-based  approach to legislation is the best, and only, way forward.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Allister</strong>:  No later than this morning, during the corporation tax debate, the Minister&rsquo;s  colleague Mr Flanagan regaled the House with the benefits of the English  language as an attraction for inward investment. Why, therefore, does the  Minister want to waste valuable resources on promoting a language that will  disadvantage young people in seeking employment in these hard economic times,  instead of better equipping them to be more proficient in English?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  I have no comment on what the Member alleges my colleague to have said. That is  his opinion. There is plenty of documentation that having more than one  language helps people, constituencies and communities with their economic  development. I suspect that economic development and well-being are not really  what the Member is hinting at. I hope that that has answered whatever sort of  question he had.</p>
<p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Border Areas: Culture and Sport</p>
<p class="OralAnswers-Question">4. <strong>Mr  Eastwood </strong>asked the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure what action she is  taking to promote cultural and sporting activities in border areas. (AQO  210/11-15<a name="AQO210/11-15" id="AQO210/11-15"></a>)</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  I thank the Member for his question. My Department actively promotes cultural  and sporting activities in the border areas as it does in all areas of the  North of Ireland. There are many activities across my Department&rsquo;s areas of  responsibility, and I want to give him a few examples.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Northern Ireland Screen funds and works closely with three  creative learning centres in Crossnacreevy and Armagh, as well as one in the  Member&rsquo;s constituency in Derry. Waterways Ireland manages the Erne navigation and the  Shannon-Erne waterway and is preparing plans for the extension of the  navigation from Upper Lough Erne to Clones in County Monaghan.  Moreover, Sport NI, which has invested more than &pound;11 million over the past  three years in border district council areas, is also involved in cross-border  initiatives to promote sporting activity on an all-island basis.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Eastwood</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her answer. Given that Derry City Football Club plays  in the League of Ireland and is a cross-border team in that regard, is the  Minister considering funding the Brandywell stadium?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  I do not know whether the Member is aware that I visited the Brandywell stadium  on Saturday. I have to say that there was a hard sell. To be frank, the  conditions in the Brandywell stadium are not befitting of the team. I am aware  that it is managed by Derry City Council, and, through Derry City Council and  the citizens of Derry, we need to pool our  efforts to do what we can to promote better use of the Brandywell. That will  happen only when there is a fit-for-purpose facility.</p>
<p class="TimePeriod">2.15 pm</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCartney</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle, Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire as a  cuid freagra&iacute;. I congratulate the Minister. I know that she visited the  Brandywell on Saturday. Indeed, she took time out to meet Eamon Zayed, a Derry City  footballer who was the subject of racist abuse, and I thank her for taking the  initiative. In relation to sporting activities in and around Derry  and other places, could the Minister give us some outline of what her plans are  in relation to angling, particularly on an all-island basis?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  I thank the Member for that supplementary question. To put it on the record  again, the racist abuse that the player received will have no support from  anybody in this House.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I suspect that my colleague&rsquo;s senior colleague Mr  McGuinness may have prompted him to ask his question about fisheries and  angling. There are a number of fisheries and waterways attached to my  Department. There are more than 60 fisheries available to the public on  purchase of a licence and permit. My Department has distributed around &pound;5  million in Peace II funding to develop water-based tourism in the sector over  the past 10 years and has generated a great deal of angling and tourism around  the border, particularly around the lower ends of Donegal. My fisheries  officers maintain good links with their counterparts in the South, particularly  in relation to lower and upper Lough Erne.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Nesbitt</strong>:  If the Minister agrees that participation in grass roots sporting activities  qualifies as preventative spending in health terms, what are her plans for  cross-cutting initiatives with the Health Minister?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  I welcome that question. As recently as this lunchtime, myself and the Health  Minister met to discuss, first, using our Departments to promote better health  and well-being, which was an issue raised in a legacy report from a previous  Culture, Arts and Leisure Committee, and, secondly, joining up the Departments  more through sports and the arts, particularly for better health promotion on  suicide prevention and mental health, while also looking at physical health. We  are looking at initiatives and events that we can use across different age  sectors, because we are acutely aware that what may be OK for young boys may  not be so for older people.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I think that the Member is probably hinting at the fact  that where joined-up government can work together to take a collaborative  approach to support those who are particularly vulnerable, that is what we need  to do. If those are the Member&rsquo;s sentiments, I fully welcome them.</p>
<p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Ulster-Scots and Orange  Cultural Groups</p>
<p class="OralAnswers-Question">5. <strong>Mr  Campbell </strong>asked the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure for an update on  the funding allocated by her Department to Ulster-Scots and Orange  cultural groups for events during the current year. (AQO 211/11-15<a name="AQO211/11-15" id="AQO211/11-15"></a>)</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  During 2011, the Ulster-Scots Agency allocated the following funding to  Ulster-Scots groups: &pound;478,000 for music and dance tuition; &pound;145,000 for  festivals; &pound;72,000 for summer schools; &pound;29,000 for partnership funding; and  &pound;31,000 for other eligible projects. The Department for Culture, Arts and  Leisure (DCAL) has also allocated &pound;450,000 to the community festival fund,  which is administered by local councils on a match funding basis. Some of this  funding has been provided to the Ulster-Scots and Orange cultural groups, and it is likely that  those groups will receive funding again this year. The Arts Council has also  made awards of &pound;54,000 to the Royal Scottish Pipe Band Association and &pound;25,000  to the Ulster-Scots community network in this financial year.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Following a competitive process, the Grand Orange Lodge of  Ireland has been identified as one of two suitable organisations to work with  DCAL to develop proposals to implement the objectives of the cultural awareness  strategy, whose objectives are to build understanding of cultural traditions in  the North and contribute to a shared and better future. Work on that, on a  three-year basis, is expected to start in July. NI Screen administrates the Ulster-Scots  broadcast fund, and, since April, it has allocated awards to five projects  totalling almost &pound;500,000 out of a budget of almost &pound;1 million.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Campbell</strong>:  The Minister has outlined a package of measures, all of which have, obviously,  been carried out in the past year or several years. She must understand the low  esteem in which she is held because of recent decisions that she has taken in  her Department. Does she think that she will be able to put aside the baggage  of the past and the violence and all that went with it, which, by her own  admission, she was involved in, and try to administer departmental funds and  resources impartially for the greater good of all the people of Northern Ireland  for the future?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  T&aacute;. Yes.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Swann</strong>: I  thank the Minister for her answer. She made reference to pipe bands. Taking  into consideration the importance of the marching bands and the Ulster-Scots  and Orange cultural groups, following the study done by her Department into  marching bands, what investment does she intend to make, given the  opportunities for development that were outlined in that study?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  I thank the Member for his question. I have not had the opportunity to read the  results of that study, but I appreciate the culture, the background and the  community that some of those bands are involved in. In fact, they are part of  the community.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I intend to meet some of the leaders of the different band  associations to work through some of the issues. Once I have read the study, if  the Member has any further questions or needs any further detail, he can come  to my Department. The door is always open.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: The  Minister mentioned the cultural awareness strategy. Does the strategy include  ethnic minority cultures?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: That is not particularly relevant to the substantive question, but  the Minister may wish to answer.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  To be quite honest, there is nothing specific about ethnic minorities in the  strategy. There are cultural awareness activities in the strategy, but I want  to try to work, in the first instance, with Belfast City Council, particularly  given the work that it has done on some of the mayor&rsquo;s events and the cultural  awareness week. I want to look at some of the programmes that are there to make  sure that they are inclusive, because the last thing that I want is for people  to be looking in from outside and feel excluded.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Boylan</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. This is my first opportunity to  wish the Minister all the best in her new post. How are decisions made on the  festivals that are successful in securing funding from the community festivals  fund?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  Decisions are made primarily by local government. The Member has not been  involved in local government for some time, but that is where the decisions are  taken and where the money is distributed. I see the value in that, because  elected representatives have worked for and represented communities and have  fought particularly hard for this fund over the years. So, it is important that  local government still has that involvement.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">However, I am aware that some groups did not receive  funding. I am not encouraging them to short-circuit their local council, but if  there are particular areas or issues that those groups feel their councils did  not take into consideration, they need to write in, in the first instance, and  let my Department know.</p>
<p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Creative Industries Innovation Fund</p>
<p class="OralAnswers-Question">6. <strong>Mrs  Dobson </strong>asked the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure to outline the  priorities within the &pound;4 million budget of the creative industries innovation  fund and how she will ensure that the budget is allocated equitably. (AQO 212/11-15<a name="AQO212/11-15" id="AQO212/11-15"></a>)</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  The creative industries are recognised locally and internationally for their  potential job and wealth creation. They also stimulate wider innovation and  expert focus growth and can, therefore, make a contribution to rebuilding and  rebalancing the economy. Funding secured by my Department will provide support  for creative businesses as well as sectoral initiatives to harness the  potential of creative skills and strengths across the North.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">By supporting innovation, we can help create the content,  products, services and experiences that are capable of competing in global  markets. Priorities will focus on export activity; cross-sectoral  collaborations; high-growth subsectors, such as digital content; and harnessing  the innovation and entrepreneurial potential in the culture, arts and leisure  base. Funding to businesses will be on a competitive basis, but my Department  and other agencies will promote and encourage applications from across the  North.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Dobson</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her answer. Will she outline how she intends the  creative industries innovation fund to work with the rural development  programme to ensure that creative industries in rural areas are considered?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  I thank the Member for her question. I am acutely aware that 52% of that fund  comes from Belfast.  It is not a fund that needs to be spread across the North because it is there;  it has to respond to initiatives that are economic in their base. I will  endeavour to liaise with my colleague on the rural development fund, because I  do not want further gaps to be created between urban and rural. People living  in rural areas should have the same opportunities as people living in the city.  So, I will endeavour to take that on board.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Ramsey</strong>:  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s response. I think we all recognise the importance of  the creative industries in a modern society and the potential for job creation.  Will the Minister outline to the House what her Department is doing to ensure  that there is a good spread of the creative industries outside the greater Belfast area?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  Apart from the answer that I have just given, I am aware of the creativity in  the Member&rsquo;s constituency in Derry, which I  witnessed first-hand on Saturday. I am actually surprised to go through  Question Time with no one asking me about funding for Derry City of Culture.  Here is an opportunity to use creative industries to export and import and to  support entrepreneurial and business growth. I will endeavour to ask my  officials to compare with my colleague, particularly around the urban and rural  gaps.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr &Oacute; hOis&iacute;n</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Does the Minister have a formal  strategy for developing the creative industries?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  I do have a formal strategy. I have about two pages of an answer here, but, in  short, I do. I also want to make sure that people are aware of any development  or any potential to harness innovation for any of the sectors. I intend to try  &mdash; maybe, if it is useful &mdash; to bring forward a synopsis of that strategy and  forward it to all Members, so that everyone has the same information at the  same time.</p>
<p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Public Record Office of Northern Ireland:  Balmoral Avenue</p>
<p class="OralAnswers-Question">7. <strong>Mr  Gardiner </strong>asked the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure for an update on  the sale of the former Public Record Office of Northern Ireland (PRONI) site at  Balmoral Avenue, Belfast.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO  213/11-15<a name="AQO213/11-15" id="AQO213/11-15"></a>)</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  The site at Balmoral Avenue  was vacated in January 2011 and is now surplus to requirements. As there was no  sustainable interest from other parts of the public sector in acquiring the  premises, my Department has obtained outline planning permission for the site  to achieve the most favourable return from sale. The site was placed on the  open market from 8 April 2011. The sale, which is being managed by a local  agent, has been advertised in several local property publications and websites.  There has been interest from a number of parties who have viewed the premises,  and we anticipate that my Department will receive a reasonable offer or number  of offers shortly.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gardiner</strong>:  What steps has the Minister taken to help implement the Bain report, which, by  relocating government jobs out of Belfast, would  free up government buildings in Belfast  for sale, rental and other solutions?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  In the last four weeks, I have opened the new PRONI building. Unfortunately for  the Member, that is in east Belfast.  In relation to the Bain report, I have to be honest and say that I am not  aware, but I will find out and write to the Member in due course.</p>
<p class="OralAnswers-H2DepartmentHeading"><a name="8"></a>Education</p>
<p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Down High School</p>
<p class="OralAnswers-Question">1. <strong>Mr  Wells </strong>asked the Minister of Education for an update on his Department&rsquo;s  plans for a newbuild for Down   High School, Downpatrick.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 221/11-15<a name="AQO221/11-15" id="AQO221/11-15"></a>)</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd (The  Minister of Education)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. A  capital scheme for the extension and refurbishment of Down High School  was announced on 21 March 2001 by the then Minister, Martin McGuinness. The  scheme formed part of a PPP cluster, which also included Tor Bank special  school and Lagan College.</p>
<p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The South Eastern Education and Library Board  (SEELB) subsequently withdrew the school from the PPP cluster with a view to  providing a new school on a greenfield  site.</p>
<p class="TimePeriod">2.30 pm</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The SEELB has since been involved in a protracted search  for a suitable site. Having obtained planning permission in December 2009, the  board submitted a revised economic appraisal to the Department in January 2010,  which is currently with the Department&rsquo;s technical advisers. The proposed major  capital scheme for Down   High School is not in the  Department&rsquo;s investment delivery plan, but it is one of a large number of  schemes that are at an early stage of planning.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Over the next four years, my Department is faced with  limited capital funding, which will impact on its ability to deliver new school  building projects. I am looking closely at how to make best use of the capital  funds to address the most pressing needs and maximise educational benefits for  children and young people. That work will be a priority for me and my officials  in the coming months. In the autumn, when I have considered the options  available to me, I wish to be in a position to make a statement on the way  forward to the Assembly. As a result of the Budget, I will not be able to bring  forward all the projects that are currently planned or in the early stages of  planning. That is a difficult position for any Minister, but the capital funds  available to me simply will not build the number of newbuilds that schools,  quite rightly, seek at this time.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>:  That is extremely disappointing news from the Minister, because the project has  been ongoing for over 10 years. At present, the very successful Down High    School finds itself in extremely cramped  conditions, with many Portakabins being used as classrooms and a building that  costs a small fortune to keep in an adequate state of repair. The school pulled  itself up by its bootstraps and successfully attracted students from Down  district and further afield. Will the Minister indicate to the Assembly that,  when it comes to revising the capital list, Down High School  can be confident that it is, at least, well up towards the top of that list?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  It would not be reasonable for me, as Minister, ahead of an announcement, to  indicate anything about an individual school&rsquo;s application. I would like to be  able to tell the Member that School A, B or C will go ahead, but I have to be  responsible for the budget that I have been allocated. I have to ensure that  the projects brought forward in this and other financial years are a priority,  that they will meet the needs of the educational framework into and beyond the  coming decades and that they are sustainable. Each school will be judged on its  merits and proposals. I want to be in a position to make a substantive  statement on the matter to the Assembly in the early autumn.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs McKevitt</strong>:  What discussions has the Minister had with the Minister of Finance and  Personnel about the &pound;270 million backlog in the school maintenance programme?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  During the recent monitoring round, we made bids for further funds to deal with  the maintenance backlog in the school estate. When I spoke to the Finance  Minister at the Executive, I told him that I wished to hold a series of  meetings with him to discuss the entire education budget. It is clear, however,  that, as Education Minister, I will have difficult decisions to make in future.  I am prepared to make those decisions. I cannot simply go to the Executive, put  my hand out and ask other Departments to divvy up moneys if I am not prepared  to make the difficult decisions required in education. That includes the  restructuring of education services and how those are delivered in the  twenty-first century.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gardiner</strong>:  Will the Minister confirm the latest situation with the newbuilds for Lurgan College  and Portadown College? What is the timescale for that  action?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: That is a little further afield from the original question. It is  up to the Minister whether he wishes to answer.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>: I  do not have the specific information in front of me. I understand that the  Member has submitted a question for written answer. I asked for further  information on that matter today. Those projects fall into the same category as  those that Mr Wells spoke about and any other projects mentioned by Members.  They await my deliberations on a capital budget and on how we move forward with  capital building.</p>
<p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Schools: &lsquo;Every School a Good School&rsquo;</p>
<p class="OralAnswers-Question">2. <strong>Mr  Molloy </strong>asked the Minister of Education to outline the effectiveness of his  Department&rsquo;s &lsquo;Every School a Good School: A Policy for School Improvement&rsquo; and  what plans he has to develop this policy in the future. (AQO 222/11-15<a name="AQO222/11-15" id="AQO222/11-15"></a>)</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  &lsquo;Every School a Good   School&rsquo; has been very  effective in raising standards. In 2006, some 53% of school leavers achieved at  least five good GCSEs, including maths, English and, for those in Irish-medium  settings, Gaelic. In 2010, the figure improved, with an increase to 59%, which  equates to almost 3,000 more young people achieving those results. In the past  two years, the inspectorate evaluated provision as either outstanding or very  good in 143 schools. Last week, at a reception to celebrate those schools, I  was delighted to be a host and to see members of the education family and the  Education Committee.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Ensuring that schools are supported in addressing the areas  for improvement identified by the Education and Training Inspectorate is a  central element of Every School a Good   School. Most settings  improved between initial and follow-up inspections by at least one performance  level, including schools placed in the formal intervention process that had  been evaluated as inadequate or unsatisfactory. Since 2009, 28 schools have  entered the formal intervention process and eight schools have successfully  exited it. However, we cannot be complacent. We remain average by OECD  standards, and too many young people are leaving school with poor literacy and  numeracy skills. I will continue to implement the school improvement policy and  the new literacy and numeracy strategy to ensure that all our young people  fulfil their potential.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>: I  congratulate the Department and the Minister on their success so far. What  effect will budget restrictions have on the Every School a Good School  programme in future?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Dealing with a heavily depleted budget clearly leads to concerns that it will  have an effect on the educational outcomes of young people who are going  through the schooling system. My predecessor and I have urged those in charge  of budget lines throughout the education system &mdash; there are over 1,200 budget  lines in education &mdash; to prioritise front line education services. I am meeting  the education and library boards to go through their budget allocations and to  discuss how we can ensure that budgets are used to maximum effect, not only to  sustain our education system but to improve educational outcomes for the young  people involved.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  I am sure that the House will be very concerned to hear the Minister&rsquo;s  assertion that the cutbacks will impact on every aspect of the education  sector. Will the Minister assure the House that the now inevitable impact on  children &mdash; children will pay for the cutbacks &mdash; will be monitored closely? In  addition, will he tell us specifically how he will ensure that the quality of  every child&rsquo;s education and the right that every child in this region has to an  education will not be undermined in any way by the proposed cutbacks?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>: I  thank the Member for his question. Many of the responsibilities relating to  that question and the comments rest with me, as Minister of Education. I must  ensure that the constrained financial circumstances in which we are working do  not affect front line services. However, I do not admit that that is  inevitable. I have to make decisions, as does the House, on how to plan and  distribute education services. We are dealing with an outdated education  management model. The five education and library boards and the several other  bodies that manage education are no longer an effective or efficient way to  deliver education. So, the public would certainly expect us to ensure that,  before going anywhere near classrooms to seek savings, we modernise service  delivery and squeeze every penny that we can out of bureaucracy. That is the  way to ensure that our limited funds achieve the maximum educational outcomes  for young people.</p>
<p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Integrated Education</p>
<p class="OralAnswers-Question">3. <strong>Mrs  Overend </strong>asked the Minister of Education for his assessment of integrated  education. (AQO 223/11-15<a name="AQO223/11-15" id="AQO223/11-15"></a>)</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>: I  take my statutory duty to encourage and facilitate the development of  integrated education very seriously. The integrated sector continues to grow,  with over 20,000 pupils attending 43 primary and 20 post-primary integrated  schools here. My Department will continue to respond to parental demand for any  and all education sectors, where proposals are robust, provide value for money  and meet specified criteria.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">My Department is exploring other means of sharing and  integrating, and opportunities for cross-sectoral collaboration for young  people at Key Stage 4 and post-16 are presented through the entitlement  framework. Members will also be aware of the project being developed in Omagh  for a shared education campus, where post-primary schools can relocate to a  single site. Each one will retain its own ethos but develop shared facilities  and teaching expertise in the best interests of the people of Omagh and  surrounding areas.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Overend</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his answer. Does he plan to use co-operation between  schools on the delivery of curriculum entitlement and on achieving a  sufficiently wide subject range as a means of achieving greater and more  effective cross-faith integration? In addition, what stage has he reached in  his discussions with CCMS and the education and library boards on the matter?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Clearly, one of the ways forward for integration and the sharing of services is  for schools to work together. You will note that, through area learning  communities, there is greater sharing of services and resources and sharing with  pupils moving back and forth between schools. That is an effective and  realistic way of moving forward in respect of shared futures.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I am not one for glossy documents, consultants&rsquo; reports,  commissioners&rsquo; reports and commissions; I want to see practice and reality on  the ground. When I visit schools, particularly in the post-primary sector, I  witness the sharing of resources and services across the sector. That can  improve. Although I have had individual discussions with CCMS and the boards  about how we move that forward, I would welcome further discussions between all  the education providers on sharing services. Even if we were flush with money,  there is a duty on all our education providers to start sharing services and to  allow our young people to meet and exchange with one another in the school  setting.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  The Minister will be aware that my party leader called for consideration to be  given to a single education system. Has his Department given any consideration  to that option, and will he inform the House of the outcome?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>: I  am aware of Mr Robinson&rsquo;s speech; there was much debate about it. However, no  formal proposals have come across my desk. We, as politicians, are elected to  make decisions. The days of setting up commissions and bodies to examine the  work that we should be doing are over. The difficult decisions rest with us. If  we are serious about shared futures and shared societies, I suggest that  measured words and comments from politicians would also assist in that regard.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dickson</strong>:  Minister, do you agree that parental choice is paramount when it comes to  choosing the education for one&rsquo;s children and that integrated education and  schools deliver an excellent model of education for this community?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>: I  agree with your comments about parental choice and integrated education. The  Department can act only if there is sufficient parental demand in an area to  expand or develop a new school provision in any sector. My predecessors, Martin  McGuinness and Caitr&iacute;ona Ruane, worked favourably with the integrated sector. I  intend to continue that relationship. We have several education sectors, all of  which provide excellent education services to the communities and are based on  parental demand.</p>
<p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Gaelscoil Aodha Rua, Dungannon</p>
<p class="OralAnswers-Question">4. <strong>Ms Gildernew </strong>asked the Minister of Education for an update on the proposals for  Gaelscoil Aodha Rua in Dungannon. &nbsp;(AQO  224/11-15<a name="AQO224/11-15" id="AQO224/11-15"></a>)</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat. I am pleased to tell you that, on 15 June 2011, I  conditionally approved the development proposal to establish a new grant-aided  Irish-medium primary school in Dungannon, which will be known as Gaelscoil  Aodha Rua. The school will open in September 2011, provided it meets the  minimum enrolment threshold for a rural primary school in the Irish-medium sector.  It must achieve the minimum viability intake of 12 pupils in year one. In  addition, the Department must be satisfied that the site and premises comply  with health and safety requirements, and the school must provide the Department  with written confirmation that it will comply fully with all statutory  conditions in relation to the operation and management of a grant-aided school.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his answer. My supplementary question was around the  minimum requirements. I understand that Aodha Rua has 14 children enrolled  already for primary one &mdash; rang a haon &mdash; which is very much to be welcomed. Will  the Minister make it his business to visit the new school during its first year  in operation to see for himself the benefit that it will bring not just to  children from Dungannon but to the south Tyrone community at large?</p>
<p class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>: I  welcome the news that the school has met the minimum enrolment figure for a new  Gaelscoil in a rural area. I come from a rural background, and good manners  dictate that I have to accept that invite.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  Will the Minister consider the fact that the current legislation regarding the  Department&rsquo;s statutory duty to promote and facilitate Irish-medium and  integrated education will be looked at? Other education sectors feel that there  is not a level playing field in the allocation of capital projects or the way  in which they are dealt with in respect of other issues emanating from his  Department.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>: I  have no plans to revisit either piece of legislation, which, the Member will be  aware, flows from the Good Friday Agreement and the St Andrews Agreement. I  assure the Member that all decisions relating to the provision of grant aid to  any sector are open and transparent and are open to examination by members of  the public. They are set against clear published criteria and against the  legislation, which is on the legislative books. Therefore, all those decisions  can be examined. Like any Minister or Department, we are open to criticism for  our decisions, but, as long as I am satisfied that any decision of mine is made  against clear criteria, I will stand by that decision.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire as  ucht an fhreagra sin.

<p class="B3BodyText">What measures has the Minister taken to increase and  enhance the amount of money that his Department has spent on nursery, primary  and secondary school education? That question relates to Irish-language  education.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Patsy, my Irish is not great, but I did pick up from your question that you  were referring to the Irish-medium sector. Go raibh maith agat, Patsy. In  respect of the previous answer to the Chair of the Education Committee, each  proposal will have to be looked at on its own merits. We can look back on the  past number of years with pride that the Irish-language community has been able  to develop its Irish-medium education sector, as it rightly should, because  parents want their children to be taught through the medium of Irish. There is  a growing sector out there that deserves to be supported, and there is a  legislative basis on which it will be supported. My Department has policies on  which it will be supported, and each development proposal that is forwarded to  my office will be judged against that legislation and those policies.</p>
<p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">DE: Budget 2011-15</p>
<p class="OralAnswers-Question">5. <strong>Mr Cree </strong>asked the Minister of Education how he plans to meet his Department&rsquo;s  budgetary shortfall during the 2011-15 period. &nbsp;(AQO 225/11-15<a name="AQO225/11-15" id="AQO225/11-15"></a>)</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  The budget outcome for education for 2011-15 has presented major challenges. A  savings delivery plan has been developed to realise resource savings over the  four-year Budget period of &pound;100 million, &pound;101 million, &pound;187 million, &pound;229  million and &pound;306 million in the last year to enable the Department to live  within its budget. Savings measures seek to protect spend on departmental  priorities and bear down on administration and duplication. I will continue to  work to alleviate pressures on front line services. I intend to work with my  Executive colleagues in the months and years ahead to help to alleviate the  pressures on the education budget.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I wish to work with my Executive colleagues in reaching  agreement on the establishment of the ESA, which I believe will ensure greater  consistency and efficiency in service delivery. Without it, scarce resources  will continue to be spent on unnecessary bureaucracy and will be spread too  thinly over existing institutions.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>: Has  the Minister assessed the number of teachers who will lose their job because of  budgetary cuts, or can he give any guarantees on job protection, given that the  median age for teachers is only 40 years of age?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Sorry, I missed the last point of your question.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>: Can  you give any guarantees on job protection, bearing in mind that the median age  for teachers is only 40 years of age?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Education is presented with a number of difficulties in preparing its budget,  including retrieving information for assessment and distribution, especially to  elected representatives. I am head of a Department that has over 1,200 budget  lines, the majority of which are made up by schools that manage their own  budget. Boards of governors will decide how those budgets are spent and the  number of teachers and redundancies.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Quite rightly, boards of governors will come back to me and  say that they can work only within the budget that they are set. They are  correct. I can work only within the budget that I am set. So, I am not able to  give a forecast on forced redundancies at this stage. I hope to return to the  subject in September, when all the boards and schools have reported back to the  Department. We have a figure to work off for this year, which they will be able  to extrapolate over the remaining three years.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Flanagan</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Could the Minister outline how the  establishment of an Education and Skills Authority could help to deliver  savings in the education system?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  The Education and Skills Authority was not originally promoted simply as a  saving device. However, it is very important, especially in the current  economic climate, that we alleviate the financial pressures on education, as  has been the case in other Departments where the review of public  administration has either been completed or is proposed to go through. It is  important that we modernise our education administration here. I require and am  seeking agreement with my Executive colleagues on how we move the ESA programme  forward. I understand that some other parties have concerns about how we deal  with that. I believe that those concerns can be overcome and that the other  parties want to have that matter resolved in the short term because they also  recognise the budgetary constraints. The primary focus of ESA has to be on the  ability to improve the educational outcomes of young people in our schools,  thereby raising the standard of young people who go out into society and play  an active role in the community and the economy and who, therefore, are of  benefit to our entire society.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  In an answer to Leslie Cree, the Minister indicated that he could not give  figures. His Department will have figures on schools that are unsustainable in  the area. Given that, in budgetary terms, a total of 850 schools are involved,  how many schools are in an unsustainable position to the extent that,  ultimately, he would consider them for closure?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>: I  can consider a school for closure only if the governing authority &mdash; CCMS,  Comhairle na Gaelscola&iacute;ochta or the education boards &mdash; comes forward to me with  a development proposal to close the school. However, although I am aware that  we have a number of unsustainable schools in our portfolio, I caution Members  not to judge unsustainable schools simply on the basis of numbers. There is a  sustainable schools policy, and that is what schools should be judged against.  I hope that the Member is as enthusiastic about closing schools when it comes  to closing a school in his constituency, because that is when &mdash;</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  You close schools, not me.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  If I am correct, the Member is a member of an education board, so he also has a  responsibility around closing schools.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">A school should be closed only if does not meet the criteria  in the sustainable schools policy, if it is not achieving the educational  outcomes for the young people in it and if every other measure to raise the  standards in the school has been tried and has not succeeded. I will inform the  House that several schools in the education portfolio are letting down the  young people who attend them. Although several of those schools are receiving  assistance from the Department of Education, their education board and the  Education and Training Inspectorate, unless there is a major turnaround in  those schools in the short term, I believe that there is a responsibility on  the governing bodies and me to close those schools.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>:  The Minister has depressed us somewhat by talking about the closure of schools  and the loss of teaching posts. As we approach the holidays, can he cheer us up  by assuring us that ICT will remain a priority for his Department? Will he  explain how he intends to do that, given that the ICT budget has been savagely  cut?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>: I  encourage the Member to examine the Every School a Good School  policy and the sustainable schools policy. I have no doubt that the Member, as  a constituency MLA, would not want a school in his constituency that was  failing its young people after going through all the measures of support that  are available. We cannot allow more children to go through schools that have  not reacted in a positive way to the policies and interventions that are  available to them to improve educational outcomes. I will not be shy when it  comes to making a hard decision on closing an underperforming school that has  not turned the corner.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The Member made comments about ICT. We were fortunate that,  over many years, we had a very healthy ICT budget, and we have had major  investment in ICT schemes throughout our schools. C2k has been a very  successful project, and it still has a substantial budget to carry forward its  work. I have asked that all my budget streams be examined to ensure that we get  as efficient a response as possible to the money that we spend, and I believe  that IT is a good area in which to ensure value for money.</p>
<p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Post-primary Education: Armagh</p>
<p class="OralAnswers-Question">6. <strong>Mr  Murphy </strong>asked the Minister of Education for his assessment of relocation  opportunities for post-primary education facilities in Armagh  city. (AQO 226/11-15<a name="AQO226/11-15" id="AQO226/11-15"></a>)</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  To date, no formal proposals have been submitted to my Department about the  matter. However, I am aware that some schools in the city are exploring  possible options, including the potential use of land at the St Luke&rsquo;s Hospital  site. It is the responsibility of the school managing authorities in the first  instance to manage provision in their respective sectors and to bring proposals  to the Department to meet local demand. Given the financial constraints, we  will have to be creative and innovative when developing solutions to meet the  needs of schools. We will have to consider more sharing, co-location and  collaboration, and I encourage all those developing proposals to embrace a way  of thinking to meet the needs of a modern education system.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his answer. He rightly refers to the financial  constraints that he faces in his budget, particularly on the capital side. Does  he agree that, in the context of the constrained financial budget, it is a very  welcome prospect for schools to come together with radical proposals that  facilitate the sharing of facilities both within sectors and, on occasion,  across sectors? Will the Department consider giving support to schools that  want to develop such ideas to allow them to bring those ideas to the Department  for support?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  In principle, I endorse the proposal that the Member sets out. We have to  encourage our sectors to come together, share resources, share sites and look  at ways, even through area planning, to bring schools together under capital  build programmes. If schools wish to hold on to their identities under such a  programme, that can be achieved through the proposals. However, I am awaiting  the publication of the Commission for Catholic Education&rsquo;s post-primary review,  which is a piece of work that has taken place across the North and has looked  at the post-primary estate in the Catholic sector. I want to be in a position  to make a statement in September on the way forward for my capital budget. I  want the post-primary review to be published and on my table before I make that  statement. However, as Minister, I have a responsibility to move ahead and  spend the limited funds available to me, and I do not think that delay will  favour anyone.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire as  an fhreagra a thug s&eacute; go dt&iacute; seo. An dtiocfadh liom a fhiafra&iacute; de an bhfuil s&eacute;  s&aacute;sta leis an sol&aacute;thar don Ghaelscola&iacute;ocht ag leibh&eacute;al an mhe&aacute;noideachais i  dtoghcheantar an I&uacute;ir agus Ard Mhacha nuair a chaithfeas p&aacute;ist&iacute; taisteal 20  m&iacute;le ar bhus &oacute; I&uacute;r Cinn Tr&aacute; go hArd Mhaca?</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Is the Minister happy with the Irish-medium provision at  secondary level in Newry and Armagh, given that some children have to travel 20  miles by bus from Newry to Armagh and given that he specifically said that he  would encourage children to attend their local secondary school and not travel  such distances?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>: I  am very happy with the educational outcomes in the Irish-medium sector, especially  at Col&aacute;iste Chaitr&iacute;ona. It is a shining example of how the English-medium  sector and the Irish-medium sector can share resources successfully. It is  regrettable, but we are still developing the Irish-medium sector.<span class="SectionMarker"><span style="font-size:14.0pt; "> </span></span></p>
<p class="B3BodyText">For years, we went through the na&iacute;scoils. We have now  developed a wide area that is covered by bunscoils. The next area that needs to  be worked on is the me&aacute;nscoils. However, we cannot do one without the other.  The quality of education that young people receive in their educational establishment  must be emphasised and is at the core of Irish-medium education. That is set  against a number of factors, whether in the Irish or the English medium. It  would be nice for me to stand up and announce a number of me&aacute;nscoils across the  North, but I will not do that unless I am satisfied that the educational  attainment in those schools is going to be of the highest standard. Let us  build that gradually and make sure that it is successful.</p>

<p class="OralAnswers-H2DepartmentHeading"><a name="9"></a>Assembly Commission</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Questions 3 and 7 have been withdrawn. Paul Maskey is not in his  place to ask question 1.</p>
<p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Damages (Asbestos-related Conditions)  Bill</p>
<p class="OralAnswers-Question">2. <strong>Mr  Elliott </strong>asked the Assembly Commission to outline the cost to the Assembly  of the Attorney General&rsquo;s referral of the Damages (Asbestos-related Conditions)  Bill to the Supreme Court. (AQO 236/11-15<a name="AQO236/11-15" id="AQO236/11-15"></a>)</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>: The  time spent on this matter by our in-house lawyers and others is not costed, as  it is part of their role to respond to such challenges. Senior and junior  counsel were appointed to represent the Assembly&rsquo;s interests, but their fees  have not yet been agreed by the Assembly Commission. However, a Supreme Court  application fee of &pound;180 was also incurred.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  I thank Mr Cree for that answer. Given that the Attorney General withdrew his  reference to the Supreme Court of the Damages (Asbestos-related Conditions)  Bill, will the Attorney General for Northern Ireland pay the Assembly&rsquo;s  case costs?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>:  Prior to consenting to the withdrawal of the reference, the Assembly Commission  advised the Attorney General for Northern Ireland that, although the  Assembly would be entitled to pursue costs against him, to do so would not be in  the public interest. The Assembly Commission, therefore, agreed to bear its own  costs in respect of the reference. The Attorney General for Northern Ireland  will not, therefore, be asked to pay the Assembly costs. We understand that the  Department of Finance and Personnel has adopted a similar position.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Allister</strong>:  I note the figures that the Member has quoted, but they are at total variance  with figures supplied to me in questions for written answer, which suggest that  there was a &pound;30,000 bill for potentially defending this matter and an estimated  &pound;4,000 bill in respect of the Attorney General&rsquo;s office. If Ministers are  supplying totally different figures, where is the Commission getting its  figures from?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>:  Figures were supplied by the Minister of Finance and Personnel. He was asked to  provide an estimate of the cost of the Northern Ireland Attorney General&rsquo;s  challenge to the validity of the Damages (Asbestos-related Conditions) Bill,  and in answer to a question in the Assembly on 3 June, which I think the Member  refers to, he estimated that the work undertaken by his Department in defending  the reference would cost &pound;30,000. The Minister stressed that that figure was  just an estimate that may be revised. As the Assembly Commission is currently  negotiating counsel fees in respect of the reference, it would not be in the  interest of the public purse to release an estimate at this point.</p>
<p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Parliament Buildings: Car Parking</p>
<p class="OralAnswers-Question">4. <strong>Mr  Gardiner </strong>asked the Assembly Commission why it has not yet extended the  lower east car park. (AQO 238/11-15<a name="AQO238/11-15" id="AQO238/11-15"></a>)</p>
<p class="OralAnswers-Question">11. <strong>Mrs  Overend </strong>asked the Assembly Commission what was the outcome of its recent  negotiations with the Department of Finance and Personnel in relation to  resolving the car parking problem at Parliament Buildings. &nbsp;(AQO 245/11-15<a name="AQO245/11-15" id="AQO245/11-15"></a>)</p>
<p class="OralAnswers-Question">14. <strong>Mrs D  Kelly </strong>asked the Assembly Commission for an update on increasing car parking  facilities in the vicinity of Parliament Buildings. (AQO 248/11-15<a name="AQO248/11-15" id="AQO248/11-15"></a>)</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Ramsey</strong>:  With your permission, Mr Deputy Speaker, I will answer questions 4, 11 and 14  together.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly Commission is very aware of the difficulties  currently being experienced with car parking, most notably on plenary days;  that is, Mondays and Tuesdays. I can tell Members that car parking is high on  the agenda at all Commission meetings that I have attended. Ongoing discussions  with Department of Finance and Personnel (DFP) officials recently resulted in  an agreement that the Assembly can develop an existing car park adjacent to the  lower east car park for use as an overflow facility, particularly on plenary  days.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">It has also been agreed that minor alterations can be made  to the parking layout in the lower east car park. Together, those proposals  will create approximately 50 additional car parking spaces for users of  Parliament Buildings.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">It is planned that construction work will be carried out  during the summer recess and that the spaces will be available in early  September. Further to that, agreement has been reached with the Department of  Finance and Personnel that Assembly security staff will assume responsibility  for managing those car parks and that access to them will be restricted to  those who use Parliament Buildings. The issue of car parking has been raised by  a number of Members, and it is anticipated that that will significantly improve  car parking facilities, particularly on Assembly plenary sitting days.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gardiner</strong>:  I thank the Commission for that reply. It is unfortunate that the Commission  appears to be able only to discuss the matter but never begin to resolve it. I  hope that the action being taken will resolve the matter. Does the Commission  agree that, in general, parking is getting worse on the estate and that urgent  action is required immediately?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Ramsey</strong>:  The Assembly Commission has been diligent on the matter. It is not easy when it  has to deal with another Department that has overall control of the management  of the estate. It took considerable discussions to reach agreement. As I  outlined to the Member, he will see significant improvement, with 50 additional  car parking spaces being made available in September when staff return after  the summer recess.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Overend</strong>:  I welcome the movement on the issue. I have no further questions, so long as it  is confirmed that there will be extra places in September.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  What plans has the Commission for the maintenance of the Stormont estate over  the next 12 months?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Ramsey</strong>:  In general terms, the maintenance of the Stormont estate is under the  governance of DFP. There is a need for ongoing maintenance, and the Commission  will be taking up that issue directly with that Department.</p>
<p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Assembly Committees: IT Facilities</p>
<p class="OralAnswers-Question">5. <strong>Mrs McKevitt </strong>asked the Assembly Commission what plans there are to introduce IT  facilities in Committee meeting rooms. &nbsp;(AQO  239/11-15<a name="AQO239/11-15" id="AQO239/11-15"></a>)</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>: The  provision of IT facilities in Committee meeting rooms is the subject of an  ongoing cross-directorate piece of work. The aim of the project is to determine  the most appropriate means by which to facilitate Committee meetings to embrace  modern technology and provide a more efficient service to Committees and their  members. To ensure that the IT facilities provided are the most appropriate for  the needs of members, the Assembly&rsquo;s Research and Information Service will  carry out initial research of technologies employed in other legislatures and  local councils, and issue a questionnaire to help determine the attitude of members  to the introduction of such facilities and the most appropriate mechanism for  delivering the needs of members.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Under consideration will be the choice of hardware to be  employed. Options might include, but are not limited to, fixed screens and  keyboards in each Committee room, laptops or hand-held tablet-style devices. In  determining the most appropriate option, consideration will be given to the  preferences expressed by members; the cost, health and safety implications; the  effect that the choice of equipment might have on existing recording equipment  and any alterations that might be required to it; the security of information  contained on the equipment; the training required by members and staff to use  the new equipment and software; and the reputational risk to the Assembly and  its users. The project is in its initial stages, and a vast number of variables  will need to be considered as it progresses. The progress of the project will  be periodically reported to the Chairpersons&rsquo; Liaison Group.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs McKevitt</strong>:  What is that status of the planned upgrade to all Assembly IT software?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>: The  real purpose of the exercise is to cut down the paper packs. In the past  financial year, almost nine million sheets of A4 paper were used for printing  and photocopying across the Assembly at an approximate cost of &pound;54,500 plus  VAT. Although Committees are not the only users, they are one of the biggest.  No longer producing Committee information packs will greatly reduce that cost.  However, that cost saving can be made only if all members move to paperless  Committee meetings.</p>
<p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Assembly: Constituency Offices</p>
<p class="OralAnswers-Question">6. <strong>Mr  Allister </strong>asked the Assembly Commission for its assessment of the impact on  services to constituents caused by the delay in approving the rental valuations  of some new Members&rsquo; constituency offices. (AQO 240/11-15<a name="AQO240/11-15" id="AQO240/11-15"></a>)</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: The  desirability of obtaining an independent valuation of constituency office  rentals was covered in the &lsquo;Financial Support for Members Handbook&rsquo; in March  2011 and was effective from the start of this new mandate. It arose as a result  of a recommendation made by the Review Body on Senior Salaries in its November  2008 report on Members&rsquo; pay, pensions and allowances, which was adopted by the  Assembly Commission in its report to the Assembly on that matter. That  requirement reflects the Assembly Commission&rsquo;s desire to ensure that value for  money is consistently achieved for rental payments funded from public funds and  that such payments are perceived as fair.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly Commission is aware of a number of issues that  have arisen during the implementation of the project. However, the Commission  is also mindful that the degree of market analysis and comparison that is  required to ensure that the most accurate rental valuations are provided means  that professional valuations may take some time to complete.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly Commission has already met to review the  progress that has been made on the exercise to date and will be meeting later  today to discuss the matter further. The Assembly Commission wishes to assure  the House that it will move to resolve these matters as soon as possible to  ensure that all newly appointed Members have access to suitable constituency  office properties at the earliest opportunity.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Allister</strong>:  I take no issue with the fact that there should be independent valuation. But,  at the induction of new Members, it was boasted to us that the process would  take four or five days; it is now some seven weeks. It is almost as if some  people did not know that there was going to be an election and nothing was put  in place to deal with it. Apparently, it was some weeks after the election that  valuers were appointed; then, they got out on the ground; then, they produced  reports &mdash;</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Can we have a question, please?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Allister</strong>:  How could the Commission be satisfied or complacent about a system that,  patently, is not working and is robbing constituents of the service that they  should by now have?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>:  That is an issue that we will be looking at later today. The valuers can look at  a property only when it is identified, first of all, by the Member. Therefore,  they would not be in a position to look at new properties on 5 May, for  example. The process had to be a competitive process of tendering to ensure  that we had consistent valuations in connection with that. I understand the  frustrations of the Member, because I suspect that they are shared by others.  However, it is important that we get this right to ensure not only that the  system offers proper value for money for the taxpayer in the first seven weeks  of this Assembly but that it will be robust and stand the test of time over the  next four or five years. It is, therefore, important that the proper time is  taken to get it correct.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Struck against that must be the balance of ensuring that  there is proper provision for constituents. Today, we will be looking at how  that can be brought about. The processes have been timely in that regard, and  effort has been made to ensure that the cases of new Members who are seeking  property are dealt with first. The process is supposed to cover all MLAs, but, principally,  the focus has been on new Members.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dickson</strong>:  I am a new Member, and I identified a suitable property in my constituency in  May. We are now sitting at the end of June, and I have not yet been able to  secure appropriate premises because of the delays caused by the valuation  process. I am not in a position to deliver an adequate constituency service to  my constituents in East Antrim who deserve  such a service and have done so since the day and hour I was elected.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>:  Again, I understand the Member&rsquo;s frustration. As I said, we will be dealing  with the issue later today via your Commission member and other Commission  members. This is the first time that this has been done. It is important that  whatever process is put in place is got right. I appreciate the level of  concern and inconvenience that it causes a new Member, but we have got to look  at something that will be robust right across the full mandate, rather than  something that will simply be there for the first few weeks.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  I thank the member of the Commission for his response. It is obviously quite a  technical issue. How much input did the Commission have in the appointment of  the property valuation company? How much is the overall process going to cost  and how long is it going to take? How much consideration was given to the  property valuer&rsquo;s relationship with each area and his knowledge of the property  values in each area throughout Northern    Ireland?</p>
<p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  will try to take those questions in turn. There was a competitive tendering  process and, from a procurement point of view, the best bid was made by the  successful surveyor. I believe that the cost is around &pound;12,000 for the overall  survey, covering all 108 Members. The surveyor was given, I think, three  months, but with the understanding that new MLAs and those who were seeking to  renew a lease were given priority. I know that a number of Members,  particularly new MLAs, have lodged appeals, so there is a process for that. I  suspect that I have forgotten some of the questions. However, the gist of the  answer is that we are trying to ensure a professional and correct process.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: That is the reason why Members should ask one question that they  want answered. Question 7 has been withdrawn. Question 8 will be answered by  Barry McElduff on behalf of the Commission.</p>
<p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Assembly: European Engagement</p>
<p class="OralAnswers-Question">8. <strong>Mr  Swann </strong>asked the Assembly Commission for an update on the development of a  European engagement strategy to enhance engagement with the European  institutions. (AQO 242/11-15<a name="AQO242/11-15" id="AQO242/11-15"></a>)</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  The Commission is mindful that it does not take the lead role in scrutinising Europe. Everyone knows that Statutory Committees take the  lead in scrutinising how Departments and Ministers, first, become aware of  European Union legislation, and, secondly, enact that legislation. The  Committee for Employment and Learning is a good example, with its recent work  on the transposition of the agency workers directive. Committees have a major  role to play in challenging what Departments are doing to ensure that available  EU funding is channelled through various streams.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The Commission is keenly aware of the lead role of the  Committees in this matter and its role is to ensure that the Committees have  the necessary support and resources to carry out that work properly. In  carrying out that role, the Commission works very closely with the Committee  for the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister, which takes the  lead on European issues. That Committee took forward inquiries on European  engagement in the previous mandate and the mandate before that, when it was the  Committee of the Centre.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Both the Commission and the Committee for the Office of the  First Minister and deputy First Minister have expressed the view that there  might be some merit in appointing a person who would be based in Brussels and would look  after the interests of the Assembly there. However, because of the current  economic climate, the Commission and the wider Assembly need to be satisfied as  to value for money. For now, the preferred way forward is the appointment of an  EU scrutiny co-ordinator to be based at Parliament Buildings. One of that  person&rsquo;s early tasks will be to put forward options for arrangements for a  presence in Brussels.  Initial preparation work will begin in the summer and there will be a report to  the Commission by the end of the year.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Swann</strong>: Is  there further detail on how that person will be selected or on who will make  the final decision on selection?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  It is my understanding that the Commission will appoint from within the  secretariat. There will be an open trawl. For example, staff within this  Building may wish to go forward to become the EU scrutiny co-ordinator. What  exactly will that co-ordinator do? The post is currently being graded, and  typical Assembly procedures will be followed to make the appointment. On  appointment, the officer will co-ordinate the flow of information and expertise  to Committees to give them more assistance in scrutinising Ministers and  Departments. The co-ordinator will also engage with a wide range of external  sources and create linkages from those to the work of Committees.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>: I  have very fond memories of one of my early trips to Brussels, which was with Barry McElduff, who  created quite a stir. Does he not agree that, in times of economic austerity,  we need to have the closest relationship with Europe  to ensure that we maximise whatever benefits come from there?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  I thank the Member for the question. Again, cost is an issue, but so too are  the potential benefits. You might have to invest to save in a situation such as  this. That is why the Commission is looking at a number of options. It might be  worth knowing that, if there were to be a permanent officer in Brussels similar to that of other Parliaments  or regional Assemblies, the calculated cost would be in the region of &pound;95,000  to &pound;132,000 annually. Before the Commission or the Assembly would commit to  such expenditure, we would want to be clear that we were getting value for  money. However, I do take the Member&rsquo;s point that it might be very necessary to  spend that money to get a better return and investment.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Ross Hussey is not in his place, so we will move on to the next  question.</p>
<p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">North/South Parliamentary Forum</p>
<p class="OralAnswers-Question">10. <strong>Mr  Murphy </strong>asked the Assembly Commission for an update on the establishment of  the North/South Parliamentary Forum. &nbsp;(AQO  244/11-15<a name="AQO244/11-15" id="AQO244/11-15"></a>)</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>: On  23 June 2011, at a joint meeting of the North/South Parliamentary Forum working  groups in the Oireachtas, it was agreed that a further three joint meetings of  the two working groups will be convened to take forward the ideas and actions  generated by the North/South Parliamentary Forum conference at the Slieve  Donard Hotel in October 2010. The meetings are planned for the autumn of 2011,  and areas for consideration include parliamentary relationships in Europe, European agriculture and rural development reform  and the role and arrangements for the North/South Parliamentary Forum. It was  further agreed that the report from the Slieve Donard conference will be issued  to all members from both legislatures.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>:  Thank you, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Depending on which member of the Commission  is answering questions, I almost have to rephrase my words. However, I am sure  that you share my frustration at the length of time that it has taken to  establish the North/South Parliamentary Forum. That area of work was part of  the St Andrews Agreement; it emanates from the Good Friday Agreement some 13  years ago but is yet to be established. Although the work of the conference is  welcome, we have now moved into working groups but have yet &mdash;</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Could we have a question, please?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>:  Yes, I am just coming to that. Does the Member think that it reflects badly on  this institution that it continues to take such a long time to establish the  forum? Will the Commission try to bring some sense of urgency to the working  groups to get a proposition so that we can actually establish the forum?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>: I  understand the Member&rsquo;s frustration. I was at the Slieve Donard conference last  year. Last week&rsquo;s meeting was very fruitful. There was a good atmosphere, and  genuine efforts were made to take the matter forward. That will happen in the  autumn.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Question 11 has already been dealt with, so we will move on.</p>
<p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Assembly Committees: Mobile Phones and  iPads</p>
<p class="OralAnswers-Question">12. <strong>Mr I  McCrea </strong>asked the Assembly Commission what steps are being taken to  facilitate the use of iPads and mobile phones in Committee meeting rooms. (AQO  246/11-15<a name="AQO246/11-15" id="AQO246/11-15"></a>)</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>: The  use of laptops and mobile phones in Committee meeting rooms has been an ongoing  issue for some time. As Members will be aware, the use of mobile phones creates  particular difficulties because the signals transmitted and received by such  devices interfere with audio recordings. Every effort has been made to attempt  to address the issue, from altering the sound levels and adjusting the  equipment to the use of alternative microphones. However, it has not been  possible to resolve the issue. Westminster  now has equipment that can almost eliminate the effect of the signals  transmitted and received by mobile phones. However, that has been at a high  financial cost. It would also involve considerable alteration to Committee  rooms.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">On the issue of iPads, as part of an ongoing project across  the Assembly secretariat, consideration is being given to the introduction of  IT facilities in Committee meeting rooms as an alternative to Committee packs. As  part of that project, consideration will be given to a hand-held, tablet-style  device similar to the iPad. The iPad is just one of the ever-increasing range  of such devices available. Indeed, last evening, I had sight of my  granddaughter playing with a BlackBerry device called a &ldquo;play board&rdquo; or  something &mdash; fantastic technology. In deciding on the most appropriate hardware  to be used by Committee members as a result of the project, the option of an  iPad or similar tablet computer will be considered.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  I thank the member of the Commission for his answer. He stole part of my  supplementary question by referring to what happens at Westminster. Surely the Commission accepts  that something needs to be done to ensure that mobile phones do not interfere  with equipment. Some MLAs consistently choose to break the rules by using their  mobile phones in Committee rooms and, indeed, the House. Will the Commission at  least give an assurance that it will seriously consider purchasing equipment to  eradicate any interference?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>: I  thank the Member for his supplementary question. Indeed, based on the Westminster model, the  estimated cost of upgrading the audio facilities here is between &pound;80,000 and  &pound;90,000 for each Committee room. It is important to note that that is only an  indicative cost, as any new system must be bespoke to the room in question,  which is likely to result in an additional cost. So the cost is high. However, Westminster has a working  solution, and the Commission will look further at that model.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>:  Does the member of the Assembly Commission agree that, in addition to the  interference that mobile phones and iPads cause, the content of some messages  shown on them can be disturbing and offensive? Perhaps the Member who asked the  original question might reflect on that.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>: It  is certainly an issue. In fact, as I said in an earlier answer, any sort of  progress in that area must have the full support of Committee members. If they  are not prepared to use the technology or have reasons for preferring paper,  the whole project will be an absolute waste of time. It is a difficult issue.  Circulars will be sent to Committee members asking for their opinions, and we  will work on that basis.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: With  your indulgence, Mr Deputy Speaker, I will ask a question that is slightly off  the track. I would like to point out that the sound system in the Senate is  still very poor. The Environment Committee meets there every Thursday. Any  other Committee members here will probably agree with me. We would like the  system to be improved. If that does not happen, we might have to think about  moving from the Senate to another room for our Committee meetings.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>: I  take your point. The difficulty with the Senate is that it is the oldest room  here. It is in a similar condition to when it was built in the 1930s, and it  has a considerable history. The Senate is a large room and is difficult to  handle. We believe that the Westminster  system could work in that room and would not be obtrusive. As I said to Mr  Murphy, we will certainly review the situation to see what can be done. It is  probably the biggest room outside of this one and has its own particular  problems.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Basil McCrea is not in his place for question 13. Question 14 has  already been dealt with. That is the end of questions to the Assembly  Commission.</p>

<p class="OralAnswers-Question"><span class="BoldText">Mr Givan</span> asked the  Minister of Justice what measures are being taken to investigate the erroneous  release of George Damien MacFerran from HMP Maghaberry and to ensure that a  fit-for-purpose system is in place to prevent further such incidents occurring.<span class="SectionMarker"><span style="font-size:14.0pt; "> </span></span></p>
<p class="TimePeriod">3.30 pm</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford (The  Minister of Justice)</strong>: I regret to advise the House that George Damien  MacFerran was released in error by the general office of Maghaberry prison on  Friday 24 June 2011. The matter came to light on Monday 27 June, and Mr  MacFerran was returned to Maghaberry prison by police officers at approximately  6.00 pm yesterday.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Mr MacFerran was released 47 days before his due release  date. I take the matter very seriously, and I am clear that an immediate and  thorough investigation is required into the circumstances that led to that  erroneous release. Terms of reference for that investigation have been issued  and a senior prison governor, who reports directly to Prison Service  headquarters, has been appointed to lead the investigation. Although I do not  wish to pre-empt the outcome of the investigation, as far as I am aware, the  circumstances of this erroneous release are quite different from those of the  three prisoners who were released in error last year. At this stage, there are  no indications that the early release occurred as the result of a systems  error.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I do not underestimate the seriousness of the incident and  the impact that it will have on public confidence in the Northern Ireland  Prison Service. It serves to highlight the need for fundamental end-to-end  reform of the Prison Service, which is to be taken forward through the  strategic efficiency and effectiveness programme that I launched earlier today.  There is a pressing need to ensure that Prison Service personnel get the basics  right and get them right consistently. Keeping prisoners in custody until their  due release dates is a fundamental part of the role of the Prison Service, and  I am, therefore, committed to doing everything that I can to ensure that real  improvements are made in that area of work.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Givan</strong>:  Today, the director general of the Prison Service said that the vision of the  Prison Service would be based on getting back to basics, and I am sure that the  Minister would agree that there is nothing as basic as ensuring that those who  are supposed to be in prison stay in prison. So that public confidence is not  continually undermined, incidents like this cannot happen again, and I am sure  that the Minister would agree also with that. Will the investigation also  examine the senior managers who are responsible for putting the systems in  place? Surely any system must have a triple-lock mechanism, whereby if a human  error is made &mdash; I am not saying that that happened in this instance &mdash; it is  detected and something like this does not happen again. Will the investigation  include senior management?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>:  When I made it clear that a senior prison governor, who is independent of the  Maghaberry arrangements, was appointed to investigate, it was with the  intention of ensuring that every conceivable line was followed through  properly. The Chairperson of the Committee for Justice highlighted the issue of  the number of locks that we may put into the system, and that is clearly valid.  However, we also need to ensure that the locks are applied properly and  correctly, and that errors are not made in the way that appears to have  happened on this occasion.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I will not pre-empt the outcome of the investigation  further. I will inform the House and the Committee in particular of the outcome  of that investigation when it is achieved.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: That concludes this item of business. I ask the Members to take  their ease for a few moments.</p>

<p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="11"></a>Ministerial Statement</p>
<p class="H4StageHeading">Belfast  Health and Social Care Trust</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Speaker has received notice from the Minister of Health,  Social Services and Public Safety that he wishes to make a statement to the  House.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots (The  Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety)</strong>: With your  permission, Mr Deputy Speaker, I wish to make a statement about the outcome of  the statutory inquiry into the oral medicine service at the Royal Victoria  Hospital&rsquo;s dental hospital and two issues concerning the Belfast Health and  Social Care Trust, namely the concerns about the pay awards for some directors  of the Belfast Trust and the contractual arrangements for the security of the  Belvoir Park site.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">On 7 February 2011, the previous Health Minister announced  in the Assembly that an independent inquiry would be established on matters  concerning the Belfast Trust and the recall of a number of patients who had  received treatment at the regional oral medicine service based at the Belfast dental hospital.  On Friday 24 June, I received a dental inquiry report. I want to take the  opportunity to thank Brian Fee QC and his team for the comprehensive report  that they provided to me. By way of a summary for MLA colleagues and the  public, the inquiry&rsquo;s terms of reference were, broadly, to evaluate the quality  of care provided to all those patients who were recalled for review; to  evaluate the effectiveness of communications between and within the Royal  dental hospital, health and social care organisations, the Department, patients  and the general public; and to make recommendations for improvements to quality  and communications.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">At the outset, I want to highlight to the public that the  trust has assured me that it is managing services at the dental hospital to  ensure patient safety and the best possible quality of services. The  Department, the Health and Social Care Board (HSCB) as commissioner and the  trust are acting together to ensure that that is secured and maintained. I hope  that the Assembly will understand that it is essential that we ensure that  nothing is said here that prejudges the proper process of investigations by the  trust and/or by regulators. I ask Members to hold back from asking any  questions that address issues about any individual concerned. I hope that you  will agree, Mr Deputy Speaker, that it will be in order if I refrain from  answering any such questions. The report makes 45 recommendations. I will give  them all full and detailed consideration. Those recommendations include some  that relate to the Belfast Trust, some relating to the entire health and social  care service, as well as issues to be addressed by my Department.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Patient safety is my first priority. The report&rsquo;s findings  show that patients have been let down. There were serious deficiencies in the  quality of care that was provided to patients, which may have impacted  adversely on the health of some. I want to apologise to people who were  affected for the serious failings in the care that they received through the  oral medicine services that were provided by the dental hospital and the  Belfast Trust. In some cases, there have been failures, material delays and  difficulties in accessing appropriate treatment. I recognise that not only has  that impacted adversely on timely access to treatment for individuals, but it  has caused considerable anxiety and distress to patients and their families. I  am truly concerned for those patients and their families. The system has let  them down. I intend to do all that I can to ensure that those failings are  rectified.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Before I go into the detail of the report, I want to make a  general comment to reassure the public. The health and social care service  treats hundreds of thousands of patients every year, and, in the vast majority  of cases, to a very high standard. However, we know that sometimes &mdash;  thankfully, only in a small proportion of cases &mdash; things go wrong. When an  incident such as that happens, the first priority has to be the patient  involved. Then, the service needs to look at what happened, why it happened,  and how a further incident can be prevented from happening again. It is only by  adopting such an approach and by sharing learning that a safer service can be  achieved and we can maintain the trust and confidence of the public, who place  their care in our hands.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The report&rsquo;s findings are serious and make sober reading.  As my predecessor explained to the Assembly last February, in November 2009,  the Belfast Health and Social Care Trust became aware that six people who had  been referred for surgery following a diagnosis of oral cancer could  potentially have been referred at an earlier stage of their illness. In  December 2009, the Belfast Trust took action to appoint a case investigator and  to review and carry out a look-back exercise into the issue; a complex process,  which involved looking at some 3,000 clinical records and, in all, took nearly  11 months to complete. The inquiry has confirmed that the vast majority of the  3,000 patients who were considered had been appropriately managed and treated.  The issue that emerged in February 2011 was that 18 people were identified for  whom major concerns existed about their quality of care. Following further  investigations, it was confirmed that there were, in fact, major concerns in  respect of 22 people.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">All those people were being actively managed by specialists  in the Health Service at the time that their concerns were identified. Fifteen  cancer patients were identified, four of whom died: three from oral cancer and  one from other causes. I repeat my predecessor&rsquo;s expression of sympathy to the  families of those patients on the loss of their loved ones.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I want to give the Assembly a summary of some of the most  important aspects of the inquiry&rsquo;s findings. The inquiry found that there was  some cause for concern about the oral medicine service two to three years  before the problem was reported in December 2009. The inquiry also concluded  that, in December 2009, the trust should have reported a serious adverse incident  (SAI) as required under departmental guidance when a look-back review is  initiated. The Department and the trust fully accept that an SAI should have  been reported earlier than was the case. The arrangements for the reporting of  an SAI were revised from May 2010, when the HSCB took on additional  responsibilities. Thus, several opportunities were missed that might have drawn  higher-level attention to the issue. However, the trust did not explain what it  was doing or provide evidence of the full range of concerns to the Department,  the HSCB or the Public Health Authority (PHA) at any stage between December  2009 and December 2010.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">On 25 February 2010, the trust received the report of the  case investigator, which recommended more direct action to address concerns for  patient safety. However, at a meeting attended by the case investigator, the  trust decided on 27 April 2010 not to act on that because it was satisfied that  the actions that it was taking included protection of patient safety. The  inquiry said that the additional information from the case investigator&rsquo;s  report ought to have removed any doubt that the trust might have had about  whether to report the matter as an SAI, as it clearly met the relevant  criteria. In particular, the inquiry points out that the trust&rsquo;s actions did  not protect patients whose records were missing or grossly incomplete. In fact,  there was a lack of any formal communication with HSCB, the Department of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety (DHSSPS) and PHA at that stage on the  issues relating to services in the trust. The inquiry&rsquo;s view is that it is  almost certain that the reporting of an SAI would have produced an insistence  that the risk to patients, including, for example, the risk posed by missing  records, would have been more urgently alleviated than was the case.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">As the look back progressed, the inquiry&rsquo;s view is that the  trust must have been aware between April and November 2010 that the disturbing  picture from the look back of major, intermediate and minor concerns in respect  of the impact on patients&rsquo; health was continuing to emerge and that the problem  of missing and incomplete records was significant. The report also says that it  would be grossly unfair to fail to acknowledge that the trust communicated  fully with the regulatory bodies, namely the General Medical Council (GMC) and  the General Dentistry Council (GDC).</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">On 4 November 2010, the draft look-back report was received  by the trust, and it received the final report on 1 December 2010. The trust  decided that a call back of certain patients should be undertaken as a  precaution in view of the report&rsquo;s findings. On receipt of the report, the  trust contacted the DHSSPS, the HSCB and the PHA in late November/early  December 2010. The HSCB immediately queried whether an SAI report should be  made. Eventually, the matter was reported as an SAI on 7 February 2011.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The inquiry also finds that there was a significant problem  with the keeping of patient records in the oral medicine department of the  dental hospital. The specialists undertaking the look-back case review between  December 2009 and November 2010 encountered serious difficulties due to the  lack of availability of patients&rsquo; records when they required them. The report&rsquo;s  statistics indicate an extremely serious deficiency in record management that  could have had a serious adverse impact on the quality of patient care.</p>
<p class="TimePeriod">3.45 pm</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Given the volume and geographical spread of patients with  disease requiring specialist oral medicine input, the inquiry suggests that  there was a potential risk of patient care being compromised when relying on  one practitioner to provide the service in such circumstances. The problem of  excessive workloads was exacerbated by the lack of an adequate secretarial and  administrative support system.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The trust acted to address the interests of the patients  whose case notes suggested major concerns in the look-back exercise. Fifteen of  the 22 cases concerned the treatment of oral cancer and related conditions, and  it is known that four of those 15 people have died, possibly as a consequence  of oral cancer. The extent of the impact that the delay in diagnosis or referral  has had on the outcome for those patients, or for the other patients with  malignant disease associated with the mouth, is unknown at this stage.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The inquiry expresses concern at the limited extent of open  communication with these patients. Best practice discourages paternalism in  patient-provider interactions. Patients who are not fully informed are at  greater risk of non-compliance and the overlooking or ignoring of symptoms that  may need to be addressed. The inquiry report states that the relationship of  trust between patient and provider should not be compromised by keeping  information from patients, however well meaning the reasoning.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I understand from the trust that the other seven patients  in the major concern groups have not been diagnosed as having oral cancer. Some  of those seven had undergone multiple X-rays of the salivary ducts and glands,  which involves exposure to radiation. It is not known whether there has been  any adverse impact on the health of any patient due to the excessive or unnecessary  use of such X-rays. The matter is being further reviewed.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The trust has also told the Department that, of the group  of patients about whom the look-back exercise found intermediate concerns, none  of those 117 patients has developed oral cancer by reason of delay in diagnosis  or referral. It is not known whether there has been any other adverse impact on  their health, whether physical or psychological.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">In summary, the inquiry concluded that there were serious  deficiencies in the quality of care provided by the oral medicine department of  the dental hospital and the Belfast Health and Social Care Trust to the  patients recalled for review. That may have impacted adversely on the health of  some of them to a significant degree, and it certainly had the potential to do  so. The inquiry also found that there was a failure by the trust to communicate  fully, effectively and promptly with the other Health and Social Care (HSC)  bodies in an appropriate manner and that there was a failure by DHSSPS to  proactively seek further communication from the trust. The primary  responsibility for the failure to provide a proper formal report rests with the  trust.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The inquiry states that DHSSPS ought to have been more  proactive, given the information that was available to it. My officials have  told me that they accept that criticism. The trust also accepts that  significant lessons about communications have been learned from this incident.  Those failures in communication contributed to the risk of harm to the patients  concerned, as they prevented wider knowledge of the problems, as well as  allocations of appropriate expertise and resources to ensure that they were  addressed as quickly and effectively as possible.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I do not doubt that a number of individuals dealing with  this complex situation believed that they were doing the right thing during  this time. The inquiry has, however, found that there were serious failings in  the care provided, as well as failings in communication, timeliness and,  ultimately, the effectiveness of the action taken. Hence, I expect to see  change, and the public deserve to see change.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">First and foremost, the safety of care that we provide and  the interests of the patient must be first and far above all other  considerations. I have full confidence that this is the case throughout the HSC  and that the Belfast Trust was and is fully committed to that ethos. However,  that point cannot be repeated and re-emphasised too often.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, the confidence of the public in that care is  dependent on a culture of openness and transparency. I want to see the culture  of all trusts, including all parts of the HSC and my Department, to be one of  openness and transparency. That means accepting and embracing accountability,  which should be fundamental to any public service. The public expects this, and  I, as Minister, require it. I want to recognise and reinforce the very welcome  commitment of the leadership team in the Belfast Trust to this approach.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Given the increasing complexity of healthcare, no service  can be without risk, but I do expect all organisations to identify and manage  those risks. In the right culture, there will be proper and timely reporting of  concerns and an active approach to the management of those concerns.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Key issues for me are encouraging the reporting and  appropriate investigation and management of concerns; the recording and  management of adverse incidents and their inter-relationship with the  investigation into concerns regarding the professional practice of individuals;  the communication of major concerns and risks to the HSC board and the  Department and the follow-up of those concerns; and the effective management of  professional performance, appraisal and supervision.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I want to be assured that the governance and communications  arrangements in the Belfast Trust are robust. There have been failings in this  regard, and I will expect the trust&rsquo;s chief executive to address those. I also  require the permanent secretary to assure me that the arrangements for  governance and communication between the Department and all parts of the HSC  are robust and effective and provide a clear basis for accountability.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">To ensure effective management of the full range of HSC  services, I require of my Department, and all the arm&rsquo;s-length bodies that it  oversees, three vital means of control. First, that the Department sets  standards that set out clearly and fairly what is expected; secondly, that all  organisations have systems of clinical and social care governance that are in  line with best practice across the world; and, thirdly, that the right people  are in place to apply these principles, and are committed to applying them  consistently and rigorously to make this work.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">That is what the public expects, and that is what I  require. I also wish to acknowledge the many thousands of people who work  diligently every day on that basis in the Belfast Trust, and in the wider  Health Service.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I believe that the public have good grounds for confidence  in the services provided by the Belfast Trust and more widely because these  principles are in place. To build on them, I want to see more robust  accountability arrangements, where trusts readily communicate major issues of  concern to enable those to be addressed in a proportionate but comprehensive  manner.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">It needs to be absolutely clear that clinical and social  care governance is a statutory responsibility and, as in all other aspects of  governance, is a matter for which chief executives in the HSC are directly  accountable to the permanent secretary, who is also chief executive of the HSC.  That needs to be clearly understood and fully reflected in the accountability  arrangements. I will be asking for regular reports from the Department to give  me assurance that HSC bodies are operating effective systems for clinical and  social care governance and complying with the Department&rsquo;s guidance.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">My Department also needs to learn lessons and provide  appropriate leadership. I expect to see leadership in the co-ordination of an  action plan detailing how all the recommendations arising from the inquiry will  be addressed. I expect this to be submitted to me no later than August 2011,  with quarterly reports thereafter. Key elements of the action plan will include  further work on serious adverse incident reporting and early alert  arrangements, with the involvement of the HSC board, the PHA and, where  appropriate, the Department to ensure that there is a proactive approach to  timely and appropriate action in the interests of patient safety and the  reduction of harm.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I will very shortly place the executive summary of the  report, including all 45 recommendations, in the Assembly Library. The full  report includes some issues that may be subject to regulatory processes that  are not complete. Therefore, I cannot publish the report in full at this stage.  The 45 recommendations range across issues relating to the care for, and  communication with, the patients affected; the management of the oral medicine  service; communication within the trust and across the HSC; procedures for  reporting and escalation of adverse incidents; and aspects of personnel  management and administration.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I am very grateful to the inquiry team for all it has done  to help to point to the lessons to be learned from this case. I am not in a  position to provide a considered response, but I want to assure the Assembly  that none of the recommendations will be ignored. On the contrary, I will  require officials to work through the implications fully and carefully in  developing an action plan.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I have also asked my officials to work with members of the  inquiry team on the production of the action plan to ensure that it is fully  informed by the team&rsquo;s thinking and that there is appropriate consideration of  the practical implications of the recommendations for the health and social  care sector. I want to be sure that the action plan is effective in applying  the lessons learned from the way the issue was handled and that there is no  risk of key insights from the inquiry team being lost.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I will share the full action plan with the Health Committee  as soon as possible after the summer recess and prior to publication, as I want  to ensure that our next steps command the confidence of the Assembly and the  public. I also intend to report back to the Assembly and the Health Committee  on progress towards full implementation of the action plan in due course.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I now want to turn to other issues pertaining to the  Belfast Trust. These are in no way related to the issues at the dental  hospital, but I want to include them because they are likely to attract  comment, and I wish to hold to the principle that I answer to the Assembly.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I need to draw attention to an irregularity in the pay  arrangements for some directors in the Belfast Trust. I regard any breach of  control as a serious issue, but I recognise that, in this case, the trust was  acting in a way that reduced overall management costs. In 2009, additional  payments were made to five directors in the Belfast Trust following a  redistribution of duties across the senior team. There was a reduction in the  overall number of senior posts, and the duties previously held by some  directors who had left the trust were redistributed to existing directors.  Those posts carry enormous responsibility by any standard. Therefore, to  remunerate individuals, the trust awarded additional payments in the region of  5% to 10% of the existing salary.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">However, the senior executive pay scheme does not have the  facility routinely to make additional financial awards. As there was, and is,  no basis on which those allowances could be paid, the Comptroller and Auditor  General has limited his regulatory opinion on the Belfast Trust&rsquo;s 2010-11  accounts, which have just been laid before the Assembly, in respect of some  &pound;26,000 of irregular expenditure.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Members will recall that, following Public Accounts  Committee (PAC) criticism in 2001, DHSSPS was, and is, required to exercise  strict control over senior pay in the health and social care sector. I remain  committed to maintaining that control. In mitigation of the breach, overall savings  were secured at the Belfast Trust through a net reduction of two posts at  director level.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">My Department became aware of the additional payments only  in September 2010, and immediate action was taken. An internal investigation  was carried out in the Department and in the Belfast Trust. The Department has  subsequently strengthened its internal controls to ensure that health and  social care organisations follow the necessary process when jobs change  significantly.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">It is essential that there is fair treatment for all, and  that is undermined when action is taken without approval. The necessary  approvals have been sought from the Department of Finance and Personnel and put  in place to permit the continued payment of those additional allowances, as  there is no basis in law on which they can be withdrawn. I do not question the  good faith of the individuals concerned or the fact that they have taken on  additional and onerous duties, but I do not find it satisfactory that  unapproved increases have to continue to be paid. However, I understand that  there is no alternative.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">To minimise the risk of any similar situation arising  again, my permanent secretary wrote to the chairs of all organisations to  remind them of their governance responsibilities, particularly the controls  over senior pay and the standards expected in public life.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">My final point is to advise that it has come to my  attention that there may be potential material shortcomings in the procurement  of a contract for security services at the Belvoir Park   Hospital. To seek  assurances that no other arrangements are in place for which appropriate  processes were not followed, my permanent secretary discussed the matter with  the chief executive of the trust and subsequently wrote to him asking for a  formal explanation of the circumstances surrounding that procurement and any  associated shortcomings<span class="SectionMarker"><span style="font-size:14.0pt; "> </span></span></p>
<p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">He has also written to all other arm&rsquo;s-length  bodies funded by the Department to seek similar assurances.</p>
<p class="TimePeriod">4.00 pm</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Any failure to comply with the requirements of appropriate  practice for procurement and/or contract management is a serious breach of  control. I need to be sure that all those who carry responsibility for managing  public money comply in full with relevant guidance on competitive procurement  and all relevant procurement legislation in services such as security and  maintain regular scrutiny of routine payments so that any departures from the  required practice are identified and corrected quickly. That is essential so  that assurance can be provided to the Assembly that public money is being used  properly to provide value for money. For that reason, I have asked my officials  to carry out a review of the arrangements for the control of procurement  expenditure between and within my Department and its arm&rsquo;s-length bodies. The  terms of reference for that review are being drafted, and the review will take  place in the coming weeks.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I hope it has been helpful to the Assembly to have a clear  and open presentation of the issues. Each involves some cause for concern, and  I want to emphasise my commitment that such issues will be addressed fairly,  openly and proportionately and that I will give top priority to actions that  protect and enhance the safety and quality of services to the public. One  common feature of the three issues is the need to ensure strong and effective  accountability. I will require that all my Department&rsquo;s arm&rsquo;s-length bodies  provide clear and timely assurance to the Department, which acts on my behalf  and under my authority on all aspects of governance. Within that framework, top  priority must be given to the quality of service and patient safety.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I believe that the vast majority of staff in the Belfast  Trust and the wider HSC sector are wholeheartedly committed to those principles  and to providing the best possible care. I am also grateful for the diligent  public service that is displayed throughout the management of the HSC sector, and  I reaffirm my commitment that the Department will act to prevent recurrence of  the lapses from acceptable standards that I have had to report today. I thank  the Assembly for its attention.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew  (The Chairperson of the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public  Safety)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I know that the  Chairperson &mdash; the Cathaoirleach &mdash; normally gets a bit of latitude in these  instances. Given the length of the statement and the fact that there are three  issues, which are all important, I would be grateful if you would extend that  latitude on this occasion.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Minister for his lengthy statement on the three  issues. I want to break them down and ask questions on the dental inquiry in  the first instance. The Minister has explained that the inquiry report cannot  be printed in full yet because it may be subject to regulatory processes. That  invites the question &ldquo;Was the Department not aware of those regulatory  processes before the report was commissioned?&rdquo;. How much did it cost to  undertake the report? Given that the Minister has said that he is keen on full  transparency and accountability, it is unfortunate that the report cannot be  printed in full at this time. I am sure, given the seniority of Brian Fee QC and  his team, that it would not have come cheap. It is a bit of a concern that it  cannot yet be printed.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The Minister informed the House that the report contained  45 recommendations and contained criticisms of the Belfast Trust, the HSC  sector and the Department. I felt, having read the statement and listened to  the Minister today, that the issues to do with the Department were actually  quite light. I would like to tease out the criticisms of and the difficulties  in the Department. I think that he has been comprehensive about the others, but  the same detail is not given for the Department. How many of the 45  recommendations relate to each of the three bodies?</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Although I fully accept and welcome the fact that the  report states that the inquiry clearly found that there were serious failings  in the care provided, in communication and in the timeliness and, ultimately,  the effectiveness of the action taken, that is not what we as an Assembly want  to see, and it is good that the Minister is addressing that. However, judging  by the language used, the inquiry concluded that there were serious  deficiencies in the quality of care. It goes on to state that those  deficiencies may have impacted adversely on the health of some patients to a  significant degree and certainly had the potential to do so. Again, however, it  is light on the details. If people died as a result of not getting a diagnosis  early enough, that is extremely serious. If the potential was there, that is  serious. We need to separate out those issues, all of which need to be taken in  at the right level.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I also welcome the Minister&rsquo;s assertion of the need for a  culture of openness, transparency and accountability, but we have not heard an  awful lot from him about his Department&rsquo;s role in addressing the three issues  that he raised today. Ultimately, as Minister, he has overall responsibility.  Is he committed to realising that the buck stops with him?</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I will move on quickly to the other two issues. This is the  first time that the issues surrounding security services at Belvoir Park   Hospital have been  discussed in the House. Given that, I expect that there may be an element of  disappointment that the Minister did not refer to the fact that patients&rsquo;  records were left behind and that those urban guerrillas or whatever they are  called broke into the hospital site and that there was no mention of the fact  that those patient records were photographed and then offered for sale on the  internet. There has been no apology to the families who have been affected by  those events. It would have been appropriate to include that along with the  explanation of the procurement arrangements.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member must bring her remarks to a close.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>:  OK. The Minister talked about the issue surrounding irregularities in senior  pay, but he did not mention what savings would be made. That detail is not  there either.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  There is a range of issues, and I will try to respond to them as quickly as  possible. It is our intention to print the report at the earliest opportunity,  but, given that inquiries are ongoing, it would be inappropriate to do so in  case the report would have an adverse impact on other actions that are being  carried out. The cost of the report has not yet been finalised, because it was  completed only last week. We will make that available in due course.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I will move on to the departmental issues that were  identified. The report laid considerably greater emphasis on the trust. The  department was criticised for taking insufficient action to pursue questions  about the progress of the review. A large number of recommendations were made  that affect the whole service and were, therefore, matters for the Department,  affecting in particular the complex area of medicine. It is not possible to  identify exactly the effect of late diagnoses on the patients concerned, but we  want to make it absolutely clear that we have identified that an issue exists,  that we want to ensure that it does not arise again and that these are the  actions that we are taking. There is no evidence that anyone has died as a  result of a late diagnosis, but, nonetheless, we always emphasise that it is  good to get early diagnoses in cancer treatments.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Where does responsibility lie? It lies right here. That is  why I am here: to explain to Members, as public representatives, what happened;  to determine whether the service provided has fallen down; and to outline the  actions that we have put in place to ensure that it does not happen again. I  have to lay it clearly on the line: trust chief executives who step over the  line in this respect again will not be treated with kid gloves. The management  of the Belfast Trust changed late last year, and many of the issues at hand do  not apply to the current chief executive. However, I want to make it abundantly  clear that the Department will not tolerate any failure by chief executives to  operate with openness and transparency. Issues that are identified by the  trust&rsquo;s senior management must be brought to the Department, after which it is  up to the Department to inform me and, therefore, Assembly Members.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">On the subject of the Belvoir Park   Hospital site, when I  attended the Committee a number of weeks ago, I made it clear that it was  unacceptable that patients&rsquo; records were used in the way in which they were  used. The main responsibility for that lies with the people who benefited  personally from going through and making public other people&rsquo;s records. Those  people should be identified as the main culprits, because they stole people&rsquo;s  information. The Department and the trust had a responsibility to protect that  information, and that did not happen, so I do not shy away from reiterating the  apology that I made to the Committee.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">On the subject of pay, two senior directors stepping down  from the Belfast Health and Social Care Trust would have saved in the region of  &pound;200,000. Therefore, the additional payment of some &pound;26,000 was a net saving to  the trust. However, all the other trusts also made net savings, and all the  other trusts applied through the proper system for pay rises for senior  directors and were rejected. The trust in question did not play by the rules  and was rewarded for it. That is unacceptable.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>: I  welcome the Minister&rsquo;s openness and transparency. The school of dentistry issue  was one in a series of revelations that plagued the Health Service from  Christmas to Easter this year. As the then Chairperson of the Health Committee,  I remember regularly having to bring in officials from various trusts and the  board to answer questions on the latest revelation. Therefore, I strongly  welcome the fact that the Minister has decided, on this occasion, to pre-empt  media revelations by coming before the House to tell us exactly how it is and  what he is going to do about it. Will he assure the House that, should other  issues arise that he believes could lead to public concern, he will continue  this practice of coming before the House to tell us how it is &mdash; warts and all &mdash;  and to outline what he intends to do so that there will be no further ambushes  on Committees or Members?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  Openness and transparency in public life is important, and the more we engage  in an open and transparent way, the more confidence the public will have in the  House, the Executive and the governance of this country. Therefore, it is my desire  to be open and transparent with the public on all occasions relating to such  matters.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I indicated to my permanent secretary &mdash; this was relayed to  the Belfast Health and Social Care Trust &mdash; that, if there are any other  carcasses in the cupboard, we had better know about them pretty soon. We want  to ensure that, if there is anything else that has not lived up to the standard  of practice that we would expect to see, we find out about it and make it known  to the public. More importantly, no further engagement in such practices should  happen, and the message must get through to trusts that, as custodians of  public money, they provide something of the highest importance to individuals &mdash;  their healthcare &mdash; and it is imperative that they do that in a way that abides  by the standards set down by the House and the Executive.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement, and I associate myself and my party with  the Minister&rsquo;s expression of sympathy to the families of those affected. The  issues outlined in the statement are very serious.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Does the Minister agree that the thread that seems to link  all three incidents &mdash; the problem at the school of dentistry; not following the  pay guidance; and, indeed, not following guidance on securing the Belvoir Park  site &mdash; is the fact that, although we had processes to deal with them, by not  communicating to the Department that there was a problem, the trusts seemed to  ignore those processes?</p>
<p class="TimePeriod">4.15 pm</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: I  agree fully with the Member. Proper considerations have been put in place for  trusts to abide by, and, in that instance, the Belfast Trust did not abide by  them. No trust is an independent island that can carry out and engage in its  own activities and ignore the codes of practice that have been put in place for  it to observe. I have given early warning that, if this happens in the future,  it will be a very significant issue that I will regard as a disciplinary  matter. Each accounting officer of each trust should take cognisance of that.  It would not be right for the House and me, as the Minister who is responsible  to the House, to ignore that activity and to allow it to continue.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  You could hardly imagine a more serious statement, with three serious omissions  and errors in a single trust being reported to the House. I am sure that many  of us are thinking of this question right now: has any clinician or official at  trust or departmental level been referred for disciplinary action? If so, what  action has been taken against those who have let themselves, their employers  and this region down so badly?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: In  my statement I indicated that I would not get into the issue of individuals.  Other inquiries are going on. The GMC and GDC have responsibilities for  deciding who acts as clinicians. That decision is not in my hands; it is in the  hands of the expert body that regulates that activity.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  It is a truly horrendous statement that the Minister has been forced to make  this afternoon. I am sure that we are all shocked and aghast at the outcome. My  thoughts are with those who have suffered as a result of the total and absolute  negligence. My query is along the lines of Conall McDevitt&rsquo;s: are the people  who were responsible for the events that the Minister outlined still in post?  Could it happen again? The Minister referred to the current chief executive,  who was not in post at the time. However, there must have been a chief  executive in post at the time with overall responsibility for all of that  horrendous stuff. Is nobody accountable? The Minister said that the buck stops  with him &mdash;</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>:  Question, please.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  &mdash; of course, we know that. Are the people who were responsible for that  horrendous litany of failures still in post?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  The previous chief executive has retired, so that individual is clearly not in  post. On the clinical side, I indicated at the outset that that is a matter for  the GDC and GMC to determine. Once that determination is concluded, decisions  can be taken arising from that.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I should correct the Member, who said that I was forced to  make the statement. I received the information, and I was not particularly  pleased about it, but I certainly was not forced to make the statement. I  wanted to make the statement and to make the House aware of the issues of which  I was aware because it is a matter of public confidence. If we wish to restore  public confidence, it has to be done in an open and transparent way. Therefore,  it was imperative that I made the statement, but I certainly was not forced to.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms P Bradley</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his statement. On the issue of senior executive pay, I  welcome the fact that action has been taken to reduce the risk of this  happening again. Will the Minister clarify whether it was a serious breach of  the trust&rsquo;s corporate governance responsibilities?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: It  was. People who were engaged in the issue knew that they were in breach or that  they were not doing their job properly because some people who received  additional pay had responsibility for corporate governance in the trust. That  is a very serious issue. They were the beneficiaries of the money, but they  knew full well that they were not entitled to go ahead and award it. I have a  major issue with the breakdown between the Department and the trust in this  instance. It is an intolerable situation and cannot be permitted to happen  again.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his  statement. In relation to communication, it is my understanding that problems  relating to dental issues were first reported in December 2009. Will the Minister  detail what action the Department took to address the problem between December  2009 and February 2011?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  The issue went on for a period of time, and, when the Department became aware  of it, we impressed on the trust the need to go back and check all records.  That process took 11 months and identified over 100 issues. At that point,  patients were recalled, 40 of whom had biopsies. From a trawl of 3,000 records,  we identified 18 breaches. After further investigation, that went up to 22  serious breaches, 15 of which were identified as oral cancer. Another seven  cases related to oral problems, but they were non-cancerous. Therefore, work  was done to identify people who had the potential for a late diagnosis. Those  people were recalled and went through the treatment process. The people who  were recalled appear to be satisfied with the standard of the subsequent work,  which was done in a very professional way.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  I also welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement and his willingness to come before the  House in relation to his portfolio. Constituents have complained about the time  that it takes for treatment at the dental hospital. Is the Minister aware of  whether the dental hospital or the school of dentistry require additional  funding? In that same vein, will he give an assessment of the long-term future  of the school of dentistry?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  The school of dentistry receives its funding from the Belfast Trust, which we  fund. The report states that the dental school is in a strong financial  position, with income to the university and the trust being sufficient to meet  the needs of a thriving institution. My Department has made additional funds  available to refurbish clinical areas, and the university is investing further  capital in training facilities. The university is also actively recruiting more  staff to ensure that teaching is adequate. Therefore, funding is in place for  the good management of the hospital to ensure that patients receive a good  service and that students who are training to be dentists receive good  training. It is a matter for the management of the facility, whether through  Queen&rsquo;s University for the training of dentists or the Belfast Trust on the  health side, to ensure that there is good practice throughout the facility.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Byrne</strong>: I declare  an interest, and I recognise the Minister&rsquo;s sincerity and the way in which he  has handled the issue, particularly the dental school.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">First, what has been done to build morale again and to  reassure good, professional staff in the dental school that the problem will be  fixed? Secondly, can students at the dental school be reassured that their job  prospects are not being inhibited? Lastly, will potential patients be told that  the service is reliable and totally professional and will not again lead to the  problems that we have just heard about?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  The Member raised three issues, starting with morale. If there is a problem  that people are talking about in the backwoods, it is far better that that  problem is made public and identified and the solutions identified and acted  upon. If we want to have confidence, we need to clear the carcasses out of the  cupboard and to get rid of the material that has been holding the facility  back. Let us move forward in a way in which the public can have confidence, and,  if the public have confidence in the service, it will inevitably raise the  morale of the people in that facility. There are numerous people in the Health  Service and in the school of dentistry who are carrying out their work and  services to the best of their ability in a very professional and dedicated way.  Many people go beyond the call of duty. I have already spoken to my colleague  in DEL,  Stephen Farry, and indicated to him that it is imperative that there is full  confidence in the dental school. As a result, he and I will meet, and we will  seek that the vice chancellor of Queen&rsquo;s University and the chief executive of  the Belfast Trust attend that meeting to ensure that, if there are outstanding  issues on the training side of that facility, we deal with them and ensure that  people are proud to be associated with that training institution and have a  strong desire to be educated there.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The public should get quality treatment at the Royal School  of Dentistry. They should have no concerns that the treatment that they receive  at that unit at the facility will be defective in any way, shape or form. They  can also be confident that, if they are dissatisfied with the treatment that  they receive and make that known through the complaints procedure, that will be  treated seriously. We will respond if someone comes forward with genuine  problems or grievances as a result of treatment that has been received or not  received.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Lewis</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his statement on the very serious matter of the dental  inquiry. What harm was caused to patients, and what feedback, if any, has been  received from patients or their families on the harm that was caused to them,  including, for example, psychological effects that were experienced as a  result?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: We  have not identified that harm has been caused to patients as a result of this.  It is clear that we had concerns about how 22 people were diagnosed, and, as a  result of looking into that, it transpired that 15 of them had cancer.  Subsequently, four have died of cancer. Three of those deaths related to oral  cancer, and one related to another cancer. It is important that people are  diagnosed in a timely way and that they can have full confidence in the  services that are provided. I believe that that is the current situation at the  school of dentistry, and we will seek to ensure that that continues to be the  case.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  I join other Members in thanking the Minister for his statement. There are  three areas to this, and, given that much of the concentration has been on two  of them, I will focus on the last one. Reference has been made to the  procurement of security services at Belvoir   Park Hospital.  Will the Minister indicate how much that contract was worth originally and how  it was awarded? Were there shortcomings in that process?<span class="SectionMarker"><span style="font-size:14.0pt; "> </span></span></p>
<p class="TimePeriod">4.30 pm</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  The contract was worth &pound;190,000 per annum and has been paid out for five years  now. So, &pound;950,000 has been paid out. One of the more positive things about this  is that that figure appears to be at the lower end of costs associated with  services provided by the security industry. The issue is that people did not  have an opportunity to bid for the contract. We did not go through the normal  procurement processes, and it simply is not good enough that a contract through  which a supplier receives close to &pound;1 million did not go through the proper  processes and channels. It broke EU rules, and it broke our own procurement  rules. That is a wholly unsatisfactory situation. We are trying to ascertain exactly  how the contract came about, but it appears not to have gone through the normal  processes or channels and may have been carried out by way of conversations  with people who knew other people in the security industry.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D McIlveen</strong>:  I, too, pay tribute to the Minister for his statement. It is truly refreshing  to see a Health Minister who operates his office with transparency. Has there  been a loss to the public purse as a result of the issues at Belvoir Park?  If so, what action do you plan to take?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: I  do not think that there has been a loss as a result of the non-procurement of  the security services because we did not pay excessively for the security  services provided. The loss was, perhaps, in public confidence, given that  people&rsquo;s information subsequently appeared for sale on internet sites.  Therefore, there was a significant loss in that we lost the confidence of the  public. We also lost a significant amount of money by holding on to the  property when we had no purpose for it. The advice from Land and Property  Services was that we should go through a process of applying for planning  approval to maximise the value of the site. I observe that quite a number of  people went through the same process from 2005 to 2008, and they did not  receive their planning approval early enough. As a consequence, when they  received planning approval, the site was worth considerably less than it was  without planning approval.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I question why, during a period of very high property  prices, which people knew could not continue because prices were nine or 10  times the value of people&rsquo;s mortgages &mdash; that does not fit with any economist&rsquo;s  assessment of what is sustainable &mdash; we held on to a property that had been  identified in the Belfast metropolitan area plan as having 24 acres that were  suitable for development. Given its superb location in south Belfast, one would anticipate that that would  have brought tens of millions of pounds into the Department for reinvestment.  We are now sitting with a property of a considerably lesser value. That is the  real loss; it is not in the procurement of services. Nonetheless, if we are to  procure services to the value of almost &pound;1 million, that needs to be done in a  proper and correct way, and people need to have the opportunity to bid for the  contract.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his  statement. Is it the case that when the Belfast Trust moved off the site  responsibility transferred to the Department? Also, will the review of the  arrangements for the control of procurement expenditure in the Department and  in arm&rsquo;s-length bodies not delay decisive action? Is a review really necessary  in a situation such as this?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  The Belfast Trust continues to have the responsibility of looking after that  site, and the Department grants it money to do so.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The Department has given an allowance to the Belfast Trust  to provide the security for that facility, to look after a degree of essential  maintenance, to pay the rates and so forth. Therefore, the Department pays for  that element.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">On the review of services, I could come in here and, within  weeks, start to change services. Presented with an approach of that nature, I  have no doubt that Members would jump up and down to indicate that this and  that should not be happening in their constituency. I want a very short, sharp  review that will provide me with professional analyses of services provided on  the clinical and social services sides.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">If the Committee is recalled, I will be happy to give it a  full explanation, because I have to go to the Executive for approval for any  such review, and I have not been able to do that before the Assembly goes into  summer recess. However, I am happy to respond to the Committee and to make a  written statement to the Speaker, which will then be passed on to all Members,  so that I keep people fully informed of my intentions as the Minister  responsible for health and also as a Minister responsible to the House.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Robinson</strong>:  How long has that firm been handling security at Belvoir Park   Hospital? He may have  already answered this question, but why has the site not been sold by now?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  The security company has looked after that site for five years. The site has  not been sold because Land and Property Services guidance was followed that  stated that planning permission should be obtained before going to the open  market. That led to the delay, and it demonstrates the unacceptability of where  we are now in Northern    Ireland with the planning system and  everything else. That is why, when I held a previous position, I wanted to  fundamentally change planning. I hope that, through the Planning Act 2011 and  other work that we carried out, there will be a change to a much more  responsive planning system, one that will meet the needs of the private and  public sectors in Northern    Ireland at the same time as taking account  of local residents&rsquo; views.</p>
<p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="12"></a>Committee Business</p>
<p class="H4StageHeading">Caesarean Sections</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I advise Members that the Speaker has been given notice that the  motion will not be moved today. However, as it is still on the Order Paper, it  will need to be dealt with formally.</p>
<p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The following motion stood in the Order Paper:</p>
<p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly calls on the Minister of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety to put in place measures to reduce the high rate of  Caesarean sections, given the risks to both mother and child, as well as the  cost to the Health Service. &mdash; <span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; ">[Ms  Gildernew (The Chairperson of the Committee for Health, Social Services and  Public Safety).]</span></span></p>
<p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Motion not moved.</p>
<p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Motion made:</p>
<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That the Assembly do now adjourn. &mdash; [Mr Deputy  Speaker.]</p>
<p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="13"></a>Adjournment</p>
<p class="H4StageHeading">Jobs and Benefits Project: Strabane</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The proposer of the Adjournment topic will have 15 minutes in  which to speak. The Minister will have 10 minutes to respond. All other Members  who are called to speak will have approximately eight minutes.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I had hoped that the Minister for  Employment and Learning would join us for the Adjournment debate. I am not sure  whether he has forwarded an explanation. It appears that the Minister for  Social Development may be stepping in for the Minister for Employment and  Learning. I thank him for doing that, because it is important to have  ministerial attendance at Adjournment debates. I thank Minister McCausland for  stepping in for Minister Farry on this occasion.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">At the outset, I apologise on behalf of my colleague  Michaela Boyle, who is unavoidably absent. I also point out that my colleague  Pat Doherty MP has lobbied strongly on the Adjournment topic for a number of  years. The research that I carried out for the debate reminded me of a number  of pertinent questions that Pat Doherty MP MLA asked on the issue, both in the  House and as questions for written answer.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">My reason for introducing this topic resulted partly from a  recent visit to the jobs and benefits office in Omagh &mdash; Omagh and Strabane  being the two principal towns in west Tyrone. I visited the jobs and benefits  office in Omagh, where I witnessed a really good joined-up benefit and  job-brokering service that keeps jobseekers in touch with the labour market. As  I understand it, that is precisely what the jobs and benefits project was  designed to achieve. To date, I understand that the project has been rolled out  across the North, with 27 offices operating as co-location. In towns such as  Omagh, that clearly benefits the jobseekers and people of the district.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I am alarmed by the fact that Strabane is one of eight  areas, including North Belfast, which is the Minister&rsquo;s constituency,  Cookstown, Bangor  and other towns, where the project has not been rolled out. The likes of  Strabane, Cookstown and North Belfast feature  regularly in a high position on the unemployment league table. So, I find it  hard to understand why those locations were not prioritised in the first  tranche, or at least at an earlier stage, of the project development.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I understand that the Department for Employment and  Learning (DEL) and the Department for Social Development (DSD) made a joint bid  for somewhere in the region of &pound;37&middot;3 million for capital investment under  Budget 2010. The bid was unsuccessful, and it left eight areas without that  type of provision.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I emphasised my visit to the jobs and benefits office in  Omagh, because best practice is obviously at work there. Therefore, why should  Strabane, Cookstown, North Belfast and other  locations &mdash; those eight places &mdash; not benefit similarly? We have been told that  the jobs and benefits project has been abandoned.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I want to drill down and get an explanation as to what  happed with Strabane. NIPSA has said that it understands that there were a  number of difficulties, ranging from car parking to the unavailability of  appropriate sites. I want to hear more about that, specifically where Strabane  is concerned. The jobs office and the benefits office are at two different  locations in the town. How hard did DEL  and DSD try? That is the crux of the question. Where was the political will?  Was it there, or was it absent?</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Typically, if Departments want to develop facilities in a  town, they ask the local government authority to search for land and property  so see whether there is suitable provision. Presumably there is a yes answer to  this question: was Strabane District Council properly, meaningfully and fully  consulted on possibilities in the town that could realise the proposal?  Strabane consistently has one of the highest unemployment rates. As of May  2011, it is my understanding that Derry&rsquo;s unemployment figure was 7&middot;5%, Belfast&rsquo;s was 6&middot;9% and  Strabane&rsquo;s was 6&middot;9%. The Strabane district has 1,756 claimants for a population  of more than 39,000.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The decision to shelve the project in Strabane has caused  great disappointment and consternation. I think that Minister Farry and  Minister McCausland need to take a fresh look at the situation. Placing  Strabane at the tail end of the roll-out of this project is illogical; it begs  many questions. You would think that the first place you would locate such a  project would be Strabane and that it would not feature low down in the  chronological priority.</p>
<p class="TimePeriod">4.45 pm</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Essentially, that is the case that I am presenting today. I  have a good understanding of the range of Department for Employment and  Learning provision in the jobs and benefits offices and the Social Security  Agency/DSD provision in the co-location offices. They work very well. The towns  that have been left out or left behind, not least the town of Strabane, for which I am making the case  today, deserve equality in the matter. I have asked a number of questions. I  would be very grateful if the Minister was able to address them.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Buchanan</strong>:  I welcome the opportunity to take part in the Adjournment debate today  regarding the closure of the jobs and benefits project in Strabane. I will be  keeping my comments fairly brief because I think that a lot of the areas have been  covered. It is disappointing that the Minister for Employment and Learning has  been unable to attend today, but we are grateful that we have the Minister for  Social Development here to answer some of our questions and address some of our  concerns surrounding the issue.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I believe that the bringing together of the Social Security  Agency and Department for Employment and Learning staff onto one site within  one purpose-designed building is the only effective way in which an efficient  and effective service can be delivered by the jobs and benefits staff. That is  to be commended. I also commend the Department on the 27 such offices that have  been delivered across Northern    Ireland. However, it is disappointing that  Strabane falls into the category of the eight remaining. Although I am not here  to cry poor mouth, I most certainly will continue to lobby for West Tyrone and  insist that it receives equality of treatment &mdash; a great term in the House &mdash; in  line with the other constituencies.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The office in Omagh has been used as an example of the  effectiveness of having two units co-located in one office. I can testify to  that, having been in that office with constituents and having seen exactly how  each unit works in tandem with the other. That is testimony to how this type of  thing works. We are here today to lobby for the project in Strabane, which was  on the schedule but has been set to the side, to be brought back on stream so  that we can get it delivered.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Many people who have been in employment all their lives now  find themselves unemployed because of the economic situation. Going to a jobs  and benefits office is a stigma for them; it is a place that they do not want  to go to. They are not used with going to those places; it is unfamiliar to  them. They would much rather be in a place of employment. It is a stigma for  them and that keeps them from going to it. To have a situation in which they  have to go to two offices, which are some distance apart, as is the case in  Strabane, adds to their frustration, and, perhaps, discourages them and turns  them away. That is why it is so important and essential that we seek to bring  this on stream.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I have a couple of questions. Has enough been done to find  a co-location site for the two bodies? I know that it is, at times, difficult  to find a site for this type of project, but I wonder whether enough work has  been done on the issue with the chief executive of Strabane District Council  and others in that area. What difficulties stood in the way? If there were  difficulties that meant that a site could not be found, what were they? Could  they be looked at again and overcome?</p>
<p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">What was it that pushed Strabane beyond the 27  other projects that have already been delivered? We commend the Department for  the 27 projects that have been delivered, but there are another eight that have  not, including Strabane. Perhaps that should be looked at again.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The case has been made for the jobs and benefits centre,  and there is merit in having it. Other places need that service too, but I am  lobbying for one in Strabane as soon as practicable. I ask the Minister to take  that on board, look at the issue again and see whether there is any way to  bring the project on stream with DSD and DEL  working in conjunction to see what can be done to bring forward this project  and ensure that it is delivered for the people of Strabane.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hussey</strong>:  I, too, thank the Minister for taking the time to be with us this afternoon. I  am sure that he had a different afternoon planned but, unfortunately, he had to  be here instead. I thank him for coming to listen to our concerns. When Mr  McElduff mentioned that he had visited the jobs and benefits office in Omagh, I  wondered whether he thought that he was not going to be re-elected to this  House. He clarified that he was there with constituents. Like Mr Buchanan, I  have visited the jobs and benefits office in Omagh, and I concur with Members&rsquo;  remarks so far. An excellent service is provided in Omagh, the county town of  Tyrone.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">We are here to talk about the wider issues in west Tyrone,  but specifically Strabane. I looked at the &lsquo;West Tyrone Area Plan 2019&rsquo;, and it  includes certain comments that you would look for if implementing a  best-practice policy in seeking a place to set up a project of this nature:</p>
<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Based on the Northern   Ireland Multiple Deprivation Scores, Strabane District  Council ranks as the most deprived District Council area on average in Northern Ireland&hellip;  Strabane has notably higher percentages of people who are unemployed or  permanently sick or disabled, and notably lower numbers of people who are  economically active and in full time employment, than the Northern Ireland  average&hellip; Strabane has a noticeably lower percentage of people working as  managers, senior officials and professional occupations, and a significantly  higher percentage working in skilled trade occupations and as process, plant and  machine operatives, than the Northern    Ireland average&hellip; Strabane has 12.32% more of  its population with no qualifications and a significantly lower percentage of  people with every level of qualification, than the Northern Ireland average.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">When I first saw the statement from DSD and DEL on the Strabane  office, I was very surprised. In fact, my initial comment was that it was  illogical; it did not make sense. The place where I would have immediately set  up an office of that nature was Strabane. When you look at the specific tasks  of the Department for Employment and Learning, you would expect to see it try  to provide some sort of support to move 20- to 30-year-olds forward. Anyone who  operated best practice should have looked at Strabane for the first office.  Strabane could have been a shining example to others.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">None of us seems to be able to understand why Strabane was  in the remaining eight and why it suddenly had the rug pulled. There have been  comments such as &ldquo;unavailability of sites&rdquo; and &ldquo;difficulty in parking&rdquo;. The  jobs and benefits office in Omagh does not have easy access to parking; you  have to walk quite a bit to get there. However, in these circumstances, people  would be prepared to walk quite a bit because of the service that that type of  office would provide.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Questions have been asked by Mr Buchanan and Mr McElduff,  and I do not intend to repeat them, but we need answers. It is quite clear that  we have a united voice from west Tyrone, and I am sure that Mr Byrne will join  that.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  The Member may not be aware of this, but it was his then party leader who  christened the West Tyrone six, &ldquo;Team West Tyrone&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hussey</strong>:  Come on, Tyrone; we&rsquo;re on our own. We intend to support Strabane. Strabane has  a history of being an unemployment black spot; we do not want it to maintain  that reputation. We, as representatives from West Tyrone, support such an  office being sited in Strabane, and we look to both Ministers to do their best  to reverse this decision.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Byrne</strong>: I  welcome the Minister for Social Development to the debate. I, too, am amazed at  central government&rsquo;s decision to bypass Strabane once again. Strabane has a  history of high unemployment and was once described as the unemployment black  spot of Europe. That high unemployment creates  a case for having a co-located office for social security staff and jobs and  benefits staff. Unfortunately, Strabane has suffered government neglect for a  very long time. I do not want to get into whingeing mode, but that is a fact.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The decision has angered people. I spent Saturday in  Strabane, and a number of people told me that, once again, they had been let  down. Staff in the social security office are also being let down. Many of them  operate out of prefab buildings that are over 30 years old, and their working  conditions are very poor. Therefore, I ask that the Minister give further  consideration to creating a better working environment with new office  accommodation.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Staff feel let down and are uncertain about their future;  they need an assurance that social security jobs in Strabane will be  maintained. I appeal to the Minister to listen sensitively to the pleas that I,  and other Members for West Tyrone, have made. From time to time, Strabane needs  a positive signal from government. I was delighted that, when he was Minister  for Social Development, Minister Attwood announced a new footbridge for  Strabane, which was regarded by the local community as a very positive signal.  However, this issue is causing grave concern. The time has come for Strabane to  get a positive signal from central government that it is a place that can be  invested in and that the co-located office will be sited there.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>:  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I welcome the opportunity to  participate in the debate, and I have listened to Members&rsquo; comments. Those of  us who live in areas in which the co-location of the jobs and benefits and  social security offices has taken place can see the benefits already. In  Dungannon, for example, that has happened, and has benefited the community. We  know too, from the experience of the Department of Agriculture and Rural  Development (DARD), the benefit for farmers when it brought together its direct  offices and located services under one roof. We know that co-location works and  is a good idea.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">We welcome the fact that the Department for Social  Development was taking forward the project. However, as a rural dweller, I will  always look at the rural implications. Over the past decade, much has been said  about Strabane&rsquo;s being an economic black spot with high unemployment and a need  for people to be helped back into work. Therefore, it would have made sense to  do the Strabane project first instead of leaving it to the end. I am not here  to give the Minister a hard time about the money not being there to complete  the project. However, in these challenging times it would be welcome.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The Rural White Paper shows that this is the kind of thing  that should not happen: if there are needs in rural areas, they should be  addressed. We should not always be left at the end of the queue. People in  Cookstown are equally aggrieved about this issue. We would like a change in  emphasis from the Executive to ensure that rural dwellers and communities are  not put to the bottom of the pile, that their needs are addressed and their  rights taken into consideration. It would have been helpful if the Strabane  project had been done first, given all that it has suffered, instead of being  left until the last and then falling off the end.<span class="SectionMarker"><span style="font-size:14.0pt; "> </span></span></p>
<p class="TimePeriod">5.00 pm</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCausland  (The Minister for Social Development)</strong>: The jobs and benefits project  started in 2001 and was designed to improve services to jobseekers by  co-locating the services of the Social Security Agency&rsquo;s social security  offices and the Department for Employment and Learning. The delivery of jobs  and benefits offices has been mainly achieved through the refurbishment of  existing social security office buildings. However, it became clear, at an  early stage of the jobs and benefits project, that a number of offices would  require purpose-built premises because of issues with the capacity and quality  of the existing offices.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Ten newbuilds were grouped at the end because they were in  need of a major procurement programme, and the office in Strabane fell into  that group. Although there was good progress in developing the initial 25 new  jobs and benefits offices, there was significant slippage in the delivery of  the last 10 offices, due to difficulties in identifying sites and procurement  issues.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">As a result of a procurement exercise in 2006, two sites  were originally identified for the new Strabane jobs and benefits office.  However, one did not offer value for money, and the other did not meet the  necessary quality criteria. The next step was to consider how the existing site  could be used. A review considered options for either a full office  refurbishment or a refurbishment of front office only, and planning  applications for both models were submitted, with approval being received  during 2009.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">At the beginning of 2010, due to concerns about the  availability of future funding, it was decided not to progress a number of  offices, including the one in Strabane, until the 2010 spending review  allocation was confirmed. Overall, allocations to Northern Ireland from Her Majesty&rsquo;s  Treasury were subject to a 40% capital reduction. All Departments have been  obliged, therefore, to make difficult decisions about the future delivery of  projects. The inability to deliver a new jobs and benefits office in Strabane  is, therefore, a result of not receiving capital funding in response to bids  submitted in the spending review in 2010.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">To date, 27 jobs and benefits offices have been delivered.  It is regrettable that new jobs and benefits offices cannot be delivered in  Strabane and the seven other areas impacted by the decision. As Members noted,  my constituency of North Belfast was one of  the areas that did not benefit from a new office. The other areas were  Newtownards, Downpatrick, Newcastle, Cookstown, Bangor and Ballynahinch.  The total cost of delivering those remaining jobs and benefits offices would  have been in the region of &pound;37&middot;3 million.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">We considered other options, such as limited refurbishment  using the existing social security offices and jobcentres, but that still  needed capital investment in excess of &pound;6 million. We also considered using the  existing infrastructure without any capital investment, but there was  insufficient accommodation in many of the eight locations, including Strabane.  Both the Social Security Agency and our partner, the Department for Employment  and Learning&rsquo;s employment service, remain fully committed to assisting people  into employment and to meeting our customers&rsquo; benefit needs. Indeed, the whole  point of bringing together the benefits office and the jobs office was to give a  strong sense of benefits leading to employment. We do not want to keep people  on benefits; rather, we want to get them into employment. I do not think that  anyone would dispute that bringing together the two offices was a good and  positive thing.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The vast majority of our customers in Strabane and in the  other social security offices are already getting a work-focused service, given  the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance conditionality and changes to incapacity benefit and  lone parent regulations. Carers in receipt of income support are not subject to  a work-focused interview as part of their claim process. Those customers would  be likely to have their work-focused interview waived or deferred, given the  impact of caring responsibilities on their availability for work.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The current labour market situation continues to present  real challenges in Strabane, with over 1,700 clients claiming jobseeker&rsquo;s  allowance and only five vacancies currently notified to the employment service  for the Strabane area. The Department for Employment and Learning is working  closely with Invest NI to assist client companies and potential inward  investors to recruit employees, particularly from among the long-term  unemployed. The Steps to Work programme has assisted clients in developing  their skills, and 95 clients in Strabane who are currently in employment  receive an employer subsidy through that programme. The Steps Ahead strand of  that programme currently provides temporary waged employment for 39 long-term  unemployed people in Strabane.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The fact that there will be no jobs and benefits office in  Strabane will have no impact on the number of staff employed. Currently, 69  staff are employed in the social security office and the jobcentre, and  staffing numbers in the remaining social security offices and jobcentres will  not be impacted by the decision. I recognise that there are some accommodation  issues, which were noted, in the existing offices, but I am committed to  addressing those. My colleague Minister Stephen Farry and I remain committed to  exploiting opportunities for the delivery of jobs and benefits services in the  eight remaining offices, and we will progress those on a case-by-case basis. We  have not given up on any of those locations, and that includes Strabane.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Members raised specific questions during the debate. One  related to the delays in delivering a new office in Strabane. A combination of  factors led to that delay. The first of those was the difficulty in finding a  site. Of the two sites identified as the result of a procurement exercise in  2006, one did not represent value for money, and the other did not meet the  necessary quality criteria. The second factor was the time needed to process  planning applications for the redevelopment of the existing Social Security  Agency site. The third factor was the alignment with the strategic business  review, now titled Customer First, which would influence whether a full office  or front office only would be delivered in Strabane. Fourthly, Minister  Ritchie, in response to strategic business reviews in July 2009, specifically  the equality impact assessment, advised that she wished to further evaluate the  proposed front-office solution for Strabane. Finally, by the time Ministers  agreed to break alignment with the strategic business review in March 2009, the  indication of likely difficulties in securing future capital made it impossible  to commit to the procurement of a contractor to build a new office.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I hope that that sets out clearly for Members the sequence  of factors that contributed to the delay. The procurement issues go back to  2006, and those were followed by further issues with planning and strategic  business reviews. The decision was then made to evaluate further whether the  office should be a full office or a front office, and, by the time that  decision was made, we had encountered financial difficulties.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I understand the affection that Members from West Tyrone  have for Strabane, and a point was raised during the debate about why Strabane  was not prioritised over other offices. An office priority order was agreed by  the Minister for Social Development and the Minister for Employment and  Learning in January 2010. It was, therefore, my predecessor in DSD and Minister  Farry&rsquo;s predecessor in DEL  who reached that decision. Strabane was given priority among the category 2  offices, which included those in Strabane, Newcastle and Cookstown, on the basis of its  history of high unemployment and associated deprivation levels. A number of  offices, namely those in north Belfast,  Newtownards and Downpatrick were prioritised in advance of Strabane as a result  of their greater size and their strategic importance to the delivery of the  strategic business review, Customer First, as they delivered the capacity for  more centralised processing.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I hope that that clarifies the situation for Members. I  appreciate and empathise with their desire for the work to be taken forward. As  I said, we will progress that work on a case-by-case basis, and we have not  given up on any location, including Strabane.</p>
