      <p class="H4StageHeading">North/South Ministerial Council: Agriculture Sectoral  Format</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I have received notice from the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development  that she wishes to make a statement</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development (Ms Gildernew)</strong>: Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat,  a Cheann Comhairle.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Before I start, I take the opportunity to wish the Bloody  Sunday families in Derry well on a very  significant day for them.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">With your permission, Mr Speaker, I wish to make a  statement in compliance with section 52 of the NI Act 1998 regarding the  thirteenth meeting of the North/South Ministerial Council (NSMC) in agriculture  sectoral format, held in the Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute, Hillsborough,  on Wednesday 31 March 2010. The Executive were represented by Minister Edwin  Poots MLA and myself; the Irish Government were represented by Brendan Smith  TD, Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. This statement has been  agreed with Mr Poots and I make it on behalf of us both.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Council noted a presentation by officials on  co-operation in research, which dealt with current structures and funding  streams for research in both jurisdictions and demonstrated the importance and  benefits of ongoing co-operation, with particular emphasis on generating and  disseminating knowledge and technology that will support the agrifood industry  in exploiting global market opportunities and highlighting the potential for  future collaboration. It welcomed plans to continue that co-operation and  engagement in areas of mutual interest and benefit, including access to  international and EU funding programmes, and it looked forward to receiving an  update at a future NSMC meeting in the agriculture sectoral format.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Council agreed an all-island animal health and welfare  strategy, designed to optimise the animal health status of the island through  the alignment of policies to control animal disease. Full co-operation on  animal health issues could help to reduce or prevent animal disease spread as  well as facilitating trade. Agreement of the strategy fulfils indicator 6 of  public service agreement (PSA) 4 of the Executive&rsquo;s Programme for Government.  The ultimate objective of the strategy is the development of policies to  facilitate the free movement of animals on the island. In order to work towards  that aim, three key strategic areas have been identified: partnership; further  co-operation on trade, animal identification and animal movement policies and  legislation; and further co-operation in developing disease control and animal  welfare policies.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Ministers welcomed progress on the delivery of initial  activities in the strategy, including progress towards a mutual recognition of  genotype programmes, which is at an advanced stage, and the cross-border  stakeholder event that took place on 12 April 2010. The Council noted that the  EU Commission is expected to publish a review of the EU budget in June or July  2010 as well as a communication on the future of the common agricultural policy  (CAP) in autumn 2010.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (DARD)  and the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (DAFF) will continue  consultations with stakeholders. Both Administrations will remain in close  contact as negotiations progress. Ministers noted the challenges facing the  agriculture sector, particularly greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets.  Ministers requested officials to remain in close contact on those issues and to  report developments to a future NSMC meeting in agriculture sectoral format.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Council welcomed the allocation by the EU of &euro;300  million to assist dairy farmers severely affected by the dairy crisis and noted  the method of allocation of payments to farmers. The Council agreed that its  next meeting would take place in late summer 2010.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Irwin</strong>:  The Minister says that she wants free movement of animals on the island. Is it  not true that there has been free movement of animals, subject to normal  testing procedures?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: There has been free movement of sheep on  the island, but following the beef ban, which was lifted in 2006, there have  been restrictions on bovine movement, despite controls on disease. There are  still problems, many of which I encounter when visiting marts and shows, where  people raise their difficulties in buying stock or moving cattle across the  island. There is much to be done, and I believe that the all-island animal  health and welfare strategy will help to facilitate that.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Doherty</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. What preventative measures has the  Minister put in place to deal with the threat of bluetongue?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: A range of measures is in place to  minimise the risk of bluetongue reaching Ireland. We carry out post-import  testing of all imported sheep and cattle from Europe and Britain and  have taken steps to ensure that importers know the risks and can put measures  in place to minimise them. Pre-import testing is one of the conditions laid  down by EU regulations before animals can be imported from bluetongue zones.  However, that testing is not always necessary if the animals satisfy other  conditions.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We have worked closely with industry stakeholders and do  not consider other measures to be necessary at this time. I have asked the  farming community to remain vigilant for bluetongue by inspecting livestock at  least daily for signs of disease and to report any suspicions immediately. My  Department has issued all cattle and sheep owners with an information leaflet  outlining the clinical signs and symptoms that they should look out for. We  also advise against importing animals from bluetongue-affected areas.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Savage</strong>: I  thank the Minister for her statement. The three strategic areas that the  Minister outlined are co-operation, partnership and further co-operation. Will  she assure the House that that co-operation is happening and that incidents  that have occurred over the past year or 18 months will not happen again?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: We should all learn from our  difficulties. I presume that the Member is referring to the dioxins incident.  Relations have been strengthened as a result of that incident, and  communication between the two Departments is much better, but there is no  question that we can always improve. I look forward to further co-operation at  ministerial, official and industry level.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We should make more of our health policies and our  bluetongue-free island status, which the fortress-Ireland approach has helped  to ensure. We have seen the difficulties that foot-and-mouth disease,  bluetongue and avian influenza caused in Britain, and we want to ensure that  our farmers are not subject to the same controls and do not face the same  difficulties as farmers across the water during what has been a difficult  enough three years for them. The fact that our farmers have benefited has much  to do with the co-operation that we have on the island.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P J Bradley</strong>:  Mr Irwin and Mr Savage asked about freedom of movement, but I want to probe the  matter further. I understand that the strategic areas to which the Minister  referred have been on the agenda for the past five or six years, so I am  disappointed that only a strategy has been agreed up until now. Will the  Minister give a date on which the free movement of animals will eventually be  permitted? That is what livestock owners want to hear. In her statement, the  Minister said that the EU&rsquo;s method of allocating &euro;300 million to farmers  affected by the dairy crisis was noted. Will she go into greater detail on what  was noted?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: The Member is aware that we reached  agreement on a strategy at March&rsquo;s NSMC meeting. I accept that there were some  difficulties in getting to that stage, but they were not of my making. In the  meantime, much work has been done on preparing the strategy. We were not waiting  for the strategy to be agreed before making progress on some of the measures  needed to benefit farmers.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We have worked in close co-operation. For example, the  fortress-Ireland approach that I first adopted in conjunction with Minister  Coughlan has been further developed with Brendan Smith. He and I continue to  work together against the real threat that bluetongue poses to the island of Ireland. We have also agreed a common  chapter on contingency plans in the event of an outbreak of foot-and-mouth  disease, avian flu or bluetongue. I have been to Brussels  and Luxembourg  on several occasions to make our case on animal health matters, and on sheep ID  tagging in particular.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to ensure that the North&rsquo;s special position in the  EU, which President Barroso has acknowledged, continues to be recognised in  disease control, trade and other important high-level discussions. I said  earlier that I am continuing to bear down on animal diseases that continue to  impose significant ongoing costs to government and industry, specifically  bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I was also delighted to welcome Commissioner John Dalli to  the cross-border event on the all-island animal health and welfare strategy on  12 April. Over breakfast, I had the opportunity to raise issues with the  commissioner. I consider that meeting to have been the start of a very positive  working relationship with him and his cabinet.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Members asked about the dairy crisis, and we have made good  progress. Some farmers here have not yet given us the necessary contact details  to have payments made into their bank account. We are working on trying to get  that number down to zero. The money should be paid out, and we will meet our  targets on the payment of our share of the &euro;300 million EU dairy fund.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement. Did she enjoy an Ulster fry when she had breakfast  with her friend? Support local industry.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I have two questions. First, when will the Minister make a  statement to the House on the &pound;60 million that must be repaid to the EU  Commission? That is an important issue for many people. Secondly, agrifood,  which is the largest private industry in Northern Ireland, was discussed at  the NSMC meeting. Is the Minister convinced that enough cross-border work is  being done to ensure that that industry continues and expands?</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">10.45 am</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: First, I should deal with the question  about the fry. The meeting took place in a very beautiful part of Ulster, in the Slieve  Russell Hotel  in Ballyconnell, County Cavan, and I did have an Ulster fry, which was great. You  would know to look at me that I have had a few.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In recent weeks, there have been difficulties with some  trade issues. Indeed, yesterday, in conjunction with Minister Foster, I had a  very useful meeting with industry representatives at which some of those issues  were discussed. Although disallowance was not discussed, I tried to explain my  position, which is quite complicated and technical. The first &pound;30 million of  the penalty has been covered, and, through the conciliation process, we are  negotiating with Europe to have the second  part reduced. The Commission made it clear that we have made great strides in  improving our mapping system, but, at this point in time, it is considering  enforcing the remaining &pound;30 million penalty. We will fight that decision as far  as we can, up to the European Court of Justice if necessary.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>:  Is there scope to extend the North/South relationship to cross-border  co-operation on research?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: In the past number of years, we have  undertaken several measures to improve co-operation. The Agri-Food and  Biosciences Institute (AFBI) works very closely with Teagasc, with which it has  a memorandum of understanding on developing complementary research strategies  to ensure that we do not have to reinvent the wheel or duplicate work in both  areas. That work is very successful and has been ongoing for a number of years.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The College of Agriculture, Food and Rural Enterprise  (CAFRE), which carries out quite a bit of research as part of its education  programme, also has a close working relationship with Teagasc. Seeing how  things are done in both areas is beneficial to the next generation coming  through the industry. CAFRE&rsquo;s student exchange programme with Kildalton College  in Piltown has been very successful, with students from there coming up to  Greenmount and vice versa.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There has been a great deal of co-operation across the  services that we provide, and the industry benefits not just from research and  development on the island but from the disease controls that are in place. For  example, when there was a case of brown rot in the South, we were quickly able  to work on measures here, likewise when phytophthora ramorum was identified in  the North. Such diseases are discussed on an all-Ireland basis so that  scientists can work to ensure that the industry does not suffer the worst  consequences of them.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement. It will not have been lost on her how  important the agrifood sector is to Northern Ireland. As a recipient of  single farm payment, I declare an interest. Will the Minister outline the work  that has been and will continue to be done to set out the vision that we need  to deal with CAP reform, which is one of the biggest challenges facing the  industry? What is her vision, and is she working with others in the Republic of Ireland  and across the UK so that  they buy in to that vision to sustain agriculture in Northern Ireland?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: The Member is right: the issue is hugely  important, and it was discussed at the meeting on 31 March. With the  appointment of the new EU Commission, the debate on the future of the CAP is  beginning in earnest. We considered various issues that are emerging from that  debate, including the size of the CAP budget and the future basis of single  farm payment. We noted that, later this year, the EU Commission is expected to  publish the EU budget review and a communication on the future of CAP. Although  the debate is at an early stage, we are engaging with stakeholders to develop  detailed thinking. I do not want the CAP to be inadequately funded; I will seek  to have it maintained at the highest possible level. The Member will be pleased  to hear that I also made it clear that the single farm payment should continue  post 2013. Given the importance of CAP to agriculture incomes, I expect that  view to be held widely.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There is consensus between Minister Smith and me, which is  shared by our counterparts in Scotland  and Wales.  The issue will come up when I meet the DEFRA Minister and the new commissioner  next week. Generally, we find ourselves at odds with the position in England,  although the Treasury position more so than the DEFRA position, because it is  very much the wish of the British Government that the agriculture budget should  be reduced, as they are a net contributor to it. There will be a fight on our  hands, and I will fight strongly for the benefit of the industry here. As I  said, we are expanding those discussions. Minister Smith, in particular, is  doing a lot of work with his counterparts in France and other EU member states  in which there are like-minded individuals. There is no doubt that it will be a  battle, but I am ready for it.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her statement. Will she make any comment about the  fact that the meeting took place about 10 weeks ago? Will she detail the  specific bids that her officials are making to EU programmes?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: The Member is right to point out that  there has been a significant time lapse since the meeting in March. That is  very unfortunate, but the circumstances were beyond my control.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Unfortunately, the new rural development Minister, Pat  Carey, was only brought into post during the reshuffle in the week in which the  meeting was held, so he was unable to attend. Not a lot of detail about EU  funding programmes was discussed at that meeting, but I expect to talk to him  in the very near future. I will be able to come back with further detail on  rural development and EU programmes at that stage.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr W Clarke</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I also thank the Minister for her  statement. What progress is being made towards us being officially recognised  as Aujeszky&rsquo;s disease-free? With your indulgence, a Cheann Comhairle, I ask the  Minister to elaborate on the challenges that the agriculture sector faces in  relation to greenhouse gas emission reduction targets.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: Under the all-island animal health and  welfare strategy, we are taking a joint approach to the eradication of  Aujeszky&rsquo;s disease on the island   of Ireland. We were  recognised formally as having annex II status last July. DAFF achieved similar  recognition for its eradication plan on 12 April 2010. On Monday 14 June,  following discussion with the industry about how we progress to official EU  recognition of freedom from Aujeszky&rsquo;s disease, I announced a voluntary  industry ban on vaccination against the disease. That begins a 12-month  vaccine-free qualifying period that will allow us to apply in due course for EU  recognition of disease-free status. The South announced its ban on vaccination  against Aujeszky&rsquo;s disease on the same day. My staff continue to work with  their counterparts in Dublin  towards the objective of achieving annex I status simultaneously throughout the  island. I pay tribute to the pig industry because it has worked very hard in  helping us to get there. It has had its knocks over the past years, but it has  been very dedicated to ensuring that we achieve freedom from Aujeszky&rsquo;s  disease.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As regards the climate change situation, the Programme for  Government contains the target for all sectors to reduce their carbon emissions  by 25% by 2025. In other regions, however, the agriculture sector has been  asked to achieve a reduction of around 10% on current levels by 2010. My  officials have developed a suite of possible mitigation measures for  consultation with the industry, including optimising manure and efficient use  of fertilisers; optimising livestock management; locking in or sequestering  carbon in soil, grassland and peatland; locking in or sequestering carbon by  creating new woodland; sustainable management of existing woodland; and  increasing renewable energy use and on-farm energy efficiency.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I suspect that that issue will have more of a focus in  future NSMC sectoral meetings because retailers are making demands on the  industry, and we have to be prepared to help it to achieve those targets and to  ensure that there are not any restrictions on trade because of our carbon  footprint or perceived carbon footprint.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I am grateful to the Minister for her statement. With regard to animal welfare  and combating animal disease, was there any discussion at the North/South  Ministerial Council meeting about the ongoing criminal activity by rogue  operators who are deliberately infecting herds, particularly in the south Armagh area? Will the Minister take the opportunity to  condemn such activities again and to encourage anyone with any information to  bring it to the PSNI?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: Certainly: on Friday, I made clear my  position on criminal activity such as brucellosis fraud and the illegal  movement of cattle that may lead to brucellosis. I have no difficulty in  condemning those actions. I appreciated the Member&rsquo;s statement in support of  that at the weekend. We have worked hard to eradicate brucellosis, and we were  down to a rate of 0&middot;036% before Christmas. However, the activities of a very  small number of people have resulted and will result in further control  measures while we get to grips with the disease and combat what has been done.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am still determined to push ahead to achieve  brucellosis-free status. I recognise that the timescale has changed, given what  happened in Lislea before Christmas. Those in the wider farming community have  been fantastic in supporting my actions. They have worked with me by doing what  they can to help to reduce the spread of brucellosis. They have accepted our  control measures, even though they are difficult and a pain at times,  especially for those trying to work and farm at the same time. We are asking  them to increase testing and to do things that put them out. Nevertheless, they  have done all that without a moan or a grumble, and we need to see that ongoing  co-operation. I am pleased that the vast majority of farmers are behind us on  this. However, I am disappointed and angry that a very small number of  self-serving individuals are prepared to sacrifice our health status on the  island and, potentially, reinfect the South. I have been forthright in my  condemnation of that, and I am happy to repeat that condemnation this morning.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>:  I, too, welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement, although I am disappointed by its  brevity. Like my colleague, I am also disappointed that it took 10 weeks to  come here. I am even more disappointed that there will be no more meetings  until late summer. Will the Minister assure us that genuine work and progress  has been made to sort out the horrendous problems that the agriculture industry  faces because we operate in two jurisdictions?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: I recognise that there are difficulties  for the industry in operating in two jurisdictions. This is early summer, and  the next meeting will take place in late summer, but I assure the Member that  those meetings are not the only things that are happening. I had a meeting  yesterday with the head of our North/South unit to get a report on the work  that is ongoing at official level between those meetings. I also want to see  how we can develop the work of the North/South Ministerial Council to ensure  that we crank it up and that we eliminate some of the challenges that our  farming community faces in working across the border and help it to cope with  those challenges.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The NSMC meetings are a valuable and useful vehicle, but  they are not the only things that are happening: a lot of work is ongoing in between  times.</p>
      <p class="H4StageHeading" style="page-break-before:always;"><a name="a2"></a>North/South  Ministerial Council: &nbsp;Inland Waterways  Sectoral Format</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I have received notice from the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure that he  wishes to make a statement.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure (Mr McCausland)</strong>: With your permission, Mr  Speaker, I wish to make a statement in compliance with section 52 of the  Northern Ireland Act 1998 regarding a meeting of the North/South Ministerial  Council in inland waterways sectoral format.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The meeting was held in Armagh  on 26 May 2010. The Northern Ireland Executive were represented by myself as  Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure and Caitr&iacute;ona Ruane, Minister of  Education. The Irish Government were represented by Pat Carey TD, Minister for  Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. This statement has been agreed with  Caitr&iacute;ona Ruane, and I am making it on behalf of us both.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The chief executive of Waterways Ireland, Mr John Martin,  presented a report on progress, which included the provision of 186 m of  additional moorings until the end of April 2010 and the provision of new  publications to promote and support the use of the waterways and the sponsoring  of key events on the waterways in 2010.<span class="SectionMarker"><span style="font-size:14.0pt; "> </span></span></p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">11.00 am</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The chief executive reported that Waterways Ireland is one  of 17 partners from 11 EU countries, along with Norway  and Serbia, involved in an  EU INTERREG IVc project entitled Waterways Forward, which was formally titled  Inland Waterways of Europe. As part of that  three-year project, Waterways Ireland will host a meeting of the 17 partner  representatives in late 2011.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The progress report detailed the completion of the dredging  of Richmond harbour to allow the reconnection of  the Royal canal to the Shannon. The official  opening of the Royal canal is planned for the end of September 2010.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The chief executive also reported that Waterways Ireland  had recently won the coveted O2 ability award 2010 for environmental  accessibility. It has also achieved the status of ability company in the  categories covering environmental accessibility and customer service.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Council discussed the main priorities for Waterways  Ireland and reviewed the progress that both sponsor Departments have made  towards finalising the business plan and budget for 2010.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Council also received a progress report on the  restoration work for the Clones to Upper Lough Erne section of the Ulster canal.  It noted that work on the strategic environmental assessment is ongoing and is  due to be completed by mid-2010, with work on the environmental impact  assessment due for completion in late 2010. It also noted that a preferred  route had been identified from a technical/engineering point of view.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Council received a presentation from Water&shy;ways Ireland  on the development of the Shannon-Erne waterway, and discussed the developments  that have taken place since it reopened. The presentation focused on the  reconstruction of the original Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal as the  Shannon-Erne waterway.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Waterways Ireland&rsquo;s  annual report and draft accounts for 2009 were also on the agenda. It was noted  that following their certification they would be laid before the Northern  Ireland Assembly and both Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Council consented to a compulsory purchase order  relating to acquisitions south of Lough Ennell to facilitate water supplies on  the Royal canal.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Council agreed that its next meeting in the inland  waterways sectoral format will take place in the autumn of 2010.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Browne</strong>:  It has been apparent for some time that Northern Ireland&rsquo;s waterways  require redevelopment to exploit their leisure and tourism potential. What  impact does the Minister believe the steps outlined today will have? What  further steps does he feel will be necessary if we are to fully unlock that  potential?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: The tourism potential of waterways is very  important, and the existing marketing and promotion strategy was launched in  2004. There is a review process involving key stakeholders, such as the  Northern Ireland Tourist Board and the Erne Charter Boat Association, and some  meetings have been held. Much of the research material has been collected and  collated, and when that is completed, a working document will be finalised for  discussion and a draft strategy prepared. The group is on target for that draft  strategy to go out to public consultation later this year.</p>
      <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Dallat] in the Chair)</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The existing strategy has five key marketing objectives:  awareness creation; development of corporate identity; promoting greater use of  the waterways; working in partnership with other bodies; and building a  platform for sustained development. Those objectives are met through a range of  marketing activities, including the publication and distribution of promotional  materials, guides and charts through advertising campaigns, press  familiarisation visits, and other promotional activity.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Mr Barry McElduff.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure (Mr McElduff)</strong>: Go raibh  maith agat. On a point of order, should I not have been called to speak on this  matter first, as the Chairperson of the Committee for Culture, Arts and  Leisure? I believe that I should.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Of course. I have just come to the Chair and it was not marked on  my notes. Please accept my apologies.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a  LeasCheann Comhairle. On 3 June 2010, the Committee for Culture, Arts and  Leisure was briefed by Waterways Ireland on its proposal to introduce by-laws  on the waterways. The Committee regarded that as a positive step forward in  regularising the current rules that apply on the waterways to ensure that  everyone using them has a safe and enjoyable experience.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In the Minister&rsquo;s statement, he said that the Council  discussed the main priorities for Waterways Ireland in 2010 and reviewed  progress in finalising the business plan and the budget. Can the Minister  indicate what those main priorities are?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister also referred to the project to restore the Ulster canal  from Upper Lough Erne to Clones. The Committee has kept a keen interest in that  issue, and in 2008, we heard from the Blackwater Regional Partnership about the  tourism and economic benefits that will result from the reopening of the canal.  Can the Minister indicate a date for completion of the overall project?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: The Member asked a number of questions. I shall  start with the last one, which was on the progress of the Clones to Upper Lough  Erne section of the Ulster  canal.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Waterways Ireland  has received the physical survey to allow the preliminary design process to  commence, and work on the environmental impact assessment (EIA) and strategic  environmental assessment (SEA) is progressing. The SEA is due to be completed  by mid-2010, and the EIA is due for completion in late 2010. Possible routes  and options are being reviewed, and when the preferred options are identified,  the tender for a site investigation will be advertised. A meeting with DOE planners  in Northern Ireland  was held in December 2009. The selection of the final option is dependent on  the outcome of the environmental studies and the final design estimates. That  option will be developed to allow it to be forwarded for planning approval, and  it is anticipated that it will be forwarded for planning approval in late 2010.  Pending a successful outcome to the planning process, the land acquisition  process will be commenced and the contract for the construction phase of the  project should be awarded in 2011.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Another part of the question referred to by-laws. As was  noted, Waterways Ireland met the Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure on 28  May 2009 and 3 June 2010. The first phase will be the public consultation  process, which is due to commence shortly and will run for 12 weeks from the  date of issue. Once the consultation has been completed and the views expressed  are taken on board, we will be in a better position to move forward in regard  to the by-laws.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I clarify that we are discussing the inland waterways section of  the meeting.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McClarty</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his statement. He stated that the accounts of  Waterways Ireland will be laid before the House in due course. Can he assure  the House that there is no cause for concern with those accounts, and can he  further assure the House that the internal management issues that have plagued  the body for years have been brought under control?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: I am unaware of any particular issues that have  arisen in regard to the accounts. Considerable interest is taken in the  governance of the organisation, as indeed it would be with all arm&rsquo;s-length  bodies and cross-border bodies. We take considerable interest in those, and  rightly so. Waterways Ireland  is accountable to the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure (DCAL) and the  Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (DCRGA) jointly and to the  NSMC. Both Ministers have to be satisfied that, through the NSMC, we are  discharging our oversight responsibilities in respect of Waterways Ireland.  Monthly meetings are chaired alternately by senior civil servants in DCAL and  DCRGA, and the chief executive officer and appropriate directors attend.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">An issue that is sometimes raised is the possibility of  appointing a board to Waterways Ireland, and arising from the St Andrews  Agreement, a review of the effectiveness and efficiency of North/South  implementation bodies is under way. If that review were to recommend that a  board for Waterways Ireland be established, Ministers in the NSMC would have to  consider that.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  Since we are on the subject of waterways, from which many people get their  enjoyment, I am sure that the Minister and Members will join me in offering the  sympathy of the House to the family of Mr Ken Dorman from Dundonald, who,  unfortunately, lost his life while enjoying the waterways of Strangford Lough  last Saturday morning.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister&rsquo;s statement says:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The Council consented to a Compulsory Purchase Order  relating to acquisitions south of Lough Ennell&rdquo;.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Will the Minister advise us whether all interested  parties explored every avenue and tried to reach agreement before the  compulsory purchase order was taken?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: People would endorse the Member&rsquo;s first point,  and we express sympathy with the family concerned.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">To facilitate the reopening of the Royal canal, it will be  necessary to extract water from Lough Ennell to provide a water supply for the  passage of boats. That is what necessitates the compulsory acquisition of land,  because the inway sluice gate and weir to the south of Lough Ennell are used to  facilitate the effective management and control of the water levels in the  lough. That will ensure that the adequate supply of water to the Royal canal is  maintained at all times.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Waterways Ireland  requires the NSMC&rsquo;s consent to progress compulsory purchase orders. In some  situations, that is necessary, and this is one such situation. I am sure that  every effort was made to avoid that, but, in this case, it was clear that a  compulsory purchase order was necessary. Although the Member might require more  detailed information, I should point out that the lough is outside the  constituency of Strangford and outside the jurisdiction of Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his statement. The statement says that the chief  executive of Waterways Ireland reported that that body is one of 17 partners  from 11 European countries. It is always good to talk and to exchange views.  Given that exchange of views and information with those European countries,  does the Minister know what benefits will flow &mdash; to use a pun &mdash; to Waterways  Ireland to help us here?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: Waterways Ireland  has joined with 16 partners from 11 EU countries, as well as with Norway and Serbia, in an INTERREG project  entitled Waterways Forward. That three-year project, which commenced in January  2010, is being led by the Dutch Recreational Waterways Foundation. Other EU  partners include British Waterways, French Waterways and regional  representatives from Italy  and Spain.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Waterways Forward seeks to exchange knowledge on existing  management strategies and regional policies; to develop recommendations on how  to establish a better connection between the economic structures of regions  adjacent to inland waterways and waterway-related businesses; to remove  barriers to stimulate the multifunctional use of the waterways; to diminish the  expected effects of climate change, particularly the shortage and surplus of  water, on navigability; and, where governance matters are concerned, to  establish policy and management structures to improve horizontal and vertical  co-operation between various policy sectors and government management levels.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As part of the work programme, Waterways Ireland will host  a meeting of the 17 partner representatives in Enniskillen towards the end of  the year. The overall project budget for all 17 partners is &euro;2&middot;8 million, which  is 75% co-financed by the EU. Waterways Ireland&rsquo;s contribution, which  includes any time that is spent on the project, is &euro;137,000 over the three-year  period from 2010 to 2012. Therefore, taking account of the 75% EU funding, the  cost to Waterways Ireland will be only &euro;34,000. DCAL&rsquo;s commitment of 15% is,  therefore, &euro;5,100 or &pound;4,200 over the three-year period. That amounts to  approximately &pound;1,400 a year in a &euro;2&middot;8 million project. Therefore, for a very  modest return, we will gain knowledge in a range of areas that will certainly  improve the effectiveness of and increase the benefits that flow from our  waterways.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Leonard</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. In the context of the Ulster canal,  the Minister mentioned marketing measures, priorities and dates. However,  delivery on the section of the overall canal project in the more northerly Ulster counties  has, in effect, been put back until at least 2020. Many people are aghast at  that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Does the Minister accept that a lack of delivery shows a  lack of vision? Will he reconsider whether engagement on this part of the  project should commence now? I anticipate the normal references to funds and  recession, but does he further accept that to do so would be an investment in  tourism potential, economic growth, construction work and regeneration along  all sections of the canal and beyond?</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">11.15 am</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: The Member raises that matter with considerable  regularity on these occasions. I will simply respond by saying that it is not a  question of a lack of delivery but of a lack of money. The vision is there to  develop waterways right across Northern    Ireland so that all areas of the Province  benefit from the tourism potential and from the social and cultural benefits  that flow from waterways. However, there are financial limits to what can be  done at present. Nothing is being ruled out in the longer term, but the lack of  money, which I highlighted already, is something that will be with us for a  considerable time. As I indicated previously, if the Member wishes to encourage  another Minister to release lots of money to free it up for my Department, I  will be more than happy to spend it.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his statement to the Assembly. I note that the meeting  of the 17 partner representatives from EU countries is due to take place in  late 2011. Can you indicate where the meeting is likely to be held? Is there an  opportunity to bring it to Enniskillen?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Although I am very impressed with the amount of work that  Waterways Ireland has done, is the Minister content with the amount of work  that will be carried out shortly north of the border, particularly in light of  the volcanic ash cloud and the advent of the &ldquo;staycation&rdquo; phenomenon, where  more people are holidaying at home? Now may be an opportunity to develop our  tourism potential and to increase the impact that Waterways Ireland has on this  side of the border.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: The policy of getting maximum value from the  maximum number of questions is spreading. I am not sure of the location of the  event, but I am sure that the meeting will involve a visit to Waterways  Ireland&rsquo;s headquarters in Enniskillen. I would be very surprised if that were  not the case, but I will write to the Member with the details of the event that  is being held towards the end of the year.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">For the investment that we put into Waterways Ireland, we  get back considerably more than we put in. Northern Ireland profits from  Waterways Ireland. I am all in favour of co-operation with our neighbours in  the Republic, as long as we benefit.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member asked about the impact on tourism and about the  fact that more people are spending their holidays at home. The figures that we  were given for Lough Erne in particular indicate a substantial increase in the  number of boats on the Lough, so it is clear that there is growth in the  sector. The Member may have been making a case for the need for us to be aware  of opportunities that should be exploited for the benefit of the local economy  rather than have people from here holiday in Great Britain, the Irish Republic,  or wherever.</p>
      <p class="H4StageHeading"><a name="a3"></a>North/South Ministerial Council: Language Sectoral  Format</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I have received notice from the Minister of Culture, Arts and  Leisure that he wishes to make a statement.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure (Mr McCausland)</strong>: In compliance with section 52 of  the Northern Ireland Act 1998, I wish to make the following report on the tenth  North/South Ministerial Council meeting in language sectoral format. It was the  sixth meeting to be held since the restoration of the Northern Ireland  Executive and Assembly, and the first meeting to be held in 2010. The report  has been endorsed by the Minister of Education, who was the accompanying  Minister.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The meeting was held in the new NSMC joint secretariat  offices in Armagh on 26 May 2010. In this, my  third North/South Ministerial Council meeting, I represented the Northern  Ireland Executive as Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure, along with  Caitr&iacute;ona Ruane MLA, Minister of Education. The Irish Government were  represented by Pat Carey TD, Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht  Affairs, who chaired the meeting. The meeting dealt with issues relating to the  language body and its two constituent agencies: Tha Boord o Ulst&eacute;r-Scotch, the  Ulster-Scots Agency; and Foras na Gaeilge, the Irish language agency.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I will now present a summary of the issues discussed by the  Council on 26 May. The Council received progress reports from Foras na Gaeilge  and the Ulster-Scots Agency on developments to date in 2010. Ministers noted  the ongoing collaboration between the agencies, including the organisation of a  lecture series entitled &lsquo;aspects of our shared heritage&rsquo; in a number of local  councils and the arrangements in hand to offer the series more widely and to  add a new lecture on the Flight of the Earls and the Plantation. The agencies also collaborated on  the screening of a programme about the hamley tongue on the Irish language  television station, TG4, on 20 January 2010, which portrayed the Ulster-Scots  language in a balanced and fair way that will enhance awareness and  understanding of Ulster Scots among the Irish-speaking community.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Ministers also noted progress by the agencies that included  the introduction by Tha Boord o Ulst&eacute;r-Scotch of a new community workers  scheme, in order to improve capacity in community groups, and the appointment  of administrative workers on a part-time basis in eight community and voluntary  organisations; the commencement of an independent evaluation of organisations  that receive core funding from Tha Boord o Ulst&eacute;r-Scotch; and the publication  of a new Irish-language weekly newspaper, Gaelsc&eacute;al, in addition to other  educational material.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Council discussed the main priorities for the two  agencies in 2010 and the progress in finalising the North/South language body&rsquo;s  business plans and budgets.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Council noted the improvement in corporate governance  and accountability in the Ulster-Scots Agency since December 2009. It agreed  that the designation of the interim chief executive would be extended until the  end of December 2010 and noted the recruitment process for appointing a  substantive chief executive to the Ulster-Scots Agency.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">With regard to Foras na Gaeilge staffing and  decentralisation, Ministers noted recent developments by the Irish language  agency in recruitment, specifically that five offers of posts have been made  for Gweedore and four offers of posts have been made for Dublin. The Council approved the appointment,  subject to the approval of the Finance Ministers, of additional contract staff  for the Irish language agency in respect of the new English-Irish dictionary  project, with the cost to be met by the reallocation of funding from within  approved budgets.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Council approved the appointment of Michael McLoone to  the board of the Ulster-Scots Agency and the extension of the terms of appointment  of John Hunter and Tony Crooks to that board.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Council noted proposals from Foras na Gaeilge that  future funding to the Irish language sector would be provided on the basis of a  number of discrete schemes. It was agreed in principle that those proposals are  within the parameters of the NSMC decision of December 2009. Ministers decided  that officials from the sponsor Departments should work with Foras na Gaeilge  to agree, by the end of June 2010, the detail of those proposals and the  timescale for their implementation. In the context of such agreement being  reached by the end of June, Ministers agreed that interim funding may be  provided to existing funded organisations to the end of December 2010. The  question of further interim funding after the end of 2010 will be considered at  the next NSMC meeting in language sectoral format, and it will be based on the  progress made in implementing the agreed proposals. There was consultation with  the Irish language sector in the course of undertaking the review, and there  will be continued consultation during the implementation process.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Council received presentations from both agencies of  the North/South language body. Foras na Gaeilge gave a presentation on the use  of modern technology and other translation developments, which will provide  significant savings to all users and significant increases in consistency and  standard of translation.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Ulster-Scots Agency gave a presentation on its ongoing  work in the Ulster-Scots community, which includes significant developments on  the community workers scheme.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Council noted that it is proposed that the language  body&rsquo;s accounts for 2006 be laid before the Assembly and the Parliament in Dublin at the earliest  possible date. The Council also noted that progress is being made with regard  to the annual reports and accounts for 2007-09. It requested a further progress  report at the next NSMC meeting in language sectoral format. The Council agreed  to hold its next meeting in that format in autumn 2010.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure (Mr McElduff)</strong>: Go raibh  maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. First, to what extent have concerns  expressed by the seven core-funded groups in the North about restructuring the  funding of the 19 core-funded organisations throughout the island been taken on  board by the North/South Ministerial Council? I seek assurance from the  Minister that jobs and services in the Irish-language sector in the North will  not be lost or undermined.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, the Minister mentioned an independent evaluation  of the organisations that receive core funding from the Ulster-Scots Agency.  What are the terms of reference and the timescale of that evaluation?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Thirdly, can the Minister explain why there is continued  delay on his part in bringing forward a strategy to promote and enhance the  Irish language in the North as he is mandated to do by the St Andrews Agreement  and the Hillsborough Castle Agreement?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: I look forward to getting to the third point.  However, I will deal with the first two in order.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The first question was about the seven core-funded  Irish-language organisations that are based in Northern Ireland. There has been  widespread consultation with core-funded organisations that are based in Northern Ireland  and those that are based south of the border in &Eacute;ire. Quite a number of  comprehensive consultation meetings have been held. It is not proposed to  administer two separate portfolios in Northern   Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.  Maybe the Member opposite would like to adopt a partitionist approach &mdash; to  divide the body up and have two different portfolios. If he wishes to be  partitionist, I welcome that.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  He is partitionist.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><span class="BoldText">Mr Deputy Speaker</span>: Order. I  have witnessed shouting across the Floor. I will not tolerate it. Make your  remarks through the Chair, nowhere else.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><span class="BoldText">The Minister of Culture, Arts and  Leisure</span>: Organisations that are based in Northern Ireland will have to  compete for funding with organisations that are based in &Eacute;ire. As regards  special consideration that might be given, as the implementation plan is  developed, Foras na Gaeilge and its two sponsor Departments will give  appropriate, due and full consideration to the organisations that are based in Northern Ireland.  Interim funding for those core-funded organisations has been agreed until the  end of 2010. I do not believe that additional protection is required.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The second question related to the value-for-money work  that is being undertaken by the Ulster-Scots Agency. That work is under way. I  do not have details of it to hand. I am happy to write to the Member to set  that out for him.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, with regard to the Member&rsquo;s question on the delay  in bringing forward the strategy for the Irish language and the Ulster-Scots  language and culture, that matter was not discussed at the meeting of the  North/South Ministerial Council because it is purely a Northern Ireland  matter. It is not a matter for the Irish   Republic, &Eacute;ire.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member wishes to know why there have been delays. The  strategy has two key elements, which are the same as for any minority language  anywhere in Europe. As the Member will be well  aware, they are education and broadcasting.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I await a resolution of the education situation,  and I require clarification on broadcasting so that we can move ahead on those  matters. Once I receive a resolution from the Department of Education, we will  be in a much better position to progress issues, which I have always been keen  to do. There has been no delay on my part; the delay has been caused by matters  that are outside my control.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">11.30 am</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Browne</strong>:  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement. Will he explain what has caused the delay  in publishing the North/South Language Body&rsquo;s annual reports and accounts?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: The accounts for 2000 and 2001 &mdash; right back to  the establishment of the North/South Language Body &mdash; were qualified by the  Northern Ireland Audit Office. There was a delay in signing off the body&rsquo;s  consolidated accounts, and that eventually happened in 2004. As a result of the  delay, the 2000 reports and accounts were not published until 2005. Subsequent  annual reports and accounts were also delayed, because the Northern Ireland  Audit Office must audit accounts chronologically. The body&rsquo;s 2001 report was  published in June 2006; the reports for 2002 and 2003 were published in May  2007; the 2004 report was published in February 2009; and the 2005 report was  published in February 2010.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">At the NSMC meeting on 26 May 2010, the Council requested a  further progress report for the next NSMC meeting in language sectoral format.  At the 26 May meeting, Ministers were advised that the consolidated 2006 draft  accounts are expected to be cleared in June 2010 and will be laid in the  respective Houses as soon as is practicable. Ministers also noted the progress  that is being made on the annual reports and accounts for 2007 to 2009.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McClarty</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his statement and congratulate him on his  pronunciation of the Irish Gaelic, which he spoke almost like a native.  Obviously, his time spent with Minister Ruane has been very constructive.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister mentioned the ongoing progress in improving  the governance of the Ulster-Scots Agency. Is he now confident that the  taxpayer is receiving value for money from the Irish language bodies that are  funded by his Department? What ongoing assessment does his Department make of  the value that society derives from those bodies?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: Support for the Irish language body comes  largely from the Irish Republic &mdash; &Eacute;ire &mdash; and the contribution from Northern Ireland  is considerably smaller. The value and benefits that the Irish language and  Ulster-Scots agencies bring to society have to do with the value of culture.  What value do we place on our traditional cultures and on cultural diversity? I  strongly believe that if we are to get the best value, whatever the language or  cultural tradition, it must be done in the context of a shared and better  future. That is why one of the key elements of the strategy that I will bring  forward in the near future, once those other matters have been resolved, is the  vision of a shared and better future.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">For example, there are issues about co-operation and  collaboration between the two parts of the cross-border language body that  could be worked on and further enhanced. There are issues about creating better  respect for, and recognition of, cultural diversity. If we are to get value,  that must be at the heart of the matter. It is generally recognised that there  is value in promoting cultural traditions, which is partly what makes Northern Ireland  distinctive and contributes to our richness. If that is the case, the promotion  of cultural traditions should be encouraged. Is the work of value? Is it of  merit? I believe that it is, and I am sure the Member does as well.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire as  na freagra&iacute; a thug s&eacute; go dt&iacute; seo. Ba mhaith liom an cheist seo a chur air  anois: arbh fh&eacute;idir leis an Aire &mdash; &oacute;s eisean at&aacute; freagrach as an Ghaeilge &mdash; a  fh&aacute;il amach ar son an Tion&oacute;il cad &eacute; mar a dh&eacute;anfar an &pound;8 milli&uacute;n at&aacute; ar f&aacute;il  don teanga a dh&aacute;ileadh?

      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Minister for his statement. During the meeting,  was there any mention of the &pound;8 million that is available for the Irish  language in Northern Ireland?  Can he ascertain on behalf of the House how and by whom that &pound;8 million will be  dispersed, when it will become available to community groups and what criteria  will be used in its dispersal?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: The money to which the Member refers is, I  presume, the money that was handed over by the Government at Westminster. That money does not come through  my Department; therefore, I have had no involvement in that.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his statement. He referred to the introduction by Tha  Boord o Ulster-Scotch of a new community workers scheme. Perhaps the Minister  would like to elaborate on that. He also stated that the Council noted the  improvement in corporate governance and accountability in the agency. I have  been in the company of an individual who did some work for the Ulster-Scots  Agency and was having difficulty getting payment for that. I hope that the  improvement in corporate governance and accountability has not led to that  individual being left without remuneration for the work that was carried out.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Culture,  Arts and Leisure</strong>: The Member will, I am sure, agree that it is absolutely  essential for any public body handling public money to have standards of  governance that are as high as they can possibly be. I note that the Member  nods in agreement with that; we are of one mind on that matter. Regarding the  particular issue that has been brought to his attention, I suggest that that  should be followed up in the normal way. If he wishes to write to me to raise  the matter or raise the matter with the agency he can do so.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member also asked about the revised financial  assistance scheme, which was introduced some time ago. Primarily, the scheme  provides financial support for music and dance tuition and other forms of  training to the Ulster-Scots community. We also reported that funding is  available under the community workers scheme, and eight awards have been made  to groups across Northern    Ireland through that scheme. They have  benefitted from it because it has enabled them to have some administrative  support to enable them to take their programmes up to a higher level.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">One of the key issues for me, which was highlighted by my  predecessor Gregory Campbell, is that of capacity building. We need to build up  the community infrastructure, and that needs to be done incrementally. The  scheme was a stage in that process. I said that the groups that received  funding were based in Northern Ireland;  I should have pointed out that Derry and  Raphoe Action extends across the border.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Miss McIlveen</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his statement. Have either he or his Department given  any direction to the Ulster-Scots Agency on how it should proceed  strategically?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: It is important that an organisation has good  governance and a clear strategy. Therefore, on receipt of the Ulster-Scots  Agency&rsquo;s draft business plan for 2010, I commented on how it might improve its  plans and priorities. I asked the agency to consider four main issues in  developing further its 2010 business plan.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">First, the primary focus of the Ulster-Scots Agency should  be the high-level promotion of Ulster-Scots culture, heritage and language to  local and international audiences. Secondly, the agency should have a target in  its business plan to develop high-level strategies to ensure that its work is  carried out strategically and that funding decisions are made in a clear,  transparent and efficient manner. Thirdly, the agency should have high-level  explicit targets in its business plan for the development of the Ulster-Scots  community in respect of infrastructure and capacity. Fourthly, the agency has a  key role to play in the cultural marketing of all things Ulster Scots. That  will require proactively building practical working relationships with other  public sector organisations, such as the Arts Council of Northern Ireland, NI  Screen, and Craft NI. The high-level objective around that should be built into  the business plan.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I would like to see the agency putting specific strategies  in place to enhance and develop Ulster-Scots projects and activities and the  appropriate funding being allocated to advance the themes. I believe that that  is appropriate in areas such as fostering east-west relations with our  neighbours and friends in Scotland.  I am determined to ensure that the Ulster-Scots Agency is fit for purpose, that  it delivers value for money, that it takes a strategic approach and that it  reflects the needs of the community that it serves. The agency has given a  commitment to review its publication strategy, or at least to create one, and I  am keen for that work to be taken forward.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Leonard</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. First, does the Minister accept  that the lack of an Irish-language strategy is a serious issue and that the  NSMC machinery has thought seriously about that, given that one of its major  bodies is worried about it? Does he also accept that the last time that he was  asked about the issue he said that it was only an education problem, whereas he  said today that it is an education and broadcasting problem and that he needs  more information? Those changing and evolving stories about why there is not an  Irish-language strategy seep into the confidence of the community concerned,  which honestly thinks that all the excuses for the lack of a strategy are simply  a ruse and have more to do with a party position than a ministerial  responsibility.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, as regards the specific issues raised at the  meeting, will the Minister confirm to the Assembly the specific reasons for the  lack of progress on some of the body&rsquo;s annual reports and accounts, given that  we are still looking to its 2006 accounts in 2010? Will he give us information  about where the problem lies specifically?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: The first issue that the Member raised was not  dealt with at the NSMC meeting, which I indicated earlier, and, in answer to a  colleague, the Chairperson of the Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure, I  explained that there were reasons for that. One of those reasons was the fact  that the strategy falls within the remit of the Assembly under education. I am  keen to bring forward a strategy to the Assembly and the Executive that covers  the Irish language and Ulster-Scots language and culture. Both of those will  come together and be forwarded to the Assembly and brought to the Executive at  the same time. I indicated that that strategy has been delayed because we  needed to see some progress and commitment in the education system to the  cultural rights of children from the Ulster-Scots community.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Rights are for everybody, and it is wrong that one cultural  community in Northern    Ireland should be denied its cultural  rights. I am sure that the Member does not wish to see anyone being denied his  or her cultural rights. We must ensure that there is progress in the field of  education, and that is an area on which I have been working. However, progress  been somewhat slow. Nevertheless, I will continue to ensure that we get to the  point where the cultural rights of the children from the Ulster-Scots community  are accommodated and implemented in the education system. Members will be aware  that the strategy is a cross-departmental one that requires buy-in, commitment  and resources from a number of Departments.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">11.45 am</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I have previously dealt with the delay in bringing forward  annual reports. There was a long delay at the beginning of the process, back  when the North/South Language Body was established. However, we are now  catching up and resolving those matters. That is slightly more complex than  might otherwise be the case, because there are two parts to the body.  Therefore, the accounts for Foras na Gaeilge and for the Ulster-Scots Agency  have to be brought together.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Let me reassure Mr McClarty, who has now left the Chamber,  that my pronunciation is very much assisted by the fact that people very kindly  give me a phonetic explanation of how to pronounce some of the terms involved.  I am very grateful to the people who do that.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his statement. He referred to the programme about &lsquo;The  Hamely Tongue&rsquo; that was on TG4 on 20 January 2010. However, I am concerned that  TG4 had no presentation or promotion of the Ulster-Scots language before 20  January 2010 and there have been no Ulster-Scots programmes on TG4 since. I,  and many other Ulster-Scots enthusiasts, of which there are many thousands,  wish to see Ulster Scots promoted on TG4 and down South. Therefore, will the  Minister tell the Assembly what steps he is taking to ensure that Ulster Scots  finds the right balance and is promoted, and that the moneys are spent? Will  Ulster Scots be promoted for its enthusiasts in the Republic  of Ireland and Northern Ireland?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: Some of the funding for TG4 programmes comes  from the Irish-language broadcast fund and some of it comes from funding that  is available from the Government south of the border. I am aware of the  benefits of the TG4 programme, and I commend TG4 for commissioning, producing  and broadcasting it. My comments on the matter reflect the Member&rsquo;s own concerns  and touch on the broadcasting issue that was raised earlier. We need to see  progress by public service broadcasters on the delivery of Ulster-Scots  broadcasting in Northern Ireland  and the rest of the United    Kingdom. At least there has been a programme  on TG4.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  I am sorry that the Minister touched on that point before I could. The TG4  programme was filmed in my constituency in the area around Cairncastle. I was  delighted to see that programme on TG4. As some of my colleagues know, I am an  avid TG4 viewer. I missed my cowboy picture that night; however, I saw the  Ulster-Scots programme. The programme highlighted for me the fact that Ulster  Scots is so far behind the development of the Irish language. Does the Minister  envisage that some of the issues that he has discussed and brought to the  Assembly will help Ulster Scots to catch up with the Irish language?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister made a point about broadcasting. Following on  from Jim Shannon&rsquo;s question, what steps have been taken to ensure that the BBC  and UTV, which appear to have endless resources to move to other parts of the  Province, do something for the Ulster-Scots community?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: I repeatedly met the BBC on the matter.  Ulster-Scots organisations, including the Ulster-Scots Community Network &mdash;  previously the Ulster-Scots Heritage Council &mdash; and the Ulster-Scots Language  Society, along with individuals from the Ulster-Scots community, have strongly  and repeatedly lobbied the BBC on the issue of broadcasting. Mark Thompson, the  former chairperson of the Ulster-Scots Agency, has also repeatedly lobbied the  BBC. However, to date, progress has been extremely limited. If my memory is  faulty, I apologise, but I recall only two programmes about the Ulster-Scots language  in the past decade. That is simply unacceptable and untenable, and it breaches  the principles of equality and diversity that lie at the heart of a shared  future. We have recognised diversity; let us have the equality. There are  people in the Chamber who talk a great deal about equality. Sometimes, however,  when it gets to the point of delivering equality, whether that relates to  broadcasting for the Ulster-Scots community or to education issues, more work  needs to be done.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire as  ucht an r&aacute;itis sin. Baineann an cheist at&aacute; agam don Aire leis an phl&eacute; a bh&iacute;  aige i dtaobh an fh&oacute;raim agus i dtaobh Fhoras na Gaeilge lena chomh-Aire &oacute;  dheas.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Minister for his statement. My question relates  to the Minister&rsquo;s discussion with his counterpart, Minister Carey, on the  future of core funding for the Irish-language organisations that were mentioned  earlier. Will the Minister elaborate on that discussion and tell us whether he  underlined the different contexts in which some of those organisations work?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: The approach is to move away from the extensive  number of organisations for which core funding is almost ongoing towards  ensuring that the organisations address the key priorities that Foras na  Gaeilge identified; hence the identification of certain themes. Groups will  then have the opportunity to tender for work in a particular sector.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Others are more familiar with the Irish-language world than  I, although I am becoming much better acquainted with it. My impression,  however, is that there has been duplication in the past, and, without  identifying the exact location in the Republic, I will cite a simple example.  Three organisations were located in the same place, and all were there to  promote the Irish language. They occupied separate buildings and duplicated  each other in a number of ways. Yet the point was made that people had nowhere  to sit down, socialise and talk to people in Irish. That highlighted the need  for a more strategic approach to identify the themes and to determine how the  needs within those themes can be met.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As I said earlier, we must adopt a highly strategic  approach to the emerging and developing Ulster-Scots community and to the  existing Irish-language community. That is particularly true now that resources  are coming under increasing pressure. Such an approach will benefit the  Irish-language community in the long run.</p>
      <p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="a4"></a>Executive Committee Business</p>
      <p class="H4StageHeading">Budget (No. 3) Bill: &nbsp;Suspension of Standing Orders</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel (Mr S Wilson)</strong>: I beg to move</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That Standing Orders 31(d), 37, 39(1) and 42(5) be  suspended in respect of the passage of the Budget (No.3) Bill.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Finance and Personnel (Ms J McCann)</strong>: Go raibh maith  agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. At its meeting on 2 June 2010, the Committee  heard evidence from senior Department of Finance and Personnel (DFP) officials  on the Budget (No. 3) Bill. In addition to the normal request for accelerated  passage, DFP sought the Committee&rsquo;s support in suspending several Standing  Orders. The suspension of Standing Orders 31(d), 37 and 39(1) dispenses with  the need for Further Consideration Stage, and the suspension of Standing Order  42(5) dispenses with the 10-day minimum requirement for completing all Assembly  Stages.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee did not consider the request lightly. In this  mandate, there has been only one example of Standing Orders associated with the  passage of a Bill being suspended. That was in March 2010 and was in connection  with the Budget (No. 2) Bill, which provided legislative authority for the  allocation of resources to the new Department of Justice. When moving the  motion to suspend Standing Orders at that time, the Minister of Finance and  Personnel outlined what he considered to be the exceptional circumstances that  resulted in the need for a more restrictive timetable to enact the Bill.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">That approach was line with the Committee on Procedures&rsquo;  recommendations in 2002, which came about as a result of the only formal review  of the Assembly&rsquo;s legislative process. The review recommended that, when the  Executive needed to introduce emergency legislation, the Standing Order that  requires a minimum of 10 days for a Bill to pass all its required stages should  be suspended. At that time, the view of the Committee on Procedures was that  only emergency Bills should pass in less than 10 days.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">After an evidence session on 2 June 2010, the Committee for  Finance and Personnel agreed to consider the matter further at its meeting of 9  June. At that meeting, the Committee received advice from the Clerk Assistant  on the procedural considerations around the Department&rsquo;s proposal for the  suspension of Standing Orders. It also took evidence from DFP officials, during  which Committee members noted the Department&rsquo;s argument that the suspension of  Standing Orders is to ensure that the opening position of 2010-11 be approved  by the Assembly as quickly as possible and before the June monitoring round, which  will amend the opening position. Therefore, Committee members sought to  establish whether the suspension of Standing Orders was necessary to ensure  that the Bill progress through the Assembly before the summer recess and that  it receive Royal Assent by 31 July 2010. Committee members also queried how the  current circumstances differ from previous occasions and, particularly, why the  process was running slightly behind schedule compared with previous years.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee is aware of the potential consequences for  Departments&rsquo; spending and public services should the Bill not progress through  the Assembly before the summer recess and receive Royal Assent by 31 July 2010.  In that context and after careful consideration, the Committee agreed to  support DFP&rsquo;s request to dispense with Further Consideration Stage by  suspending Standing Orders 31(d), 37 and 39(1). It also agreed to the request  to suspend Standing Order 42(5) so that the Bill can pass all its legislative  stages in less than 10 days. However, I emphasise that the Committee&rsquo;s support  for the suspension of the said Standing Orders in this instance is conditional  on its not being regarded as setting a precedent for applying such measures to  future Budget Bills.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee is conducting an inquiry into the Assembly&rsquo;s  role in scrutinising the Executive&rsquo;s Budget and expenditure. The plenary  process that is associated with the Budget and Estimates forms part of the  inquiry&rsquo;s considerations, and I do not wish for the outcome of any aspect of  that work to be pre-empted. That said, on behalf of the Committee, I support  the motion.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I thank the Chairperson for her remarks. I also  thank the Committee for agreeing to the suspension of Standing Orders to enable  the Bill to pass more quickly.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to make a number of points to provide assurances. I  know that the Committee has been provided with assurances, but they bear  repetition in the House. We are at the end of what has been a long process for  this Budget Bill. We recently had extensive discussions about the Budget. The  Committees discussed it and, on 20 April 2010, the revised programme of  expenditure for 2010-11 was debated in and approved by the House. The Supply  resolutions were, of course, debated for about four hours yesterday, during  which the contents of the Budget (No. 3) Bill were also reflected. Therefore,  extensive discussions about the Budget (No. 3) Bill have taken place in the  House and in Committees.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, the passage of Budget Bills is recognised as something  unique. That Standing Order 42 makes provision for the exclusion of the  Committee Stage and for accelerated passage for Budget Bills indicates that  they merit special consideration.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Thirdly, there is limited scope at this stage for  amendments to be made to the Bill. Indeed, it is my understanding that the only  amendments that could be made at this stage are those to provisions on  borrowing powers, and I suspect that it is unlikely that any amendments along  those lines will be proposed.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">12.00 noon</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">For all those reasons, the request for accelerated passage  is not unreasonable. There has been extensive debate, the Assembly recognises  the uniqueness of Budget Bills, and the possibility of amendment is fairly  limited. One other point to make is that suspending Standing Orders in this way  will not in any way limit the Assembly&rsquo;s ability to debate the Budget (No.3)  Bill, because there is no time limit on the debate. Therefore, the suspension  of Standing Orders and the reduction of this stage to eight days should not  impair Members&rsquo; ability to give their views on the Budget (No.3) Bill.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As the Committee Chairperson mentioned, were there to be  any delay in passing this legislation, we would find ourselves in a situation  where the time for getting Royal Assent to the Budget (No.3) Bill would be  tight. That would have implications for Departments. The Bill would also be  overtaken by the June monitoring round, so changes would be made to the opening  position before the Bill had even received final approval from the Assembly. I  think that that would be discourteous to the Assembly. The Committee  Chairperson mentioned that we have inherited our timetable from direct rule and  that it has operated over decades. There has been some delay this year, and we  all know that the special considerations that had to be taken into account  caused the delay in getting the draft Budget and the whole process started.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that, as we engage with the Committee in examining  the Budget process, we will be able to work out a method of dealing with Budget  Bills, perhaps without the vain repetition that is sometimes made. We need to  look at that. Members spoke about it in yesterday&rsquo;s debate, and they may do so  again today. As we look at the Budget process, I hope that the need for  accelerated passage and the suspension of Standing Orders becomes less frequent  in future.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Committee for its support and understanding. I  hope that the explanations that I have given to the Committee and now to the  House will enable Members to vote for the suspension of Standing Orders for  this Bill.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Before we proceed to the Question, I remind Members that this  motion requires cross-community support.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved (with cross-community support):</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That Standing Orders 31(d), 37, 39(1) and 42(5) be  suspended in respect of the passage of the Budget (No.3) Bill.</p>
      <p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="a5"></a>Executive Committee Business</p>
      <p class="H4StageHeading">Budget (No. 3) Bill: Second Stage</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel (Mr S Wilson)</strong>: I beg to move</p>
      <p class="Q3Motion">That the Second Stage of the Budget (No. 3) Bill [NIA 26/09]  be agreed.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I will confine my remarks to a few main points and the  general principles of the Bill. The debate follows the Assembly&rsquo;s approval  yesterday of the Supply resolutions for the expenditure plans of Departments  and other public bodies, as outlined in the 2010-11 Main Estimates and the  approval of two Excess Votes for 2008-09.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is worth restating that the 2010-11 Main Estimates and,  therefore, the Bill reflect the Executive&rsquo;s revised 2010-11 spending plans  approved by the Assembly on 20 April 2010, as well as the demand-led annually  managed expenditure (AME).</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Following on from the Vote on Account on the Budget Bill of  2010, the Budget (No. 3) Bill provides the balance of cash and resources to  complete the requirements of Departments and public bodies for the opening  plans for 2010-11. As pointed out yesterday, the Bill does not make provision  for the new Department of Justice, the Office of the First Minister and deputy  First Minister or the Public Prosecution Service. Full-year provision for those  Departments was made in the Budget (No. 2) Act (Northern Ireland) 2010, which was  passed by this Chamber prior to the Easter recess.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As Members are well aware, accelerated passage is needed  for logistical reasons and to ensure that Royal Assent is achieved prior to the  summer recess. In addition, the legal authority that the Bill confers on  Departments and other public bodies to spend the cash and use the resources  will ensure a seamless continuation of public services for the remainder of  2010-11. I am glad that the Bill can be given accelerated passage because the  Committee for Finance and Personnel has confirmed that, in line with Standing  Order 42, it is satisfied that there has been appropriate consultation with it  on the public expenditure proposals in the Bill. On several occasions during  the formation of the Executive&rsquo;s revised 2010-11 spending plans and in recent  weeks, the Committee took evidence on the Main Estimates, the Statement of  Excesses and the Bill. Once again, I am grateful to the Committee for its  assistance.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The purpose of the Bill is to give full legislative effect  to the 2010-11 Main Estimates and the 2008-09 Excess Votes approved through  Supply resolutions yesterday. Copies of the Main Estimates volume, the  Statement of Excesses, the Budget (No. 3) Bill and the explanatory and  financial memorandum have been made available to Members.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">For the benefit of Members and in accordance with the  nature of Second Stage debates as envisaged under Standing Order 32, I will  briefly summarise the main features of the Bill. The purpose of the Bill is to  authorise the issue of a further &pound;7,019,163,000 from the Northern Ireland  Consolidated Fund and the future use of resources totalling &pound;7,569,483,000 by  the Departments and certain other bodies listed in schedules 1 and 2 to the  Bill. Those amounts are in addition to the Vote on Account that the Assembly  passed in March. The sums to be issued from the Consolidated Fund are to be appropriated  by each Department or public body for services as detailed in column 1 of  schedule 1 to the Bill, while the resources are to be used for the purposes  specified in column 1 of schedule 2 to the Bill. In addition, the Bill sets the  limit on the use of accruing resources, both operating and non-operating, for  2010-11, and column 1 of schedule 2 specifies the purposes for which they may  be used.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">After the Bill receives Royal Assent, the Department of  Finance and Personnel will, under section 8 of the Government Resources and  Accounts Act (Northern    Ireland) 2001, lay a minute in the Assembly  that specifies the accruing resources within the limits set in the Bill and  that directs their use.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 2 authorises the temporary borrowing by the  Department of Finance and Personnel of &pound;3,509,581,000, which is approximately  half the sum authorised by clause 1 for issue out of the Consolidated Fund.  That limit prudently allows the Department of Finance and Personnel to manage  the cash throughout 2010-11 efficiently and effectively. However, I stress that  it does not provide for any additional cash to be paid out of the Consolidated  Fund or convey any additional spending power. The daily management of the cash  is an important function of DFP to ensure the daily supply of cash to  Departments that enables services to be delivered, while ensuring the minimum  drawdown of the Northern    Ireland block grant.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 5 makes good the excess of &pound;16,272,049&middot;74 from the  Consolidated Fund for the year ended 31 March 2009 and appropriates it for  services by the Department for Employment and Learning and the Department of  the Environment, as detailed in column 1 of schedule 3. In its eleventh report  of this session, the Public Accounts Committee has recommended, on the basis of  its examination of the reasons for the excesses, that the Assembly provide the  necessary amounts by means of an Excess Vote. Clause 6 removes from the statute  book the Budget (Northern Ireland)  Order 2007 and the Budget Act (Northern    Ireland) 2007, which are no longer  operative.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As I stated earlier, in addition to the two Excess Votes,  the Budget (No. 3) Bill reflects the additional cash and resources required at  this stage of the financial process to enable the delivery of Departments&rsquo;  detailed spending plans, as set out in the 2010-11 Main Estimates, which were  approved yesterday. As discussed in yesterday&rsquo;s debate, this opening position  for 2010-11 has already been undermined by the Chancellor&rsquo;s announcement on 24  May. Difficult monitoring rounds lie ahead in deciding how to manage the  reduction in our block grant and dealing with emerging pressures during the  remainder of the financial year. At the same time, the Executive and the  Assembly need to develop plans for the next Budget period, 2011-14. An extremely  busy and challenging few months lie ahead. On that note, I will not take up any  more valuable debating time on the substance of the Budget (No. 3) Bill, but I  will be happy to deal with any points of principle or detail that Members wish  to raise.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Finance and Personnel (Ms J McCann)</strong>: Go raibh maith  agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I will first speak on behalf of the Committee,  but then I will make some comments on some of the debates that have been  ongoing, particularly yesterday.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">At its 2 June meeting, the Committee for Finance and  Personnel took evidence from senior DFP officials on the Budget (No. 3) Bill,  the general principles of which are being debated today. The Committee took  further evidence from departmental officials on 9 June, but that session  primarily focused on matters of process. As outlined, the Bill provides for the  balance of cash and resources required to reflect departmental spending plans  in the 2010-11 Main Estimates, which, in turn, are based on the Executive&rsquo;s  revised 2010-11 spending plans, which were approved by the Assembly on 20  April.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill does not include provision for the Department of  Justice, the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister or the  Public Prosecution Service, as the Main Estimates for those Departments have  been approved as part of the process for devolving policing and justice.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Budget (No. 3) Bill also includes provision for excess  cash requirements by the Department for Employment and Learning and the Department  of the Environment for 2008-09 that were not anticipated in the 2008-09 spring  Supplementary Estimates. The Committee noted that this matter had been  considered by the Comptroller and Auditor General and by the Public Accounts  Committee, which recommended that the necessary sums be provided by Excess  Votes in the Assembly. The relevant Statutory Committees have been informed.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee is aware of the potential consequences for  departmental spending, should the Bill not progress through the Assembly before  the summer recess and receive Royal Assent in July. In that context, the  Committee agreed that the Bill could proceed by accelerated passage, on the  basis of being satisfied that it had been consulted appropriately on the Bill&rsquo;s  public expenditure proposals, in accordance with Standing Order 42(2). On 11  June, I wrote to the Speaker to confirm that.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">12.15 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee is mindful of the concerns raised by other  Statutory Committees about the lack of engagement by their respective  Departments on the review of departmental spending plans for 2010-11.  Therefore, before approving accelerated passage for the Bill, the Committee  sought assurances from the Minister that steps will be taken to ensure that  consultation and transparency are improved for future Budget processes. I am  aware that the Minister shares the Committee&rsquo;s frustration with the varying  degrees of engagement and consultation between Departments and their respective  Committees. Therefore, I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s call to his Executive colleagues  to engage early and meaningfully with their Committees and his call during  Question Time yesterday for Ministers to work collaboratively with their  Committee when bringing forward proposals during the Budget 2010 process.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee will soon publish its report on the second  part of its inquiry into the Assembly&rsquo;s role in scrutinising the Executive&rsquo;s  Budget and expenditure. The report is intended to be a positive and useful  contribution to the discussion on the Budget process. I reiterate the Committee&rsquo;s  long-standing appeal for a formalised Budget process that details the timing of  various events in the Budget cycle. The pressures on public spending, which are  likely to increase following the British Chancellor&rsquo;s Budget statement next  week, add weight to the need for a formalised Budget process that is  transparent, allows for full public consultation and fully respects the House&rsquo;s  role and processes in Budget and financial scrutiny. Strategic decisions can be  made only if the Executive adopt a medium- to long-term approach, and that can  only be done effectively when proper processes are in place.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">With respect to the more immediate issue that is before us,  on behalf of the Committee, I support the general principles of the Bill.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I turn now to cover some issues that were brought up in the  debate yesterday. I am conscious that I have a view that we would be in a  better position if we had more fiscal powers. However, I do not want to get  into that subject today. I also have a view about an all-island approach to the  economic situation here. In yesterday&rsquo;s debate, the Minister asked quite a lot  for Members who were calling for new spending to tell him where the money would  come from. I want to touch on a few ways in which the Minister and the Executive  could use public spending more strategically.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I have already spoken here about public procurement, but I  want to touch on it again. Public procurement accounts for one quarter of the  Executive&rsquo;s total spend each year. When that is combined with local government  spend, we are talking about upwards of &pound;3 million a year. That level of  expenditure is an important lever that could be used more strategically as a  tool to support long-term social and economic well-being, particularly in a  time of economic recession when public expenditure is even more constrained. We  need to really drive that and use public procurement in that way. The Executive  and the Assembly can create a public procurement environment that assists  smaller enterprises in our communities in realising their full potential. That  includes the social economy sector, because it could maximise the economic and  social impact of public procurement.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I also want to talk about the social values of procurement,  and I know that that subject has been brought up here in recent weeks. If we  put that in public procurement contracts, particularly in construction,  employment opportunities can be created for the long-term unemployed and  apprenticeships can be created. I am mindful that a lot of young people are leaving  school. Skills and education are important, but a percentage of those young  people will leave school with no formal qualifications and go into hands-on,  practical work. We need to look after them by creating apprenticeships. We need  to look after those people and create apprenticeships. It would be much more  meaningful if it was put in the contracts in a social way, and targets should  be set for that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We have talked a lot about poverty and about the different  strategies that have been brought together to alleviate it. In the Welfare  Reform Bill debate yesterday, I noticed that child poverty was mentioned quite  a lot, especially the increase of severe child poverty in our society. We need  to target the money in a more strategic way so that it goes to families who  need it, particularly low-income families with children who live in poverty.  Look at fuel poverty: we need to have a staged process of social tariffs for  the elderly and for low-income families with children who suffer from poverty.  We need to look at the way in which we pay the winter fuel payment. Does  everybody need it? Can we not have a more focused view and give it to the  people who need it? We need to look at the ways in which we spend our money  because there are better ways to do it. We need to have a more targeted  approach.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">To finish, I want to touch on the likes of banking and  lending. Again, we have talked about that here. Smaller businesses are being  squeezed by banks. They are not lending them money, and they are looking for  their money back. The banks are putting people out of business and work. There  is a real opportunity for the Executive in respect of the credit unions. We  have talked about this, and I know that legislation is going through Westminster. However, it  does not have the part that is needed, whereby credit unions could reinvest in  communities and social economy enterprises, such as housing associations, which  can build social housing for people. We could make a difference to people&rsquo;s  lives. We need to look at how we are spending our money and adopt a more  targeted approach. We need to target the people who need it. I am just touching  on headlines, but I wanted to bring that in because it was brought up at the  debate yesterday. I am sure that other Members will think of other ways to  help.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We need to create employment opportunities, we need to  regenerate communities right across the North, and we particularly need to  target families who are in poverty and people who live in areas of deprivation  and disadvantage.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McQuillan</strong>:  I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill as a member of the Finance and  Personnel Committee and as a Member for East Londonderry.  The Bill will see the transfer of the remaining moneys until the end of the  financial year, which is March 2011, to the Departments and associated  agencies. Although tedious, the Bill is obviously necessary, as it grants the  Minister of Finance and Personnel the authority to do that. If we do not  approve the Bill, Departments and all other agencies will not be able to function  and will grind to a halt.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">This side of the general election, things are a little  clearer. The Tory-Liberal Democrat rainbow coalition Government will be one of  cuts, sacrifice and depression. Obviously, they are not a Government who have  come to power with a great wave of support behind them. They have lacked the  flag flying and cheering crowds that New Labour had when it came to power in  1997. The Government will be very unpopular, and I, for one, do not agree  entirely with their strategy. There will probably be people jeering and  protesting on the streets before long.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We in Northern    Ireland are now expected to take our  medicine and take our share of the burden. That seems most unfair given the  fact that everyone will have to suffer the burden of debt and increases in  taxes and the cost of living because of the mismanagement and greed of the  bankers in the City, who gambled away their money only to be bailed out by the  taxpaying public. Despite the mess that they made, they still get bonuses while  the ordinary person will suffer. We have been given the option of deferring any  cuts until next year, but we should start to make the savings now, as we are  unsure of what Westminster  will expect of us next year.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The next few years offer much uncertainty, but we must look  to the future. The focus for the remainder of this financial year must be on  rebuilding the economy, creating jobs and preparing the younger generations and  those out of work for the future. My main focus is on education and training,  as well as on assisting businesses and encouraging investment. It is important,  therefore, for the Department for Employment and Learning, the Department of  Education and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment to work  together to prepare a workforce for the future.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We also need to capitalise on tourism. I represent one of  the most beautiful parts of Northern    Ireland, and tourism has been vital to its  development. The area has hundreds of bed and breakfasts, several hotels and  many self-catering cottages and apartments. I want my constituency and Northern Ireland  as a whole to get the most out of tourism. It offers long-term benefits and  payback on investment, because tourists spend money and contribute to the  economy. I support the Bill.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Business Committee has agreed to meet immediately upon the  lunchtime suspension. I propose, therefore, by leave of the Assembly, to  suspend the sitting until 2.00 pm, when the first Member to speak will be Mr  David McNarry.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The sitting was suspended at 12.26 pm.</p>

      <p class="H4StageHeading">Resignation of Mr Ian Paisley Jnr</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I advise the House that I have received a letter from Mr Ian Paisley Jnr,  notifying me that he will resign as a Member of the Assembly with effect from  Monday 21 June 2010. I have notified the Chief Electoral Officer, in accordance  with section 35 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998.</p>

      <p class="H4StageHeading">Budget (No. 3) Bill: Second Stage</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Debate resumed on motion:</p>
      <p class="Q3Motion">That the Second Stage of the Budget (No.3) Bill [NIA 26/09]  be agreed. &mdash; [The Minister of Finance and Personnel (Mr S Wilson).]</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  Having received such news, I am not sure whether I should congratulate the  Member for North Antrim on his decision to  resign, but I hope that I will see him in the corridor and have a word with  him. It is not often that one gets an opportunity to say something in these  circumstances, but I have always found Ian Jnr to be someone whom I could talk  to and someone who would listen most of the time. I wish him well. He will be a  loss to the House, and one waits to see who his successor will be.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">When speaking on yesterday&rsquo;s Supply resolution motions, the  Minister said:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Ordinary people in the street recognise that any  reduction in the amount of money coming in every week requires them to make  certain decisions, such as whether they stop going out for meals. People who  want to go on holiday may decide not to buy a new car or something for the  house. That elementary concept seems continually to escape Members. Sometimes,  they simply want to list their favourite things on which money should be spent,  even adding those to what we spend on at present. If we were to go down that  route, our only choice would be to raise the taxes that are available to us in Northern Ireland.&rdquo;  &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Official Report,  Vol 53, No 1, p51, col 1]</span>.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">In a profound way, the Minister&rsquo;s comments  yesterday set the tone not only for this debate but, in a fundamental way, I  hope, for all our thought lines as we enter the most difficult economic times  that many of us will ever experience.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I respectfully contend that sharing and understanding the  impact that decisions made in London  will have on ordinary people here is not beyond any Member. However, we must  also consider the home-made impact and the made-in-Stormont errors on spending,  and it is surely not beyond the wit of any Member to recognise that we cannot  afford to grow the litany of spending errors as we have been doing. It is not  that we could have afforded them in the first place, but if we are to tighten  our economic belt, we must cut out the errors and mistakes.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Our Budget this year will be considered against the  backdrop of a fast-moving political situation in Westminster, with the United  Kingdom Budget, which is the first of the new coalition Government, just six  days away. Only yesterday morning, the new Office for Budget Responsibility  said that the previous Chancellor, Alistair Darling, made an overoptimistic  economic growth forecast of 3% for 2011. That office has scaled the growth  prediction down to 2&middot;6%, which translates into billions of pounds of potential  further cuts. The statement from that office will surely set the tone for next  Tuesday&rsquo;s Budget, and, put simply, it means that there is a larger hole in the  public finances than was previously thought. To what extent is the Minister  aware of the figures that the Treasury is crunching at the moment? Has he been  in touch with the Treasury about the matter, given that it arose only  yesterday? How bad does he think things look?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">This Minister in particular will appreciate that I could  not allow yesterday&rsquo;s press reports about his recent Executive paper on the  cost to other public services of postponing water charges to pass me by. Those  stories reportedly included a table with calculations based on the assumption  that full water charges would be available to the local Administration from  2011-12. It was also reported that his party leader, the First Minister,  demanded that the document be withdrawn and redrafted. Will he confirm the  accuracy of those press reports? For the sake of the House, will he also  confirm whether Sinn F&eacute;in shared the First Minister&rsquo;s view and also rejected  the paper?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I now turn to what lies ahead. The Finance Minister may now  realise the scale of the problem that we are dealing with, but what worries me  is that he may well be a lone voice in the upper reaches of the DUP/Sinn F&eacute;in  partnership. Does he believe that his fellow DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in Ministers really  have a grasp of the seriousness of the financial situation that we are in? The  situation is too serious for anyone to be playing their usual game of delaying  situations.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel (Mr S Wilson)</strong>: The Member always provokes me into  intervening. He talked of the grasp that members of the Executive have of the  budgetary considerations that we will have to face. Is the Member aware of and  does he support the calls from his own party to exempt 50% of the Budget  available to us in Northern Ireland from any of the savings and cuts that will  have to be found in the future? Does he understand the impact that that is  likely to have, especially on Departments that are designed to grow the  economy, particularly the private sector, which will be important in getting us  out of the present problems?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his intervention. I am sure that I will deal with what  he said about exempting 50% of the block grant from cuts.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">To clarify: I did not query whether members of the  Executive have a grasp of the seriousness of the situation. I was quite  specific and asked whether or not his fellow DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in Ministers have a  grasp of the seriousness of the situation. I said that because it would be very  serious if anyone was playing their usual game of delaying situations. The way  in which the decision on RPA was arrived at late last night illustrates how  continual delays can compound a situation.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Is the Minister going to do the bidding of the First  Minister and the Regional Development Minister &mdash; as was mentioned in the press  reports that I referred to &mdash; or, like the rest of us, is he waiting for  responsible action on water charges to flow down to a public who want to know  whether they should ration their budgets, as he suggested earlier on? Indeed,  are we thinking &mdash; surely not &mdash; that the public may be thinking that they need  to ration their water usage?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">When I last spoke on the Budget, on 15 February, I did so  in anticipation of major public sector spending cuts. The first tranche of  those cuts has arrived, and Northern Ireland&rsquo;s share is some &pound;128 million. That  is on top of the &pound;393 million of locally generated cuts that the Finance  Minister is already imposing on all the Northern Ireland Departments, which are  due to the black hole that he denied existed for a year and a half. That gives  a running total of some &pound;521 million of cuts for the current year. That is  before the main body of cuts to our block grant arrives as part of the pain  that the Prime Minister and others have said we will have to share with the  rest of the United Kingdom. I mention that because, at the time of the last  Budget vote, I asked the Minister to look at establishing a new method of  managing and prioritising all government programmes in Northern Ireland, across  all Departments. I hope that more frequent in-year monitoring rounds might be  possible, given the increasing sophistication of financial management  information systems. That would enable a more robust, flexible and speedier  response to emerging situations than has previously been possible.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It remains my view that we may have to move towards a more  sophisticated common overall priority system, based on a common scale for all  government spending programmes. That would place every government programme  across all Departments on a common weighted scale. Pre-agreed ratings would be  applied for key pre-agreed substantive elements of all programmes, with  relative weights for politically preprioritised factors, such as healthcare,  job creation and social need, which are intrinsic to those programmes.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister asked for some ideas. I think that I have been  giving him food for thought, and I shall now put some ideas in his direction.  The Assembly will not &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: Will the Member give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  Yes.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I need clarification, because I am genuinely  intrigued by what the Member means by attaching weightings to particular  aspects of the Budget. How does that differ from our policy of setting  priorities in the Programme for Government, which are then reflected in the  budget allocations that the Assembly makes? For example, our top priority is  growing the economy, our second priority is health and so on. How does the  Member&rsquo;s idea of introducing weightings differ from that?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  I am glad that I have caught the Minister&rsquo;s attention. When I was talking about  the black hole, his facial expression seemed to be one of confusion rather than  laughter. I am rather used to both those expressions on the Minister&rsquo;s face.  Nevertheless, they are still difficult to read.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: It was derision about the black hole.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  That is your view, but I am still right on it, Minister.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I will address the Minister&rsquo;s question on clarification. It  is important that I develop my argument, and I say this to help the Minister.  When discussing relative rates and factors that need to be prioritised, the  Assembly will not and should not tolerate a priority that would reduce the  money available to, for example, health services simply because that is what we  need to do. I am talking about the type of corporate behaviour that the  Chairperson of the Committee for Finance and Personnel, Jennifer McCann,  mentioned in reference to the Minister&rsquo;s comments yesterday. Such behaviour  should take place in the Executive if, in deference to Mr Farry, it really is a  five-party coalition.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Those weightings could either be on a numerical scale or on  a system of banding so that discussions on spending cuts could be taken and be  seen to be taken on a fair and equitable priority basis across all Departments.  That system would prevent the political nightmare scenario that can emerge  under the current system and which must be devilish for the Minister. The  current system relies on departmental cuts as opposed to overall cuts that are  imposed suddenly in a blaze of publicity in a headline-grabbing announcement by  the Minister. That mechanism is, at best, destabilising to the entire system.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The system that I propose would avoid a situation arising  that the public do not understand, in which, for example, a football club might  get a new ground while a hospital ward anywhere in the country might be closed  simply because separate Departments happen to administer those areas in such a  way. In such a scheme, the Health Minister would be able to convince  ministerial colleagues that health is a spending priority and of the merits of  sustaining spending. It would be a more professional and more corporate way to  handle the new climate of cuts that we face as a regional Administration. The  emphasis on that point is that we face the cuts as a regional Administration.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I will give way to Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n, and I see that the  Minister wants in again.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">2.15 pm</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  I thank the Member for giving way and appreciate that he needed to make his  point before doing so. He has partly answered my question. If the Member is  suggesting that we take a corporate approach to spend here, does that mean  that, for example, the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety  might take money from the Department for Employment and Learning rather than  the Department for Employment and Learning cutting its own spend and, in turn,  returning the surplus to the Executive to be spent on health? I am not on the  Committee for Finance and Personnel, but my understanding of the kernel of the  Member&rsquo;s argument is that we should direct money to where the objective need is  rather than allow Departments to, for example, put in 20 inescapable bids.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  I thank the Member for picking up on that. If she allows me to develop my  point, I hope that it will answer that question.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I thank the Member for giving way again. I know that  the Member wants to produce some fresh ideas, and I always welcome fresh ideas  and new approaches to allocating the Budget better. However, I am at something  of a loss to understand his point. He used the term &ldquo;weighting&rdquo; instead of  &ldquo;priority&rdquo;, and he outlined how he believes those weightings should be used.  However, if he considers last year&rsquo;s Budget arrangements when we made the  reallocations &mdash; they were not cuts; I want to emphasise that point &mdash; he will  see that that is exactly what happened. For example, because of the priority or  &mdash; I use the Member&rsquo;s terminology &mdash; the weighting that was attached to it, the  Health Department had the lowest reduction of all. The fact that OFMDFM and  DCAL had the highest reductions shows that I was not being partisan with the  Budget allocations. Both Departments, which have lower priorities or  weightings, received a 5% reduction in current spending, whereas the Health  Department was subject to a 2&middot;1% reduction. Therefore, DFP and the Executive  already corporately use the kind of system that the Member describes when  looking at how Budget changes might be made.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  I heard what the Minister said yesterday and what the Chairman said earlier  about developing a corporate mentality in here. I know that the Minister and  other Members may think that I am focusing on health because my party holds the  health portfolio. That is not the reason. I am doing so because I believe that  health is the priority and the House also recognises it as a priority. I do not  want to get involved in the departmental changeover through the party system or  through the fiefdoms that we have, and I do not want Members to focus on  Departments that their party is in charge of. That happens too often and is  part of the difficulties that beset the Executive&rsquo;s performance. What I am  saying is &ldquo;Let us have the corporate identity that I am talking about, but let  us cement it&rdquo;. That might become clearer as I move on.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is helpful that we are discussing this issue under a  Budget motion. Such a scheme would mean that there would be no delays. That is  crucial. There would no delays to the cuts that are deemed necessary, because  all spending programmes would be on a scheduled, prioritised list. When the axe  needs to be wielded, it would be immediately clear where it needs to fall  first. That needs to be clear to everyone. There would be no delays, such as  those that are occurring at present because the Finance Minister is refraining  from action &mdash; he cannot deny that &mdash; until he discovers the division between  capital investment and current expenditure from the Treasury.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I will also throw some questions back at the Minister,  because he has been asking me questions. I would like to raise the issue of the  real state of in-year monitoring. Some comments that the Minister made recently  seem to contradict what he said earlier in the year to the effect that in-year  monitoring had less and less money in it because of the increasing efficiency  of departmental spending. Departmental officials highlighted the inadequacy of  the ad hoc system of unplanned underspends as a proper, defensible or efficient  means of redistribution among Departments. Yet the Minister&rsquo;s initial reaction  to the spending cuts announced by the new Government was to say on 24 May to  the BBC:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;We knew it was coming down the line and when  departments surrender money through the year as they inevitably do, we can  maybe use some of that to offset these cuts that have been imposed on us.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I would like the Minister to tell us how that sits  with his earlier statement that in-year monitoring was producing less and less  money because of greater departmental efficiency.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As a member of the Finance Committee, I think that it does  a very good job in scrutinising budgets. However, the Scottish Parliament last  year set up a financial scrutiny unit in its research and support services to  enhance its Parliament&rsquo;s ability to examine the fine detail of government  spending proposals. As a member of our Finance Committee, I would strongly  welcome the availability here of such sound independent analysis, especially in  the current tight budgeting environment. I am sure that the financial scrutiny  unit will come up in the House in later discussions, and I hope that a proposal  or motion will come out of it. I hope that the Finance Committee will be the  driver for that; however, I am flagging it up now so that the Minister will  consider it. He should ask for details of that unit if he has not already done  so.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I will finish by reflecting on the headlines in today&rsquo;s  &lsquo;Belfast Telegraph&rsquo; that the free ride is over. Mike Smyth correctly  acknowledges the annual spending gap of &pound;7&middot;3 billion between the public  services that Northern Ireland consumes and the taxes paid. What does that mean  for us? A significant gap will remain, because that is the benefit to us of  being part of the United Kingdom. We must always respect that spending, and we  must always act responsibly towards it. However, as we know, things will become  more difficult, which means that we must mature as an institution in order to  hold the mature debate that the Minister would like.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We must be prepared to take tough decisions on water and  even support the Minister if he tells us what happened between him, the First  Minister and the Minister for Regional Development in relation to what he  wanted to do on water and what they would not let him do, because he has the  advantage of us all: he can say that something went on in the Executive, but he  knows that the rest of us are not privy to that information because it is  confidential. He may tell his party what goes on at Executive meetings, but I  assure him that our Ministers do not betray that confidence with us.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In tightening up those things, we must not lose sight of  our original priority, which was to grow the economy. Therefore, we must make  Northern Ireland a viable place, through growing our private sector. In saying  that, I note that reducing corporation tax has also been making the headlines  this morning as a kick-start to that revival, and I humbly welcome the fact  that others are finally getting on board with the Ulster Unionist Party&rsquo;s core messages  of fiscal responsibility and real policies to grow the private sector.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As politicians, we need to start working together to ensure  that Northern Ireland comes out of this period in a stronger position. However,  the events of yesterday and the collapse of local government reform will not  give the public much hope. I challenge the Minister to outline today the  process that the Executive intend to follow to deal with the inevitable  difficult decisions that are coming down the line, because that is what the  House needs to hear.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. The Member who spoke previously  referred to today&rsquo;s &lsquo;Belfast Telegraph&rsquo; headlines. However, yesterday&rsquo;s  &lsquo;Belfast Telegraph&rsquo; headlines reflected what I had to say here yesterday  regarding the &pound;300 million backlog in school maintenance. That is an indication  that there is deep concern in the community about the issue. It is an issue  that I have highlighted time and again, not only on the Floor of the House but  at the Education Committee.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Yesterday, the Minister of Finance and Personnel told us  that, since 2006-07, which was a year of direct rule, spending on capital  schemes had increased by around 28% and that 25 schemes totalling around &pound;700  million had been completed by then. That is good; I welcome that investment.  However, I notice from the figures on capital spend that the Education  Committee received from the Department that the projected spend for 2010-11  tells a far less pleasing story. It is a story of a year-on-year reduction of  33&middot;2%. Given that &pound;100 million is needed for essential health and safety work  in schools and that there are 600 applications in the pipeline to the value of  &pound;45 million for minor works, the &pound;10 million bid by the Minister in June  monitoring will not make much of a dent in the overall requirement.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: The Member is correct that there has been a  reduction in the capital budgets. I think that the reasons for that, namely the  fall in capital receipts on which some of the capital spend was predicated,  have been well rehearsed. Does the Member recognise that building costs have  dropped substantially? In fact, many capital projects are coming in at 20% less  than the 2007-08 and 2008-09 prices. Therefore, in real terms and on the  ability to deliver projects, the gap is not as large as the Member has  described.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his intervention, and I sincerely hope that what he  says is true. There is still quite a gap. Primary schools are probably worse  off than the post-primary phase, because the majority of investment over the  past 10 to 15 years has been in post-primary schools and the grammar school  sector in particular. I think that we are seeing further slippage in the  Executive&rsquo;s investment delivery plan. That cannot be satisfactory to the  Executive, considering that the economy is one of their priorities, as the  Minister said, and capital schemes impact positively on the economy, especially  on the building sector.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">2.30 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As I said, there is deep concern in the community, and not  just among school groups that await newbuilds. Indeed, the Education and  Training Inspectorate commented adversely in several reports on conditions that  teachers and pupils in some schools endure. Furthermore, the Health and Safety  Executive expressed concern over schools that have been inspected and found to  be below acceptable standards. Therefore, urgent work needs to be done.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Earlier in 2010, consultation took place on the way forward  for special educational needs and inclusion. I must say that that was one of  the most controversial consultations that the Department of Education ever  conducted. In fact, it was so controversial that the deadline for submissions  to the consultation had to be shifted at least twice in order to ensure that  all interested parties had time to respond.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Among all the advocacy groups that represent children with  special educational needs, it was difficult to find even one that supported the  introduction of the proposals. I note that, even though the consultation has  finished, responses to it have not been analysed yet, nor have they been shared  with the Committee for Education. Despite that, the Minister proposes to spend  &pound;25 million on capacity building at a time when teaching posts are in danger;  literacy and numeracy teams are having to be dismantled; and special teaching  assistants&rsquo; posts are in question.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We are told that &pound;8&middot;5 million is to be spent in each of the  three years 2010-11, 2011-12 and 2012-13 as a result of the findings of the  review of special educational needs and inclusion. As I said, that process of  review and consultation has not finished. At this stage, even though the  Department of Education has allocated considerable resources, it cannot tell  the Assembly in detail how it proposes to spend that money. On the one hand,  the Department says that the money is being spent as a result of the review&rsquo;s  findings. On the other hand, it is unclear and vague about developments that  might emerge from the review.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I ask whether there is enough clarity in the Department&rsquo;s  thinking to warrant spending such a large resource on something that is  shrouded in controversy and about which the Department itself is so unsure.  Surely there is a strong case to be made for waiting until the consultation  phase is properly completed. The Department should then assess on that basis  what is needed, how much it will cost and how money should be spent.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">If the Minister does not do that, what is the point of  consultation when the intention is to ignore responses and to push ahead with  original proposals, regardless of what parents, teachers and professionals say?  Surprisingly, the Department of Education, in a note to the Committee, states  that future resource allocation to special needs can be made only after full  analysis of consultation responses and development of lower-level policies,  including any legislative change that may be required. Surely the proposed &pound;25  million resource should be subject to at least the same caveat that any future  spend is subject to. Under the current circumstances, it would be much more  sensible, given my scenario about the huge backlog in school maintenance, to  delay the &pound;25 million spend on capacity building and redirect it towards the  schools estate, minor works and capital build, where it is needed at present.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It has been difficult to assess the Department of  Education&rsquo;s budget. On the one hand, officials quite often tell Members one  thing, and, on the other hand, the Minister appears in the House and tells us  something different. That is confusing not only for Assembly Members and  Committee members, but for people in schools who are waiting for news about  newbuilds. Perhaps the work that is being undertaken by the Committee for  Finance and Personnel in its effort to improve the Budget scrutiny process will  bring about an improvement in that situation. I live in hope.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  Today&rsquo;s debate will inevitably be over&shy;&shy;shadowed by events elsewhere in  Northern Ireland and in London. Nevertheless, the subject of the debate is  critical to the future of Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to make a number of points, and I will endeavour to  avoid repeating anything that was said yesterday in this rolling debate. We  must first acknowledge the public expenditure context in which we are  operating. This Budget reflects the &pound;370 million in cuts or efficiencies that  the Executive had to make. I fully accept that that is partly the outcome of  events having knocked our budgetary assumptions off course. That is perfectly  understandable, but I reiterate that, even making allowances for that, from our  perspective, there were already financial distortions in the Northern Ireland  Budget. Indeed, some decisions that the Executive took in their early days  compounded rather than addressed those distortions. I am a member of a party  that is a now a member of the coalition, so I have to restrain my criticisms of  the Executive and make my comments in a much more constructive context. I hope  that I have always tried to do that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We are faced with looming Treasury cuts in this financial  year and in the coming years between 2011 and 2014. This year&rsquo;s Budget will lay  the ground for the way in which we tackle even greater challenges that will  follow in those coming years. It is worth noting that there has been a rapid  switch in government policy across Europe from fiscal stimulus to address the  downturn towards austerity. Although there always was a range of views in the  UK domestic debate, more people have moved towards paying the debt end of the  spectrum than had been the case before the problems in Greece and the other  so-called PIGS countries in the euro zone.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">That said, there is a sense in some quarters, and  particularly among some economists, that the pendulum is swinging too far and  too rapidly in the other direction. Northern Ireland&rsquo;s heavy dependence on the  public sector leaves us open to the dangers of a double-dip recession. Much of  the outworkings of those debates will take place at a national and European  level, and, in some respects, Northern Ireland will be the subject of decisions  that are taken elsewhere. Nevertheless, we should still be mindful, with the  limited tools at our disposal, of the need to have counter-cyclical policies to  ensure that we are able to manage the last days of the recession and protect  ourselves as best as possible from the local risk of a double-dip recession. In  doing so, we should not lose sight of the importance of trying to rebalance our  economy. In using those scarce resources, there is always a tension between, on  the one hand, simply trying to manage demand in the short term and, on the  other hand, managing how we invest, restructure and modernise our economy at  the supply end of the spectrum.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the comments that were made a few months ago by  the Finance Minister in his speech to, I think, an audience in Dundalk, when he  set out some of those views. I have been promoting such an approach in this  Chamber for some time, and I welcome the thrust of what the Minister had to say  at that time.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In relation to public expenditure choices locally,  yesterday I spoke about the importance of having to bite the bullet in raising  additional revenue. The Minister, quite rightly, challenged me by asking  whether that was the only perspective that the Alliance Party had to offer. It  is certainly not, and I promised to try to give a slightly more rounded view on  what we can do in Northern Ireland. The first point that I will make is that  every Government in our situation would have to consider a range of both  revenue-raising and cost-cutting measures. What should divide Governments is  the balance that they adopt between those two approaches. The concern that I  have had for some time is that in Northern Ireland we have tended to put all  our eggs in the one basket of cutbacks and expenditure, rather than seeking to  move on a broader front.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the thrust of what the Finance Minister has been  saying, particularly in recent months, and his beginning to recognise that we  need to look at both those aspects. Clearly there is a challenge to drive out  inefficiencies in our own Budget. There is also a challenge to ensure that we  bring public opinion with us. We have to rise to those challenges sooner rather  than later; within the current financial year if possible and, if not, certainly  when we are laying the groundwork for next year&rsquo;s Budget.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In relation to the public expenditure issues facing us, I  will mention what we have traditionally highlighted as the key distortion in  our public expenditure: the cost of division. I will just note that; people  will be glad to know that I will not go into any more detail on it. I just  remind the Minister and other Members that it is an outstanding issue that we  have to address. We certainly do not expect massive savings to be generated in  the short term, but it is an issue on which we have to make a start and plan to  realise those savings in the long run.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I also recognise that there are distortions in public  expenditure that arise from having a border on the island of Ireland. While  respecting our constitutional situation, we could be doing more on the  North/South structures to see where there is potential for shared services and  the resulting savings from those. I reiterate that my party is more than happy  to enter into discussions with other parties to explore those areas.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I also want to reflect on what Mervyn Storey was saying  yesterday about the challenge of other parties signing up to reforms in the  structures, not just in relation to the Assembly and Departments at a central  level, but in relation to the wider public sector. The Alliance Party is  certainly up for that challenge, and we have been very consistent in supporting  more efficient and reformed government over the past decade. Indeed, our 2004  paper &lsquo;Agenda for Democracy&rsquo; set out that position in some detail.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to stress the need for a little bit of caution in  relation to how far that agenda can go and the perspective that it may be a  bottomless pit or in some way cover all the pressures that we are facing. It is  something that we should be doing, but it is important that we do not lose  sight of the fact that we have to do more than simply review and rationalise  the structures of government. In some respects, the real benefit of that is not  so much financial savings, important as they may be, but a leaner, more  efficient, customer-focused government that produces more effective results and  reduces the cost pressures facing businesses and citizens in our society alike.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We also have to recognise that it is very easy to call for  a cull of quangos; however, some of them do provide important services and, at  times, it is more efficient and better for those to be delivered at arm&rsquo;s  length from government, rather than being sucked into central or local  government. I am sure the Minister will have something to say about that later;  I see him scribbling away in anticipation.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The line between front line and back office services is  often blurred, and, as a result, a lot of services fall between the cracks. It  is easy to say, &ldquo;Let us protect front line services and cut administration and  bureaucracy.&rdquo; It is important that we run lean, efficient services. However,  the notion that we can provide front line services without some degree of  management is somewhat naive.</p>
<p class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">My final point about the public sector reform agenda is  worth bearing in mind. Engaging in reform will involve transition costs that we  must bear in the short term before we can realise the bigger benefits. I do not  want to go into a wider discussion about the review of public administration  (RPA) now, because that is a debate for another time in the Chamber. However,  that is one feature of the debate on the present situation.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">It is important that we appreciate exactly what we mean  when we talk about efficiency savings and cuts. To me, efficiency savings are  about productivity gain and getting greater output from the same input or  maintaining the same output with less input. Cutting back, doing less or  increasing fees or costs of a service is not an efficiency; that is simply  doing something differently, less often or at greater cost or bringing in more  money to cover costs. We need to be mindful of that kind of qualification.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The Executive have a real opportunity to make efficiency  savings by shifting the balance of resources more towards investment in early  intervention and prevention of problems. For example, if a health and social  care trust makes the call that a child must be taken into care, the state has a  statutory duty to provide for that child, the cost of which is substantial &mdash;  approximately &pound;80,000 a year. Yet, there is no statutory duty to invest in  initiatives such as Home-Start and prevention. However, if the balance of  resources were shifted to such areas, fewer children would go into care in the  first place. Therefore, if we front-load the investment of resources, we could  reduce the cost pressures faced by Departments and, in so doing, ease their  budgetary pressures.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">In a similar vein, we need to recognise the problems that  arise from Departments having a silo mentality and to explore opportunities for  greater co-ordination between Departments. If we do so, we may find more  rounded outcomes that are, in theory, less expensive. We need to give more  attention to that area in order to find savings.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">In addressing these theoretical themes, for want of a  better term, I wish to compare the profile of expenditure in Northern Ireland  with that of other jurisdictions, particularly neighbouring ones. I am a strong  defender of devolution, and I recognise that devolution is about local people,  through local representatives, making choices on priorities for public  expenditure. Nevertheless, in so doing, we should not lose sight of what is  happening elsewhere and of best practice in those places. The Treasury&rsquo;s Public  Expenditure Statistical Analyses tables set out the differences in expenditure  per capita across the four countries of the United Kingdom and provide us with  the opportunity to see different patterns. When we look at those tables, we  must ask ourselves whether or not the distortions and differences shown are  justifiable given the particular circumstances in Northern Ireland. If they are not  justifiable, that would point to the need to find more savings in certain  areas.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">From memory, I think that we are spending less per capita than  elsewhere on areas such as transport and environmental protection. That is  evident from our infrastructure and our attitude to the environment. However,  in areas such as education, we are spending proportionately more than we should  be spending. The anecdotal evidence on the ground shows that cuts in education  are causing real problems and are biting at a local level. That begs the  question; where are we going wrong with education provision to have put it in  such a tight financial situation? The answer may lie in the overall provision  of school buildings and facilities. We need to be bold with respect to  rationalisation and do it on a cross-sectoral, rather than piecemeal, basis as  is happening at the moment.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Northern Ireland  has much higher health needs than other parts of the UK, which justifies the  historically high level of expenditure here. However, the challenge is to  address those differentials and health inequalities so that we reduce the cost  pressures facing the Health Service, while always recognising that changing  demographics will have a counterbalancing effect and create increased cost  pressures as people live longer.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Looking to the future, I think we must try to remember the  importance of protecting our public services. Also, we should not lose sight of  the Assembly&rsquo;s primary responsibility to grow and modernise our economy. On the  latter point, it is important that we ensure that ample resources are left  available for investment in economic transformation. As I said earlier, it is  not just about investing in the demand-led side through cutting costs for  businesses; it is also about investing in the supply side. Therefore, we need  to leave sufficient resources available to invest in things such as skills and  innovation. If I were to make a plug for what I believe to be the priority for  money, that would be it.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">There is also the pressure to reduce corporation tax, and I  am not sure whether that is going to happen, but I certainly hope that it will.  In that event, financial provision will have to be made. If we view corporation  tax as being something important for making a step change in our economy, we  may have to make some tough decisions in the short term to free up resources  and cover the lost revenue under the terms of the Azores  ruling. On the other hand, I am conscious of the evolving situation around  European Union state aid rules. From that, we may no longer be able to invest  at the same level as we have in the past on items such as selective financial  assistance. Therefore, some resources may be freed up, and we may wish to  reprioritise and use those for economic development investment.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I turn now to the health budget, which is timely, as the Health  Minister is joining us. It is my and my party&rsquo;s opinion that we cannot justify  ring-fencing the health budget in Northern Ireland. That said, it is  open to the Executive to make their own decisions as to the priorities for the  protection of front line services. We should not be talking about simply  top-slicing Departments&rsquo; budgets, which is what is happening in practice. We  should give some consideration to what is more important and what is less  important. Most Members will regard protecting the health budget as something  that is more important.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The danger in ring-fencing the health budget is twofold.  First, in practice, it would double the costs of, and the savings required  from, all Departments, including the economic levers that I mentioned. Secondly,  if an organisation is given an indication that it is in a standstill situation,  the incentives to look to reform and restructure are often lost. Although there  are real problems with front line health services, we are still hearing  anecdotal stories about bureaucracy and administration problems in the Health  Service. Therefore, there is still the sense that more could be done on those  issues, rather than simply cutting back on front line services.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Part of the reform process touches on early intervention  and prevention, a point that I made earlier. If proper incentives are created  for Departments, it would facilitate that type of shift in resources, rather  than circling the wagons around what have traditionally been viewed as core  services and finding savings by cutting back on services that are wrongly  viewed as add-ons, particularly community services that can make a real  difference through improving people&rsquo;s lives.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">This is a critical debate and, in some respects, only a  precursor to the fundamental decisions that the Assembly and Executive will  have to make over the coming months and years. I was somewhat critical of David  McNarry yesterday, but I found his comments today more constructive. At least  he hinted that even if the Finance Minister is not prepared to be bold and make  tough decisions on raising revenue, the Ulster Unionist Party may be prepared  to back such an approach. I encourage him to go a step further by leading and  championing the tough decisions that must be taken, rather than simply being  reactive. Nevertheless, the glass is now more half full than half empty. In  that respect, I welcome Mr McNarry&rsquo;s comments, and I look forward to hearing  the Minister&rsquo;s winding-up speech.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I suggest that the House take its ease as we move on to questions to the Health  Minister. We will return to the debate after Question Time, when the next  Member to speak will be Miss Michelle McIlveen.</p>
<p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The debate stood suspended.</p>
<p class="TimePeriod" style="page-break-before:always;">3.00 pm</p>
<p class="OralAnswers-H1Heading"><a name="a8"></a>Oral Answers to Questions</p>
<p class="OralAnswers-H2DepartmentHeading">Health, Social Services and Public  Safety</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Questions 1, 3, 5, 6 and 9 have been withdrawn.</p>
<p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Lifeline</p>
<p class="OralAnswers-Question">2. <strong>Mr  McKay </strong>asked the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety to  outline any evaluation carried out in relation to the Lifeline project. (AQO  1426/10<a name="AQO1426/10" id="AQO1426/10"></a>)</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mr McGimpsey)</strong>: A review of the  north and west Belfast  pilot telephone helpline has been carried out, and learning from that review  has helped to inform the ongoing development of the Lifeline service. The  Public Health Agency is undertaking an extensive evaluation of Lifeline. That  evaluation will cover uptake and accessibility of the service levels, public  and professional awareness of the service, impact on service users and value  for money. Interim findings indicate a high level of public support for the  provision of the service. They also show that just over half the Lifeline  callers are female and that more than half of all callers are over 25. The full  findings of the evaluation will be available in early 2011.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McKay</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his answer. Many  people present themselves to support organisations. I am thinking particularly  of the N&iacute;amh Louise Foundation and the Public Initiative for the Prevention of  Suicide &amp; Self-Harm (PIPS). When people present themselves, those  organisations are not obligated under their contracts to deal with them unless  they have been referred by Lifeline. Therefore, people have to contact Lifeline  before they can contact one of those organisations. Does the Minister agree  that that is an anomaly that must be urgently addressed?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I have said many times that  voluntary and community groups play a vital role in that essential interface  between community and statutory services.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Lifeline began in January 2008 and, to date, has received  180,000 calls, which is far in excess of anything that we anticipated. The age,  location, gender and issues of callers exceeded our expectations. By extension,  outcomes of interventions also exceeded expectations. For example, 33,000  wrap-around support service sessions have been provided to clients as a result  of those calls. Voluntary and community groups, including, for example, PIPS,  which is changing its name to Lighthouse, have played an important role in this  process.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I am not aware of anomalies. I do not believe that  everything that we do is absolutely perfect. Part of the evaluation will look  at such issues, and groups will be able to make those points.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>: An  important matter is at stake. The Lifeline service refers people to CHILL &mdash;  Counselling, Help and Information in Lifestyle and Living. Given the tragedy in  Newtownards, will the Minister assure us that he will continue to support the  excellent work that his Department is doing to provide counselling services to  vulnerable young people, particularly those who are at risk of solvent abuse?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I am happy to give that  assurance to Mr Bell. He made an important point, particularly about the tragic  circumstances surrounding the recent death of Darlene Bell in Newtownards.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">A key part of the Investing for Health strategy, which was  the subject of question 1, which was withdrawn, is our drug and alcohol  addiction services. They address wider issues, such as solvent abuse,  particularly among young people. This society is facing a serious issue, which  the Health Department or social services cannot solve by themselves. It is a  cross-departmental issue and one on which I continually work with other  Departments in an attempt to make improvements and to decrease the numbers of  people affected. Drug and alcohol abuse can result in the tragedies that we are  seeing among young people. Vulnerable young people can also fall victim to  solvent abuse, which can also lead to tragedies, as was witnessed recently in  Newtownards.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gardiner</strong>:  I commend the Minister for his work in this area. Does he agree that more  funding is required to help out this service? I wish to place on record our  appreciation to all those who have helped, but funding is required.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: The resource plays a key part in  Lifeline. I invest &pound;3&middot;5 million per annum in it, and a further &pound;3&middot;2 million in  specific suicide prevention measures. I am always looking at ways to extend our  work and to get a better penetration of the relevant peer groups. There has  been a very good response to Lifeline, but it is only one of a wide range of  measures that we undertake, no one of which will, on its own, solve our  problem. Statistics for 2006-09 show a drop in the numbers of suicides, but we  have a long, long way to go. I am by no means complacent, nor is the service.</p>
<p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Out-of-hours GP Service: Limavady</p>
<p class="OralAnswers-Question">4. <strong>Mr G  Robinson </strong>asked the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety  whether he will examine other services in which to reduce expenditure in order  to retain the out-of-hours GP service in Limavady. (AQO 1428/10<a name="AQO1428/10" id="AQO1428/10"></a>)</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I do not propose to examine ways  of reducing other areas of primary medical services expenditure, as  out-of-hours services will continue to be provided from the Limavady  out-of-hours centre. As I have previously advised the Member, and emphasise  once again, out-of-hours services will continue to be provided in Limavady.  Patients will continue to have access to the out-of-hours service and will be  able to see a GP if appropriate.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Robinson</strong>:  Why is the Minister allowing this vital front line service to be cut? It is the  equivalent of a 40% cut. At present, five doctors operate it; after 1 July,  that will be reduced to three doctors. If that is not a cut, I do not know what  a cut is.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: There is a history of questions  and answers with Mr Robinson. I thought that I had gone a long way to  explaining the situation.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">This is certainly a change in the service. At Limavady, we  are getting two calls per night in the red-eye shift. From 12.00 midnight until  8.00 am, two calls per night require a doctor consultation. We will provide  three GPs on call and three on duty. Three GPs will be active and three will be  on backup. In addition to that, we will put in a triage nurse to receive those  calls. These measures will also produce substantial efficiencies and savings;  we anticipate savings of &pound;600,000 per annum. It is costing us &pound;1,000 per night  to maintain a doctor to have a consultation with about two patients, and that  cannot be justified. We pay around &pound;5,000 per month to one GP in the area to  maintain the service.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">It is an expensive service, but the point is that it will  not be withdrawn. We will merely change the location of the GP. That is all  that will happen. There will be three GPs on duty, three on call and a triage  nurse to receive the calls. The service will continue, and I am confident that  it can be maintained at its current standard.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Leonard</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Does the Minister accept that the  figure that he has cited for the shift beginning at midnight takes no account  of the usual workload between the hours of 11.00 pm and midnight? Will he  confirm that the nurses have not been trained to the appropriate standards for  the commencement of the diminished service? Does he further accept that the  public will see this as a cut, not as a reconfiguration? Will he confirm why he  will not meet a delegation from Limavady that I have asked him to meet, on the  basis that it can just go along and see a person who has already addressed a  public meeting? Does the Minister accept that there is major disappointment  that he will not open his doors so that members of the public can express their  concerns about what they see as definite cuts?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I am concerned about the level  of scaremongering in that part of the world. There has been scaremongering on  rapid response vehicles (RRV), the so-called shutting down of the Causeway Hospital and, more recently,  out-of-hours services. I hear that the latest scare is about untrained nurses.  The behaviour of some Members in that respect is, quite frankly, disgraceful.  People must look at the situation rationally. The out-of-hours service is not  being withdrawn from Limavady. That service is being maintained, and it is  adequate.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">People who want to talk to those who put the service in  place should start with the trust. There are legitimate concerns about what is  happening, but those should be raised with the trust. I repeat that the service  is being maintained, and the only difference is that the GP will come from a  different location. There will still be enough GPs to handle the two calls a  night to the out-of-hours service, and savings of about &pound;600,000 will be made.  The Member supported that when he voted for efficiencies. The particular  efficiencies at Limavady will not harm the service.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I wish that Members who were scaremongers about RRVs and  the Causeway Hospital would stop their scaremongering  about the out-of-hours service. Who hears anything now about RRVs or the Causeway Hospital?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>: I  listened carefully to the Minister, and I assure him that I am not in the  business of scaremongering. The Minister said that trust was important. Does he  agree that not having a consultation process on the change to the service was a  bad mistake? Does he accept that Limavady is an area that tends to lose  services? Some years ago, it lost its accident and emergency service, and now  its out-of-hours doctor service seems to have gone.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">There is a general need for reassurance that the service  that is in place will work. We were told that when a patient is at a crucial  stage and in danger of losing his or her life, a doctor could move from  Strabane to Limavady.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I speak positively, because I appreciate the work that the  Minister has done for the Health Department. On most occasions, he has  delivered what I asked of him.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: The trust does consult, but, in  this instance, it is not changing the service, only the way in which it is  delivered. The service remains the same, in that an out-of-hours GP service is  provided between midnight and 8.00 am. The out-of-hours service does not deal  with people who are in life-threatening situations. That type of emergency is a  matter for A&amp;E and the Ambulance Service.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I am not aware of when the A&amp;E department disappeared  from Limavady, but accident and emergency services have been rationalised to  the benefit of the population. As Members know, it is not simply a matter of  what is contained in the accident and emergency department, but the services  that exist behind it. A proper A&amp;E department requires paediatrics, acute  surgery and an intensive care unit. An A&amp;E department without supporting  services behind it would be catastrophic.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Questions 5 and 6 have been withdrawn.</p>
<p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">NHS Dental Services</p>
<p class="OralAnswers-Question">7. <strong>Mrs  Kelly </strong>asked the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety for  his assessment of the equality of access for patients to Health Service dental  treatment. (AQO 1431/10<a name="AQO1431/10" id="AQO1431/10"></a>)</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I am content that there is  equality of access for all groups of Health Service dental patients across Northern Ireland.  I have approved the recruitment of 38 additional Health Service dentists in  areas where access was problematic. The initiative has been successful and has  greatly improved access to Health Service dentistry. Furthermore, the community  dental service provides care and treatment for patients who have special needs  and are unable to access dental services in the high street. My officials are  negotiating a new contract with the British Dental Association Northern Ireland  that will further improve access to services. That contract will be piloted  next year.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his response. Will the Minister assure the House that  the new commissioning arrangements for 2010-11 will not have any adverse impact  on dental services? As a former healthcare worker, I know that dentists and  dental hygienists used to be able to enter residential homes and statutory  day-care centres to provide services to people in care. It was a good idea to  have a dental clinic in an outreach centre. Has the Minister any thoughts on  the provision of that service, which, I understand, is no longer available?</p>
<p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: On the latter point, we have a  community dental service to provide care for patients with special needs, such  as a learning or physical disability, including those in nursing homes. A  dental contract negotiation is under way, and I regret that I have been unable  to see that brought to fruition.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Members will be aware that dentists are private individuals  who can set up shop and take on business wherever they wish. I hope that, in  future, as part of a contract, we will commission dental services where we want  them; in other words, where there is need, so that we place dentists much more  accurately and carefully, rather than leave their location to market forces. It  is vital that we are able to commission dental services in a particular area,  and that is one way in which I have looked at how we tender for dental  services. In Northern    Ireland, more than 50,000 patients in a  number of hot spots are outside National Health Service dentistry. I have  tendered for and contracted a dental provider to provide services specifically  in those areas.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his response. Children are key when it comes to  equality of access for patients. The Minister and other Members will probably  agree with me that it is vital that dental treatment is available and easily  accessible to children at school. Will the Minister assure me that that dental  treatment is available to children inside and outside school?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: Of course children are an  important focus of dental services, as they are for all health and social  services care. As for children&rsquo;s dental services, I am negotiating a new dental  contract with the British Dental Association. I have put a tender in place with  Oasis Dental Care to deal with the hot spots and those 50,000 patients who are  outside Health Service provision. As part of that, we registered 273,000  under-18s with dentists. I will continue to look carefully at how we deliver  treatment and prevention, which, for children, will be a key part of the new  contract. It is important that the emphasis is on prevention rather than  treatment because Northern Ireland  children have the worst dental hygiene in the UK.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  In response to the Minister&rsquo;s answer to Dolores Kelly&rsquo;s question, does the  Minister wish to express concern about Dundonald? There were two dental  practices within about 200 metres of each other, but, suddenly, a third dental  practice was permitted to open between them, which could adversely affect the  village&rsquo;s existing dental practices.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: Dundonald was identified as one  of the hot spots. Some 18 months or two years ago, the same questioner might  have stood in the House to complain that patients in Dundonald were unable to  access a dentist. I am glad to say that they are now able to do so, but I will  keep the situation there under control. A new contract with the British Dental  Association, which we are negotiating at the minute, is a key way to deal with  such issues.</p>
<p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Health Budget 2010-11</p>
<p class="OralAnswers-Question">8. <strong>Mr  McCallister </strong>asked the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety  for his assessment of the decision to reduce his Department&rsquo;s budget for  2010-11 by &pound;113m. (AQO 1432/10<a name="AQO1432/10" id="AQO1432/10"></a>)</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: In spite of having to deliver  Northern Ireland-made cuts, I have striven to ensure continued healthcare  provision. However, that has simply not been possible in all areas. Crucially,  I am not able to sustain the previous standards for waiting times, nor will I  be able to introduce all my plans for new services and treatments. The  important thing now is that the Health Service is not subjected to further  cuts, which would cause pain and distress to the most vulnerable groups in our  society.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I am grateful to the Minister for his response. Does the Minister agree that it  is time that the Executive carried out a needs analysis of the Departments?  Given that demand for health services has risen by more than 20% in the past  couple of years, does he accept that it is time that we looked at ring-fencing  health spending?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I remind Members that if they want the possibility of being called to ask a  supplementary question, they must rise in their place each time the Minister  finishes speaking.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I agree with the thrust of Mr  McCallister&rsquo;s question and the points that he raised. The fact is that demand  has risen. The fact is that many of the Members who voted to impose &pound;700  million of efficiencies on the Health Service also voted recently for a Budget  that includes &pound;128 million of Health Service cuts. How anybody imagines that  the Health Service can stretch itself and deal with increasing demand &mdash; Health  being the only Department that must do so &mdash; escapes logic. I hear Members who  voted for cuts complaining about those cuts; they would do well to address that  contradiction. To put it another way: we have cradle-to-grave healthcare that  is free at the point of delivery, but we also have a state monopoly, so if the  state is not prepared to deliver the service, where should patients go to get  it? They cannot get it anywhere else, so they suffer pain and distress. In many  areas, that is the situation that people are in.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Givan</strong>:  The Minister will be aware of the I CAN centre in Ballynahinch. There is some  confusion about which Department is ultimately responsible for funding that  service. Will the Minister confirm whether it is the Department of Health,  Social Services and Public Safety in conjunction with the Department of  Education? Furthermore, will he ensure that, through the trust, his Department  provides that service?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: To go off topic a little: yes,  the Health Department undertook to provide a speech and language therapist at  the I CAN centre, and it will continue to do so. The Department of Education is  required to provide the premises, teacher and classroom assistant, and that is  where the difficulty lies. As I understand it, the Department of Education is  unable or unwilling to do that. For two years in a row, the local trust stepped  in to provide support and to maintain the service. It is not in a position to  do that now. Nevertheless, the speech and language therapist, provided by the  Health Department, continues to be available at the I CAN centre. However, as  part of the package, we require the premises, teacher and classroom assistant.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  I am sure that the Minister will acknowledge that the SDLP did not vote for the  cuts. Given that we are all looking to achieve efficiencies in the system, will  he confirm that tens of millions of pounds of bonuses will not be paid to  consultants this or next year?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I can confirm that no bonuses  will be paid to consultants. We do not pay consultants&rsquo; bonuses.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Question 9 has been withdrawn.</p>
<p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Gastroenterology</p>
<p class="OralAnswers-Question">10. <strong>Dr  Farry </strong>asked the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety for  his assessment of the current number of gastroenterologist consultants in the  Health Service and the hours of service they provide. (AQO 1434/10<a name="AQO1434/10" id="AQO1434/10"></a>)</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: Across the five trusts, 30  consultants &mdash; adult and paediatric &mdash; are working in the gastroenterology  service. I am aware of one gastroenterology general internal medicine vacancy  in the Western Health and Social Care Trust. There is also a vacancy in  paediatric gastroenterology in Belfast.  Both posts are being recruited for actively. Of the people who are waiting for  gastroenterology procedures, 93% have been waiting for less than the target  inpatient waiting time of 13 weeks, and all outpatients for the service have  been waiting for less than the target outpatient waiting time of nine weeks.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Staffing levels in individual specialities are the  responsibility of trusts, based on the needs of the population that they serve.  My Department carries out regional workforce planning to help to ensure that  there are sufficient, suitably qualified staff to meet the needs of the  population overall. Recent workforce forecasts indicate that there are  sufficient numbers in junior doctor grades to meet the demand for consultants  across the workforce as a whole over the next five to 10 years. Those forecasts  will be reviewed regularly and, where necessary, corrective action will be  taken.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his answer. He will be aware of the public concern about  the gap in provision in Belfast,  which, as he outlined, is now being filled. However, there is also concern  about a lack of service provision in the Royal Belfast   Hospital for Sick  Children. In light of the Minister&rsquo;s comments on workforce planning, to what  extent is his Department making general assessments of gaps in consultant  provision in Northern    Ireland? The general impression from the  public is that there are gaps in the provision of service in key specialities.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: A paediatric gastroenterologist  has left the Royal   Belfast Hospital  for Sick Children, which is recruiting to fill that post. In the meantime, it  has locum and other support. Therefore, in fact, the gap has been filled. Mr  Farry is fond of talking about gaps. In his previous address to the House, I  noted that he said that he would not be prepared to ring-fence the health  budget. However, he is prepared to ring-fence the policing and justice budget,  so, as far as he is concerned, prisoners come before patients.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">As far as specialities are concerned &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. Members should allow the Minister to continue.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: We have a number of highly  specialised low-volume areas that are very difficult to sustain because we  cannot operate large teams. This means that we end up with single-handed  services, which makes them vulnerable. Therefore, we rely on other tertiary  centres in the rest of the UK  and in the Irish Republic. The service operates as a  network, which is the only way in which it can work.</p>
<p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Mid-Ulster Hospital:  Accident and Emergency Unit</p>
<p class="OralAnswers-Question">11. <strong>Mr D  Bradley </strong>asked the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety if  his Department plans to extend the opening hours at the accident and emergency  unit at the Mid-Ulster   Hospital. (AQO 1435/10<a name="AQO1435/10" id="AQO1435/10"></a>)</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: From Monday 24 May 2010, the  accident and emergency units at the Mid-Ulster  Hospital and Whiteabbey Hospital  became nurse-led minor injury units, operating from nine to five, Monday to  Friday. I have, however, asked the Northern Health and Social Care Trust, in  conjunction with the Health and Social Care Board, to consider the feasibility  of extending the opening hours of those minor injury services. In the coming  weeks, I will be advised of the outcome of the board and the trust&rsquo;s  assessment.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Will the Minister assure us that the  extended hours will apply until the new A&amp;E facility that has been promised  for the Antrim Area Hospital  is in operation?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I have asked the board to look  at the possibility of extending the hours. That is the situation as it stands.  The hours will remain at that point until I have the report, the feasibility  and the expense.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Antrim   Area Hospital&rsquo;s  A&amp;E unit is coping very well, despite scaremongering. By consolidating the  A&amp;E staff at Antrim and introducing new beds, and generally extending the  service, it is coping very well. By 5 June, there were no waits in excess of 12  hours, and the four-hour performance target time was 82%. That is rising all  the time, so we are seeing real improvements. Indeed, I talked to an A&amp;E  night sister at the recent nurse of the year awards who assured me again that  the scaremongering that we read in the papers is not the case. Antrim A&amp;E  is coping very well. However, it requires major investment in the fabric of the  building, but that is out of my hands; it is a matter for the House. Perhaps  Dominic Bradley would be kind enough to assure me that he will support  investment.</p>
<p class="TimePeriod" style="page-break-before:always;">3.30 pm</p>
<p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="a9"></a>Executive Committee Business</p>
<p class="H4StageHeading">Budget (No. 3) Bill: Second Stage</p>
<p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Debate resumed on motion:</p>
<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That the Second Stage of the Budget (No. 3) Bill [NIA  26/09] be agreed. &mdash; [The Minister of Finance and Personnel (Mr S Wilson).]</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy  Chairperson of the Committee for Regional Development (Miss McIlveen)</strong>: In  the absence of the Chairperson, it is left to me to bring out the begging bowl  on behalf of regional development and to use this opportunity to underline the  importance of providing adequate resources for regional development in Northern Ireland.  We must take cognisance of the economic pressures under which the Assembly  needs to operate in the current climate, and we must also be aware that pockets  are not quite as deep as they used to be. Previously, we complained about those  pockets not even being deep enough.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Sometimes, it is all too easy to be parochial in our  approaches to matters affected by the Budget. On the other hand, it is  important to express the impact that reduced allocations can have on the often  vital services being delivered by Departments, particularly in regional  develop&shy;ment. I am saying that to set in context the views of the Committee in  relation to the debate.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The infrastructure investment programmes and transport  services provided under the auspices of regional development underpin all  aspects of life in Northern    Ireland, be they social, economic or  environmental. The people of Northern    Ireland need and deserve the very best that  we can provide in public infrastructure and services. High-quality, efficient  and integrated roads and public-transport networks are essential to bring  people to work, education and training, and social services across the  Province. To connect Northern Ireland  with the rest of the world, we need sustainable and economically viable ports  and airports to bring tourists and businesses into Northern Ireland and to enhance our  ability to compete in the global economy. The everyday quality of everyone&rsquo;s  life here depends on our having reliable, efficient, high-quality and  value-for-money water and waste-water services, and the quality of the built  and lived environment depends on sound and sustainable regional development  policy.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The Committee for Regional Development continues to express  its concern that the Department is facing more than &pound;65 million in resource and  capital pressures in the current year. That funding is required to meet the  demands for the concessionary fares scheme, to maintain the street lighting  stock, to support bus and rail services and to continue to provide transport  services to older people and those with disabilities. The Committee was  disappointed that funding for important and inescapable projects, such as those  I have mentioned, is being sought through the in-year monitoring process.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Structural maintenance is a constant theme for the  Committee, which has presented its concerns about funding levels for structural  road maintenance at all available opportunities. Members are dismayed that  roads structure maintenance remains significantly underfunded. Leaving aside  the road safety issues that I am sure the Assembly supports, the Department  indicates that, in purely value-for-money terms, it costs four to five times as  much to carry out reactive maintenance as opposed to proactive treatments.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">As Members will be aware, the Snaith review, a recent  independent review of structural maintenance, found that around &pound;108 million a  year was needed to maintain the structural integrity of the entire network at  good practice resurfacing frequencies. Structural maintenance for 2009-2010 was  around &pound;85 million, which is &pound;23 million below recommended levels. The  allocation for this year of circa &pound;70 million is, again, below the recommended  level. This year&rsquo;s shortfall of &pound;41 million is in addition to the existing &pound;700  million-plus backlog in structural maintenance. Underfunding for structural  maintenance cannot continue, and the quality of our road network underpins Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  competitive position and our quality of life. The impact of the prolonged  periods of severe winter weather this year has yet to be finally quantified.  However, it is clear that the condition of our roads has deteriorated seriously  in recent months.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">As we are aware, the Executive&rsquo;s top priority is the economy.  It is the Committee&rsquo;s view that prioritising the economy means prioritising  road structural maintenance. Spending on public infrastructure, such as roads  and public transport, has been shown internationally to support and to  stimulate growth across the economy as a whole. Such investment is never more  cost effective than during a period of economic downturn. The Committee would  support continued infrastructure investment to ensure that Northern Ireland  is in the best possible place to take advantage of the recovery when it comes.  For that reason, the Regional Development Committee is calling for additional  in-year funding to at least meet the &pound;108 million recommended in the Snaith  review, together with allocations to address the backlog.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Those are just some of the difficult financial issues faced  by the Department for Regional Development (DRD), even before securing future  funding for vital improvements in areas such as bus- and rail-based public  transport and improvements in the roads network. DRD can and will spend its  allocations, and it managed its capital and resource allocations well last  year. Provisional outturn figures that DFP published last week indicate that  DRD has a capital underspend approaching 0% and a resource underspend of 1%.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  At the outset, I want to comment briefly on some of the points that were made  about water charges. I know that the Minister of Finance and Personnel has been  faced with something of a dilemma in that area, particularly since 1 April,  when Conor Murphy, the Sinn F&eacute;in Minister for Regional Development, moved from  a situation in which the subsidy has run out, which everybody knew would  happen, to one in which money has to be taken from other Departments&rsquo; budgets  to fund the water service. Indeed, as far back as the previous Assembly  election, some of us suggested in our manifestos that the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in  were tying themselves in knots by claiming that they would have nothing to do  with water charges. However, the Finance Minister now has that dilemma to  contend with.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I will move on to the education sector and the problems  that it has as a result of the way the bundles are handled. I am sorry; I meant  to say the budgets, but I suppose that bundles of money are being handed out to  the different education and library boards. Under the current arrangements,  money is allocated to the schools at the front line and only passes through the  boards. The same happens with our youth services, but, thankfully, those front  line services are being protected. However, the problem is that the rest of the  education budget goes into what are called central or managed services in the  boards. We know that there are pressures in all areas, and, until we get  through this exercise, it is a pity the boards will not have clarity on the  savings that they must make this year. However, that has not prevented them  acting.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The resource budgets for special education, including those  for children with severe learning disabilities, come not from the normal  schools budget but from the centralised or managed part of the budget. That is  a pretty awkward and unfortunate arrangement, especially this year, as the  boards cannot cut front line services and must go to the centralised or managed  services. Special education is one of the areas that has been hit.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">One example of that is the recent decision to cut the  provision of summer schemes on special school premises from two weeks to one  week. There has been an outcry in the western board area about that decision,  and I am sure that the same thing is happening and has been picked up on in  other areas. The board used to provide the transport so that the children,  particularly those in rural areas, could attend those schemes. However, the  entire transport service has now been cut. That means that one week of the  special scheme has gone and that the transport for the second week has  disappeared. The result is that parents must take their children to the summer  schemes. This is carers&rsquo; week, and we know that children with severe learning  disabilities are largely cared for at home and that that is where the burden of  that work falls. Those summer schemes provide an opportunity for respite and  for parents in difficult circumstances to do other things with, for example,  other family members. However, they now find themselves unable to do that. That  must be looked at, and Finance Ministers, as we know, can sometimes round up  money at the last minute. I am hoping that it is no different this year and  that, given that we are talking about children with severe learning  disabilities, some money can be found to at this late stage to save those  summer schemes.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I want to comment briefly on the balance of resources,  which was mentioned by one or two Members, including Stephen Farry. That is an  important issue, and, if I can switch to the health sector, I will use health  centres as an example. We know that the emphasis now is on developing primary  care services and providing a much greater range of them. The benefit of that  to the economy is a reduction in the pressures on hospitals, particularly acute  hospitals. So, there are savings to be made by developing primary care  services.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Unfortunately, that often requires new premises. There have  been 42 or 45 centres identified for primary and community care infrastructure  &mdash; in other words, newbuilds. I understand that only half a dozen of those have  moved forward. If we are looking at things like the balance of resources, we  should be looking at doing more to develop primary care services, which would  lead to an overall saving in the hard-pressed health budget.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I apologise to the Minister and to  other Members for not being in for the whole debate this morning. I was here  for a good part of it, and it was fairly interesting.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The Minister of Health made a quip to Stephen Farry at the  end of Question Time about the budget for the Justice Department being  ring-fenced. That was part of the arrangements for devolution. It was very  clear to me that the Health Minister, who has responsibility for the healthcare  of prisoners, has made it clear that there is a pecking order when it comes to  delivering healthcare to prisoners. That is on the record and is something that  we will be keeping an eye on.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Tommy Gallagher made some points about the Budget. I heard  him take an intervention. Is he suggesting that the Minister of Finance, Sammy  Wilson, should go back to the position that Mr Gallagher&rsquo;s party colleague Mark  Durkan had on the reinvestment and reform initiative (RRI), the rates reform,  the Durkan tax on water? It seems to me that that is being thrown out. I am  prepared to take an intervention from Tommy if he wants to expand on what he  said, because I am quite interested in it.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  There is not much point in going back if we are trying to find solutions. I can  outline the SDLP&rsquo;s current position on water charges, which can be summed up in  four words: no new water charges.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  I am glad. I have a lot of time for Tommy, which is why I gave him the  opportunity to clarify that. It had sounded like he, along with David McNarry,  was asking us to pay twice for water. At least Tommy was given the opportunity  to clarify that.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I am on the Social Development Committee along with Simon  Hamilton. I am sure that he will cover some, if not all, of the points that he  raised in yesterday&rsquo;s debate in more detail today. Sitting on a scrutiny  Committee, one of the things that has jumped out at me has been stuff on the  formalised Budget process. In his comments today and at later stages, perhaps  the Minister can outline how that will be rolled out.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">We do get presentations from officials. We all, including  the Minister, have sat at the other end of the table and tried to draw  something down and get to the bottom of it. Like many other people here, I  consider myself to be tuned in as much as I can be. However, some of the  language just goes completely over our heads. Some of the stuff that David  McNarry was talking about earlier went over his own head, never mind anyone  else&rsquo;s. The point is that, as people are becoming more interested in democracy,  they are asking questions that sometimes seem very technical. I am not afraid  to say &ldquo;I do not know&rdquo; or &ldquo;I will go and find out for you&rdquo;. However, when I  write the question down and ask officials, I get an answer that means less and  is more confusing.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: It is deliberate.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  You are right; it is deliberate. I have arrived at the position that the use of  that language is deliberate and is an art form. It is vital that every  available opportunity to understand the democratic processes here, including  the scrutiny of budgets, is taken.</p>
<p class="TimePeriod">3.45 pm</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">David McNarry spoke about end-of-year monitoring. It is  good if less money is available at the end of the year, because it means that  the Departments are spending money properly. If less money is to be  surrendered, that seems to be a good thing. I am not from the &ldquo;no surrender&rdquo;  camp, but I understand the logic that if less money is given back, more money  has been spent. My concern is still about the spending that happens, because I  am not convinced that value for money is being achieved.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I do not expect the Minister to remember, but something  that stuck in my mind was a paper entitled &lsquo;Perspective on Social Housing&rsquo; (POSH).  It had a glossy photograph of a housing estate in east Belfast that looked great, but over &pound;1  million had been spent on a handful of houses. I do not begrudge people from East Belfast or any other constituency having a new home;  that is a good thing. However, my query is on whether that is good value for  money, and I am not convinced that it is.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Under the previous Minister for Social Development,  Margaret Ritchie, many houses were bought off the shelf to meet targets. It was  good that the targets were met, but the processes that were used to meet the  targets suggest that something is not right. Not only were houses bought off  the shelf to meet targets, more public money was put into houses to bring them  up to a public standard. It does not sit right. My colleague Fra McCann has  raised that issue consistently.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Particularly in this place, a lot of clich&eacute;s are thrown out  about the Budget. Sometimes, I can understand where they are coming from and,  at other times, they are purely political. However, something needs to be taken  out of the statement that we cannot cut our way out of a recession, and I  understand that huge challenges will come to us all. We all have to be made  accountable for those, and Ministers, in particular, will bear the brunt of  that.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I agree with some of the comments of my colleague Jennifer  McCann on procurement and social clauses. When Members such as me talk about  social clauses, Members on the other side of the House think, &ldquo;Here we go  again, socialist rhetoric.&rdquo; In fact, it makes economic sense.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: The Member is being a bit unfair, both to herself  and to the House on the issue of social clauses. All of us wish to see some  social value coming from public procurement, and, indeed, that is now formalised  in the procurement process. Frequently, I go out and look at public procurement  projects to see what is happening on the ground and to get a flavour of where  money is being spent. Especially on larger projects, I always ask whether the  project employs anyone who had been long-term unemployed or has taken on young  apprentices. Under procurement policy, there is a requirement to do that. I do  not regard that as a particularly socialist policy. It is a good investment,  because the more economically inactive people we get back into the workforce  and the more people we get skilled up for the future, the better it is for the  economy. If public money can help to do that, it is a good thing.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  I thank the Minister for that. I will be really honest, because it is not fair  to make a throwaway remark about the other side of the House. When I talked  about the other side of the House, I was talking about Members such as David  McNarry, and I was referring to his body language. Fair play to David, because  Sinn F&eacute;in has economic spokespeople on the Committee for Finance and Personnel  who are really tuned into the subject. I am tuned into it because I have an  interest in social development, while other Members talk about budgetary issues  all day every day. I can tune in and out with a bit of flexibility. One thing I  picked up on is that, when my colleague Jennifer McCann speaks, you can almost  see some Members react physically.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I accept the Minister&rsquo;s point, which is the same point that  I was going to expand on: social clauses make economic sense. They generally  target the long-term unemployed. That is not to be unsympathetic to people who  have recently been made unemployed as a result of the economic downturn. Given  that their skills have been updated recently and that they may have better CVs,  they will be better placed in the labour market than the long-term unemployed.  I have great concerns about some aspects of public procurement.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Jennifer spoke about apprenticeships, particularly for  young people, and the Minister mentioned them, too. Some of my colleagues on  the Committee for Employment and Learning, have debated motions in the House on  children and young people who are not in education, training or employment.  This is a good opportunity for them.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I will speak about social housing from a social development  perspective. Massive regeneration will potentially happen on my doorstep, and I  thought that recent events concerning the Royal Exchange were disappointing and  sad. Fra McCann knows the issue inside out and back again, but it struck me  that Belfast missed an opportunity to secure value for money and improve the  sequencing of such issues. I am sure that people from rural constituencies or  smaller towns think that that is no big shakes, because Belfast gets everything. However, there needs  to be better scrutiny of how money is spent during the Budget process, of how  Departments roll out projects and of the sequencing of big urban regeneration  projects.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I mentioned value for money. David McNarry, who is no longer  in the Chamber, spoke about corporate mentality. I asked him to take an  intervention, which he allowed. To be frank, I may need to be on the Committee  for Finance and Personnel to understand some of the language, but I still do  not understand Mr McNarry&rsquo;s perspective. I am not being flippant when I say  that. Through the Programme for Government, we agreed that the Budget should be  spent in certain ways. Regardless of the presentational differences that I have  with the Minister, the Department of Health has been historically underfunded,  and it receives more than its fair share of the Budget. I support the argument  that that is probably still not enough.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I formerly sat on the Health Committee, and I now sit on  the Committee for Social Development and the Committee for Justice. We may need  to consider other examples to see what we can do better. I accept that we have  much to learn from other devolved institutions. We could pick out some models  from them to use here. However, I am concerned about the pressing need to meet  targets. In the process of meeting those targets, more money than has been  allocated is being spent. Some big challenges need to be faced in the  monitoring rounds.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I will finish by asking the Minister to expand, if  possible, on what the formal Budget process entails. I am being totally up  front when I say that, before the Westminster  election, I was asked more questions about the Budget process than ever before.  That is positive. I do not mean questions from lobbyists or big trade unions  but from people whose schemes have collapsed or from the media. Although people  in the media may not know the language, they see the headlines that classroom  numbers are being reduced and ask questions. They may not be able to navigate  the process, but they want to know, given all the cuts and the fact that money  is not being spent, what we are doing with all the money. I would welcome an  answer to that question. The next election is around the corner, and I know  that we will be asked to explain ourselves. That is no bad thing.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Before I call Mr Givan to speak, I remind the House that, as this will be the  first occasion on which he has spoken in a debate in the House, it is  convention that a maiden speech be made without interruption.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Givan</strong>: I  make my maiden speech during very difficult financial times for the economy in  the United Kingdom, and  particularly for Northern    Ireland. As we look to the future, there  will be difficult decisions to make. Sometimes, the best way to look at how we  make those decisions and what priority we give to them is to look at what we  have done in the past. Therefore, I will reflect briefly on some of what the  Executive and the Assembly have been able to deliver for the people.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The Executive can be rightly proud of their achievements.  The extension of free transport to 60-year-olds is a benefit that we brought  in. Everybody is now entitled to free prescriptions, and I must declare an  interest as someone who has a mild form of asthma and who uses an inhaler. I am  now entitled to free prescriptions, and I am pleased about that. We have been  able to freeze the regional rate, and we have capped the level of rating on  industrial and commercial premises. We capped domestic rates. We ensured that  people who were asset rich but cash poor were protected from excessive rates on  their houses when the new valuation system was brought in. Water charging has  been deferred for a number of years, and, this year, we introduced the small  business rates relief scheme.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">As the Finance Minister has indicated, the good days are  over, and, in all likelihood, some of the measures that were taken over the  years might not have been taken now. Nevertheless, a lot of credit needs to be  given to the Executive. To listen to some programmes, one would, at times,  think that the Executive have done nothing for the people. However, the record  shows that that is not the case.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Tough decisions will have to be made as we move into the  future. Ministers are already grappling with making 3% efficiency savings, and  we know the difficulties that that has brought. In a previous role, I worked  for the Minister of the Environment, and he did not have just 3% efficiency  savings to grapple with; he had a 10% reduction in his baseline because of the  deficit in planning income from receipts. Therefore, he has had difficulty  beyond the 3% efficiency savings that other Ministers have had to find.  Nevertheless, some Ministers will complain, while others will get on with doing  the job and trying to live within their means.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Each Minister is given an envelope of funding. They make  the case for what that envelope should be, but, ultimately, when the Finance  Minister and the Executive approve the Budget spend for Departments, Ministers  are responsible for delivering that to specific areas of funding. The Finance  Minister is not a dictator. He does not dictate to Ministers that funding must  be spent in specific ways. Ministers of those Departments are responsible for  ensuring that they carry out their roles.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I agree with other Members&rsquo; comments that front line  services are key and should be protected. However, it is important that  inefficiency is driven out. I noted Mr Farry&rsquo;s comments about how, at times,  the line between front line services and backroom services can be blurred and  that it is difficult to distinguish between them. However, the exercise that  took place in the Department of the Environment (DOE) has identified a large  amount of waste, and there are processes in place to try to tackle that.  Therefore, I do not believe that the line is blurred. I believe that if there  is a willingness and a determination by the Minister and civil servants in  those Departments to drill down and drive out inefficiency, it can be done.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">We talked about the deferral of water charges. Ultimately,  it will be difficult to continue to defer water charges, but I do not believe  that their deferral should be taken as a soft option. It is difficult to  continue to defer water charges, but Members have commented that the pressures  that those difficulties place on Departments can act as a catalyst to ensure  that they drive out inefficiency. Nevertheless, the year-on-year deferral makes  it difficult for Departments to plan properly, because they are often hit late  in the cycle with a need to find additional cuts to allow the deferral of water  charges to continue. Therefore, that is an issue that we will grapple with, and  I am sure that it will be difficult to come to a resolution on it.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">There will be many issues that I will want to work on as an  MLA for Lagan Valley. One issue is investment in  schools, and we have had very considerable capital schemes in the Lagan Valley  constituency.</p>
<p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">However, other schools are crying out for work to  be done. The maintenance backlog has been mentioned in the local press of late,  and I know that it is an issue in my area. Work also needs to be done on  healthcare provision, road infrastructure, city centre investment and many  other areas, and I will endeavour to do that.</p>
<p class="TimePeriod">4.00 pm</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">In the education and health sectors, people who have special  needs require help. As an MLA for Lagan   Valley, my priority will  be those who have special health and education needs. I sat on the South  Eastern Education and Library Board and was one of the members who voted  against the budget that led to us being suspended from that board. One reason  why we did that was because it was proposed that if the board was to live  within budget, the identification of special needs in children at nursery  school was to be removed. There is no statutory obligation on education boards  to identify children&rsquo;s special needs at nursery school; that does not need to  be done until the child begins primary school and enters P1. It was proposed  that work on the earlier identification of special needs would be removed from  the budget. We felt that we could not sustain that decision. Indeed, all the  political parties on the board shared that opinion, but, ultimately, we were  suspended.</p>
<p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr McClarty] in the Chair)</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">During questions to the Health Minister, I mentioned the I  CAN centre in Ballynahinch. That facility caters for children in my  constituency and in other constituencies who have speech and language  difficulties. If we do not ensure that the most care is given to those who are  most in need &mdash; those who have not been blessed with the good health with which  I have been blessed, and for which I am grateful &mdash; it will stand against them.  I am committed to doing that work in Lagan   Valley and to trying to  build on the work that, as an MLA, former Member Jeffrey Donaldson carried out  on behalf of those people.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I will take a few moments to comment on Jeffrey Donaldson.  He is one of the hardest-working politicians whom I have come across. I know  that our Finance Minister has a similar reputation. Jeffrey will always do what  he can to assist anyone, regardless of whether the person is a party colleague  or a member of the public, and irrespective of what time of the day or night he  or she contacts him. The people of Lagan   Valley endorsed him  overwhelmingly at every election. Beyond the party vote, he has a huge personal  vote in Lagan Valley, which is testimony to his hard  work on bread-and-butter issues on behalf of those people. I am privileged to  attempt to step into his shoes and to carry on the work that he has done for  the people.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  It is a pleasure to follow my old friend Mr Givan. I know that Members would  not know it to look at him, but he and I are old friends, although I am more of  an old-timer now. From our friendship over many years, I know that he has the skills,  ability and attributes to be an excellent Member of the House. That is more  than evident from the contribution that he has made in his maiden speech.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The debate has shown what could be described as an  &ldquo;evolution&rdquo; of debates on Budgets in the House. When I first entered the House  three years ago, debates on budgetary matters could be best characterised by  Members on all sides reading lengthy wish lists. I did it, other Members here  did it, and colleagues who are not here did it.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: Some still do it.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  Some still do it. Yes, the Minister is absolutely right. It would appear that  evolution is a slow process for some. At times, all parties and all sides of  the House were guilty of rhyming off lengthy lists of what they wanted for  their constituencies and pet projects and for the Departments that the  Committees of which they were members were scrutinizing. The lists also  contained issues that affected the Ministers from their parties and those  issues that were more pertinent and relevant to them.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Thankfully, as the Minister has highlighted, that activity  has not been completely disappeared, but it would seem to have lessened in some  respects. There was an interim period during which Members seemed to complain  regularly about the Budget, saying that there was not enough money and that  there had been cock-ups, messes, foul-ups, and all sorts of things. That  characterised Budget debates for a considerable period. However, I detect a  healthy development. Members are now a little more circumspect in their  comments. They recognise our real financial and budgetary difficulties. That  harsh reality has forced Members to be a wee bit more sensible in their  contributions. We do not tend to hear the lengthy wish lists that characterised  Budget debates in the past.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Indeed, even Mr McNarry did two things that I thought I  would never see in a Budget debate. The first thing that he did was to give  way. He rarely does that. The second thing that he did was to try to put  forward many constructive proposals. At least, their intention was to be  constructive. If it is not unfair to pick out one person, Mr McNarry  characterises the growing level of maturity that exists in the Chamber.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">In many respects, Members are all in the same boat. I do  not believe that anybody thinks otherwise. We now sit in an Assembly that has a  five-party mandatory-coalition Executive, which represent well in excess of 80%  of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  people with regard to the votes cast. I am afraid that we simply cannot get  away with bailing out and blaming others any more, even though some Members  might have liked to do that in the past.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">That harsh reality has been impressed upon us by the public  spending scenario that we face. Everyone knows the difficulties that are in our  midst. Mr Givan and other Members have pointed that out. We face &pound;128 million  of in-year cuts to our Budget. It is difficult enough to face reductions in the  Budget when one has time to plan for them. To contend with cuts of &pound;128 million  in the middle of the financial year is desperately difficult.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The whole of the United   Kingdom has a deficit of &pound;167 billion, and it has been  estimated that public sector debt is likely to grow to around 75% of the UK&rsquo;s entire  GDP. There is real and genuine concern that our economy could fall into the  same trap that others have fallen into &mdash; not necessarily because of anything  that we have done but because of the domino effect of what has happened to Greece. It has  affected Spain, and other  countries, such as Portugal,  Ireland and Italy are on  the fringes of that. That domino effect could easily hit our economy as well.  Therefore, we are all acutely aware of the public spending scenario that we are  in. During the next number of days, we face an emergency Budget at Westminster that will  have a bearing and an impact on next year&rsquo;s Budget. It could well make the &pound;128  million of cuts seem easy-peasy in comparison.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">As the Minister highlighted previously, the good times have  gone. The days of sitting here and waiting for public spending increase after  increase to arrive will not happen any more. The complaining that we did two or  three years ago during the middle of those good times will be nothing compared  to what is to come during the next number of years. I mentioned the complaints  of certain Members in the House who, at times, bemoaned the Budget&rsquo;s  inefficiency, inadequacy and inability to deliver enough on this and that. We  will look back on the 2008-2011 Budget as representing halcyon days in Northern Ireland.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">If people thought that that was bad &mdash; when, year in, year  out, there were record levels of investment in public sector infrastructure in  Northern Ireland to build new roads, hospitals, healthcare facilities,  colleges, and so on, which we have seen in all our constituencies &mdash; what will  they think when that investment stops? Although it will not stop entirely, it  will not grow at the same rate that it did in the past. They will not complain  about the 2008-2011 Budget then.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">There are years of pain ahead of us, but we do have to face  those years. We can see this as a crisis, complain about how awful it is going  to be, and run about like headless chickens, or we can see it as an  opportunity. I hope that the growing level of maturity that is being exhibited  in the House turns Members&rsquo; attention to using this time as an opportunity. I  know that it is very difficult to look at the situation as an opportunity, when  we are facing the level of cuts that are being proposed and are in the middle  of a difficult public spending scenario, but I believe that there is an  opportunity for us to do so.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">When an abundance of resources is available, as was the  case, comparatively speaking, we do not always look at how those resources are  being spent. I agree with the Members who said earlier that we were ploughing  money in, but I am not entirely convinced &mdash; in fact, I know for certain &mdash; that  we were not always getting the most efficient performance in Departments, nor  were we always getting value for money. I do not want to rake up old ground and  pick old sores about the health budget, but that is a prime example of a  situation in which record increases in investment were achieved, year-in,  year-out, yet report after report highlighted the lack of productivity in the  Health Service in Northern    Ireland. We know that simply ploughing money  in did not produce the levels of output that were expected.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">In the private sector, no company will ever look at the  product that it makes unless it faces competition, profits go down, or it goes  into a loss or faces a downturn. It must be the same in the public sector: we  must take the crisis of cuts in public spending as an opportunity to do things  differently than we did in the past. That attitudinal change, which was not  really there in the past, may well be enforced on us.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">There is also a need and an increasing desire in the  Finance Committee, of which I am a member, to have that change continue into  the Budget process. Changing the Budget process will not change the amount of  money going in, but it is incumbent on this House to have as rigid and robust a  budgetary process as we possibly can. Given the constraints in which we are  going to find ourselves, and increasing public demands, we can no longer always  accept what Departments put forward. As individual Members, and on behalf of  the constituents whom we represent and who benefit from the services that are  provided by Departments, we need to get our teeth into the Budget lines that  are coming forward and the bids that are being made by Departments. The  Minister of Finance and Personnel must lead that change. We must have a Budget  process that draws in stakeholders from the outside much earlier and that  empowers individuals and Committees to scrutinise better the work of  Departments and their budgets.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly must resource Committees better so that they  have the skills and ability to do that work. We cannot simply accept  departmental budgets as being the gospel truth. We must test them to ensure  that they hit the priorities that have been set by the Executive. We must  ensure that they deliver results for people and that they achieve the aims that  we all share.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">We can talk about the difficulties that we have with public  spending and the cuts that we are facing, but we need to sharpen our pencils  and become much better at scrutinising budgets than we have been up to now. In  the past, I have read out long lists of achievements that we have made, of  which we should be rightly proud, whether they are to do with record levels of  investment in infrastructure or helping vulnerable people to obtain lone  pensioner allowance, which has helped thousands of pensioners in my constituency  to save hundreds of thousands of pounds on their rates bills. However, better  financial management by the Executive has gone unheralded even though it is one  of their biggest achievements, led as it was by the Finance Minister and his  predecessors.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">When devolution was restored in 2007, we inherited a  scenario in which there was chronic underspending, year in, year out. It was a  habitual problem. In 2005-06, the underspend amounted to approximately &pound;375  million. In 2006-07, it amounted to &pound;255&middot;5 million. In two years alone,  Departments had nearly &pound;700,000 in their budgets that they had the power to  spend but were unable to spend. That has changed drastically over the past  number of years, to the point where, in 2008-09 &mdash; the last financial year but one  &mdash; there was only &pound;50 million in underspend. Between 2006-07, which was the last  full year of direct rule, and 2008-09, &pound;200 million more was spent on public  services in Northern Ireland.  We can see devolution making a real difference and impact, with more money  being spent, rather than wasted and sent back to the Exchequer for us to bid  for again in the hope that we might get it back to spend in our Budget. There  has been much improvement in financial management, and we should acknowledge  and support that.</p>
<p class="TimePeriod">4.15 pm</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Finally, I want to pick up on some points that were made by  other Members. There was mention of an article in today&rsquo;s &lsquo;Belfast Telegraph&rsquo;,  which appears on the front page, and there is a two-page article inside the  paper. I know that there are elements of the media who were enthusiastic  supporters of restoring devolution, to the point of damning us all for being  pathetic failures for not getting this place up and running again. As soon as  the Assembly was restored, they set about trying to knock the place down again.  The perverted view of certain elements of the media never ceases to amaze me.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">That newspaper article is consistent with a theme that that  publication has been pressing for some time. On the front page, and on two  pages inside, there are all sorts of doom-laden predictions about the economy  in Northern Ireland.  There is a reference to a report by a leading economist in a First Trust Bank  publication, which states that our subsidised standard of living must end. It  refers to Northern Ireland  as a &ldquo;free rider&rdquo;, and states that we are living way beyond our means. All  those sorts of inflammatory comments might be interesting in newspapers, and  might even sell a few, although I am not sure about that, but they belie the  truth.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I am quite sick of hearing from the same people, whether  they are economists, bankers or journalists, all of whom knock the public  sector and everybody up here. No matter what party or perspective we come from,  we are all here to try our best to make Northern Ireland a better place for the  people whom we represent, and I am sick, sore and tired of us, this place and  the public sector in general being knocked by certain people in the media, when  they are very much dependent on the public sector for their employment. Economists  at banks that are now totally or majority owned by the public sector and funded  by the public purse are continually criticising the Governments here in Northern Ireland  and elsewhere for the decisions that they make, when those banks, because of  their bad decisions, have had to be bailed out by the public sector and the  public purse.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">During the recent Westminster  election campaign, a letter arrived in my pigeonhole from three local  newspapers that referred to how dependent they were on the public sector in Northern Ireland  for advertisements, how important the public sector was to them and how they  could not do without the public sector. However, they publish stories knocking Northern Ireland  and our public sector. It is high time that they looked at themselves and their  own behaviour before criticising others in Northern Ireland.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The reality is that there is a &pound;7&middot;3 billion funding gap in Northern Ireland.  Nobody hides that fact; it is no secret. We are dependent on a subvention from  the United Kingdom Government. We know that: it is the truth, it is a fact. We  cannot hide it, and nobody is trying to. No one in this place denies that that  is the case.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The article in today&rsquo;s &lsquo;Belfast Telegraph&rsquo; implies that we  are somehow special, that we are some sort of different case altogether, and  that we are a basket case alone among the regions of the United Kingdom.  However, the fact, as any sensible person knows, is that every region outside  of London and the south-east of England is  dependent on subvention from those areas. We are not different. We are like Scotland, Wales,  the north-east, the north-west, the west Midlands, the east Midlands and other  parts of England.  We are exactly the same in that respect, although it gives me no pleasure to  say it. I wish that Northern Ireland  were less dependent, but we are no different from other regions in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">It is exactly the same across the border. Are parts of the  west or south-west of Ireland  not dependent on the Dublin  economy? Similarly, the east of Germany  is dependent on the west of Germany  for sustaining it. It happens the world over. Certain publications do Northern Ireland  a disservice when they churn out such claptrap on a weekly, if not daily, basis</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I hope that, in time, Northern Ireland can make a greater  contribution and that we are not as dependent. That has been my entire focus  over the past number of years. The Executive&rsquo;s priority is about closing  productivity gaps and giving the economy a kick-start, and that is what we have  been trying to do. Thank goodness that there is devolution in Northern Ireland  and that we have the ability to address and be sympathetic to the concerns of  people here during these difficult times.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, I welcome today&rsquo;s more mature debate in the  Assembly on the issue. The style of this Budget debate has differed from those  that we have had in the Chamber in the past; no doubt that has been brought on  by the harsh realities that we face. We must look at the services, projects and  schemes that the public sector provides and some of the sacred cows that we  have with a much more critical eye than we were prepared to in the past, when  there were record amounts of funding coming into Northern Ireland. It is incumbent  on us to treat the situation that we will face in the next number of years not  as a crisis but as an opportunity to fine-tune the Government and the Executive  to make the country as efficient and effective as possible.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B Wilson</strong>:  I begin by referring to an issue that I raised yesterday: the cost of local government  reform. I declare an interest as a member of North Down Borough Council. I  welcome last night&rsquo;s decision to defer the reform of local government. It has  been clear for many months that the original drivers for RPA cannot be  achieved. The main driver for reform was savings to the ratepayer, and as those  savings cannot be guaranteed, it would have been a case of throwing good money  after bad. In the present economic state, it would be irresponsible to spend  &pound;118 million that we do not have in the Budget to fund those changes. I do not  intend to repeat the points that I made yesterday. However, I emphasise that it  is essential that we review all the priorities, policies and decisions that  were made during the good times.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">It is important that we see the Budget in the context of  the present state of the Northern    Ireland economy, which is fragile and needs  tender nurturing. A recent Ulster Bank report indicated that in the second  quarter of 2010, economic growth of 0&middot;4% was achieved and the projected growth  for the whole year is less than 1%. That indicates that economic recovery is  extremely weak and must be treated with care. That was prior to the euro zone  crisis, the Greek bail out and Mr Cameron&rsquo;s latest cuts prediction.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">In addition, the growth in the economy has been limited to  the service sector, with manufacturing and construction continuing to decline.  A major factor in the growth in the retail sector has been the influx of  shoppers from the Republic to take advantage of the weak pound. However, in  recent months, there has been a significant decline in the value of the euro,  and as a result, traffic from the Republic is beginning to dry up. If that  continues, we might fall back into recession. That is the present economic  climate.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Economic activity is extremely low. There is plenty of  spare capacity in the economy. Within the private sector, the service sector is  producing 11% below its 2007 peak. In addition, manufacturing is down by 15%  from its peak, and engineering is down by one third. That has been reflected in  the level of unemployment, which has risen for 26 consecutive months. The rate  of job loss has also been much more severe here than in the rest of the United Kingdom.  Although unemployment fell last month, that is likely to be a blip, especially  when the public sector cuts begin to hit. The Ulster Bank reports that the  level of unemployment may not peak until 2012. Therefore, that is the economic  climate in which we are presenting this Budget. Another worrying feature is  house prices. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors survey for March  2010 showed that house prices had fallen for the thirty-second consecutive  month. That is very worrying.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">We must ask ourselves how the Budget will impact on those  economic problems. What will it do to generate economic activity? How will it  reduce the unacceptably high levels of unemployment?</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">We must also consider the new political context in which we  are working, and, in particular, the cuts that were recently set out by Mr  Cameron. Mr Cameron frightens me. In comments made just before the election, he  singled out the Northern    Ireland economy for cuts. I am fearful of  the damage that Mr Cameron&rsquo;s policies will do and that they will undermine our  fragile economic recovery. His record on the economy is consistent, in that he  has been consistently wrong on all major economic decisions made over the past  20 years. It would appear that Mr Cameron hopes to maintain that record by getting  it wrong again and destroying our recovery and slashing public services before Northern Ireland  gets out of recession.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Mr Cameron&rsquo;s record goes back to 1992, when he was economic  adviser to Norman Lamont and Britain  was forced to leave the European exchange-rate mechanism. Since then, Mr  Cameron&rsquo;s right wing economic views have led him to oppose the minimum wage and  the decision to give independence to the Bank of England. We are fortunate that  Mr Cameron was not in charge during the past few years, because his policies of  refusing to help the banks and of cutting capital investment during a recession  are similar to those that were adopted following the 1929 Wall Street crash,  which turned into the Great Depression of the 1930s. It concerns me that the impact  of applying such policies to the Northern Ireland economy would be  extremely serious.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Mr Cameron&rsquo;s recent response to the Budget is, therefore,  disingenuous in the extreme. We have been faced with the worst global financial  crisis, and the Government had no alternative but to stimulate the economy.  Without those measures, unemployment could have been as high as 5 million.  There was no alternative, just as cutting public expenditure now is a measure  for taking us back into recession and increasing the hardship felt by millions  of ordinary people throughout the United Kingdom.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  Does the Member accept that there is a balance to be struck and that, in fact,  if one keeps borrowing and borrowing and borrowing &mdash; similar to an extended  credit card &mdash; one gets into trouble? Does he accept that Greece and Spain have shown particular  difficulties because of that attitude?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B Wilson</strong>:  Yes, I accept that. However, I am referring to the timing of cuts. The  situation is that, at present, before our economy has moved out of recession,  we are being asked to make further cuts.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I am always interested in the economic policies of  the Green Party, which, if followed, would destroy half the businesses in Northern Ireland.  When it comes to macroeconomics, the party is as well off as it would be with  microeconomics and how individual business decisions are dealt with.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Does the Member accept that if we continue at current  borrowing levels, there will be an impact on the economy and our recovery  anyhow, insofar as debt interest &mdash; not repaying debt &mdash; will, by next year,  amount to &pound;75 billion? That is bound to have an impact here, and the danger is  that there could be a knock-on effect on interest rates that would also impact  on businesses. If we keep on spending in the way in which the Member is talking  about, how do we get round the problem of servicing the debt without eating  into the money that is available for vital services?</p>
<p class="TimePeriod">4.30 pm</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B Wilson</strong>:  I accept everything that the Minister said. At present, the Northern Ireland  economy is not capable of taking further cuts. There will be severe cuts in the  longer term, but those will have to be phased in. It is important to get out of  recession first. We are in extreme danger of ending up with a double-dip  recession. The Tory, and now Liberal Democrat, economic policies are driven by  the need to make immediate cuts in public expenditure, regardless of the impact  on public services and ignoring the risk of a double-dip recession. Proportionately,  Northern Ireland has a  larger public sector than other parts of the United Kingdom, and that will,  inevitably, lead to a disproportionate reduction in services.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Cuts in public expenditure are essential, but not at this  stage. The introduction of further cuts now, given the earlier Budget cuts,  would lead to a significant increase in hardship, particularly as Northern Ireland, unlike the rest of the United Kingdom,  has barely emerged from recession. The economic recovery must be sustained, not  choked at birth.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The actions of the Lib Dems are particularly disappointing.  Nick Clegg went into the election with a manifesto pledge to delay spending  cuts until the time was right. He immediately caved in to Tory demands, tore up  his manifesto and became a cheerleader for instant cuts.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I remind the Member that the debate is on the Budget here in Northern Ireland, not on what happens at Westminster.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B Wilson</strong>:  Yes, sorry. Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am trying to put the debate in the  context of the pressures coming from Westminster.  Further cuts are being demanded, and that is the issue on which I appeal to the  Minister. Mr Cameron said that we could defer further cuts until next year, and  I appeal to the Minister to follow the example of his Scottish counterpart by  doing so. The Scottish Government plan to defer &pound;332 million of cuts, and their  Finance Secretary, John Swinney, said that he would defer the savings until  next year:</p>
<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;in order that we can entrench economic recovery.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">He added:</p>
<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;At a time when economic recovery is extremely  fragile, the spending cuts outlined by the Treasury risk undermining recovery  and damaging our comprehensive work to support the Scottish economy.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The Government in Scotland are saying that they  cannot impose those cuts now. The Northern   Ireland economy is much weaker and more vulnerable than  that of Scotland,  and we have already suffered cuts and made significant efficiency savings.  Enough is enough: we must follow the Scottish example and defer further cuts until  next year.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">It is not sensible to tear up budgets that have already  been allocated, and therefore, despite the reservations that I expressed  yesterday, I support the Bill. We must re-examine our priorities and reconsider  our previous decisions. We must ensure that scarce resources are allocated in  the most efficient and effective manner. Their allocation must be focused on  encouraging enterprise and expanding the private sector. In the short term, it  is inevitable that the public sector will be reduced, but that will create an  opportunity to develop new business, particularly in the green economy.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I appreciate the opportunity to  discuss the crisis and severe pressures in the budgetary position. As a member  of the Environment Committee, I will touch on how those pressures relate to  specific issues, how the Budget impacts on that Department and, more important,  how it impacts on the public.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP did not vote for the current Budget when it was  drawn up alongside the Programme for Government in 2007. We had significant  concerns then about the implications of indiscriminate efficiency savings being  imposed on Departments and, consequently, on front line services. The year 2007  followed a decade of uninterrupted economic growth in the North, which we hoped  would continue. The year-on-year increases in public expenditure and the  booming land and property market resulted in bumper capital receipts.  Therefore, the economic analysis on which the Budget was based &mdash; in hindsight,  it was utterly defective &mdash; made assumptions of steady economic growth. Indeed,  many Departments were confident of continued growth at unprecedented levels and  expanded their staff numbers and expenditure. For example, current problems in  the Planning Service resulted from the presumption that those levels of growth  would continue ad infinitum. There were numerous wasteful projects and  ridiculous wastes of additional public money.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">In recent days, I highlighted the hundreds of millions of  pounds that have been spent. Further questions will be asked about the review  of public administration, which has cost &pound;113&middot;5 million to date. We had  Workplace 2010, the failure to establish the Education and Skills Authority and  the failure to progress the Maze stadium. The Planning Service expended a huge  amount of money on the Electronic Planning Information for Citizens (e-PIC)  project, which continues to accrue additional expenditure. All those projects  have cost us very dear.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Well over a year ago, in &lsquo;New Priorities in Difficult  Times&rsquo;, the SDLP highlighted the black hole in the Budget finances. Crucially,  we also highlighted the areas in which funds could be raised. The Assembly is  now struggling with the additional cuts to our Budget of &pound;128 million or more,  with much more to come. The SDLP never claimed that our document was the  finished article, but it was worthy of stimulating a serious debate, and no one  else brought forward ideas for economic development.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">When that document was published, it received grudging  respect and, indeed, some positive comments from other parties in the Assembly,  even including the current First Minister. The implementation of those  proposals to assist the Budget is better late than never, and I welcome reports  from my colleague Alex Attwood that the Executive are now considering some of  our proposals. For example, we put forward ideas such as tackling senior civil  servants&rsquo; pay, the pay of senior staff in quangos and the role of certain  quangos. Ridiculously high bonuses were paid to civil servants, even on foot of  poor performance. That is a serious situation and an awful indictment of the  Assembly&rsquo;s scrutiny of the Civil Service. We now all know that an inflated  number of 39 senior civil servants who received high bonuses were based in DFP.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Another prime example that we highlighted was the role that  the Belfast Harbour Commissioners could play in assisting infrastructure  projects. Yesterday in the House, the Finance Minister confirmed that:</p>
<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;There is a mechanism by which the cash reserves of  the Belfast  port can be accessed to fund infrastructure projects.&rdquo; &mdash; [Official Report, Vol  53, No 1, p33, col 1.]</p>
<p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">It is imperative that we build on some of those  ideas. We must re-examine ways to invest more resources into areas that will  sustain and grow employment during the recession and will position our economy  to enable it to capitalise when the recovery comes. We must also show some  leadership in bringing about that recovery. We must find ways for the Budget to  help to create jobs, especially in the construction industry, which, given the  constituency that I represent, I highlight continually.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">There must be an in-depth examination to find Budget  savings in the public sector, with a particular focus on senior salaries and  perks. At the same time, we must protect front line services for vulnerable  communities and people. In the past couple of weeks, I witnessed how cuts have  impacted on vulnerable people through the closure of the accident and emergency  unit of the Mid-Ulster   Hospital. That, coupled  with a service that is under stress at Antrim Area   Hospital, highlighted  some of the incredible positions that we now find ourselves in. I am angry  about how that situation was managed, and the Executive must have much better  budgetary planning to ensure that the public do not face continued shocks.  However, I am aware that the Health Minister said that the closure was not  entirely due to budgetary pressures, which is an issue that is being further  explored locally.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">In the Department of the Environment, we had the RPA  debacle. The strategic approach in the Department seems to be almost in  meltdown as people make a sort of risk reaction to cuts instead of managing  them through a strategic approach. We also have the current cuts to Planning Service  and difficulties within the NIEA, at a time when tackling environmental crime  is supposed to be a priority for government. The actions that I have outlined  are but some of those needed by DOE, but they are important and necessary for  all Departments.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">It is important that, in our Budget planning, we make  changes. Until now, the Executive have failed to take decisive action on the  Budget and the economic downturn. For example, we have seen the cross-sector  advisory forum turned into a talking shop. It produced a wish list containing  some good proposals, but I have no confidence that the Executive will implement  them. DETI has commissioned an independent review of economic policy that the  Executive have, likewise, failed to consider and implement in our current  economic climate.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I highlight one more proposal from the SDLP that requires  implementation: an oversight committee to look at the Budget. We have seen the  mess that the Executive have made over budgetary issues in the last three  years. To protect our front line services and target what limited funds there  are to assist vulnerable people, we must ensure that future Budgets are  properly scrutinised. We must never again see such a waste of public funds as I  have witnessed both in the Assembly and as a member of the Public Accounts  Committee. What has passed for public service in this place at times beggars  belief. The public themselves must no longer have decisions foisted upon them  that may not be based on the Budget. Often we ask ourselves on what logic such  decisions are based: witness the closure of the accident and emergency  department of the Mid-Ulster   Hospital. It may be a  local or parochial issue, but it is one that I feel deeply about, given my connection  with the area. I live there, and I have seen close family friends being dealt  with at that hospital.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker and Minister, for your time.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McHugh</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">It has been a long enough session today, and I apologise  for being unable to speak in the debate yesterday. Had I had that opportunity,  I would have left today out of the equation.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The Finance Minister has to sit through all of this, listen  to it and try to make comment. Our new MLA said that the Finance Minister was  not a dictator. The Minister is a likeable sort of guy; it is hard to see how  he could be a dictator. There may be the makings of dictators in other Members  of the Assembly, but that has not been checked out yet.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I will try to cover some areas that others would not. At  this late stage in the debate, a lot has been said, so we may go over old  ground no matter what happens. As Assembly Members, we are much more mature  than we were a few years ago, and by now we should have seen through all the  issues and into the hidden areas.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Car&aacute;l N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n asked where all the money had gone. That  sort of comment tells me that there are others who wonder, as I do, where the  savings will be made. We have talked at length over the last four years about  savings. Every Budget was about the savings that we could make, but I have yet  to see what, if any, savings have been made. That is the crux of the matter. If  we cannot make savings in the Departments, we will instead have to make cuts  for the future years.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Mike Smyth spoke about borrowing for the future at local  council level, like taking out a mortgage, to help local enterprise. That might  not be such a bad thing, because some local councils have not borrowed to the  same extent as the Assembly may have done. However, that is for another day&rsquo;s  thinking, and it may well be worth looking at.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">We can look at deflationary or inflationary models. Argentina spent  10 years cutting all expenditure back to zero but found that that was not going  to work. It had to go the other way and spend, to raise the standard of living  to a more acceptable level than the previous policy delivered.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">We must learn from those policies. However, different  Governments do different things. Given the new Government in Westminster,  it is clear that people in the UK,  as the saying goes, voted for cuts. That is good stuff, but it will affect us.  As my colleague said, it affects our Budget, whether we like it or not. We are  not separate from that.</p>
<p class="TimePeriod">4.45 pm</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">During the debate on the Supply resolutions yesterday, the  Minister and others mentioned the challenges and pressures that face existing priorities.  We may think that there can sometimes be a lack of information when Committees  are trying to scrutinise departmental budgets. Perhaps there is, and the  Minister may even think that. He has to listen to what the experts tell him,  whether he likes it or not. As Car&aacute;l N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n said, that is an art form, and  convincing people can also be an art form. There is no one better at that than  those who are skilled in that art. At the end of the day, we can be convinced  that we are going in the right direction when we may not be.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">David McNarry mentioned a figure of &pound;7&middot;3 billion, and he  highlighted the fact that we do not take out anything like what we pay in tax  to the Exchequer. He said that we get an easy ride. If all that were removed,  which would probably be acceptable to me, it would be easier for us to move to  a united Ireland  if we did not depend on the easy ride or the pocket money that comes from the  block grant, which is what we are getting at the minute.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">That funding came from a background of sustaining the  unsustainable, which is this entity. The North or the Six Counties  was considered unsustainable, which, in its own right, it probably was.  Therefore, it had to be bolstered by a tremendous amount of money. We have been  in conflict for the past whatever number of years, and we did not get the kind  of returns or inward investment that ROI or areas such as Scotland, Wales  or England  got. That was our dilemma. Therefore, it was not for nothing that that extra  money was put in.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">People should look at where that money was spent and where  it is being spent. Each Department has a certain amount of money, and, if we  were to go back through the years, we would see that the cake can be cut only  in so many ways. The first division in most Departments is in wages, salaries  and bonuses. Whatever little corner is left then goes on roads, stone,  tendering or whatever else. It is the same with council budgets. Perhaps that  needs to be reviewed. People may not be happy with that, but we are talking  about jobs.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Cavan, which is the opposite county to my constituency of  Fermanagh, was mentioned to me recently as an example of that situation. The  Fire Service there employs 10 people to our 33. We can either sustain jobs or  throw people out of them. That is a difficult situation that would not go down  well with anyone. However, we may have to consider such matters in the future.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Regardless of whether it is in the North or the South,  youth unemployment severely affects the whole island. Compared with the figures  for a short time ago, youth unemployment in the Republic has increased by  around 100,000. Here, around one in three of our young people is unemployed.  That number is disproportionate, bearing in mind the size of the population. We  must realise the effect that that has on young people.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Young people now have far higher expectations than we had.  What is the future, cost and value for money of the education that they receive  if, afterwards, they are told to clear off and find a job somewhere else? Our  young people do not have the same opportunities to go to the US or elsewhere  that we did when there were previous downturns in the economy.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The recent downturn and the bursting of the bubble have  dashed the hopes of many young people. They are not too happy about the  recently announced intention to increase student fees. A considerable increase  of at least &pound;1,000 and up to &pound;3,000 a term was mentioned. I am not sure that that  is the right direction to go in if we are to help students or encourage  families from lower-income backgrounds to support their kids to continue in  education, which is essential for most of them. That is an issue that must be  considered.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Training programmes may ease the impact of unemployment on  young people. Unemployment has led many young people into difficult  circum&shy;stances, including criminal activity, which has its own massive cost. We  all know that the cost of keeping someone in prison is an awful lot higher than  the cost of keeping them in a job outside. However, the impact of youth  joblessness extends to families and communities. Indeed, the entire nation  suffers, to the extent that young people have taken their own lives because of  the situation in which they found themselves. That is something that we need to  consider when we make cuts at that level.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">It has been mentioned that we are overgoverned and that  councils and other bodies cost money. Minister Poots has often said that there  are inefficiencies at council level. Well, he did not exactly point out the  detail of those inefficiencies. We need to know what he means, what we can do  about it and how we can put that right. Councils lend ad hoc support to many  projects, sometimes without giving much thought to their overall budget, but  they lend support because it is popular to do so. Perhaps we cannot afford to  do those things in the future &mdash; I do not know.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Almost all Departments here run up tremendous costs in  meeting rules and regulations, including the cost of meeting European rules as  well as regulations that cover health and safety at work. Costs are even  involved in tendering. Submitting a tender these days is a massively different  story from what it was even 10 years ago because of the health and safety  regulations that have to be met here. Yet, those who provide goods and services  from outside Europe do not have to contend  with a lot of that. Therefore, they can compete much more easily than we can.  That is something that we cannot do anything about.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">My colleagues from the Committee for Enterprise,  Trade and Investment and I visited Europe  recently. It has been suggested that perhaps more Assembly Members and  Ministers should go to Brussels to keep a better  eye on what Europe is doing before the regulations and rules that affect us are  made, rather than work away here quietly and ignore what Europe  is doing, in many instances, behind our backs. Sometimes what is done there is  positive; nevertheless, some very costly rules and regulations are created.  Take, for example, the issue of roads and the lowering of footpaths, which is  necessary but incurs a massive extra cost. That cost was not there a few years  ago, and it is not always seen.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">There are various measures in the Budget to reduce the  incidence of family poverty. Young people&rsquo;s lifestyles are much more expensive  nowadays. We can cut those measures on the same basis as we did a number of  years ago, but there is a perceived need to keep young people in a particular  lifestyle. They have a lot more ways of spending money than they did in the  past. Therefore, families are under massive pressure to try to help their young  people with housing and other interests, including education. That is an extra  cost for families, some of whom are living on very low budgets or benefits. For  example, an individual in the South receives &euro;200 in unemployment benefit  compared with &pound;60 here. That difference is not always realised, and there is a  similar disparity for a family with two children. Whatever we may say about its  economy, it is, at least, a good thing that the South looked after some of  those areas quite well. It must now meet the cost of that, but at least it is  doing a good thing. We are not doing that. For those on low incomes here,  poverty is much worse now than it was 10 or even five years ago because money  simply does not go as far as it used to.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The Committee for Enterprise,  Trade and Investment addressed fuel prices and the costs and policies  associated with renewables. During our review, we tried to determine how we  might become less dependent on fossil fuels, the cost of which drains every  Department. No matter what, each Department has to come up with money to meet  fuel costs, which bear no relation to those of five or 10 years ago. The costs  of running services and of capital projects, such as road schemes, are  phenomenally higher than they were, and that is not always taken into account.  Nevertheless, the problem exists, and it is difficult to deal with because we  have become almost entirely dependent on fuel.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">People have the same problem in their homes. Relatively low  fuel costs a number of years ago meant that the Housing Executive moved to  being almost entirely dependent on oil. Perhaps that was a bad policy, but it  had little choice in the matter. People are under tremendous pressure from fuel  costs, so we must tackle the problem. I have already explained who is charging  too much, but I am afraid that that information is falling on deaf ears.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The debate about harmonising corporation tax rates North  and South has moved forward quite a bit, and it would be good if we could move  towards that. If we could become less dependent on the block grant, perhaps we  would be able to consider something like that. On the other side of the coin,  the difficulties associated with state aid make the benefits of harmonisation  debatable. Nevertheless, compared with the situation a few years ago, at least  people are now prepared to talk about it.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">As for the Health Department budget, everyone believes that  it is essential to continue to plough money into front line services. It is an  important Department, but maybe there is a need to scrutinise the minutiae of  what is done. The Minister is told about spending at a very high level. Take,  for example, the cost of mistakes in hospitals. People break limbs while in  hospital. Somewhere in the South, someone said that more people suffer injuries  and fractures in hospitals than on the roads. I am not sure what the long-term  costs of payouts for that would be. Another cost is the considerable amount of  money that was put aside to deal with swine flu, which ended up being a major  overspend. Given that there was no pandemic, perhaps what happened had more to  do with the agendas of large corporations and drug companies. Nevertheless, it  cost us and everyone else plenty.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">In the long term, we could save considerable sums in the  Budget by adopting an all-island approach. As other Members said, we could make  considerable changes, particularly in border areas, in respect of health,  tourism and transport. In some instances, as a result of infighting over  budgets, tourism bodies in neighbouring areas work against each other&rsquo;s  interests. Therefore, we must think about introducing cross-border or  all-island tendering; there may be merit in that. I would support doing  anything that would produce savings in those areas. For example, perhaps  something could be done about the way in which bodies on each side of the  border carry out health visits. As many as seven or eight people a week, or  even a day, visit the homes of ill people, and people, North and South, have to  travel great distances, all of whom claim mileage allowances and so forth.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">A great deal of money is being wasted, and that wastage has  not been looked at over a very long period, even though it has been staring us  in the face.</p>
<p class="TimePeriod">5.00 pm</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I raised the issue of top-heavy Departments. There has been  &pound;800 million allocated to policing and justice. That seems to be a necessity,  yet many other much more important areas will simply have to endure the cuts.  We need to look at all that.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I have talked about how dividing up the cake will pan out.  The Department for Regional Development has done some very good infrastructural  work in the west. Although Tommy Gallagher condemns absolutely everything that  is done, the Department does much good work. However, a great deal of money  could be saved if all areas worked together a little bit more and took a  long-term view of roads. We will seriously pay for the current underspend in  maintaining our roads infrastructure. Whatever about the South of Ireland&rsquo;s structural  funds, I commend it for doing a tremendous job with its roads almost right  across the board. We will incur serious costs in the short term through not  maintaining our road network.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">We are being fined &pound;60 million by Europe  because the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development overpaid, I think,  &pound;2 million to farmers under the single farm payment scheme. Some farmers must  have been overpaid. I declare an interest as a farmer. However, I find that it  is very difficult to get a pound over and above. How did that overpayment  happen? Where was the appeals process when &pound;2 million was overpaid? Indeed,  where was the appeals process when Europe  fined us? It is a serious loss. The High Hedges Bill is passing through the  House, but this is about wide hedges. Europe  should make up its mind and decide whether it wants farmers to create a  sustained environment or for them to do the opposite? They are doing both at  the minute, and Europe is fining them for  both. That is absolutely ridiculous. The costs involved are completely mad.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I must mention what the Minister of Agriculture and Rural  Development said today about the brucellosis infection being reintroduced  purposely in farm animals so that farmers can claim moneys. There should be no  winners from that. Certainly, no payments should be made, and I hope that  nobody profits from such criminal activity.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McHugh</strong>:  The issue of water metering, or the tap tax, also came up. I will not say very  much about it, but we have spent a long time saying that we will not introduce  water charges. Water meters are to be introduced in the South. Farmers pay a  considerable amount as it is because of metering, but it would be a much better  system than simply slapping a broad, extra tax on people for something for  which they pay already.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I will bring my remarks to a close. I have no way of  knowing whether I have been speaking for an hour, because the clock has  remained &mdash;</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  It seems like an hour. [Laughter.]</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McHugh</strong>:  At least the Chamber had to see me only once this week. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mr Wells)</strong>:  I am grateful for the opportunity to speak in this debate. On a minor  procedural matter, I appreciated the fact that the honourable Member for South  Belfast Mr McDevitt and several other Members, rather than walk in front of  him, sat at the Door and waited until Mr McHugh had finished speaking.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I also noticed that Mr McGlone, the Member for Mid Ulster,  sought to go out through the Division Lobby rather than walk across him. That  is good news. Members are beginning to learn that it is most off-putting to  have someone parade past during the middle of their speech.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Over the past two or three weeks, the Committee has had a  number of meetings with the Minister and his senior officials to discuss the  Budget. It has also had a long session with the chief executives of the Health  and Social Care Board and the Public Health Agency. The Committee has used  those meetings to drill down into the budget for health and social care. Our  role was to scrutinise and to see whether the most vulnerable in our society  were protected and to ensure that the impact on front line services was  minimised.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">It is no secret that the Minister is not happy with the  budget that he has been allocated. He believes that health deserves more  funding. His speeches and correspondence to the Committee are littered with  figures on growing demands and comparisons with the English system. However,  the reality is that the Minister has been asked to make an additional saving of  &pound;105 million in revenue in the revised spending plans. That reality is  reflected in this Bill. The delivery of health and social care in Northern Ireland  within the budget allocated is a complex and extremely difficult task, and no  one can deny that.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I should like to comment on the job done by health and  social care workers. As individuals, we have heard from nurses and doctors, lab  technicians and other essential front line staff that they are rushed off their  feet, and we recognise their hard work and the quality of what they do on  behalf of patients and those in need. However, it must be accepted that the  majority of the budget in the Department of Health, Social Services and Public  Safety is spent on salaries; I believe that it is about 70%. Therefore, there  is no way in which staff cannot be affected by the savings. Nevertheless, the  Minister has said that there will be no compulsory redundancies, and I as  Chairman, and the Committee generally, welcome the fact that no one will be  forced to leave their job as a result of the savings. However, the budget has  to be cut and the Minister, like every other Minister, must live within his  means.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">In the opinion of the Committee, the Minister has made some  difficult choices. He could have gone for the nuclear option: he could have  gone for hospital closures, had wards shut down, or removed a particular  service. Instead, he has brought forward a programme that is more balanced.  Someone has described it as salami-slicing: taking a little here and there off  a huge range of services. We have not been able to get more localised details  to find out just how it will affect individual trusts. We have not, as yet,  received the operational plans for each of the five trusts. In fact, I  understand that they have not even been finished. One of the great complexities  and frustrations of being on the Health Committee is that it was announced that  savings had been made in February, but we did not receive the final details until  three and a half months later.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">We are now well into the new financial year 2010-11, and  trusts have to hit a moving target in the sense that they are spending money  but they did not have a finalised budget for the current tax year.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  The trust in the area that I represent seems to be aware of some efficiency  savings. Ward closures have been mooted, and there will be some meetings  tomorrow about that. The trust also seems to be aware of other cutbacks.  Therefore, there is some talk about it in my area. However, there are a lot of  concerns about cutbacks and who they will affect. Some of those cutbacks seem  to be touching front line services, which concerns me.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: Part of Mr  McCallister&rsquo;s and my constituency falls into the same trust. Indeed, there will  be a highly charged public meeting in Downpatrick on 23 June to discuss these  very issues. The chief executive of the trust has argued that they are not  cutbacks as such: they are a rationalisation and improvement of services. He  says that he can deliver the same service in Downe Hospital  with the closure of an entire ward. If that is an indication of what is  happening when rationalisation is going on, I shudder to think what will happen  when we impose large, real-term cuts.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The details of the various discussions on how the cuts and  savings will be made were outlined by me and other Health Committee members  during yesterday&rsquo;s debate, so I do not intend to repeat that. Instead, I will  outline that the Minister is relying on balancing the books through a number of  strategic choices, which have been examined in detail by the Committee. The big  savings are expected in a number of areas, one of which is workforce control,  whereby a 2% cut in trust payroll will save up to &pound;40 million in 2010-11. That  will cause great concern to the community and to those who work in the health  and social care sector. The Committee is particularly concerned about the  freeze in recruitment and the impact that that will have on staff. A vacant  post will not be filled until it has been examined and scrutinised in some  detail. That will take time, and, in the interim period, other staff members  will be put under severe pressure in trying to cover for the missing post. That  change will lead to safety issues and a potential impact on waiting lists.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Another major area of savings and cuts will come through  the non-introduction of new services. Current services will be protected, but  there will be some impact on waiting lists, and new services will be reduced,  delayed or not introduced at all. I am particularly concerned about anti-TNF  drugs, and Members who have been visited by constituents complaining of  rheumatoid arthritis will know the enormous benefits of those drugs.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">About three years ago, I met a young lady while canvassing  in the village of   Clough in South Down &mdash;  one of the few areas that still votes for me &mdash; who was in severe pain as a  result of rheumatoid arthritis and was campaigning for the introduction of  anti-TNF drugs for her fellow sufferers. That young lady was about 28 when I  first met her and, when I met her again a few weeks ago, I did not recognise  her: she was a totally transformed person because of the benefits of anti-TNF  drugs. They had totally revolutionised her life, she was no longer in severe  pain, she was able to return to full-time employment and was making a valuable  contribution to society. The term &ldquo;wonder drug&rdquo; is sometimes overused, but  anti-TNF drugs are almost exactly that, because they have a profound impact on  the quality of life of those in Northern    Ireland who suffer from that awful disease.  Therefore, the Committee is concerned that the commissioning plan proposes to  reduce the availability of those drugs and increase the waiting list for those  life-changing drugs to nine months, rather than reducing it, as was previously  planned.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Some members of the Committee met representatives from  Arthritis UK  at a function in the Long Gallery recently, a charity for which the issue of  anti-TNF drugs is a burning issue. They were disappointed that a wonder drug  that offered so much hope to people who suffer from that condition had been  developed, but it now looks as if sufferers will have to wait a long time to  avail themselves of it.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The final savings are expected through the making of  additional efficiencies in family health services, with a particular emphasis  on the use of generic drugs. I am sure that Members know that generic drugs are  products that have gone out of patent, and the company that originally produced  them is no longer entitled to charge a large amount to recover its huge  expenditure in researching and developing the drug. One drug that I looked at  recently had a branded version costing &pound;26 and a generic version costing 90p,  and clearly there is huge potential to save money in the Health Service in Northern Ireland  by moving towards those drugs, without affecting front line care.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">However, there is a problem in that the GPs have the right  to prescribe either a generic or branded version of a drug to patients; it is  entirely their call. Indeed, there are some GPs who think that their patients  like to have a certain branded product prescribed to them, and when the patient  goes to the pharmacy, the pharmacist has no ability to alter that prescription  and cannot tell the patient that they can have the same product, with the same  impact, at one tenth of the cost. The Department is quite rightly making  significant strides on generic drugs, but if it could bring the generic prescription  level up to between 60% and 65%, an enormous saving would be made to the  budget, with no difference in patient care. The Committee sees that as a way of  achieving savings without affecting the most vulnerable.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The commissioning plan contains ambitious targets to  increase the use of generic drugs to 64% of the total. That is already a PSA  target, but the emphasis must be on speeding up the increase, especially in GP  practices. We urge the Minister to crack the whip with GPs to ensure that they  always go for the most cost-effective option.</p>
<p class="TimePeriod">5.15 pm</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Northern    Ireland spends &pound;224 per capita on medicines.  In Wales,  the corresponding figure is &pound;194, so we are clearly spending too much in  certain areas. There is room for improvement. According to the information that  was given to the Committee, there is room for an additional &pound;46 million of  savings in that field alone.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">That is significant, because, as I said yesterday, adding  that figure to the possible &pound;11&middot;7 million of savings that could be made from  eliminating consultants&rsquo; bonuses could save almost &pound;60 million. Would anybody  notice any change in front line services if that happened? Those are the types  of savings, cuts and efficiencies that we have to find in the Health Service  budget: those that have no impact on the patient or the person who is waiting  for treatment at a GP surgery.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I have outlined the main elements of the revenue savings in  the new revised expenditure plan from the Department. Before I finish, I want  to point out that we are still waiting to see detailed operational plans and,  despite asking on a number of occasions, we do not know exactly what has been  allocated to each trust. Moreover, we do not know anything yet about the  capital budget for this financial year.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Every Department has revenue and capital elements of its  budget. Capital is vital, because many infrastructure projects are urgently  required. We brought officials who are in charge of the capital budget before  the Committee during a recent evidence session in the Downe Hospital,  and they did not have a clue where we are going.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">For example, the new women and children&rsquo;s hospital in the  Royal complex has been earmarked to be built at a cost of &pound;360 million. Given  the noises from the Department, the chances of that project going ahead are  practically non-existent. However, we need to have that issue dealt with and  get alternatives implemented to improve maternity care in the Royal complex.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">We have received lobbying material and numerous requests  for meetings from groups in the west Tyrone/Omagh area. There is a great deal  of controversy over the fact that County   Tyrone has been left  without any form of acute service cover. Looking at the map and realising that  there is nothing between Altnagelvin and Craigavon and between Craigavon and  Enniskillen, one can see that the people of Tyrone have much to complain about.  They are stranded in the west of the Province, miles away from a hospital with  acute cover.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I have listened to people from that area with great  interest. The other day, we met a west Tyrone lobby group led by Father Mullan  from Drumquin. I got a very nice letter from Father Mullan afterwards, thanking  me for the reception that the Committee had provided the group. I never thought  that I would get a letter from a priest, so it was very nice to get that. He  leads a group that has a very just cause; he said that Tyrone is the Cinderella  of acute care in Northern    Ireland, and I agree with him. That group  demands a new hospital for Omagh in line with what has been provided in  Downpatrick.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Downpatrick has a marvellous new facility, but the  essential services are going out of it as quickly as one could imagine; every  time I open the local paper, another service seems to have been withdrawn.  However, there is no certainty about the new hospital in Omagh, because we do  not know what stage it is at in the capital budget. There are scores of similar  projects in the same position, including new health centres, throughout the  country.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">It would be lamentable if I were making these comments in  the December before the new financial year, but we are more than 20% into the  new 2010-11 financial year and we do not have a clue where we are going with  capital expenditure.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The sad reality is that the D&aacute;il Select Committee on Health  and Children came up to see us and told us that tender prices for capital  projects in the Irish Republic are coming in at 21% below the expected price  and that contractors are basically buying projects to keep their staff working.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, the sad thing is that the time that we could be  spending maximising the return for the taxpayer and achieving best value for  capital projects is the time that it looks as though there is absolutely no  money to get the projects off the stocks and get them going. For example,  although the budget for Downe   Hospital was &pound;63 million,  I suspect that, if it were to go out to tender today, it would be around &pound;55  million. That would be a major saving. Therefore, that is the dilemma that we  face.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">However, we do not have a clue about where we stand with  capital budgets. No matter what happens next year, it is essential that the  Department gets its act together and that the Committee gets the figures before  the start of the financial year. The Committee cannot be left lagging behind  all others without knowing where it is going.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  Will the Member agree that it would be helpful to revert to the Assembly&rsquo;s  original practice? If we were to do that, a draft Budget paper would be  produced in the September or October, a couple of months would be available for  discussion, debate and consideration, and, ultimately, the Budget would go  through in December, rather than go through very late with limited discussion.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I  understand the difficulties that the Department faced, in the sense that the  announcement that a further reduction in expenditure had to be made was not  known until January or February. Therefore, it would have been unreasonable to  have expected the Department to have come up with a draft budget in October and  to have stuck to it. However, the problem was that other Departments reacted  immediately to the Minister of Finance and Personnel&rsquo;s decision by going  through their budgets and finding savings. They reported those to their  relevant Committees to give them time to consider the figures before the end of  the financial year and to report back to the Assembly. The Committee for  Health, Social Services and Public Safety was left completely in the dark for  the three-and-a-half months after October. Although the community was concerned  about where potential savings would be made, we did not have a clue, because we  did not have even one leak, and, until two weeks ago, we did not have even the  slightest hint of what was going to happen.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Will the Member agree that the Health Minister&rsquo;s way of carrying out the  process has been much better, in that he has not presented cuts here and cuts  there? He has done what Mr Wells said at the start of his speech that he would  do and slashed off different bits. That has resulted in a much better outcome,  because front line services will be protected, which is what we all want to  see.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: On balance,  the Committee decided that the Minister was right to go for what is an  extremely complex package of reductions in services, greater efficiencies and  savings on generic medicine and so on. He has devised a difficult-to-understand  and complex package, but that is not the issue. The issue is why it took so  long to tell the Committee what he intended to do. We were left without even an  off-the-record briefing on what was happening.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">My concern is that the way in which the Minister is  proceeding could be described as being too clever by half. I hope that I am  wrong, but the way that he is doing this is so difficult and complex and will  require such a huge degree of management and supervision that it may be almost  impossible to achieve. He plans to save 2% on staffing through a freeze on  posts, and each post will then be assessed on whether it should be filled. We  have not even mentioned the reduction in agency nursing and locums. That will  require a level of expertise that I hope the Department has, and I wish it  well. If it can do it, good luck to it.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">That is much more preferable than a slash-and-burn  approach, which would have involved saving money by closing wards, stopping  services and not having any more child protection and so on. I agree with the  Minister about that. My argument is not about what he did; it is about the fact  that the Committee was kept in the dark for such a long period. Next time, he could  at least bring in one representative from each party at the start of the  process and roughly outline his intentions, so that, when he makes an  announcement, we know where he is coming from. Instead, we got the Minister&rsquo;s  plans in their entirety two weeks ago.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">As he knows, the Committee had to go through the budget  until 7.05 pm, which I think is the longest time that any Assembly Committee  has ever sat. That is an indication of the serious difficulties in which we  were placed, and, during the entire period, we were approached by unions,  charitable groups and patients&rsquo; representatives, who were asking us what was  going on. Neither Mr McCallister nor I had a clue what was going on, and the  Minister did not seem particularly concerned. As I said yesterday, getting  financial information from the Minister was like pulling hen&rsquo;s teeth. Nothing  was forthcoming from Castle Buildings.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The Committee is concerned about what the future holds. We  know that harsh spending cuts are coming; we all agree on that. I would be  absolutely delighted if, this time next year, my only concern was how to  continue to provide a service based on the current Budget of &pound;4&middot;3 billion. If  we were to reach that situation, we would all be happy, and we could all live  with that. However, I suspect that that will not be the case. We do not know  how severe the cuts will be, and everyone awaits 22 June with some dread. That  is not, by the way, the date of the World Cup quarter-finals but the date that  has been set for the emergency Budget. We will know our fate when the  Chancellor rises to his feet and announces how much money will be given to Northern Ireland.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">We must remember that, apart from a few minor powers to  raise additional revenue, Northern    Ireland cannot invent money, grow money on  trees or create it out of thin air. Therefore, we must live with what we have  been given. That will result in a difficult year for all of us, because we will  have to determine how to allocate that limited Budget among the Departments. We  do not know what decision the Executive will take on ring-fencing; that is  entirely their decision. We could live with a decision to ring-fence some  services, but we do not have the full facts, and, therefore, the Executive must  take those terribly difficult decisions.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">A decision to ring-fence money for one or two Departments  that account for a significant proportion of the Budget would decimate other  Departments. People ask why we do not ring-fence spending for health and  education. However, those two Departments account for about two thirds of the  Budget. Therefore, the implementation of a 10% cut in the remaining  Departments, would mean cutting about one third of their combined budgets.  There is no option to cut the budget for the Department of Justice, because it  is ring-fenced. Those are the dilemmas that we will face. Since the devolution  of policing and justice, the Health Department accounts for 40% of the Budget,  and that has severe implications for our Department.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">We, as a Committee, understand that there is considerable  concern in the community among health charities, lobby groups and politicians  about the potential impact on the health sector. The Committee will discuss  that in further detail at this week&rsquo;s meeting. The other day, somebody asked me  what I thought would be the dominant health issues over the next year. My reply  was that there would be three issues: budgets, budgets and budgets. Over the  next 12 months, funding and the availability of resources for health will,  without doubt, be the most dominant issues in the Department.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I thank my fellow Committee members, who recently spent  many hours scrutinising Departmental officials and the Minister and trying to  get to the bottom of how the budget for health and social care will be spent.  It has been a long and difficult period for the Committee, but the members were  up to it. They were loyal in their attendance and asked some pertinent  questions. The departure of the honourable Member for South Belfast Conall  McDevitt was a significant loss to the Committee, as he had asked some  extremely pertinent questions in the early stages of the process. He was  replaced by Mrs Bradley and, more latterly, Mr Tommy Gallagher joined us.  Therefore, we have a good mix of youth, good looks and experience on our  Committee. Members have worked hard on a difficult issue, and we all await with  interest, and some trepidation, developments in the incoming financial year.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: It has been a long debate, and I should start by  apologising to the Assembly. Yesterday, I predicted that today&rsquo;s debate would  be reheated fare, that we would go through the political microwave and have to  listen to the same old debate all over again. However, Members have spoken from  many new angles today, and I wish to respond to them.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Towards the end of the debate, there was one disappointing  contribution from Mr McGlone, who did the SDLP no favours. He adopted a cop-out  approach when he said that the SDLP washed its hands of any responsibility. He  said that his party did not vote for the Budget and did not believe that it was  correct. He said that mistakes had been made and that he had never seen such a  waste of public funds in his life.</p>
<p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">He then went on to complain about the Department of  the Environment and the loss of jobs in the Planning Service. When I was  Environment Minister, I went to the Committee with a proposal to increase  planning fees after there had been four years without an increase. It would  have helped to keep the revenue, which, in turn, would have maintained jobs in  the Planning Service. The charge against that proposal was led by none other  than the then Committee Chairman, Mr McGlone, who lamented that if the  increases went through, the cost of a planning application for a house in the  countryside would increase by &pound;100, and no one would want to build any more  houses in the countryside. That was the level of discussion that we had on the  issue.</p>
<p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Molloy] in the Chair)</p>
<p class="TimePeriod">5.30 pm</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">It is one thing to come here and moan and whinge about the  impact of the Budget changes, it is another thing to accept some  responsibility. I enjoyed the experience of going along to the Committee and  giving evidence to it, but if there is so much waste in the Department of the  Environment, why, under Mr McGlone&rsquo;s leadership, did the Committee spend so  many hours and days investigating climate change, which, of course, is very  relevant to people of Northern Ireland, and ask experts to come along? With all  that waste in public spending, I would have thought that Mr McGlone would have  had far better things to do when he was the Chairman of the Environment  Committee.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I thought that someone might rise to Mr McGlone&rsquo;s  defence, as he has left the Chamber. I will be very happy to listen.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  I have a basic question for the Minister. Does he look forward to taking those  strange and unique arguments to another place at some point in the near future?  Maybe he will get back to talking about the Budget.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: That was just an introduction. I felt that I had to  let off a bit of steam about something, and I am glad that Mr McGlone gave me  that opportunity at the end of the debate. I will come back to some things that  he said during his contribution, but, first, I will come to the contributions  that other Members made.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Standing Orders require Members to confine themselves to  the general principles of the Bill. Mr Deputy Speaker, you were not responsible  for doing so, but another Deputy Speaker and the Speaker allowed people to make  wide-ranging contributions on the issue. I do not think that there was anything  lost in doing that. Once again, I express my appreciation to the Committee for  Finance and Personnel for ensuring accelerated passage of the Bill and for  ensuring that the legislative timetable for the debate was adhered to.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I come to the contributions that a number of Members made.  First, the Chairperson of the Committee for Finance and Personnel raised a  number of points. The first point, which her colleague Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n also  raised, related to the procurement process and to adding social and economic  value to that process. We had a wide-ranging debate in the Assembly on that  issue on another occasion, and the Committee has already produced a report on  procurement, which my Department has partly responded to. It will give a more  comprehensive response to the report, but the general guidance on procurement  states clearly that economic, social and environmental objectives are to be  considered from the outset of the procurement process. Indeed, the objectives  in the Programme for Government placed responsibility on Departments to produce  procurement plans, which set out how procurement will assist in delivering the  most economically advantageous outcomes, including specific measures that will  give full consideration to social procurement.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">As I said in the intervention to Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n, when going  around public procurement projects to look at what is happening, I am  encouraged when contractors tell me that they have taken on long-term  unemployed people or have given people apprenticeship opportunities as a result  of the procurement and tendering process that they had to undergo.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Ms McCann also raised the issue of poverty and winter fuel  payments and talked about targeting them better to deal with child, pensioner  and fuel poverty. She will know that since those are classed as benefit  payments, there is parity with the rest of the United Kingdom. We do not want to  break parity and so introduce means-testing, although it is up to the Minister  for Social Development to make a decision on that if he so wishes.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I hear the same comments about means-testing all the time,  as, I am sure, do other Members. Once means-testing is introduced, there will  be a cut-off point, but many people who may not be described as poor are,  nevertheless, not well off. They feel that they are being excluded from  means-tested benefits simply because they have been prudent and saved a little  money. Their pockets are hit, and sometimes they find that having savings leads  to their being less well off. That is the other side of the coin.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Ms McCann also raised the issue of child poverty. She will  know that there is an obligation, under the Child Poverty Act 2010, which went  through the Westminster Parliament, to deal with child poverty. The Act  requires a three-year strategy, which must be in place by March 2011. That is  being undertaken by OFMDFM, but it will be the responsibility of each Department.  Although OFMDFM will set the strategy and the 10-year objectives, it will be  delivered across a range of Departments, and it will be for Departments and  Committees to ensure that that is done.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Mr McQuillan raised the issues of tourism and savings, and  we have great potential for developing tourism. His constituency attracts many  tourists because of the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway, but  it also has huge potential for jobs and growth, especially in the private  sector, and the Executive have sought to encourage it and to direct attention  to it. In fact, the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway visitor  centre is getting off the ground.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">A theme recurs time and time again throughout the  responses. It perturbs me that radio phone-in programmes, their presenters &mdash;  Members &mdash; journalists and the chattering classes portray the Assembly, the  Executive and local government as bodies that do not deliver or even try to  deliver and which make little difference to people&rsquo;s lives. That is the &ldquo;in  thing&rdquo;. It is, therefore, worthwhile highlighting the things that are done. I  urge Members to look not only at the amount of money that has been made  available to the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway, but at the  way in which the planning process sought to accommodate the facility in a  sensitive area. It is an indication that the arms of government came together  to provide something that will add significantly to that area&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">As regards savings, I agree with the Member that  Departments should make early, achievable plans for savings, which they can  then bring to Committees so that proper scrutiny can be carried out. Many  Members raised that issue in their contributions. Committees should push  Ministers to bring those plans forward. I will certainly encourage Ministers to  do so. As I outlined yesterday, the Budget process will require Departments to  bring forward their plans for savings between now and the end of July. I intend  to speak to each Minister about those plans during the summer so that they can  be fed into the system in the new session.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Mr McNarry never comes into the Chamber to listen to me. He  comes in and talks but never listens to me. We have been talking about  processes, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I know that you may accuse me of digressing.  However, I believe that we should introduce a system by which, if Members wish  to speak in a debate, they should, at least, be present for the summing up of  the debate, so that they can hear the Minister&rsquo;s response. They may not like  that response. However, at least they would hear the response to the speeches  that they have made. Perhaps, you will pass that on, Mr Deputy Speaker. I will  say no more about it, except that it would help the process of debates, rather  than having Members walk in, make their speeches, walk out, and not be seen  again. Ministers never have a chance to respond to them.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: The  Minister can be confident that if he misses any point that is made by most of  the Back-Benchers on all sides of the House, they will ensure that it appears  verbatim in local newspapers the following week. Therefore, he has nothing to  worry about: he will be able to catch it in his local journal.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I am sure that I will. However, since I have had to  sit through the debate for several hours, I would like it if Members would, at  least, return to the Chamber to listen to what I have to say at the end of it.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Let me get back to what Mr McNarry said. At least his  contribution to today&rsquo;s debate was, perhaps, just a little notch higher than  the standard that we usually expect from him. He mentioned the black hole and  severe cuts. He had a go about water charges and leaked documents from the  Executive &mdash; on which, of course, he would have great expertise. I suspect that  his party is well used to that kind of thing.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I have just listed some of the issues that Mr McNarry  raised. He mentioned the weighted scale. I am still at a loss to understand how  his weighted-scale theory is any different to how projects are judged against  priorities that are listed in the Programme for Government. He mentioned  setting up a scrutiny Committee. I would have thought that at a time when we  want to streamline the system, we should try to get rid of unnecessary  Committees. Mr McNarry says no: let us have a scrutiny Committee.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">What really took me to the fair was that although the  Assembly has four in-year monitoring periods, all of which require feed-in from  Departments, along with Executive discussion on how to allocate money, followed  by debate in the Assembly, Mr McNarry wants monthly, rather than quarterly,  in-year allocations. The important fact is that none of that would generate any  more money for Departments. We would still face choices. We would still have to  make difficult decisions because there would still be the same pot of money to  spread around Departments.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Mr McNarry described measures that he believes would  improve the situation. However, those measures would not magic money out of the  air, make it grow on trees or persuade the Treasury to make more of it  available to us. We would simply have to continue to make difficult decisions.  Those decisions are not best made by saying that just because something is a  high priority, it must simply be given all the money that it requires.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">That seems to be what was being suggested &mdash; that a high  rating meant that a budget would not be touched. When we talk about giving the  growth of the economy a high priority, it does not mean that everything that  comes under the heading of growing the economy is necessarily a good project or  the best way of spending money. We allocate and give priority to budgets  through in-year monitoring and looking at departmental baselines, among other  things. When spending proposals come forward, we have a clear indication of their  relative benefits when it comes to prioritising spend. We do that rather than  act on an abstract notion that a priority gets money. We must look at those  elements.</p>
<p class="TimePeriod">5.45 pm</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I want to say something about the Budget process. The more  that we get down to clear lines of departmental spend, the more that we will be  able to drill down and look at some of the bids that are being made and make  some judgements on them.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Mr McNarry also talked about the economic projections. He  loves talking about black holes in the economy and in spending. He was on about  it again today. He said that, last year, we had &pound;390 million in cuts in this  Budget. I do not know how often I have to say it; I will send him a copy of the  Hansard report. We reallocated &pound;370 million in this Budget. We did not cut &pound;370  million from this Budget. I do not know how many ways I have to say it. We  decided that we could not sell some assets because of the market. We decided  that we were not going to impose water charges because, politically, people  said that we could not do it. We decided that we were going to help businesses  with their rates. If we used the money for that, we could not use it for  something else, and so we reallocated. We did not cut.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">We will have to make cuts this year. We will have &pound;128 million  less. Next year, it will be the same or even more so. Those are cuts, but there  was no black hole because someone lost control of the finances. A reallocation  was made on the basis of decisions that were taken by the Assembly. Mr McNarry  talked about the economic projections and the difficulties posed by economic  growth. We may well face such difficulties, but he did not say that it has been  found that levels of borrowing were less than anticipated. I do not know  whether one may offset the other, but we will know that when the Chancellor  makes his Budget statement next week.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Mr McNarry and Mr Farry raised the issue of corporation  tax. We have had long debates on that issue. Although I will be interested to  see the paper that comes forward, we must remember that it is only another  paper that has been promised. We had Varney I, Varney II, and now we are going  to have a third paper &mdash; Paterson or Osborne; I do not know what it will be  called. We will then see what the full implications of allowing variations in  corporation tax for the Assembly are likely to be.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I do not want to go over everything, because the hour is  late, but when we responded to the report, a lot of queries were raised about  the full cost of devolving corporation tax and allowing changes to be made by  the Assembly and also the benefits. Any economic model that predicts benefits  25 years ahead is going on guesswork. No model can sustain all the  uncertainties and risks that occur over a 25-year period and come out with  accurate predictions. The predictions about creating 90,000 jobs over the 25  years have to be taken with a pinch of salt. It makes a good headline in the  paper, but when one looks behind it to see where those figures come from,  sometimes the figures become a little bit more suspect.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Mr McNarry also mentioned in-year monitoring, and he raised  a query. He seemed to think that there was some contradiction in what I said  about in-year monitoring getting tighter. It is, and that is good. C&aacute;ral N&iacute;  Chuil&iacute;n spoke about the benefit of that. It means that Departments are spending  money on what they actually planned to spend it on. It does not mean that there  are no reduced requirements. There will still be reduced requirements, because  unforeseen circumstances always arise where Departments planned to spend money  on something but could not spend it. That is the situation this year again.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The question that the Executive must ask when we present  the June monitoring round is how we deal with reduced requirements, bids from  Departments and the knowledge that we have got to find &pound;128 million in cuts. Do  we simply say that we have x amount of reduced requirements, so we will give x  out to Departments because there is x worth of bids? Do we say that we will  only give half of x, refuse some of the bids, and use the remainder to  facilitate and finance some of the cuts? Or do we give it all over to remove  the cuts this year? Those are the kinds of decisions that are being made.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I do not know whether Mr McNarry is just paranoid that  someone is trying to pull the wool over his eyes, but to suggest that there is  something untoward going on when I say that in-year monitoring throws up less  in reduced requirements this year than last year, and less last year than it  did the year before &mdash; and that, just because I mentioned that maybe some of  those reduced requirements could be used in a certain way, the wool is being  pulled over people&rsquo;s eyes &mdash; really is either stretching to find something to  complain about or not understanding the process.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I have dealt with the Assembly Budget scrutiny unit and the  Member&rsquo;s proposal. I would have thought that we would want to move away from  more bureaucracy and try to get a more streamlined system.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Mr Bradley raised the issue of the schools capital budget.  It must be recognised that there has been a reduction in the schools capital  budget. That is partly as a result of the fact that we made decisions to, for  example, defer water charges. I noticed that, when challenged about whether the  SDLP would support the introduction of water charges, Mr Gallagher was emphatic  that it would not. Again, it comes down to that issue: if more money is  required for one thing, where does the finance come from? In all the discussion  today &mdash; I think only two or three members of the SDLP spoke &mdash; on no occasion  was any suggestion made as to how the additional money that they wanted spent  on things could be found.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">As I have said, although there has been a reduction, we  also know that as a result of the different treatment of PFI projects by the  Treasury, there will be savings to the schools capital budget of &pound;10 million  this year, which is welcome. Also, as has been pointed out by other Members,  construction costs have been reduced. Indeed, Mr McHugh pointed out that, in  the Irish Republic, construction costs are coming  in 21% below what had been expected. I think that there is a similar situation  here in Northern Ireland.  Therefore, even with reduced finance, hopefully we can get more projects per  pound than we would have two years ago.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Mr Bradley also raised the issue of special educational  needs. Although the issue that he raised about the &pound;25 million is primarily for  the Education Minister, my understanding is that the consultation responses on  the special educational needs report have now been received by the Department  of Education, and a summary of those will be produced by the end of the summer.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The emphasis will now be on schools, and I understand that  work has already begun on developing school workforce capacity to build in the  requirements and responsibilities that schools must meet to cater for children  with special educational needs.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Mr Bradley spoke about school maintenance, and we must  acknowledge that significant issues exist in that respect. The bill stands at  &pound;280 million, &pound;60 million of which is required for areas that need immediate  attention. Again, it is up to the Minister of Education to manage those issues  by using the budget available to her.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I now come to Mr Farry&rsquo;s points. I have said on many  occasions that I enjoy his contributions in the Assembly. However, I noticed  today that he is slipping into Lib Dem mode. He does not put up the same kind  of resistance to proposals for immediate cuts that he used to, and he talks  about balancing the need to raise revenue against the need to cut the amount of  money spent on services. He has not yet sold his soul, but he is moving in that  direction.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">However, Mr Farry made a number of useful points. He and  Jennifer McCann talked about the potential of North/South co-operation, and I  wish to make a point about that. I do not take a dogmatic stance to the Irish Republic  and ignore it because of unionists&rsquo; difficulties with it in the past. However,  to use Mr Farry&rsquo;s words, we must strike a balance. We are very dependent on the  UK  economy, and east-west links are important. However, a land boundary exists  between Northern Ireland and  the Irish Republic, and significant work can be  done. I have no ideological reason for not wanting to try to maximise the use  of resources through co-operation with the Irish Republic.  Indeed, I have had discussions with the Finance Minister in the Republic about  co-operation, not because I wish to drive some political agenda or ideology but  because sometimes it makes sense to share resources and services and to have a  useful discussion about how we can maximise the impact of resources that are  spent on, for example, procurement in the Republic and here. Of course, we have  already benefited from such co-operation, after the Irish Republic  contributed to the roads network here when it recognised that it also serves  its economy. Certain exchanges will, therefore, be worthwhile.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">However, we must bear in mind that the Republic is our  competitor in many other areas, so there are limits to how much co-operation  can take place. I am sure that the Government in the Republic also bear that in  mind when they are making certain decisions. Co-operation is useful in  circumstances in which potential savings are available, and it would be wrong  of us not to consider those. Co-operation will sometimes take place Minister to  Minister. I have said many times in the Assembly that I prefer to do business  Minister to Minister rather than through the complicated structures of the  North/South institutions.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Mr Farry also mentioned the counter-cyclical measures.  Yesterday, he said that it would be mature of us if we decided to introduce  water charges.</p>
<p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Although I have some sympathy with the Member&rsquo;s  point, and have said so publicly, we have to recognise that the introduction of  water charges is a form of fiscal tightening, in so far as those charges will  remove spending power from private individuals that would have benefited the  economy. Whether it is through introducing water charges or reducing public  spending, there will be fiscal tightening and an impact on the economy.</p>
<p class="TimePeriod">6.00 pm</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: It  is a fairly complicated balancing act, and the Department may come to the  conclusion that it is right to introduce water charges, thereby tightening the  economy in one respect to balance the books and bring money in. However, it may  be more economically efficient to loosen the economy in another area. Not  levying water charges may not be the most efficient way to ensure spending  power in the economy. There may be more efficient ways of doing that.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: It is sometimes very difficult to work out the total  impact of such a change vis-&agrave;-vis other methods. If money is brought in through  water charges, it would leave in some other form. The question is whether it  would have a greater overall economic impact, and that is where economic  modelling comes into consideration. There is also a political argument  surrounding water charges.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I referred earlier to Mr McNarry&rsquo;s contribution. He  finished his speech by demanding to know what I was going to do about water  charges. However, if Mr McNarry had done his homework, he would know that I can  do nothing about water charges. I have raised the issue of water charges  honestly, both publicly and in the Assembly. However, at the end of the day,  the responsibility for water charges lies first with the Minister for Regional  Development, secondly with the Executive, and thirdly with the Assembly. On one  hand, Mr McNarry puts forward the idea of perhaps supporting water charges,  and, on the other, Mr Cobain says that introducing water charges would be a  total betrayal. Given that record, Mr McNarry has a debate to sort out in his  own party before he asks me what I am going to do about water charges.  Nevertheless, it is an issue that we will come back to.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Mr Farry raised the issue of spending differentials and the  fact that some Departments spend more per capita than others. He mentioned that  the Health Department spends more per capita, but that, when health needs are  considered, there may be a need for more spending. That is a very dangerous  route for the Member to go down because, if we look at where the biggest  disparity of spending per capita is, we find that it is in his Minister&rsquo;s  Department, where there is a 40% difference in spending per capita, compared  with the rest of the United    Kingdom. The average difference is 22% per  capita for the Northern Ireland Budget as a whole, whereas there is a 7%  difference per capita in the Education Department.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: Perhaps the Member is going to tell me that he has  already been lobbying his Minister to make sure that those disparities are  addressed.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  know that I am going to get myself in trouble for saying this, but if we are to  be mature, it is important to recognise the benefits of freezing the justice  budget in the short term, given the potential crisis and uncertainty that we  face, particularly the threat from dissidents. As we normalise society and as  the rule of law becomes better entrenched, it is clear that there will come a  time in the very near future when justice has to be paid for against other  competing priorities such as health and education. The Minister of Justice gave  a very clear warning of that in his keynote speech last week. Such movement  will be a sign of Northern    Ireland maturing as a society. I recognise  that what the Minister of Justice suggested will inevitably happen here under  devolution.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I used to think that Mr Farry was a rising star in  the Alliance Party. With a contribution such as that, I will maybe have to  rethink that position. Nevertheless, again, he has demonstrated an honesty that  is sometimes lacking in other Members&rsquo; contributions by recognising that we  need to take a hard look at such issues.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Although Mr Farry mentioned policing, there are other areas  in the Department of Justice in which savings can be made. I admire the stance  that Mr Ford took on how legal aid costs should be tackled so that we achieve  greater parity with other parts of the United Kingdom. He will be taking  on a big vested interest there. As with many such issues, however, that will  have to happen anyhow.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Michelle McIlveen mentioned structural maintenance and  underfunding of Roads Service. The infrastructure of Northern Ireland is important if we  are to deliver an effective economy. Last year, Roads Service&rsquo;s maintenance  budget was increased to &pound;85 million, which included an additional &pound;15 million.  From 2007-08, the budget has gone up from &pound;63 million to &pound;77 million to &pound;85  million. So, we have increased the maintenance budget for Roads Service. I  understand that most of that will go on the strategic road network, but other  roads, including rural roads, will have resurfacing treatment.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The Member also raised the issue of DRD funding for roads  and transport. The allocation is due to increase by more than 20% in the  current financial year to just under &pound;700 million, which indicates the  importance that we attach to building the infrastructure in Northern Ireland.  Of course, it is up to the Minister to decide how that money is allocated.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Mr Gallagher raised the issue of savings. He spoke about  the problems of the Western Education and Library Board and the treatment that  he believed that the board received from the Department of Education. Education  spending went up by 5&middot;8% last year, well above the rate of inflation, and there  is a 1&middot;9% increase in education funding this year. How that is allocated is, of  course, the responsibility of the Education Minister, as are decisions on  timing and information.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Car&aacute;l N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n raised the issue of value for money in  social housing. If one looks at this Administration&rsquo;s record on social housing,  one can see that, last year, we had the biggest production of social housing  for years, with a programme for more than 1,800 homes. The average cost to the  public sector was &pound;80,000, and, because delivery is now through housing  associations, their contribution was &pound;50,000 per unit through private lending.  The standard of new houses in the public sector is well known and represents  good value for money.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The Member raised an issue that is also important to me,  and that is the language that is used in the Budget. I, too, am glad to see  that more and more people are asking questions and discussing and wanting to  discuss with public representatives the whole issue of public spending and how  it is done. I suppose that it is the teacher coming out in me, but I do not  think that there is any point in providing Committees or Members with documents  that they do not understand.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, they should be in plain English so that people  can understand them. Perhaps the Members on the Benches opposite will remember  that when they speak Irish, it is sometimes just as confusing as some of the  official speak that Car&aacute;l N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n referred to when talking about some of the  documents concerning budgetary considerations that come across her desk.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Part of the revision of the Budget process will be to look  at how figures and information can be presented in a more understandable way  and broken down in a way that makes them clearer. That would enable us to have  a proper debate. I do not believe that it is beyond the wit of the Departments  to do that. As part of the Budget process, I hope that an easy-to-read summary  will be published in the autumn alongside the draft Budget document. That will  enable people other than the professional consultees to respond to the Budget,  which is, of course, important to all their lives.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Car&aacute;l N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n also raised the issue of streamlining the  Budget process. Again, I have assured the Assembly that we want to bring  forward a new set of proposals for the Budget process. Part of that will  involve Ministers trying to address the problem of Committees not receiving  timely and adequate information to enable them to properly scrutinise the  Budget. That problem was raised by a number of Members yesterday, today and on  other occasions.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Mr Givan made his maiden speech today. If he continues to  wear such ties, he will ensure that he gets himself on TV. [Laughter.] I do not  want to sound patronising, but I congratulate him on his maiden speech, which  was insightful, useful and delivered with confidence. I look forward to more  contributions from him in the future.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">He raised the issue of special needs and talked about the I  CAN centre in Ballynahinch. The education and library boards have a statutory  duty to identify children over two years of age who have special educational  needs and determine the provision to meet those needs. The boards were  established on an arm&rsquo;s length basis so that they could respond to local needs,  and that was based on legislation that was set by the Department. If they do  not adhere to that legislation, they know the consequences, as Mr Givan  described today.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Brian Wilson referred to Budget cuts and his desire to  defer them. We know what is coming down the line. Next year is going to be  worse and we are unlikely to be out of troubled waters by then. Therefore,  simply saying that we should defer the cuts without any consideration of our  ability to make some of the savings this year really is reckless. I know that  the Member is in the Green Party, but I hope that he is not green when it comes  to some of the economic issues. His speech was a bit depressing. He suggested  that we should put it all off until tomorrow and hope that everything turns out  OK so that we do not have to make the hard decisions now. We cannot heap some  of the cuts that we have to make this year on to next year&rsquo;s Budget.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I already mentioned Mr McGlone, but I must come back to the  SDLP&rsquo;s wonderful Budget proposals, which supposedly would have steered us out  of the present situation. The proposals are brought up during every Budget  debate. Mr McGlone said that we could take money from the budget for the  Belfast Harbour Commissioners. During Question Time yesterday, I said that the  commission does have a cash reserve.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">However, that cash reserve is being built up in order to  undertake infrastructure work to develop the port to ensure that it becomes  more efficient. The port is the major outlet for goods and services from Northern Ireland and for bringing goods,  passengers and everything else into Northern Ireland. If we were to  take the money from that cash reserve, from where would the port get the money  to do its infrastructure work? I take it that Members support the idea of  improving our infrastructure. If we were to take the money from the reserve, the  Belfast Harbour Commissioners would simply make a demand on the public purse by  borrowing, and that would not solve anything. We would be taking with one hand  but giving with the other.</p>
<p class="TimePeriod">6.15 pm</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Mr McGlone talked about some other problems. He said that we  did not anticipate that capital receipts would fall. I must say that he failed  to mention that DSD did not accurately project housing receipts. It might have  been in a better position to do so than DFP. It did not accurately predict what  would happen to the Royal Exchange project &mdash; money was paid out and then it had  to come back in. The SDLP is adopting a hand-washing attitude: &ldquo;Not me, guv. We  have copped out of all of this.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I will give way presently. The SDLP&rsquo;s attitude is  that everyone else got it wrong and is to blame and that it has the magic  solution.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  I thank the Minister for giving way. I did not want to intervene again, but he  has returned to the subject of the SDLP</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Earlier in his contribution, he talked about corporation  tax. I am interested to know whether the Minister wishes to revise an answer  that he gave to me previously. At Question Time last month, I asked him about  the estimated take of corporation tax in this region, and he told me that it  was somewhere between &pound;350 million and half a billion pounds a year. Those are  the Minister&rsquo;s words, not mine. I did my homework and figured out that what the  Minister must have been doing was extrapolating a Barnett-type formula. He had  reckoned on the estimated take across the UK and assumed that we would get,  more or less, our Barnett share of it. I hope that all the other comments that  the Minister has made today are based on slightly stronger and sounder economic  reasoning than that figure appears to be. He is a man who knows what he is  talking about most of the time. Will he clarify that specific figure and tell  me whether he still stands over the assertion that we are walking away with  half a billion pounds in corporation tax every year from this region, as he  said we did a month ago? If so, I would welcome it.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">What other magic formulas has the Minister up his sleeve to  deliver us out of the current financial crisis?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: First, as I explained to the Member in my answer,  the corporation tax take depends on how wide the scope for corporation tax is  and on which businesses are included in the take. [Interruption.] The Member  wants a simple answer to his question of how much the corporation tax bill is.  It depends on the scope of the tax and which businesses pay it. Members talked  about that when they discussed the issue in the Assembly. Not every business  would be covered by a reduction in the rate of corporation tax. I heard some  Members say that they would not allow banks&rsquo; profits to be covered by a lower  rate of corporation tax. The amount collected will vary, depending on which  businesses we include and which we leave out. I do not know that the Member has  a point to make there at all.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Mr Wells raised a number of issues about the women&rsquo;s and  children&rsquo;s hospital. I understand that the current allocated profile for its  funding is during the ISNI II period. That means that the project will have to  be split into two separate projects. One will start in 2015-16 and see  completion in 2017-18, while the other will start in 2017 and be completed in  2021.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Mr Wells also raised the issue of generic drugs. It is my  understanding is that the Health Minister is already working to roll out the  use of generic drugs across health and social care services, although, as the  Minister pointed out, that will often require educating GPs to use generic  drugs.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Finally, he mentioned the hospital at Omagh and the need  for services in that part of the west of the Province. I understand that the  Western Health and Social Care Trust has reviewed the business case for a new  Omagh hospital. The trust will submit a revised business case, which now  includes the procurement route, to the Department of Health, Social Services  and Public Safety. Of course, that will have to go into the financial melting  pot.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I thank Members for their interest in the legislative stage  of this public expenditure cycle. I have endeavoured to respond to most of the  key issues raised. It has been a good and important debate. I loved Mr McHugh&rsquo;s  comment that the debate was about the &ldquo;pocket money&rdquo; of the block grant. We  have been debating more than &ldquo;pocket money&rdquo; today. It is very important  business for Northern    Ireland. I believe that this Budget will  deliver services to people across the Province, even in these straitened times.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">As Members, we would be failing in our jobs if we did not  notice money being wasted or spent improperly. Equally, it is our job to  recognise that money is being spent on vital services. Good work is being  delivered across Northern    Ireland. Let us not join the doom and gloom  merchants who see nothing good coming from that work or from the Budget  allocations that we make. At least, let us give people hope and optimism that  we are doing our best to ensure the best use of financial resources.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Before proceeding to the Question, I remind Members that, as this  is a Budget Bill, the motion requires cross-community support.</p>
<p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
<p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved (with cross-community support):</p>
<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That the Second Stage of the Budget (No. 3) Bill [NIA  26/09] be agreed.</p>
<p class="H4StageHeading" style="page-break-before:always;"><a name="a10"></a>Energy Bill: Second  Stage</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment (Mrs Foster)</strong>: I beg to move</p>
<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That the Second Stage of the Energy Bill [NIA 23/09]  be agreed.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">It may be helpful for Members if I outline the background  to the Bill. The Energy Bill is intended to update legislation that applies  principally to the natural gas sector in Northern Ireland. It is framed in  such a way that the gas sector will benefit from policies and legislation that  have already been successfully implemented for the electricity sector. Its  other main purpose is to create a special administration regime that will be  applicable to the gas and electricity sectors.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The proposed Energy Bill now includes the following  provisions: first, the power of access for authorised natural gas companies  will be enhanced to allow them to enter premises where, for example, there is  suspicion of gas-meter tampering. Natural gas companies are currently unable to  enter a property to inspect their equipment unless they suspect that there is a  safety concern. The new proposals will provide gas companies with extended  powers of entry analogous to those already in place for the electricity  industry in Northern Ireland  and Great Britain.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">However, we have also proposed a number of key safeguards.  The legislation states that the person seeking entry to a property will have to  provide evidence of his or her authority. They will have to provide sufficient  notice that they wish to gain entry, and entry will only be permitted during  reasonable times. Those safeguards will be put in place to protect consumers.  Also, a gas company must be able to satisfy a Justice of the Peace in order to  obtain a warrant if entry to the property is refused.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The Bill will also provide for a new offence of damaging  gas plant. The provisions will be similar to those already contained in the  Electricity (Northern    Ireland) Order 1992 for damage to electrical  plant.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The introduction of guaranteed performance standards for  the gas industry will provide consumers with specific, measured, achievable,  reliable and timely standards to gauge the level of service being provided by  different gas companies. That will help to create a level playing field for  customer standards and allow for easier comparison of competitive offers.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The Bill also provides a Utility Regulator with the power  to delegate gas meter stamping and testing functions, as opposed to being  responsible for completing those in-house, which also brings us into line with  the rest of the UK.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The Bill will allow for the establishment of deemed  contract provisions between natural gas companies and customers. A deemed  contract exists between a consumer and a gas supply company where no written or  verbal agreement has been exchanged; for example, when a change of tenancy  occurs, such as someone moving into a different property. The introduction of  deemed contracts will facilitate a sound and binding basis on which companies  will supply customers with whom a contract has not been expressly agreed. It  also provides suppliers with a clear basis on which to charge for that supply.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The Bill will also introduce special administration regime  provisions for the natural gas and electricity industries in Northern Ireland.  In the unlikely event of a utility becoming insolvent, the usual insolvency  arrangements mean that the primary responsibility would be towards creditors.  However, the proposed legislation provides for gas and electricity networks to  remain in place and operational in the event of a network company failure to  ensure the continuation of gas and electricity supplies to consumers.  Responsibility for a utility that becomes insolvent will be transferred to a  special administrator appointed by the High Court who would put the energy  consumers&rsquo; interests above those of creditors and shareholders</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The Bill will also update provisions for gas storage. A  regime to allow the Department and the Utility Regulator to consent to gas  storage in Northern Ireland  exists and the legislative changes proposed in the Bill are relatively minor.  The proposed provisions will clarify the meaning of &ldquo;store&rdquo; for the purpose of  existing gas storage provisions in the Gas (Northern Ireland) Order 1996. It  will also clarify that only the operator of a gas storage facility will store  gas for the purpose of the Order, rather than the user of a gas storage  facility. That will define that it is the responsibility of the licence holder  to operate the gas storage facility and it is only the licence holder who can  store gas in the facility.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The equivalent legislation for the electricity industry in  relation to powers of access, guaranteed standards of performance, deemed contracts  and the offence of damaging gas plant can be found in the Electricity (Northern Ireland)  Order 1992. It is intended that the proposed Energy Bill provisions will  produce the same legal effect for the gas industry as existing electricity  legislation in Northern    Ireland. The Bill will also bring Northern Ireland law into line with the Energy  Act 2004 in Great Britain  by creating a special administration regime for the natural gas and electricity  industries.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">My Department carried out a consultation exercise on the  policy proposals in the Bill, and the vast majority of respondents expressed  support for the new legal provisions. However, particular comments are worth  highlighting. In response to the legislative provisions that would extend the  power of access for gas companies, consumer bodies accepted that gas meter  tampering was a serious issue with potential safety implications. They also  believed that the existing and proposed legal provisions should contain  sufficient safeguards in relation to gaining access to a property. That was  considered necessary to allay any concerns about appropriate notice being given  if access to a property is requested, and a court must be satisfied with the  gas company&rsquo;s arguments before granting a warrant.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Existing provisions provide access powers only when there  is a danger to life or property posed by events such as a gas escape;  essentially, when there is a safety issue. However, the Energy Bill provides  safeguards to protect individuals from unwarranted intrusion. The gas supplier  requiring entry under the new powers will have to provide evidence of their  authority at the request of the owner or occupier or make a case sufficient to  obtain a warrant from a Justice of the Peace. The new legal powers will also  provide that such entry can only take place at reasonable times, so there will  be no prospect of it happening very early in the morning or the middle of the  night.</p>
<p class="TimePeriod">6.30 pm</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Other comments related to whether the proposed special  administration arrangements would negate the recently implemented Gas (Supplier  of Last Resort) Regulations (Northern    Ireland) 2009. That will not be the case,  because the 2009 regulations relate to gas supply companies, whereas the  special administration arrangements will apply to network and distribution  companies in order to ensure continuation of supply.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Some gas companies were not totally convinced of the need  for guaranteed standards of performance. In particular, they said that they  would have to pay compensation for failing to meet agreed standards. However, Northern Ireland  electricity legislation and GB energy legislation provide for such compensation  to be paid by the energy supplier if customer standards are not met. Some  companies supported the setting of guaranteed standards but requested that  suppliers not be unfairly penalised if the failure was due to other providers &mdash;  for example, gas distribution network operators. The Department will work with  the Consumer Council and the Utility Regulator on the outworkings of that  issue. However, essentially it is a parity issue and something that should be  proceeded with.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I summarise the content of the Bill as follows: it is  divided into three Parts, containing 37 clauses and one schedule. Part 1,  clauses 1 to 15, relates specifically to the gas industry. Part 2 relates to  both the gas and electricity industries, and Part 3 contains supplementary  provisions.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Clauses 1 to 8 provide gas customers in Northern Ireland  with an enhanced level of consumer protection by authorising the Utility  Regulator and the Department to determine standards of performance in  connection with the activities of companies that convey and supply natural gas.  Clause 9 makes certain amendments to the Energy (Northern Ireland) Order 2003 in  order to ensure that the introduction of the new provisions on gas standards of  performance is facilitated.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Clause 10 creates a criminal offence for persons who  intentionally or negligently damage gas equipment used for conveying, storing  or supplying gas. It also allows gas companies to disconnect premises and/or  remove gas meters where the offence is committed. Clause 11 exempts gas plant  owned by gas companies from judgement and bankruptcy processes where a customer  is in possession of that gas plant.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Clauses 12 and 13 create a procedure to provide for deemed  contracts to arise in situations where customers take a supply of gas without  having first agreed a written or verbal supply contract with a gas supplier.  Clause 14 enhances gas companies&rsquo; existing powers of entry to customer premises.  Clause 15 clarifies the meaning of gas storage for the purposes of the Gas (Northern Ireland)  Order 1996.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Clause 16 amends the 1996 Order so that the Utility  Regulator does not have to appoint meter examiners from members of its staff  and can delegate that function to an appropriate outside body.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Clauses 17 to 33 create a special administration regime for  licensed energy network companies. Where a gas conveyance company or an  electricity transmission or distribution company faces actual or threatened  insolvency, the new regime will seek to ensure that the operation of that  relevant network continues.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Clauses 34 to 37 contain supplementary provisions and the  interpretation, commencement and short title provisions of the Bill.  Supplementary provisions include providing my Department and the Utility  Regulator with the power to make subordinate legislation by means of  regulation, subject to negative resolution. Regulations under the Bill may also  make any necessary transitional provisions and amendments.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Finally, the schedule covers the content and effect of the  special administration transfer schemes that are referred to in clause 18. The  transfer of any energy company assets must not prevent the activities of the  protected energy company from being maintained, and the assets must be  transferred as a viable going concern. That will ensure that the objective of  the energy administration arrangements is met. It may be the case that all the  protected company assets will be transferred to one company, but the protected  energy company may also be separated into several going concerns. All transfers  will, it has to be said, be subject to veto or amendment by my Department.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">In summary, I consider that the Bill will facilitate the  further development of the natural gas industry by introducing measures to  bring it up to date with legislation already in place for the electricity  industry in Northern Ireland and, indeed, with energy legislation in Great  Britain. The Bill will update the law to ensure that legislation continues to  provide protection for Northern    Ireland energy consumers and energy  companies alike.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy  Chairperson of the Committee for Enterprise,  Trade and Investment (Mr Butler)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann  Comhairle. I welcome the Energy Bill and the opportunity to contribute to the  debate. The Bill contains provisions relating to power of access to premises  for gas companies; a special administration regime for electricity and gas;  deemed contracts between gas companies and customers; guaranteed standards of  performance for gas suppliers and conveyors; gas meter stamping and testing;  and gas storage facilities.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">One of the main objectives of the Bill is to permit gas  companies to enter customers&rsquo; premises. For example, it is only right and  proper that gas companies should be permitted to enter premises when there is  reasonable cause to suspect that equipment has been damaged. The Committee, of  course, will want to be assured that such powers are exercised in an  appropriate and sensitive manner and that the term &ldquo;reasonable cause&rdquo; is  defined clearly and adhered to.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The proposal to introduce a regime that is designed to  ensure uninterrupted operation of essential electricity and gas networks in the  event of actual or threatened insolvency of an energy company is to be  welcomed. That will ensure that the interests of consumers and the public are  put before those of creditors and shareholders. The Committee has discussed the  funding of the proposed regime with departmental officials. It has been  suggested that a regime could be funded through the provision of grants or loans.  The Committee will, of course, wish to be assured that any proposal to provide  a grant to a failing energy company would be very much a measure of last  resort.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The proposals for guaranteed standards of performance are,  in principle, to be welcomed. The Committee will seek to ensure that the bar is  not set too low in determining what constitutes an acceptable standard of  performance and customer service. For households and businesses that depend on  natural gas, it is an essential service. Guaranteed standards of performance  must not only reflect the importance of the service but ensure that consumers  are compensated fully and adequately for any failure in performance. The  Committee asked the Consumer Council for its views on that matter. It responded  that guaranteed standards act as a driver for energy companies to improve  standards and enhance the service that they deliver to consumers. The Consumer  Council also stated that any compensation paid to consumers as a result of a  failure to meet standards should be recovered from the appropriate company&rsquo;s  profits, rather than from consumers. The Department informed the Committee that  that is a matter for the Utility Regulator. Therefore, the Committee wrote to  the Utility Regulator and asked how money paid to consumers as a result of  failure in service can be recovered without consumers having to bear the cost.  The Utility Regulator informed the Committee that his office is currently  considering that issue and it is his intention to carry out a public consultation  on it. The Committee will consider carefully the outcomes of that consultation  and the proposals that the Utility Regulator brings forward as a result.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The Committee supports the principles of the Energy Bill.  There are, of course, many other important aspects to it, and the Committee  will consider those in more detail at Committee Stage.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I speak now as a Sinn F&eacute;in Member. The Minister mentioned  the power of access. Although I welcome the fact that it is very much a measure  of last resort, more scrutiny of that matter needs to be conducted at Committee  Stage. There are concerns that people&rsquo;s gas could be cut off, which would give  gas companies access to their premises. That has happened on a number of  occasions over the years; for example, when NIE had that power. Although I  accept that that has to be balanced against meter tampering and people not  paying their bill, it has to be very much a measure of last resort.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">If gas companies fail to meet certain guaranteed  performance standards and have to pay out compensation to consumers, we have to  ensure that that does not come out of other consumers&rsquo; pockets. It must be  borne by the company in question.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">With regard to deemed contracts &mdash; when people have moved  into a house but do not actually have a contract &mdash; we must ensure that whatever  contract they enter into with the gas company does not penalise those using gas  or electricity. It is vital to have transparency and independence in testing  meters to see whether there is meter tampering. The Minister said that the  Utility Regulator will be involved. However, it would not be right for gas  companies to be involved in testing meters, and we must ensure that it is fully  independent. By and large, Sinn F&eacute;in welcomes the Bill.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Moutray</strong>:  I support the Bill. I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s remarks and commend her for  driving the issue forward so promptly. It is important that legislation for  natural gas issues in Northern    Ireland be updated and in line with GB. It  is important to ensure that the natural gas sector is protected and that it can  benefit from the policies and regulations that have been implemented already in  the electricity sector.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Although the Bill is technical, I welcome a number of  points. I particularly welcome the fact that the Bill provides gas customers in  Northern Ireland  with enhanced consumer protection. It is important that consumers who decide to  use gas as a source of energy be protected. I welcome the fact that the Bill  empowers the Utility Regulator and the Department to determine the standards of  performance of companies that transport gas and those that supply it to end  users. That will ensure that consumers obtain quality service.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Additionally, I welcome the fact that the Bill makes it a  criminal offence intentionally or negligently to damage gas equipment used for  conveying, storing or supplying gas. Those who damage equipment should be held  accountable. The Bill allows gas companies to disconnect premises and/or remove  gas meters where the offence is committed. At present, the power of access for  natural gas companies is limited; they can access premises only if there is a  health and safety risk. The Bill will allow the Utility Regulator to deal with  those who have taken a supply of gas without having first agreed a supply  contract with a supplier.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The creation of a special administration regime applicable  to both gas and electricity sectors will safeguard the provision of supplies by  local electricity and gas networks, thereby protecting the interests of  consumers and all our constituents. That means that, where a gas conveyance or  an electricity transmission or distribution company faces actual or threatened  insolvency, the new regime will seek to ensure the continuance of the operation  of the relevant network. The interests of consumers will, in that instance, be  placed above those of shareholders or creditors. That will help to protect the  consumer with supply and demand, should a company become insolvent.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The Bill will further enhance the natural gas industry and  protect consumers and energy suppliers alike. In addition, it will bring us  into line with energy legislation in the rest of Great Britain.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>: I,  too, am pleased that the Energy Bill has reached its Second Stage. Facilitating  the diversification of our energy supply is crucial to our long-term energy  security in Northern Ireland.  Increased competition will benefit consumers in the longer term. I support a  uniform approach to the gas and electricity industries, and I welcome the way  in which the Bill has sought to provide protection to energy consumers in Northern Ireland.  The Bill seeks to provide protection to consumers while attending to the areas  that the industry and the utility regulator have highlighted for revision.</p>
<p class="TimePeriod">6.45 pm</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The Bill also brings natural gas legislation in Northern Ireland up to date with that which  governs regimes in the gas industries in Great   Britain and the electricity sector in Northern Ireland.  Given Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  reliance on oil-based heat supply &mdash; 70% of homes use oil-fired central heating  &mdash; diversification in the market is welcome for security and energy reasons.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I am pleased that the Bill seeks to introduce a deemed  contracts regime, as that will provide a firm basis for suppliers to supply  customers with gas and will echo what takes place in the electricity sector in  Northern Ireland. Deemed contracts arise when customers take a supply of gas  without having first agreed a supply contract with a supplier; where  appropriately regulated, they give the consumer valuable protection.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The Bill also introduces a special administration regime in  the gas and electricity sectors to ensure the uninterrupted operation of gas  and electricity networks, even when continuity of supply is at risk due to the  financial status of an energy supplier. Such provision is important to ensure  the continuance of the operation of the energy network and the protection of  energy consumers. It is also important in the current economic climate as  companies face greater risks in the marketplace and may get into financial  difficulties. The Bill is significant, as it could protect the supply of energy  to consumers when it is interrupted due to the insolvency or potential  insolvency of an energy provider. It provides an important safeguard, which I  welcome.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The Bill takes a common-sense approach to introducing a  criminal offence when damage is caused to gas plant, akin to the current  offence that deals with damage to electricity plant. That consistency is to be  welcomed.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I find three areas of the Bill particularly beneficial.  First, clauses 1 to 8 will provide gas consumers with more protection by  seeking to establish standards of practice. Secondly, clause 10 takes a  common-sense approach and seeks to establish a criminal offence in respect of  persons who intentionally or negligently damage gas equipment used for  conveying, storing or supplying gas. The clause also allows gas companies to  disconnect premises and/or remove gas meters where the offence has been  committed. That uniformity of practice, with sanctions that are already  available to the electricity sector, is to be welcomed. Finally, clause 11  protects the gas industry by exempting equipment that a company has hired or  lent to a customer from any bankruptcy processes against the customer. Thus the  industry is protected from any potential insolvency proceedings taken against  the consumer.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Originally, the Bill referred to gas storage facilities &ldquo;in  Northern Ireland  territorial waters&rdquo;. I hope that progress can be made soon to reduce costs to  the company and the consumer and increase our energy security by improving the  diversification of the energy industry in Northern Ireland. I look forward to  participating in the debate as the Bill progresses through the House, and I  support its Second Stage.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  At the outset, I apologise for the absence of Alban Maginness, the Chairperson  of the Committee for Enterprise,  Trade and Investment, who has been unavoidably delayed; however, I will do my  best to reflect the position of the SDLP on the Bill.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP generally welcomes the Bill, but I have some  questions for the Minister. Furthermore, with the indulgence of the Deputy  Speaker, I will make a few general comments, as I will not have the benefit of  being party to the Bill&rsquo;s Committee Stage.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">As Mr Cree said, the first part of the Bill deals with  performance standards. All Members will agree that regional performance  standards in the electricity industry have been positive, as they have acted as  an incentive to electricity supply companies and transmission distribution  companies to improve their customer service and their security of supply  arrangements.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Clause 2 provides for the payment of compensation in the  event of standards not being met. However, I do not see any detail in the Bill  on whether a supply or transmission distribution business could pass on the  costs of such compensation to consumers. Therefore, I wonder whether the  intention is to make specific provisions to ensure that, when compensation is  paid, it is paid by those who are at fault and not by consumers via the back door.  Maybe the Minister could return to that when she sums up.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Powers of entry are covered in clause 14. The term  &ldquo;reasonable times&rdquo; is used frequently throughout the clause. Again, I am  interested to know what exactly is meant by &ldquo;reasonable times&rdquo;, because all the  powers that will be passed on to suppliers or their authorised agents will be  to enter premises at &ldquo;reasonable times&rdquo;. Picking up on Mr Butler&rsquo;s point, that  is an important provision, but we must be certain that it will not lead to  abuse. Therefore, I would like clarity on the specific meaning of that term. I  would also like to know what precedent, if any, the Department and the Minister  are drawing on in using it.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">That brings me to my next point about reasonable cause. The  Bill states that powers of entry will be sought if there is reasonable cause to  do so. Again, what precedent is being used to define &ldquo;reasonable cause&rdquo;? Like  my party colleagues and other parties in the House, I welcome the general  provisions of the Bill. It is important that companies and their agents have  the powers to enter, but those should be powers that are used in extremis; they  should not be powers that are sought or used as a matter of routine.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Clause 28 deals with energy administrators, which, again,  is a provision that we welcome. The clause deals with grants and loans, which,  as I read it, will be a mechanism that is available to government to bail out a  failing energy company that has found itself in administration. Again, in  principle, we would all welcome that provision as a common-sense measure, but  it raises a series of questions about the funding of grants and loans and where  the liability will ultimately lie.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Mr Deputy Speaker, with your indulgence and that of  Members, I will read out the relevant part of the clause, because, although it  reads well, I am not sure that it reads as tightly as it should. That may be  something that Committee members will pick up on at Committee Stage. Clause  28(4) states:</p>
<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The terms on which a grant may be made under this  section include, in particular, terms requiring the whole or a part of the  grant to be repaid to the Department if there is a contravention of the other  terms on which the grant is made.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That is a welcome provision. Clause 28(5) states:</p>
<p class="BillAmend-AmendedText">&ldquo;The terms on which a loan may be made under  this section include, in particular, terms requiring&mdash;</p>
<p class="BillAmend-AmendedTextIndent">(a)&nbsp; the  loan to be repaid at such times and by such methods, and</p>
<p class="BillAmend-AmendedTextIndent">(b)&nbsp; interest  to be paid on the loan at such rates and at such times, as the Department may  from time to time direct.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The clause continues by stating that the consent of  the Department of Finance and Personnel will be required. In clause 28(2),  power is given to the Department to:</p>
<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;make grants or loans to the company of such amounts  as appear to the Department appropriate to pay or lend for achieving the  objective of the energy administration.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Again, those are welcome provisions, but they  potentially open a significant liability to us as a region. What are the  conditionalities for those? How can we become more convinced than we are now &mdash;  simply on the basis of the legislation &mdash; that, some dark November morning, that  power will not open up a proverbial can of worms that we will all grow to  regret? Perhaps we need policy statements from the Minister and, more  generally, from the Department.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">On the more general question of energy policy, I find the  Bill&rsquo;s title ambitious. It is loftily titled the Energy Bill, but it is a Bill  to administer a small, although important, part of the management of the gas and  electricity supply in this region. I suspect that, had a member of the public  walked into the Great Hall this morning and noticed the Energy Bill on the  Order Paper, he or she might have expected us to be debating the fact that &pound;9  out of every &pound;10 that consumers spend on energy is sent outside this part of  the world. We pay people from other places for the gas and hydrocarbons of  which we consume a large amount.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I look forward to the day on which, through legislation, we  will have a serious and strategic discussion about our energy policy. I hope  that we will set ourselves ambitious goals to reduce our dependency on imported  gas and oil in particular. I await the day when we look to the economic  opportunities in our region to reduce our dependency on someone else&rsquo;s oil and  find it less in our interests to spend so much time paying so much money to  other people. We could be paying some of that money to our people to develop  renewable and other alternative sources of energy. Not only would that reduce  our dependency on the outside world and increase this region&rsquo;s energy security,  it would provide opportunities for the development of indigenous industries.  The realisation of light engineering capacity, for example, would stimulate  training and employment opportunities in the rural community and provide a  solid bedrock on which to grow the local economy.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">That is the sum extent of my contribution, and I would  appreciate the Minister&rsquo;s clarification on those specific points.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Neeson</strong>: I  support the Bill, as does the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Investment. As the  Minister said, the Bill focuses on the natural gas industry in Northern Ireland.  She eloquently explained the main issues, and I have no intention of repeating  them, particularly as the Assembly Commission meets after the House rises this  evening.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">A minor part of the Bill relates to gas storage, and I  welcome that. As the Minister knows, a planning application has been lodged for  the area around Larne lough and Islandmagee. As I said in the House before,  east Antrim is the energy centre for Northern Ireland. However, I ask  that, during the process, full consultation be carried out with the residents  of Islandmagee. In recent years, they have faced major issues connected to the  building and development of the Moyle interconnector and the new power station  at Ballylumford. Local residents should be brought into the equation.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">We all realise and recognise the importance of the project,  not only to Northern Ireland  but to the island   of Ireland.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I support the Energy Bill, and I thank the Minister for bringing its Second  Stage to the Floor of the House. Many of the clauses have been long anticipated  by many in Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  energy industry. The Minister and many Members will know that I have a  long-standing interest in the gas industry in Northern Ireland, which, as the  Minister and other Members have said, is the Bill&rsquo;s primary focus.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">For a long time, I have supported and been an advocate for  the expansion of the gas industry in Northern Ireland. I have lobbied  extensively and repeatedly, to the point of being an irritation to the Minister  and her departmental officials, for the extension of the natural gas network  through my constituency of Strangford. I have generously lobbied on behalf of  colleagues in South Down for an extension into their constituency and into the  greater south-east area of Northern    Ireland.</p>
<p class="TimePeriod">7.00 pm</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I have supported the roll-out of the gas network in my  hometown of Comber, where Phoenix Natural Gas recently invested almost &pound;1  million to expand its infrastructure and to bring the benefits of natural gas  to many more customers. In the summer, I hope to spend a day or two with Firmus  Energy as part of the Assembly and Business Trust&rsquo;s company fellowship. I have  a long-standing interest in the gas industry, and I hope that it continues. I  want that industry to be advanced in Northern Ireland in whatever way is  possible.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I have unashamedly done that for three main reasons, the  first of which is the environmental benefit of natural gas. Although it is a  fossil fuel, it is infinitely better than the high-carbon fuels, such as oil  and coal, particularly oil, which are prominent in Northern Ireland, especially in  rural areas. If we are to tackle collectively some issues that other Members  talked about, such as reducing our carbon footprint and our dependency on those  high-carbon fuels, we must consider gas, because it has proven to be much more  environmentally friendly than fuels such as oil.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I have also supported gas for economic reasons. In some  ways, that benefit is marginal, but there is a significant price differential  between natural gas and oil or coal. Given the high levels of fuel poverty in Northern Ireland,  the roll-out of gas to as many customers as possible will reap financial  benefits for people&rsquo;s pockets. That is very important. Furthermore, natural gas  has a wider economic benefit. The placing of those pipelines in the ground will  create jobs and investment. We should always encourage money from the private  sector, particularly at this time. That is the background to my interest in the  gas industry.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I support the Bill for one main reason, and I want to speak  about one area. Broadly speaking, gas now has a greater share of the energy  market in Northern Ireland  than it had previously. Since the mid-1990s, when natural gas came back to Northern Ireland and Phoenix Natural Gas  invested in the greater Belfast  area, gas has accounted for an ever-increasing chunk of our energy market.  However, the regulatory and legislative system that underpins it has not kept  pace with that change in market share. The Bill will try to plug some of those  gaps and to bring us into line with legislation in the rest of the United Kingdom.  Moreover, it will bring gas companies into line with electricity companies in Northern Ireland,  because electricity suppliers enjoy some powers that gas suppliers do not.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I will talk about clause 14, which concentrates on powers  of entry. It is important to put that clause in some context. I have spoken to  the gas companies, and I understand that they have a problem with customers  whom they have reason to believe have damaged or tampered with their gas  systems. Although the problem is not widespread, it is at a sufficient level to  cause them some concern, to the extent that they have been pushing for a change  to the law for some time. When the companies try to investigate the problems,  they do not have consent to enter premises. They are sometimes unable to  contact customers even though they have reasonable cause, and they find that  customers are, mysteriously, unable to be contacted. They are out every time  that they are telephoned and every time that their doors are knocked. That is,  potentially, a very serious problem.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">We talked about welfare reform yesterday and mentioned the  old view that, sadly, some people in society encourage benefit fraud. Perhaps  some people believe that tampering with a gas meter is acceptable. It is not  acceptable. Not only is it stealing from the gas supplier, but it could  endanger the homes of that family and its neighbours.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Mr McDevitt talked about reasonable cause for a gas company  to want to enter premises. The Gas (Northern Ireland) Order 1996 allows  gas companies to enter premises where there is a gas escape. That is only right  and proper. However, if Jack the lad were to tamper with his gas meter, he  could damage the meter and the pipes in his house and create the risk of an  explosion that could ruin his house and harm his family and his neighbours.  That is reasonable cause for such a power.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Gas can be a very dangerous energy supply if it gets into  the wrong hands or is mistreated. Therefore &ldquo;reasonable cause&rdquo; is a proper  power if there is a suspicion that something may be wrong. However, it must be  proven either by evidence brought to the gas company by other agencies or the  police or by the company&rsquo;s own data showing erratic or irregular energy  consumption or usage changing drastically over a short time. If a gas company  has such evidence, it is only right and proper that it enter premises to avert  possible disaster. We have all seen the problems that gas escapes cause.  Sometimes such problems are created by people tampering with their systems.  That is a fact, and the Bill will help to address it.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the safeguards. Gas companies, even with the best  of intentions, cannot simply wade into people&rsquo;s houses under the suspicion that  somebody has tampered with or damaged their system. I welcome the fact that  they are encouraged to seek consent in the first instance. Failing that, they  have to have evidence, they have to provide notice, they have to ensure that  entry is done at a reasonable time, and they have to get the consent of a  Justice of the Peace. That is more than reasonable back-up: gas companies  cannot simply wade in without a shred of evidence to somebody&rsquo;s house to check  their system.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the Bill, particularly the clause on the power of  entry. I raised the issue with the Minister and her officials in the past, and  I am glad that the legitimate concerns of Members and of gas companies have  been taken on board and included in the Bill. I am very pleased that the Bill  is being brought forward today. I welcome it and encourage Members to support  it.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment (Mrs Foster)</strong>: I am genuinely grateful to Members for the issues  that they raised. Sometimes, the House takes a great deal of criticism, but it  is at its best when it is doing work like this. Unfortunately, however, work  like this rarely gets covered outside the House.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I will respond to the points that were made across the  Chamber. Members appreciate that this is a technical Bill, although I believe  that it is very important. Members made the point that the gas industry should  be brought up to the same standard that has applied to the electricity sector  for some time. Therefore, it is right that we move quickly on it.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The Energy Bill will ensure that the gas sector will  benefit from the policies that have been successfully implemented in the  electricity sector. A special administration regime applicable to both gas and  electricity sectors will safeguard the provision of supplies by local  electricity and gas networks, thereby putting Northern Ireland consumers&rsquo;  interests above those of creditors and shareholders. That is a key element of  the Bill.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I want to turn to issues that have been raised by Members  across the House. On behalf of the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Investment, the Deputy  Chairperson indicated that the Committee wanted to support the principles of  the Energy Bill. He also mentioned the funding of the scheme. That is an area  that I want to come back to, and I will address the grants that would, as he  put it, be paid to failing energy companies. He also spoke from a Sinn F&eacute;in  point of view about his concerns around power of access and deemed contracts.  His final point related to the independence of meter testing and the meters  that were removed from houses.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Cutting off gas is a last resort. I think that that is a  clear issue and something that has been the case with electricity companies  heretofore. Vulnerable customers who are unable to pay restitution in full will  not be cut off if they agree to put in a pre-payment meter, for example, to  recover the outstanding costs that have been incurred. In consultation with the  Department, gas companies have advised that they will discuss and agree with  the consumer the rate of recovery. Therefore, there will not be a standard rate  of recovery; it will be something that can be worked out between the company  and the gas customer.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">As to whether companies will pay compensation from their  profits or whether it will be paid by consumers, the Utility Regulator, as  Members know, monitors the energy industry here, and he has advised that there  is no regulatory allowance in the electricity price controls to cover  guaranteed standards of performance and that electricity companies are to fund  associated costs. In other words, they cannot recoup it from their customers.  The Department will be working with the Utility Regulator on a scheme for the  gas industry, and I expect that it will work in the same way as our electricity  system. That was the second issue that the Deputy Chairperson raised.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I remind Members that a loan for special administration  will be put in place if we believe that there is a danger of the gas network  not being able to function, and the special administrator will make sure that  it continues to function for the consumer. It is the last resort. If the loan  cannot be recouped from a company in special administration, we will have to  look at alternatives for recovering that money. Nevertheless, the establishment  of a special administration regime for the utility industry will benefit  consumers. If the Bill is referred to the Committee today, that is an area on  which it will spend a little bit of time.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The Deputy Chairperson mentioned the independence of meter  testing. The Bill contains a clause that gives the Utility Regulator the  ability to delegate those functions to an appropriate body that is best  equipped to perform such tasks. It is thought that the National Measurement  Office, which deals with traditional weight and measurement enforcement and  operates UK  wide, will be the agency appointed by the Utility Regulator to take on the  independent testing of any damaged meters that come before him. That will  provide the transparency that the Member has been looking for.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Stephen Moutray welcomed the fact that we are making  negligent or intentional damage to equipment a criminal offence. One of the  main reasons why the provision has been included, and it was mentioned by Mr  Hamilton as well, is because tampering with gas equipment is so serious. As one  of my officials said: when you tamper with electrical equipment, you could kill  yourself; when you tamper with gas equipment, you could kill your whole street.  It is serious stuff. I am sure that Members recognise that, and I think that  that is what Mr Moutray wanted to recognise today.</p>
<p class="TimePeriod">7.15 pm</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Mr Moutray correctly said that, in the past, a gas company  could enter premises only if there was a safety issue. Access was permitted  only under the Gas (Northern    Ireland) Order 1996. If the Bill goes  through, access will be allowed on the grounds of reasonable suspicion. I will  return to that issue, because Mr McDevitt talked about it at some length. Mr  Moutray also welcomed the fact that consumers&rsquo; interests would be protected through  the special administration scheme.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Mr Cree also welcomed the Bill and recognised that its  purpose is to facilitate the diversity of the energy supply. He recognised that  the Bill aims to protect energy consumers and welcomed the special administration  scheme in particular. The regulator has described the special administration  scheme as the &ldquo;second line of defence&rdquo; for customers. Therefore, it exists to  provide additional customer protection. My Department and I believe that that  is to be welcomed wholeheartedly. Mr Cree went on to talk about various clauses  that he particularly welcomes. He said that he hopes, as do I, that gas storage  will come to fruition in the coming months.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Mr McDevitt rose to outline to the House the SDLP&rsquo;s  position on the Bill. He welcomed the performance standards for customer  service in Part 1. He talked about Part 2 and the fact that compensation for  low standards should not be borne by the consumer. I responded to that issue  when I dealt with points that were raised by the Deputy Chairperson.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Mr McDevitt went on to mention specific provisions. In  particular, he mentioned the provisions on reasonableness in clause 14, which  deals with &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; time and &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; suspicion. &ldquo;Reasonable&rdquo; is a  well-used term, which is taken from other legislation, not least the Energy  (Northern Ireland) Order 2003 upon which large parts of the Bill are based. As  I said, the Bill aims to bring gas provisions in line with those for  electricity. If a gas company is denied access to a property, reasonableness is  tested by a Justice of the Peace, so someone else makes that decision. An  objective test, known as the man on the Clapham omnibus test, determines  whether it is reasonable to enter the premises. If necessary, the ultimate  arbitrator is the court.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I mentioned loans in my response to the Deputy Chairperson.  The Bill aims to ensure that consumers remain online while a company is in  difficulty. However, I recognise that points were made about the wisdom of  giving a loan to an energy company that is going down the tubes. My Department  will have to consider that to determine whether it is in the Government&rsquo;s best  interests to intervene during that period and whether that should genuinely be  a policy debate.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">We moved on to talk of a dark November morning and special  administration. I was not quite sure where that was going. Mr McDevitt was not  happy with the title of the Bill and thought it a little grandiose. If it is  grandiose this time round, it was grandiose at the time of the Energy (Northern Ireland)  Order 2003 and the Energy Act 2004 in GB on the special administration scheme.  Therefore, we continue with the grandiose theme.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  That legislation was passed under direct rule.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: The special administration scheme for electricity was, in fact,  brought in under the Energy Act 2004. We are largely emulating that scheme for  gas companies and, indeed, for electricity companies in Northern Ireland.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Mr McDevitt also said that he would like there to be a more  rigorous debate on energy. I am happy for that to be the case. My strategic  energy framework will be published by the Executive &mdash; please God &mdash; before the  end of the summer. It has been consulted on widely, and the Member will find  that discussion has taken place on all the issues that he raised, including the  security of supply and competitiveness.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I thank Mr Neeson for his support. He mentioned gas  storage, as I thought he might. He knows that we hope to have a viable gas  storage facility in the Larne area that will provide us with 70 days&rsquo; gas  storage. As he said, that will be tremendous for Northern   Ireland and, indeed, for Scotland. Such a facility will  greatly enhance our security of supply. I am aware that a planning application  has been submitted for the Islandmagee storage facility&rsquo;s project on Larne  lough. Consultation will be a part of that process, and I want local people to  be involved in it.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I commend Mr Hamilton for his work on the extension to the  gas network and his advocacy on behalf of gas as a sustainable energy source in  Northern Ireland.  I am delighted to tell him about the completion of the gas extension network  study, which I commissioned, along with the Utility Regulator, to consider the  technical and economic feasibility of extending the natural gas network to the  west and to other parts of the north-west of Northern Ireland. We will use the  results of that study to consider how best to take the new gas infrastructure  to areas where there are sufficient gas loads and where large infrastructure  investments of that nature are deemed to be economically viable.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Mr Hamilton concentrated on clause 14 of the Bill, which  deals with powers of entry. He gave reasons why those powers are needed. I am  glad that he articulated those reasons, and I completely agree with him that  they are necessary. Many safeguards have been included in the Bill, and the  Committee will want to examine those safeguards. However, they should be  welcomed.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I am grateful to those who contributed to what has been a  helpful debate on technical but important legislation. I look forward to the  further progress of the Bill through the Assembly. My officials and I look  forward to working with the Committee and our continuing engagement with  Members as the Bill progresses through its legislative stages.</p>
<p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
<p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
<p class="Q3Motion">That the Second Stage of the Energy Bill <span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; ">[NIA 23/09]</span></span> be agreed.</p>
<p class="H4StageHeading" style="page-break-before:always;"><a name="a11"></a>Roads (Miscellaneous  Provisions) Bill: Further Consideration Stage</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I have received notice that the Minister for Regional Development  is not available this evening. The junior Minister Mr Gerry Kelly will move the  Further Consideration Stage of the Roads (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.</p>
<p class="Q3Motion">Moved. &mdash; [The junior Minister (Office of the First Minister  and deputy First Minister) (Mr G Kelly).]</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: As no amendments have been selected, there is no opportunity to  discuss the Roads (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill today. Members will, of  course, be able to have a full debate at Final Stage. Further Consideration  Stage is, therefore, concluded. The Bill stands referred to the Speaker.</p>
<p class="H4StageHeading"><a name="a12"></a>Employment Bill: Final Stage</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning (Sir Reg Empey)</strong>: I beg to move</p>
<p class="Q3Motion">That the Employment Bill [NIA 9/08] do now pass.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I am pleased that the Employment Bill has reached its Final  Stage because it represents an important milestone towards ensuring that we  have in place an effective body of employment law in Northern Ireland. Although the  provisions of the Bill are somewhat mixed and eclectic, they provide for  important changes to a wide range of employment law.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I am pleased that the proposals on the enforcement of  legislation relating to employment agencies and the minimum wage have been  welcomed. The private recruitment sector in Northern Ireland provides an  important degree of flexibility for work seekers and hirers. It continues to  play a vital role in the economic recovery.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The provisions of the Employment Bill will help my  Department to deal with agencies that would attempt to abuse vulnerable workers  or to break the law to gain a competitive advantage over compliant agencies.  Those measures do not affect agencies that operate within the law. However, the  provision of unlimited fines through the Crown Court, powers to compel agencies  or third parties to provide relevant financial information and the removal of  information-sharing barriers between employment agency inspectors and national  minimum wage compliance officers enable my Department to deal more effectively  with those who are intent on breaking the law. I welcome the Assembly&rsquo;s support  for those provisions.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">New provisions about the membership of the Industrial Court  will allow for greater flexibility to facilitate future changes with respect to  the appointment of members of the court. Following the passing of the Bill,  regulations can be made relating to the appointment of members and the terms of  their appointment to replace the current primary legislation provisions, which  are too restrictive.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">We have complied with the requirements of legal advice that  failure to allow legal representation before the Industrial Court could have  led to a challenge under article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights;  that is, the right to a fair trial. Parties appearing before the Industrial  Court will now be able to have legal representation in relation to seven of the  court&rsquo;s eight jurisdictions. By its nature, the final jurisdiction, which is to  do with the provision of voluntary arbitration in relation to industrial disputes,  would not benefit from legal representation, and, for that reason, the  necessary changes brought about by the Bill to representation in the Industrial  Court do not apply there.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">We have heard in the Assembly of a number of cases during  the economic downturn where employers have not paid workers who are being made  redundant. The losses incurred by individuals may not be limited to non-payment  of redundancy or unlawful deductions from wages. They could, for example,  extend to interest charges and direct debit charges on bank accounts. The Bill  provides for compensation for the full financial loss sustained by individuals,  and it will be a great advantage to claimants in such cases that an industrial  tribunal can order the employer to pay compensation. That will be in addition  to paying or repaying the amount arising from the employer&rsquo;s direct liability.  That clause in the Bill relieves claimants of the need to make a separate claim  to obtain the compensation element through the civil courts.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Of equal importance are those people who are endeavouring  to gain employment through participation in my Department&rsquo;s employment and  training programmes. By treating payments received as training allowance, not  employed income, we will ensure that participants are not liable for tax and  National Insurance while taking part in those programmes.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Chairperson and members of the Committee for  their detailed consideration of the Bill. The publication of the Committee&rsquo;s  report, and its subsequent work in relation to amendments, contributed very  much to the final outcome. In particular, the Committee pointed the way for  engagement by my Department with stakeholders on consultation rights, and that  led to effective agreement in an area that might otherwise have proved contentious.  That engagement has clarified the form in which the consultation will take  place on the arrangements for public appointments to the boards of  CITB-ConstructionSkills Northern Ireland and the Labour Relations Agency.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Employment and Learning (Mrs D Kelly)</strong>: It has been  almost a year since the Second Stage of the Bill and the subsequent Committee  Stage. I thank the Minister and his officials for their support and  co-operation during the passage of the Bill. I also thank the Bill Clerk and  the Committee staff for their work in bringing the Bill to this point. Finally,  I thank the other Committee members for the effort and commitment that they  have applied to the pre-legislative stage and Committee Stage of the Bill.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I would like to state on the record how important the work  of the Committee is in the Bill process. Often the public does not realise that  the work of the Assembly is so much more than what is portrayed in the media &mdash;  a view expressed just a short time ago by Minister Foster of the Department of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The Bill&rsquo;s First Stage was on Monday 22 June 2009, with the  Second Stage on 30 June and the Committee Stage beginning on Wednesday 1 July.  The Consideration Stage was on 25 May 2010. The Committee undertook a fairly  extensive pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill before it was brought to the  Floor of the Assembly, and that continued during a thorough Committee Stage.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The background to the Bill is that the Minister&rsquo;s  Department is responsible for the regulation of the private recruitment sector,  including the inspection of locally based employment agencies and businesses.</p>
<p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The Department employs two inspectors whose role it  is to inspect the relevant businesses and to investigate any complaints made  against them. If any one of those businesses does not comply with the law, the  Department has the power to prosecute it in a Magistrate&rsquo;s Court or to apply to  an industrial tribunal to prohibit an individual from operating or being  concerned with the operation of an employment agency for a period of up to 10  years.</p>
<p class="TimePeriod">7.30 pm</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The Bill seeks to enhance the Department&rsquo;s powers to  investigate and to prosecute those involved in particularly serious offences  under employment agency law. I am sure that Members will agree it is vital that  there be robust powers to ensure that the employment agency sector is properly  policed. In this time of economic hardship, many people have been put out of  work and are turning to agencies to find employment. Many of them are  desperate, because they have bills and mortgages to pay, and would be easy prey  for unscrupulous agencies.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The Bill provides the Department with important powers to  compel agencies and third parties, such as banks, to provide financial  information that is useful to the investigation of an agency. Obviously, that  power must be used sparingly and appropriately and only when authorised at an  appropriate level in the Department. The Bill provides clarification on the law  relating to information sharing. It allows national minimum wage compliance  officers from Revenue and Customs and DEL&rsquo;s employment agency inspectors to  legally share and exchange information, which means that employment agency  inspectors could, for example, highlight cases to Revenue and Customs in which  employment businesses have breached the National Minimum Wage Act 1998. Again,  I am sure that Members will be keen to support the protection of vulnerable  workers, who are often new to the country and are at the bottom of the pay  scale. Such people often do not know their rights and need to be shielded from  those who would exploit them.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">All Members will be aware of examples that their  constituents have brought to their attention of employment agencies&rsquo; abusing  the law. The Committee was made acutely aware of that and, as a consequence,  has supported the Bill throughout the process. Businesses must operate in  strict accordance with the law and good practice. All of us have heard of the  abuse of wage, leave, maternity and paternity regulations, among others, and we  must all show our commitment to working with the bodies and organisations that  seek to root out and to end such abuses. The Committee has shown its  determination to help vulnerable groups, particularly in the current climate in  which unemployment has risen sharply and many more people are looking for work.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The Bill also deals with a more flexible approach to  appointments to the Industrial Court, and members are content that that is  sensible and necessary. The Bill makes provision for the extension of legal  representation to all jurisdictions of the Industrial Court, except that which  deals with the provision of voluntary arbitration in industrial disputes. The  Committee is aware of the legal advice that the Department received stating that  a failure to allow legal representation might be a breach of the right to a  fair trial under the European Convention on Human Rights. The Committee is  awaiting the Committee Stage of the Employment (No.2) Bill, which deals more  fully with workplace dispute resolution. The Committee has done a great deal of  the groundwork for the second Bill, and members support the establishment of  improved systems for resolving disputes in the workplace.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The Minister and his Department undertook meaningful and  thorough consultation, the results of which are reflected in the Bill. The  Committee acted as a super-consultee in that process, and it wrote to the  Department in December 2008 indicating that members were content with the  provisions that went forward and are in the Bill. The only issue that the  Committee regarded as problematic was the proposal to amend the legislation  relating to a trade union&rsquo;s ability to expel members for reasons relating to  party political membership. Members believe that such provisions would have  far-reaching and potentially dangerous implications, and the Committee wishes  to record its support for the exclusion of that provision from the Bill. The  debate on that issue is for another day, but it is one that, ultimately, we  cannot avoid.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">As part of the Committee Stage, views on the Bill were  sought through a public notice in the three main daily newspapers. There were  no submissions in response to that. The Committee supported the Minister&rsquo;s  amendments to the Bill, and those were thoroughly debated at Consideration  Stage. Members have talked previously about the benefits of the Committee&rsquo;s  approach to Bills where members work closely, where possible, with the Minister  and his Department to ensure that the Committee&rsquo;s views are heard, respected and  acted on. The Committee&rsquo;s chief aims in its relationship with the Minister and  his Department will continue to be co-operation, where appropriate, and  constructive dialogue.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Butler</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I do not have much to say. The  Committee looked extensively at the Bill during its Committee Stage. I welcome  some areas of the Bill, such as that concerning employment agencies, which, as  the Minister mentioned, deals with how some agencies have treated workers over  the years. I commend the Minister for changing and tightening up the law in  that regard. That is not to say that all employment agencies have done wrong or  abused staff. However, the issue has come before the House on a number of  occasions and the Minister has been asked questions on it. Therefore, this is  welcome legislation to ensure that agency workers are treated properly. I also  welcome the minimum wage aspect of the Bill.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">As the Minister said, there is an issue around people  trying to get appointments with organisations such as the Labour Relations  Agency. The Committee met trade union representatives, and the Department was  very helpful on that matter. That dispute was resolved to everybody&rsquo;s  satisfaction.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Overall, the Bill is to be welcomed. A lot of work was done  on it over the past year during Committee Stage. The Minister set up a working  group to look at the issue of workplace dispute resolution, and a lot of good  work was done by that group.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">By and large, as far as this side of the House is  concerned, we fully support the Bill.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr Robert  Coulter</strong>: I support the Bill and commend the Minister for the way in which  he co-operated with the Committee in bringing it to this stage. From this point  on, the Bill will give hope to a lot of people who, in the past, felt that they  were being neglected when it came to the issue of workplace disputes. I hope  that the Bill will achieve much success and result in satisfaction in the  workplace.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I thank Members for their contributions. I pay  tribute to the high level of co-operation that there was with stakeholders,  through the Committee, to achieve today&rsquo;s very positive outcome.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">It is important to recognise that the Bill is the first  piece of primary legislation in the employment field to be delivered by the  Assembly. In these straitened economic times, it is even more important that  the necessary employment protections are in place, which, while not undermining  labour market flexibility, can provide protection for workers.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Committee Chairperson for her comments. She  said that it is vital that robust powers are in place to ensure that the  employment agency sector is properly policed. I emphasise that the proposals  relating to employment agencies will not place any additional burden on  reputable agencies. However, I agree that it is important, especially during  the current economic climate, that the recruitment sector in Northern Ireland  is properly regulated and that my Department has the necessary powers to  curtail those who consistently seek to abuse the law and exploit vulnerable  workers.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I will turn briefly to the issue of a trade union&rsquo;s ability  to expel members for reasons relating to party political membership. The  Committee Chairperson rightly said the provision regarding that issue has been  removed from the Bill. That was due to problems surrounding section 75 issues  and the legislative competence of the Assembly to deal with those. The Department  is currently seeking a way forward on that, possibly by use of a Westminster  legislative vehicle. The Committee will be fully briefed on those issues as  they develop.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Members will be aware that, as was referred to, there is  now a second Bill, known as the Employment (No. 2) Bill, which was introduced  on 2 June 2010. I hope that that latter Bill can be dealt with in the same  spirit of co-operation that has been adopted to date.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I value the Committee&rsquo;s work in scrutinising the Bills. We  have a good relationship, and I look forward to that continuing. I am confident  that the Employment Bill will address my Department&rsquo;s objectives of developing  and maintaining an effective framework for employment rights, relations and  responsibilities.</p>
