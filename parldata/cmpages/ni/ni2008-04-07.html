	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The Assembly met at 12.00 noon (Mr Speaker in the  Chair).</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Members observed two minutes&rsquo; silence.</p>
	      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="1"></a>Executive Committee Business</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Public Health (Amendment) Bill</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Further Consideration Stage</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I remind Members that, under Standing Order 35(2), the Further Consideration  Stage of the Bill is restricted to the debating of any amendments that have  been tabled. As no amendments have been tabled, there will be no opportunity  today to discuss the Bill. However, Members will be able to have a full debate  during the Bill&rsquo;s Final Stage.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Further Consideration Stage of the Bill is, therefore,  concluded. The Bill stands referred to the Speaker.</p>
	      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="2"></a>Private Members&rsquo; Business</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Forkhill Military Site</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Members will recall that this motion was on the Order Paper on Monday 31 March  but could not be disposed of before the House adjourned.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to one hour  and 30 minutes for the debate. The proposer of the motion will have 10 minutes  to propose and 10 minutes to make a  winding-up speech. All other Members who are called to speak will have  five minutes.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Two amendments have been selected and published on the  Marshalled List. The proposer of each amendment will have 10 minutes to propose  and five minutes to make a winding-up speech. A valid petition of concern in  respect of amendment No 2 was presented on 31 March. The effect of the petition  of concern is that any vote on amendment No 2 will be decided on a  cross-community basis.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly notes with concern the role of the  Department of Agriculture and Rural Development in the redevelopment of the  Forkhill Military Site, and believes that the Department for Social Development  should consider taking the lead role in the matter.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am pleased to have the opportunity to move the motion, which, as you said, Mr Speaker, has been  carried over from a previous day as there was insufficient time to  debate it then. I, therefore, welcome the opportunity to move the motion that  stands in my name and in those of William McCrea and Trevor Clarke.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The motion does not state that nothing should happen at the  Forkhill site; that is not what we are saying. However, we are mystified as to  why the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (DARD) or its Minister  should think that it is their duty or responsibility to develop military sites  across Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The listed responsibilities and functions of DARD tell a  different story &mdash; that Department does not have responsibility for developing  military sites in Northern    Ireland. The DARD website states:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;DARD has responsibility for food, farming, and  environmental policy and the development of the rural sector in Northern Ireland.  It provides a business development service for farmers and growers, and a  veterinary service with administration of animal health and welfare.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">It is difficult to reconcile those responsibilities  with the development of a former army base or military site.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I see that the Minister is in her place, and I look forward  to hearing her outline, in graphic detail, her plans for the site and how they  will enhance the agriculture sector and bring confidence to it. Some Members  are of the strong opinion that the Minister&rsquo;s remit,  energies and resources would be better channelled towards the  agriculture industry, some sectors of which are having difficulty surviving. I  have no doubt that, in a short time, she will come to the House with all the  answers and put us all at ease by informing us about how she proposes to  redevelop the site using her budget, among other resources. However, I will not  pre-empt what she intends to say.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As I said at the outset, the motion does not state that  there should be no redevelopment of the Forkhill army base. There are several  former military sites across the Province, and they provide significant housing  and employment opportunities for local people. Those opportunities must not be  missed. However &mdash; and I will continue to emphasise this point &mdash; the remit of  the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development does not cover the  provision of housing or the creation of jobs in the industry sector. The  Minister will, therefore, find it difficult to justify her interference in  those areas.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister might contend that she has an interest in all  things rural, but if that point were brought to its logical conclusion, she  could claim responsibility for every area of Government that affects those who  live in rural areas.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The proof that the development of the site should not lie  within the responsibility of DARD is shown by the method by which the site was  to be purchased. The public purse would not have had to pay once for the site;  it would have been forced to pay twice for the pleasure of having DARD take the  lead role in its development.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The responsibility for every other similar develop&shy;ment has  lain with the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister (OFMDFM)  and the Department for Social Development (DSD). Given that those are the  Departments that have statutory responsibility for that type of work, the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development should focus her attention on the  problems that the agriculture industry faces. The proper advice for the  Minister &mdash; and, perhaps, her officials might whisper this in her ear sometime &mdash;  is to let OFMDFM and the Department for Social Development get on with what  they are supposed to be doing. Indeed, she should be reminded that the role and  function of the Agriculture Minister is to look after the agriculture industry.  It is hoped that, as a result of today&rsquo;s debate, that message will come out  loud and clear and that the Minister will follow the advice of the Assembly.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">DARD is in a rush to fast-track the development, regardless  of its failings. One proposal seeks to establish business units on the site,  despite the fact that Invest NI has not identified a need in that area. Other  provisions would be developed on the site, regardless of need or whether they  replicate similar services in other local villages or rural areas.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A list of problems and failings has been identified.  However, the Minister, in her mad rush to progress the development, has not taken those problems on board. Many of my  colleagues are members of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development  and are mystified by the Minister&rsquo;s headlong charge towards development,  regardless of the problems or cost.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am sure that the Minister and her party could not be  attempting to score brownie points in the south Armagh  area at the expense of another Minister and another political party. However,  on examination of the handling of the development, many reasonable people may  reach that conclusion.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Millions of pounds from DARD&rsquo;s budget will be invested in a  project that may benefit the Forkhill area. However, the agriculture industry  is struggling to survive. Several million pounds could have a great impact if  they were ploughed into the Department&rsquo;s response to the Red Meat Industry Task  Force. That would have an impact right across Northern Ireland rather than in  only one village. Therefore, we ask the Minister to concentrate her efforts on  the agriculture industry and leave those issues to others.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Similarly, pig farmers are hanging on to production by a  thin thread. They lose money on every pig that they produce, yet their plight  is met with stubborn inaction by DARD, compared with the &ldquo;can&rsquo;t wait, won&rsquo;t  wait&rdquo; approach taken to the development of the Forkhill army base. Although the  development, undoubtedly, has merits, the Minister must prioritise to ensure  that the greatest good is delivered by her Department. If the Minister  considers the plight of the pig industry,  perhaps she will conclude that the millions of pounds allocated to this  project &mdash; which is none of her business or concern &mdash; would be better deployed  in that sector. The construction of a strategy to secure the future of beef  farmers and sheep farmers must surely be a greater priority.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Similarly, the future of pig farmers in the Province might  have been considered a more important use of several million pounds of public  money. The establishment of a few industrial units in south Armagh may help  farmers to leave the agriculture industry &mdash; a measure on which the Minister is  keen &mdash; but it will not help a farming industry in crisis. The core of the  debate is about the specific responsibilities of DARD. Seemingly, the Minister  for Agriculture and Rural Development does not believe in farmers actually  farming. Every policy tries to put farmers out to pasture and to move away from  agriculture. Rural development must be a core aspect of DARD&rsquo;s activities, but  it must not be the only activity.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I urge the Minister to consider carefully the content of  this debate, which I hope will encourage her to return to her roots and  responsibilities and pour the Department&rsquo;s resources, funding and energy into  the agriculture industry &mdash; something for which she is directly responsible.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">12.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  I beg to move amendment No 1: Leave out all after &ldquo;notes&rdquo; and insert</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;the role of the  Department of Agriculture and Rural Development in the redevelopment of  the Forkhill Military Site, and believes the department should continue to work  with the Department for Social Development on it; and calls on the Department  of Finance and Personnel to reconsider its position on this project to ensure  that the best possible project is delivered for the people of Forkhill and the  surrounding district.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Go raibh maith agat, a  Cheann Comhairle. &Eacute;ir&iacute;m leis an ch&eacute;ad leas&uacute; ar an r&uacute;n a mholadh. The  Department of Agriculture and Rural Development has an obvious lead role in,  and a main responsibility for, what is clearly a rural development project,  which will have benefits for the rural hinterland of south Armagh.  The Department for Social Development also has a role to play, particularly in  acquiring the land and providing social housing. The Minister for Social  Development, Margaret Ritchie, has expressed her full support for the project  and her willingness to work in co-operation with DARD to bring the project to  fruition.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">DARD&rsquo;s primary role in the initiative is to provide the  finance for the purchase of the site and to develop the business plan to present  to the Department of Finance and Personnel (DFP). I note the unfounded  allegations in the media that DSD had a role in frustrating the Forkhill  project. According to my information, nothing could be further from the truth.  DSD has been fully supportive of the project and has co-operated fully with  DARD on the issue. Those who suggest otherwise are being mischievous and  engaging in petty political point-scoring, which is of no benefit whatsoever to  the future of the project. DSD and its Minister have a role in acquiring the  site, the resources for which are to be provided by DARD, subject to the  approval of DFP.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The motion has, to some extent, been overtaken by events,  as, in the interim, the project has not received approval from DFP. However,  that is not a reason why this innovative project should be allowed to sink into  oblivion. DARD should re-examine the business case for the project and submit a  revised plan to DFP, to ensure that the project becomes a reality.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The proposal is a worthy one, which deserves the support of  the Executive. It is aimed at developing community facilities in Forkhill and  the surrounding district, and will include business units, sporting and family  recreational facilities, a community centre and much-needed social housing for  the area.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The joint declaration by the British and Irish Governments  of April 2003 promised vacated military sites to local people who have endured  decades dominated by the Troubles:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Many of the vacated military and police &hellip; sites might  be made available &hellip; to ensure that the process of normalisation generates a new  public asset base for those communities most directly affected by the security  arrangements to date.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">There is no doubt that Forkhill is one such place.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I note also the First Minister&rsquo;s answer to a question about  the Lisanelly site during Question Time on 3 March:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;OFMDFM continues to press the British Government  strongly about the transfer of Lisanelly and other military sites to the  Executive. We are waiting for a response from the Chief Secretary to the  Treasury. We recently met the Secretary of State to discuss that important  issue, and we clearly set out our view that an MOD requirement for the  Executive to purchase such sites at market value is a retraction from the joint  declaration position.</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">Furthermore, we pointed out the substantial impact  that such an approach will have on our investment capacity, and we asked for  the Secretary of State&rsquo;s urgent personal intervention and support. Clearly, we  want to see whether the Secretary of State is able to persuade his colleagues  that the sites can be purchased at market value &hellip; We will press the issue again  shortly &mdash; directly with the Prime Minister&rdquo;. &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Official Report, Vol 28,  No 3, p137, col 1].</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That is the response from the First Minister, the  leader of Lord Morrow&rsquo;s party.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In response to my question on the Forkhill military site  during the same Question Time, the First Minister said:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The principle must  first be established that we will benefit, and we must put our hearts and minds  to that. The promise that was made by the British Government must be fulfilled,  and the people of Northern    Ireland must benefit from what happens to  those sites.&rdquo; &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Official Report, Vol 28, No 3, p137, col 2].</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the commitment of the First Minister and deputy  First Minister to the acquisition of those sites, and I urge them to redouble  their efforts to ensure that those sites are available to our people without  further delay. I also commend the Forkhill community for the work that it has  done in developing the proposal. As public representatives, the least that we  can do is provide the resources to ensure that the community&rsquo;s vision becomes a  reality.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If devolution is to be meaningful to our citizens, we must  be seen to deliver on projects such as the one that is under discussion today.  We have heard much talk about a peace dividend, but, to date, we have seen  little evidence of it. Communities that have suffered through decades of  conflict deserve recognition, and the project proposed  for Forkhill fits the bill perfectly in that respect.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, I call on the Departments concerned &mdash; DARD and  DFP, in co-operation with DSD &mdash; to work together to ensure that our people  benefit from devolution and that the best possible project is delivered for the  people of Forkhill and the surrounding district. Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Dallat] in the Chair)</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  I beg to move amendment No 2: Leave out all after &ldquo;Site&rdquo; and insert</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;and, inter alia, for the purposes of paragraph 1.4(f)  of the Northern Ireland  Ministerial Code, determines that the site shall not be acquired by, or on  behalf of, the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Members who secured this debate today. I have  never made any secret of my opposition to DARD&rsquo;s taking the lead role in the  project. That is not to say that I am against the development of Forkhill army  base. As Dominic Bradley said, the project should be developed for the  community. However, I am concerned about the prospect of the Department of Agriculture  and Rural Development taking the lead role in the project. I base my opinion on  several factors that I have aired and highlighted in the Committee for  Agriculture and Rural Development, and I will reiterate them again.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The development of any former military base in the Province  must be handled with care. Across Northern Ireland, the public would  like redundant sites &mdash; whether they are army bases, former army bases or any  other sites &mdash; to be developed so that they  can deliver for local communities.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In fact, the Minister for Social Development, Margaret  Ritchie, announced recently that a new eco-village will be built in my  constituency &mdash; Fermanagh and South Tyrone &mdash; which is also the constituency of  the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, on the site of the former  Grosvenor army base in Enniskillen. That decision was broadly welcomed by all  members of the community, and it is my sincere hope that the new homes will  help to bring increased revenue into Enniskillen and release the ever-growing  pressure on the Housing Executive to provide social and affordable housing in  the area. I should be delighted to see something similar, with broader  community support and development, on the Forkhill site. However, I do not  believe that the Agriculture Minister or her Department are best placed to  deliver on that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The proposals for the development of the Forkhill barracks  site include social housing, business units and community facilities, and are  largely supported by members of my party and of other parties. However, my  concern is that DARD will be the lead funder and administrator of the project:  that should be the responsibility of other Departments. Where are the  Departments of Social Development, Enterprise Trade and Investment, Education  and Health, Social Services and Public Safety in the development? Surely bodies  in those Departments should take the lead role. I, and others, ask the Minister  of Agriculture and Rural Development and her Department why they feel it  necessary to branch into the development of buildings and dwellings, and other  programmes that are clearly outside the remit of that Department. The building  of social homes and community facilities is not the responsibility of the  Department of Agriculture and Rural Development.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The essence of the project is social, and that brings it outside the agriculture and rural development  context. I know that departmental bodies work together throughout Northern Ireland,  with a view to providing cohesive and efficient benefits for all the people of  this Province. However we set a precedent if  the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development takes the lead in  such a project. Will that mean that every village and town with a population of  under 4,500 will expect the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development to  spend its money on projects in that area,  and that the Department for Social Development and others will not have  to do that? What does that say for other sites that are, at the moment,  redundant? Will it mean that sites in the Minister&rsquo;s constituency and mine,  such as the old Duke of Westminster High School sites in Ballinamallard and  Kesh &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hilditch</strong>:  If the Member has had the opportunity to read the Department&rsquo;s response to the  question, he will, perhaps, have seen a section referring to the Department&rsquo;s  concern that the site will fall to a private developer to turn into a housing  development, which would take the population of Forkhill to well over 4,500. Is  it a concern of the Department that a private developer wishes to develop the  site into housing?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  Clearly the Department will have a view on that. If DARD is going to develop a  site such as Forkhill, other sites should  also be examined, including those old school sites that I mentioned, and  one even closer to the Minister&rsquo;s own home, in Granville. An old school there  could be developed into something else, such as housing or business units. Is  that under the remit of the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development?  Those issues must be examined, because we could set a very dangerous precedent  for the Department. It will cause almost a leeching of money by the Department  of Agriculture and Rural Development to fund issues that are no concern  whatsoever of that Department.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The agricultural community in Northern Ireland &mdash; as Lord Morrow  said earlier &mdash; wants to see more proactive work taking place regarding  situations of countrywide importance, such as the promotion of local produce,  addressing the continuing consolidation of  farm land, and the huge crisis facing the pig industry. Some people say  that agriculturally based families and workers want to be greedy, but that is  not the case. They want to see rural development progress &mdash; and I want to make that absolutely clear. We  want to see rural development go forward in Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The difficulty is that large sections of the  rural-development funding come from farmers; the farming community helps to  support the rural communities and the rural development projects, because  modulation funding has taken that money from farmers through their single farm  payment. It is not fair for people to say that the whole farming community is  interested only in farming. That is not the case.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, I am  concerned that, if DARD continues to lead and fund the project in the  future, millions of pounds will be poured into it, but who will actually  administer and run it? Will it be sustainable? The business case that I saw  provides no such guarantees, nor did it fill me with confidence that the  project will be run and developed positively for Northern Ireland or for the area in  which it is to be located.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">12.30 pm.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Northern    Ireland agriculture industry requires  investment, stimulation and general support, and the fundamental provider of  such support is DARD, which is also responsible for rural development. As a  rural citizen, and as a man with the agriculture industry at heart &mdash; and given  the knowledge that so many ventures are going to the wall &mdash; how could I support  DARD&rsquo;s leadership role in the Forkhill project?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Undoubtedly, the project is much needed in the area, and,  as we heard, it has the local community&rsquo;s backing. I wish it success, but I do  not wish DARD to be used in such a way. If the Department continues along that  path, it will be making a huge mistake. My concern is that the proposal is  political rather than departmental.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Rural development is a matter for everyone in Northern Ireland,  and it must not be used as a conduit to build social housing and industrial  units. Money for that could be better processed using other mechanisms.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I ask Members to  support the Ulster Unionist Party&rsquo;s amendment. Do not allow DARD to be  dragged into areas that are not its business.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Thus far, the message from the  other side of the Chamber is that those Members simply do not want money to be  spent on that project or in that area, and they are seeking every possible  device to frustrate and prevent that happening. In many ways, the Ulster  Unionist Party&rsquo;s amendment is more honest than the DUP&rsquo;s motion, which, in  effect, seeks to do the same thing.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The project in that village is very much about rural  development. For more than 30 years, those barracks &mdash; a huge, imposing  structure covering more than 14 acres &mdash; dominated the small village from a height  and were right smack in the centre of it. The movement in and out of that site  impacted negatively on lives in the community to such an extent that the  primary school found it necessary to develop plans to relocate away from the  barracks.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">When the military and the police decided to pull out of the  site, there was much relief in the area, and the case has been made that the Ministry of Defence (MOD) should, in  good faith, have handed over the site for development by the community.  However, of course, the MOD has sought to generate every last shilling from the  site for its war efforts elsewhere in the world.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The regeneration group &mdash; which has a proven track record in  stimulating economic redevelopment projects in the village &mdash; came forward with  a plan that includes social housing, childcare provision, retail and industrial  units and open space comprising protected walking and lit walkways, and, in  doing so, secured the support of the Department of Agriculture and Rural  Development, the Department for Social Development, the local council and Invest NI, and involved community,  sporting and cultural groups. Most importantly, the project also received an  overwhelming mandate from the entire village, who wanted the site to be  developed in such a fashion.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The case for the project was presented to the Departments  in order to gain support. Mr Elliott and Maurice Morrow inferred that the  current Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development&rsquo;s decision was political;  however, the interest expressed by both Departments predates the Assembly&rsquo;s  restoration; both were on board for the Forkhill project and both were working with the community and the local council  long before last May, and I took community representatives to meet  direct rule Ministers and officials from the relevant Departments and agencies.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The attempt by some, particularly the Chairperson of the  Committee for Agriculture and Rural Develop&shy;ment and several other Committee  colleagues from his party and the Ulster  Unionist Party, to portray the project as a politically motivated  initiative by the Minister, betrays the hostility that the project has faced.  Their assertion is untrue, and had those Committee members investigated the history of the project, they  would know that. Both Departments, as well as all the agencies,  supported the project long before the current Minister took office. The  Minister has simply delivered what those Departments were in the process of  doing.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  Given the Member&rsquo;s ministerial role, this may be a difficult question for him  to answer, but has he read the business case for the project and seen the  hypocrisy therein?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>:  The Member&rsquo;s use of the word hypocrisy betrays his political attitude towards  the project and the area in which it is based. Not only have I have read the  business case, I was part of the group that worked on it at the start, as were  all the elected representatives from the area. That includes all members of the  parties that held seats on Newry and Mourne District Council; indeed, the  entire council supported the project.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I believe that the business case stacks up, and it has the  support of many agencies, not just the Department of Agriculture and Rural  Development. The Member&rsquo;s description of the business case betrays what is at  the root of the motion. The irony is that the remote direct rule Ministers, who  were not in touch with the feelings of the people and who were not reflecting  the views on the ground, supported the project. Yet, when the institutions are  returned, we find political hostility, not from Departments or the Civil  Service, but from MLAs, including those who chair Committees. Those people have  generated political hostility to the project.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The project will  succeed. Maurice Morrow mentioned missed opportunities, and the  opportunities presented by this project should not be missed. The irony was not  lost that, in the same week that it was  revealed that DFP had not offered funding for the project, the Minister  of Enterprise, Trade and Investment and the MP for East Belfast visited a  community project in that area that was  funded by Government agencies. If the funding is not found, the project  will be lost, and that would be a missed opportunity. Someone will build on the  site, and cram &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>A Member</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>: I  will not; I have only seconds left.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Someone will cram houses on to that site, and that will be  detrimental for the population and that area.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Political hostility is the real intention behind the  Unionist motion and the Unionist amendment.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bresland</strong>:  I welcome the opportunity to speak in support of the motion. The role of the  Department of Agriculture and Rural Development is twofold: first, to offer  support to the agriculture industry; and secondly, to support sustainable rural  development.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The European Union recognises rural development as the  second pillar of the common agricultural policy, and, over several years, DARD  has engaged in programmes that support rural  development in NorthernIreland. DARD has engaged with stakeholders, including  other Departments, strategic bodies, funding bodies, and, most importantly, the  local community, to develop sustainable rural development projects.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">DARD&rsquo;s proposal to purchase the former military base from  the Ministry of Defence and the PSNI takes the Department in a different  direction in its promotion of sustainable rural development. Indeed, that fact  was noted in the economic appraisal for the acquisition of the former Forkhill military base. That appraisal  suggests that the proposals for Forkhill should be considered as a pilot scheme, given that a  well-established community development infrastructure exists.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The economic appraisal leaves several simple questions  unanswered. I am concerned about the process of purchasing the property from  the MOD and the PSNI. There is no legal provision for DARD to purchase  property; therefore, it proposes to ask the Department for Social Development  to purchase the former military base and transfer the property back to DARD.  Can the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development tell us how much the  process to transfer the property between the various Departments will cost, in  addition to the cost of the land?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">When the economic appraisal was submitted to the Committee  for Agriculture and Rural Development, it became clear that it did not explain  how the complex transfer process would work. The economic appraisal also failed  to show value for money, the number of jobs that would be created, how the  project would address deprivation, and many other basic principles with which  an economic appraisal should deal.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The economic appraisal also mentions DARD&rsquo;s plans for a  community capital grant scheme, and suggests that the community group will  apply to DARD for some &pound;2,895,000. What is the community capital grant scheme?  Can other community groups in Northern    Ireland apply to that scheme?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">For a number of years, the Department for Social Development has been involved in  capital-development programmes, and has, in that time, developed  consider&shy;able expertise in that process. Such expertise should be compared to  that of DARD. The economic appraisal recognises  that the proposal is a pilot scheme for DARD.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">DARD has a valuable role to play in supporting rural  development and assisting local communities to improve society. However, this  proposal is flawed and will create a precedent that will offer nothing to help  to create sustainable rural development.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The first principle of rural development is to put people  first. Rural-development projects must also develop capacity, skills and confidence  and must offer economic opportunities for future generations. These proposals  will potentially offer such opportunities. However,  they will be best achieved through the well-tested methods that have  been used by the Department for Social Development.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I support the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I commend the group in Forkhill for  identifying that the best use of the land is for a multi&shy;faceted development and for submitting a  comprehensive business plan. That business plan considers the whole idea  of rural development, including business opportunities, housing and childcare.  It will ensure sustainable development and sustainable communities, which will  result in a vibrant way of life.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It has been suggested that this project does not offer  value for money. However, funding has been granted to schemes that have had  much smaller numbers of beneficiaries. Some 70% of people in rural areas are  not farmers. Although they support farmers and will continue to do so, it is important  to acknowledge that if rural communities are to survive, development outside  the agriculture industry is required.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Forkhill has suffered at the hands of the British military  establishment for the past 30 years. It appears that some Members would prefer  to have a continued military presence. However, they have gone away, you know.  The people of south Armagh, and specifically  Forkhill in this instance, have the right to local sustainable development.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I commend the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development  for embracing all aspects of her brief. This project is about joined-up  Government, and it is for the Executive to decide on which Department or  Departments are best qualified to deliver it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is encouraging to hear that DSD is fully supportive of  the project. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  I am more than disappointed that the project  is still being discussed and led by the Department of Agriculture and  Rural Development. Although one can see the merits of the redevelopment of a  disused site, I am amazed that it is being led by DARD.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members have heard about the childcare facilities, the  social housing and the various aspects of the project &mdash; much of which I still  do not believe should be led by DARD.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If it were not for the recent Budget, one would almost  believe that DARD has too much money and is looking for ways to spend it. If  that is the case, maybe DARD officials should consider the recent Red Meat  Industry Task Force report &mdash; the Department has given no help to the farmers who were discussed in that report.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There are also issues for the pig industry: farmers are  producing and selling pigs for &pound;27 less than they cost to produce. Perhaps DARD will help them. However, I do not  think so. The farmer from north Antrim &mdash; on whose farm the first outbreak of  bluetongue in the Province occurred &mdash; had his entire herd culled by the  Department. Perhaps that farming family expected to receive help. However, it  did not. In an answer to a question, the Minister said that she was not  compelled to pay compensation. However, she now sees fit to provide industrial  units in south Armagh.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">What about the increasing prices of grain? Help should be  made available to people affected by that. However, it is not. What about the  ageing fleet of fishing boats in Northern Ireland? Perhaps DARD will  help those in that industry. However, they have received no help either.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">All of them come under the remit of the Department for  Agriculture and Rural Development. Perhaps the Minister would prefer  agriculture to be dropped from her remit. Perhaps she wants to be the Minister  for rural development only. That will not be the case, and I will not be part  of it.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">12.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Farming is a key part of business in Northern Ireland,  and it should not be forgotten that farming is a way of life for many people.  Instead of interfering with the remits of other Departments, I suggest that the  Minister should focus on her own remit and let others look after theirs.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Savage</strong>: I  support amendment No 2. Before talking about that, I will mention the background  to the matter.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Forkhill military site became available following the  announcement in July 2005 that, due to the improving security situation, a  number of army posts would be demolished. Following consultations with the  local community and sporting  representatives, local politicians and various agencies decided to  develop a practical vision for the use of the vacant site, Bernard Boyle of  Forkhill and District Development Association outlined proposals in February  2007. He stated that the site would be used for retail and business units, an  all day childcare facility, a playing field, a recreation area and an  illuminated walkway.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">At a meeting of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural  Development on 9 October 2007, the Deputy Chairperson &mdash; my colleague Tom  Elliott &mdash; proposed that, although the Committee supported the development of  the Forkhill army site, DARD should not be the lead Department in the  development or financing of it or any other military site.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That motion was carried, because we want to see the  Forkhill site developed for the benefit of the people of the area. That can  best be achieved under the auspices of the Department for Social Development.  However, that is not to say that DARD will not have any input.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have read about this matter and heard a number of Members  in the Chamber saying that the number of Departments should be cut. Having done  so, I have concluded that DARD should take over the Department for Social  Development because we could do an equally good job. However, that is another  matter for another day. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Due to the geographical and demographical area on which the  site exists, common sense dictates that DARD is well placed to have a  consultative role on matters of rural poverty, and some input into DSD&rsquo;s plans  to ensure that rural development takes place. DETI would be involved in  attracting businesses to new retail and business units.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It must be ensured that the job is not only done but done  right. The Department for Social Development is best placed to carry the scheme  forward. That Department has the necessary in-house experience, knowledge and  past experience of delivering projects such as this.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">DARD ought to be focusing on a number of other issues in  order to protect and promote the farming community in Northern Ireland.  I am sure that the Minister is fed up listening to Members but I want to  reinforce to her my feelings about the other issues in need of address.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We must maintain our vigilance about bluetongue, especially  coming into the summer, when the midge population is at its highest.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We must continue to be mindful of the plight of pig  farmers. Indeed, there are many pig farmers in the Forkhill area. We must help,  in any way that we can, to raise the price of pig meat in the short, medium and  long term to ensure that the pig industry stays afloat.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Regarding the price of wheat, we must continue to ensure  that our farmers have a more than adequate supply of feed for their animals  between now and the next harvest. According to the BBC, there are only about 35  day&rsquo;s supply of grain with which to feed the world. That figure is falling week  by week and that fact must be taken in to account.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Those are three major issues but, rest assured, there are  many more.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am confused regarding the Forkhill military site. On 23  January 2008, in reply to a question for written answer from Tom Elliott, the  Finance Minister stated:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;DARD intends to make a bid in the February Monitoring  Round for the &pound;4.5 million required for the purchase by DSD of the former  Forkhill Military Base.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The Department  of Agriculture and Rural Development seems to be doing all the running  on behalf of the Department for Social Development, which is why DARD should  have a bigger role.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Surely the Department for Social Development is better  placed to acquire the site, take ownership of it and develop it as it sees fit.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Order. The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P J Bradley</strong>:  I support my colleague Dominic Bradley&rsquo;s amendment, and I compliment him for  including the key words:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;to ensure that the best possible project is delivered  for the people of Forkhill and the surrounding district.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I repeat the words of the Member for Newry and Armagh so that Members can give them serious consideration.  We are here not only in the interests of those  who voted us in but in the interest of the common good and the broader  community. A responsible development committee is in situ in Forkhill. The  members of the Forkhill and District Development Association are waiting for a  bureaucratic wrangle to be sorted out so that they can proceed with their plans  for the site, which can be activated right away. I question the size of the  site; Conor Murphy said that it might be 14 acres, but I do not know whether it  is as large as that. The site was vacated in 2005, and it is easy to understand  the frustration of the project&rsquo;s supporters at the lack of progress.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Forkhill and District Development Association has the  full support of Newry and Mourne District Council. Mr Tom Elliott expressed  concern about the sustainability of the project. It should be noted that the  Newry and Mourne Enterprise Agency also supports the proposal. The agency is  interested in becoming involved in the Forkhill project. For the benefit of  those Members who do not know that agency, it has an excellent track record in  providing business units, of which I will name four: WIN Business   Park in Newry;  Warrenpoint Enterprise Centre; Kilkeel Enterprise Centre; and Flurrybridge  Enterprise Centre. The interests of the agency should not be underestimated in  any way. It is a key player in getting that area of Newry and Mourne back on  its feet.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Northern Ireland Housing Executive is interested in the  assembly of lands within the site for the development of social and affordable  housing, although the provision of residential dwellings is the responsibility  of the designated Fold Housing Association.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is also worth noting that the Forkhill site has been  identified in the draft Banbridge, Newry and Mourne area plan for 2015 for  mixed-use development. If the people of Forkhill and the surrounding district  are to be allowed to benefit from the potential of the site in the near future,  it is important &mdash; as the amendment states &mdash; for the Department of Finance and  Personnel, the Department for Social Development, the Department of Agriculture  and Rural Development and, perhaps, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment to reach an agreement urgently that will benefit all the people.  That could not happen soon enough.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Doherty</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I support Mr Bradley&rsquo;s amendment.  The best that can be said about the negative motion, and the equally negative  amendment No 2, is that they give us an opportunity to highlight some of the  issues and to expose the wrong-headed thinking behind the motion and amendment  No 2.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In April 2003, a joint declaration by the British and Irish  Governments stated that all vacated military barracks should be gifted to a  working Executive; it is critical that that is mentioned as many times as  possible. That joint declaration has been cited several times in the Chamber,  not least by the First Minister, the Rev Ian Paisley, and other Ministers as a  key component in dealing with those vacated  barracks sites.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">DARD&rsquo;s name and remit cover both agriculture and rural  development.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is no wonder that Maurice Morrow is mystified. When  referring to the Minister, he called her the Minister of Agriculture two or  three times. Let me clear that up for you, Maurice: she is the very able  Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There are four axes by which moneys can be drawn down from  the rural development budget. All of those are open to farmers as well as to  other rural dwellers, and I point out &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is quite clear that that is what you want, but the remit  is agriculture and rural development.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. Members should make their remarks through the Chair.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Doherty</strong>:  Of those people living in rural areas, 70% are not farmers, and they have as  much right as farmers to access funding for their various projects. There is a  big challenge for the DUP and the UUP to get their thinking right on that  issue. The remit of the Department covers rural development as well as agriculture,  and there is nothing that those parties can do to change that.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  I thank the Member for giving way. He is keen to quote me, and I do not retract  anything that I said. Perhaps he will recall that I said that this motion does  not oppose the development of the Forkhill site. The redevelopment of that site  is essential, and we hope that similar sites will also be redeveloped. However,  that project should not be funded from the budget of the Department of  Agriculture and Rural Development. That is the task of another Department.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Doherty</strong>:  If Maurice Morrow is anxious that the Forkhill site be redeveloped, he should  support amendment No 1, and not the ridiculous motion that he has tabled.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development (Ms Gildernew)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a  LeasCheann Comhairle. I am glad that Pat Doherty cleared up that last issue. I  was going to offer Maurice Morrow a competition: what do the letters &ldquo;R&rdquo; and  &ldquo;D&rdquo; stand for in the title of the Department? The Member should send his  answers on a postcard.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the opportunity to debate the redevelopment of  the former military site in Forkhill. This issue has been raised by Dr William  McCrea through the Agriculture and Rural Development Committee on a number of  occasions. It is something that he and his colleagues believe requires further  clarification and discussion, particularly the matter of why my Department,  rather than the Department for Social Development, takes the lead.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is not a question of which Department leads the project.  Acting on behalf of the Executive, the Department of Agriculture and Rural  Development is helping the various community groups to achieve their ambitions,  and has taken ownership of the project to that extent. To provide that help  effectively, it is required that I create a capital grants scheme. It requires  DSD to provide the finance for and to build both social and affordable housing.  While it is not the role of DARD to build houses, we are working with DSD on  that matter. We are all required to prepare a business case that stands up to  scrutiny. Therefore, this is not solely a DARD issue, but it is one that I am  prepared to champion.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I feel that it would be helpful to set out my Department&rsquo;s  involvement in Forkhill, to date. As has been mentioned by the MP for the area,  Conor Murphy, under the former direct rule Administration, several approaches  were made to Ministers in respect of the redevelopment opportunities presented  by redundant military sites. Those sites are owned by the Ministry of Defence,  and its programme of disposals is based on the desire to realise receipts from  the disposal of the bases as quickly as possible. In urban areas, the  Department for Social Development is developing a number of those sites. My  Department became involved in the Forkhill project following an approach, over  two years ago, by the local MP, MLAs and councillors for the Forkhill area, to  David Hanson, the then Social Development Minister.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That process has been ongoing for over two years &mdash; it is  not a quick fix. Time has been taken to ensure that the project was viable and  had the full support of the community.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">1.00 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">DARD has been working towards the creation of sustainable  communities through its innovative rural development programmes of job  creation, farm diversification, business opportunities and social enhancement  projects. The Department became convinced that former military sites or  abandoned public spaces in rural areas presented an additional excellent  opportunity to help to bring about more holistic redevelopment, especially in  areas in which social and economic progress had stagnated. Forkhill was considered particularly suitable to be taken  forward as a pilot project because of its location, condition and the  work that had already been undertaken by the local community group, the Forkhill and District Development  Association. I add my comments to those of other Members in commending and  congratulating that group for the work that it has done to date, which has produced, through widespread community  consultation, a blueprint of suitable social and economic actions for  the site.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">An inter-agency steering group was formed to bring forward  the proposals for the site, and a business case for its acquisition and  development was prepared. The site covers a large area of ground in the centre  of the village. The proposals have been  cleared by the Ministry of Defence.  It is proposed that the site will accommodate a mixed development to  include social and affordable housing, which will be led by DSD. It will also  include a number of business and workspace units, for which there is a demand.  A range of community facilities will be  included, such as a community hall, a cr&egrave;che, changing rooms, a  multi-purpose games area and an illuminated walkway for health-and-safety and  visual-amenity reasons, along with the associated infrastructure.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although it is not its  core business, Invest NI supports the business units that are proposed  for Forkhill, under the management of local economic development units. The  rural development programme has created, and will continue to create, business  units and jobs under the Department&rsquo;s rural development programme.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">DARD does not have the necessary legal powers to purchase  the site, but, under the Social Need Order 1986, DSD has the power to do so. It  has agreed to purchase the site on DARD&rsquo;s behalf. It is intended that the acres  that are set aside for housing will be acquired and developed by a housing  association, with the approval and support of DSD. The remaining acres will be  acquired and developed by the Forkhill and District Development Association,  using a capital grant from my Department of around &pound;2&middot;9 million. Financial  support will also come from Newry and Mourne District Council, along with other  funding.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">DARD&rsquo;s involvement in the project fits clearly with the  overall theme of its rural strategy for 2007 to 2013. That strategy aims to diversify the rural economy, protect the  rural environment and sustain rural communities. It meets one of the key aims  of that document and the Department&rsquo;s strategic plan for 2006 to 2011, which is  to strengthen the social and economic infrastructure of rural areas. The Department&rsquo;s involvement also fits well with the Programme for Government, which was  agreed by the Executive in January 2008. The Programme for Government  charges DARD with helping rural communities to improve the physical, economic  and social infrastructure of their areas. The development of former military  sites and/or abandoned spaces fits squarely within that remit. Forkhill has a  population of fewer than 3,000 people, so it is clearly a rural area.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Forkhill project, and similar projects, also sits  comfortably alongside the new rural development programme, which runs from 2007  to 2013. Axis 3 of that programme aims to improve the quality of life in rural  areas and the diversification of the rural economy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A number of Members referred to the challenges that face the agriculture sector; I am aware of those  challenges. Under the rural development programme, a number of  opportunities exist to help the beef and sheep sector. It has set aside &pound;20  million for diversi&shy;fication, &pound;65 million for farmers and farm families and  over &pound;300 million for agrienvironment schemes. Over 70% of the rural  development programme&rsquo;s money will go directly to farmers and farm families, so  farmers will do extremely well out of the programme.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The rural development programme clearly identifies the  challenges of the agricultural community. From a strategic point of view, it is  important that the Department is already involved in some redevelopment of rural areas through the rural development  programme. It should also seek to complement those activities when  specific unique opportunities are presented. As I said earlier, it is incumbent  on all of us to progress the opportunity, utilising my Department&rsquo;s capital  grant, which will be a relatively modest, although important, contribution and  DSD&rsquo;s provision of housing. Local government is also firmly committed to the  scheme and will provide financial support.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The business case that I mentioned earlier was submitted,  as requested, to the Department of Finance and Personnel, but, regrettably, it  was rejected last week. I am hugely disappointed at that decision, as are the  people of Forkhill and their local representatives, all of whom have worked  extremely hard to provide solid evidence to demonstrate the benefits that that  exciting initiative would bring. I have instructed my officials to continue to  explore with DFP ways in which this development opportunity can be exploited,  and those discussions are urgent and ongoing.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It remains my clear  belief that there is a strong case for the public sector to intervene in  an area of deprivation such as Forkhill, which has had a particularly difficult  history because of the major military base that was strategically placed in the  centre of the village. That has impacted greatly on every aspect of local life  in past years, as many of the local elected representatives have said. The  proposal that my Department supports would send out a strong signal &mdash; not only  to the local community, but across the North as a whole and to the private  sector &mdash; that this Administration are prepared to commit themselves financially  to a unique rural-development opportunity that will bring significant benefits  to the local people and, I hope, attract some private investment too. It would  help to bring back pride to the area, and it would help to create business opportunities and jobs. It would provide leisure  facilities for young people, create  opportunities for young mothers and fathers, reduce antisocial behaviour  and encourage children to participate in healthy outdoor pursuits and sports. I wish that the Executive had more such  projects, which can create real benefits for communities.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If it is allowed to proceed, the Forkhill project will help  to create a new revitalised village centre for the people of Forkhill and the  surrounding area. Of course, it will be evaluated and the benefits assessed so  as to allow consideration of other projects in the future. This is a project on  which my Department can take the lead, and I  believe that it will be successful and make a genuine difference to the  lives of the people in the area.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am very concerned at the efforts being made to prevent  the Executive from supporting robustly the development of specific programmes  that will help to achieve our objective of sustaining rural communities. I hope that my response has given Members an  assurance about the very positive steps that DARD and DSD have taken in  taking forward the redevelopment of the former military site at Forkhill.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is my belief that the proposed project for Forkhill sits  squarely within my Department&rsquo;s remit, and it is my intention that the Department  should continue to work to achieve approval  for the business case from DFP so that it can move forward with this  project with the co-operation of the  Department for Social Development. The people of Forkhill deserve the  support of the Assembly. I hope that we can  bring about the economic and social enhancement for which the area is  crying out and for which it has asked. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  Some Members, including the Member of Parliament for Newry and Armagh, an MLA  for Newry and Armagh and a Minister of the Executive, have suggested that  unionists are somehow opposed to the regeneration of the Forkhill site. I want  to make it clear at the outset that nothing could be further from the truth.  Through our amendment, my party and I have sought to clarify something that it  appears even the SDLP has missed in the debate. In my view, this issue has  started a turf war between DARD and DSD. It  is not only a battle between two Departments, two political parties and  two women; it is also a case of the SDLP having its eye wiped. If its members  are not prepared to realise that, that is up to them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to outline my unequivocal support for the future regeneration of the former army base at  Forkhill. Its regeneration will be a significant milestone in the  normalisation of society in Northern Ireland  and will potentially bring great benefits to the people of south Armagh. However, as a local representative, I believe  that the current situation &mdash; whereby the Minister of Agriculture and Rural  Development is taking the lead on this issue &mdash; has the potential to create a  less than optimum project. It is clear that  DARD is not the correct vehicle through which to deliver this particular  project.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, I strongly  support my party&rsquo;s amendment, which lays out a commonsense opinion that  for a more efficient and effective project, more rationalised Government, and  the correct use of expertise and resources.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In a recent answer to an Assembly question, the Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development stated that:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;It is intended that  the site will be regenerated into a rural economic and social hub. It will  provide a range of integrated services such as local enterprise units; light  industrial units; community space; and childcare facilities&rdquo;. &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Official  Report, Vol 24, No 5, p225, col 2].</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The Minister went on to outline that:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Some social housing has also been provided for, and  my Department is working with the Housing Executive on that aspect.&rdquo; &mdash;<span class="Italic"> [Official Report, Vol 24, No 5, p225, col 2].</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Those are all extremely  welcome elements. However, the Minister of Agriculture and Rural  Development is not the best-placed Minister to deliver them. Nor should the  Department for Social Development have to spend &pound;4.5 million of taxpayers&rsquo;  money to allow a maverick Minister to stray from her rural development remit.  DARD does not have on overly-impressive record when it comes to leading  projects in south Armagh and other places.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department for Social Development is responsible for,  and has extensive experience and expertise in, social housing, enterprise  development, urban regeneration and community development. This project, as  outlined, clearly encom&shy;passes all of those aspects. Although the Minister&rsquo;s  responsibility for rural development is recognised, she will have to admit &mdash;  and should admit &mdash; that that responsibility does not cover those areas in any meaningful way and is geared more towards  agricultural diversification and development.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That will mean the  potential waste of all the expertise and relationships that have built  up between the Department for Social Development, the Housing Executive,  developers and communities. At a time when we are asked to encourage the  Executive to increase efficiency, rationalise procedures and review public  administration, the decision by the Minister of Agriculture and Rural  Development to seek the lead role in this project seems contradictory. There is  no doubt that what is proposed for the Forkhill site does not fall under the  immediate remit of DARD. Yes, DARD will have a role; other Departments will  have a role; but the lead role should not be undertaken by DARD. Therefore, to  get the best for the people of Forkhill and south Armagh, and to get the best  use of taxpayers&rsquo; money, Government  expertise and efficiency, it makes basic common sense for the Department  of Agriculture and Rural Development to step aside on this project, yet to  assist, wherever possible, the Department  for Social Development in the development of that site. I commend the  second amendment.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. One of the main points made  during this debate was that the sole responsibility of the Department of  Agriculture and Rural Development is that of farming. There is no doubt that  farming is one of the main responsibilities of that Department. However, it is  not the only one. The Department&rsquo;s very title clearly shows the range of its  responsibilities. The project in Forkhill falls clearly into the Department&rsquo;s  remit under rural development. The project at the old military site is one that  will serve not only the rural village of Forkhill but, in addition, its rural  hinterland. If we wish to maintain a rural population, then we must provide the  facilities and services needed by rural dwellers in rural hubs such as  Forkhill. We have heard, clearly and properly, voices raised in unison from all  sides of the House against the closure of rural post offices. We all agree that  rural communities require rural services and rural facilities.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">1.15 pm </p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The redevelopment  project is about providing services and facilities to a local, rural  community. Let me outline those services once again. They include: sporting and  recreational facilities; support facilities for rural families; industrial  units, which will help provide employment  in the local rural and farming community; and social housing, which is  greatly needed because, under stringent planning regulations, people in the  rural area around Forkhill cannot build much-needed homes.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Forkhill is a small village, not a large town, as some  Members on the opposite Benches seem to suggest. It is part of the rural  community in which it is located &mdash; it is a hub for the surrounding rural  community, and it makes good sense to provide much-needed services from such a  hub.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As I said earlier, Members from all sides of the House have  told the public that devolution is good and that it is better than direct rule  or rule by civil servants. However, anyone  listening to Members from the Benches opposite  would doubt that argument very much. Instead of facilitating the plans  of local communities, those Members seem to be hell-bent on frustrating rural  development. People will ask themselves where the benefits of devolution are  for them. Rural dwellers will wonder why  members of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development, led by  its Chairperson, are frustrating a rural development project. The debate may be  about Forkhill today, but it could be about their communities tomorrow.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is clear that the  role of the Department of Agriculture and  Rural Development is to promote rural development. It is also the role  of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development to promote such  development, not to attempt to frustrate it. Amendment No 1 contains the  sensible approach to the issue, which is that the Department of Agriculture and  Rural Development should continue to co-operate with the Department for Social  Development on the project and that the Department  of Finance and Personnel should reconsider its position and ensure that  the best possible project is delivered for  the people of Forkhill and the surrounding district, who are the most  important people at the heart of the debate. Go raibh maith agat ar&iacute;s, a  LeasCheann Comhairle.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr W McCrea</strong>:  I have listened to the debate with interest. Some Members raised substantive  issues, and others waffled as usual. I suppose that they are allowed to do that  in the name of debate. The issue is an important one that deserves debate, and  it has been raised on several occasions in my Committee. The Committee made a  decision on the matter, and it has reiterated that decision several times. The  substance of the motion arose from the general tenor of the Committee&rsquo;s  decision and would be accepted, substantially, by members of that Committee.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We have listened to some of the issues that have been  raised. Let me make it abundantly clear that many Members have tried to turn  the debate into a political football by making it a sectarian issue. The truth  is that there was absolutely no issue about the need to regenerate the site of  the former Army base. However, there was a clear issue, and a clear challenge  to be made, about which Department should be responsible for that regeneration.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Kennedy said that there was a turf war going on between  DARD and DSD. I doubt that somehow, because DSD is sitting back and allowing  DARD to do all the work. Indeed, DSD is happy that DARD is spending all the  money. Why should DSD spend any of its money when DARD believes that it has all  that money to offer to the community? DSD is sitting pretty, and Minister  Ritchie is rubbing her hands and saying, &ldquo;we have a fool a day in the midst of  the field.&rdquo; Someone just wants to project himself or herself, as it were, and  spend the money.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It would be different if the Department of Agriculture and  Rural Development had plenty of money to spend. However, DARD has a limited  budget, and Members must carefully consider the origin of some of the money for  the redevelopment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Speaking in support of the Minister&rsquo;s position, Mr Brady said  that the agriculture community makes up only a small part of the rural  community. However, I remind Members that the money gained through the  modulation of the single farm payment comes out of farmers&rsquo; pockets. It was  acknowledged in Europe that that money should go into farmers&rsquo; pockets, but  voluntary modulation removed it. Although the money belonged to the  farmers, the modulation was not voluntary on their  part: the Department is responsible for the voluntary modulation that  results in that money going to others.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is easy and nice to give away other people&rsquo;s money, but  it must be acknowledged that Northern    Ireland&rsquo;s premier industry is farming.  Whether some Members in the House like it or not, over the years farming has  been the backbone of Northern    Ireland, and we should give the industry  credit for what it has achieved under harsh and difficult circumstances and in  all types of weather. Even when times were bad for farming, the industry kept  going and was the backbone of the Northern Ireland community. During  times of economic difficulty and the Troubles, the farming industry held out  and was regarded as the backbone of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s prosperity.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Northern    Ireland&rsquo;s agriculture industry faces a  crisis.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Doherty</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr W McCrea</strong>:  I am speaking. When the Member had the opportunity, he spoke for only a few  moments, and, therefore, he should sit down.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Doherty</strong>: On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. Will the Member clarify  whether he is speaking on his own behalf or as Chairperson of the Committee for  Agriculture and Rural Development?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr W McCrea</strong>:  The Member has the opportunity to go to another place, but he does not bother.  Therefore, he knows little about democracy, and that must be taken into  consideration. However, he knows that had I intended to speak as Chairman, Mr  Deputy Speaker would have called me as such. I am not speaking as Chairman of  the Committee, but as a proposer of the motion. Let me make it abundantly  clear: I will defend the motion because it is right for the people of Forkhill  and Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister wants to be known as more of a rural champion,  but she wants to forget about agriculture and does more to destroy than to aid  the industry. What is she doing about the  crisis in the pig industry? Nothing. What was she willing to do about  the crisis in the red meat industry? She wanted to do nothing. All she had to offer was an exodus from the industry: she  suggested either diversification or getting out of the industry  altogether, instead of keeping the &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr W McCrea</strong>:  No, the Minister muffed her opportunity to speak. Her speech was useless, and,  therefore, she will not take up any of my time. Let me make it abundantly clear  that the Minister&rsquo;s handling of the crisis in the red meat industry was  absolutely useless; she had nothing to offer.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister has forgotten that the fishing industry is  part of her remit, and she did little to defend it when she went to Europe. She relied on the Irish Republic,  and it put a knife into the back of the fishing industry. Ageing fleets and rising fuel costs have been  mentioned, but the Minister has done nothing. What does she want to do  now? She wants to offer money to someone else.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Order. Please stick to the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr W McCrea</strong>: With the greatest respect, Mr Deputy Speaker, if you check the  Hansard report, you will find that everyone else who took part, including the  Minister, was allowed to cover all the agriculture industries. This is  important: in the light of all the issues about which the Minister seems able  to do nothing, what did she select to form  part of the Programme for Government? She  chose the development at Forkhill as an inescapable bid. Why did she do  that?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Remember that that was an inescapable bid, which means that  the Minister prioritised it above any other matter. Therefore, the red-meat,  pig and the fishing industries can just go to the wall &mdash; instead, her  inescapable bid is for redevelopment of the Forkhill Army base. One must ask  why that is the case. I can tell Members that it has nothing to do with saving  Forkhill; it has more to do with the Minister&rsquo;s political ideology and party  interest than any effort to bring benefits to the community.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Let us test the Minister&rsquo;s claim that redevelopment of the  Forkhill Army base will benefit the community through the development of  housing and industry. Housing is not the  Agriculture Minister&rsquo;s responsibility. Is  the Minister suggesting that DSD is no longer necessary because she will  take over responsibility for housing? If that is the case, the Department of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment (DETI) is not necessary either, because she  will also take over responsibility for industry. She is not able to do her own  job, never mind that of any other Department. Let her get on with the job for  which she is paid &mdash; to defend the farming industry and the rural community of Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee has asked 57 questions, some of which,  perhaps, Mr Doherty might be interested. Has he read the answers?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">With respect to housing, the Committee has still not  received answers to the enquiries that it continues to make on the number of  units that are required. The Committee has been told that that is because the  Department is unable to provide them. A departmental paper dated 4 April states that the documentary evidence and  information required to answer the Committee&rsquo;s query will take a little more  time to obtain and that the information will be passed to the Committee. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. The Member has the Floor.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr W McCrea</strong>:  The Members opposite do not like to hear the truth, because it hurts. The  Department&rsquo;s response on the matter of jobs is that the jobs created and the  cost per job have not currently been addressed in the business case. The  Minister says that she is surprised that  the Department of Finance and Personnel has not agreed with her. She has  not even provided DFP with the necessary information. That is a total and  absolute disgrace.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister has the idea &mdash; which Sinn F&eacute;in has held throughout the years &mdash; that if she makes  demands, we will give her what she wants. However, she has discovered that  the unionist Members are not willing to bow to Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s every whim and  demand. We are prepared to stand up to the Minister and to scrutinise the  business case, which has been rejected twice because it does not stand up to  scrutiny. That is why I ask the House to turn down the SDLP&rsquo;s amendment. I ask  my friends in the Ulster Unionist Party to consider their amendment. I ask the House to give its wholehearted support  to the proposal that I have put forward with Lord Morrow and Mr Trevor Clarke.</p>

	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am proposing the motion because provision throughout the  North is piecemeal. Some colleges proactively  address the needs of people with a disability; however, others offer  only limited or low-quality provision. Vulnerable individuals, such as those  with a disability, are already marginalised and face further barriers in their  attempts to access further education opportunities.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In October 2007, my colleague proposed a similar motion  and, as a consequence, we were promised that there  would be a review of the services offered. However, six months on, there  has been no response as regards that review. That is why I am concerned about  the UUP amendment, which strikes me as being a fudge on the issue. When will we  see real changes that affect the lives of young, disabled people? The amendment  calls on Members to await the outcome of the review. However, the motion in  October called for immediate, urgent action. I am not interested in paying lip  service to this matter or in protecting the Minister, which, I suspect, is the UUP&rsquo;s motive in tabling the  amendment. Six months for the review&rsquo;s outcome is far too long to wait.  Nevertheless, I await with interest the UUP&rsquo;s contributions to the debate.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although the motion refers only to further education  opportunities, I must point out that there is also a requirement for more supported employment opportunities for  young, disabled people.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Any provision of supported employment and/or further  education must be based on the principles of equality  and inclusion. That is because disabled children and adults have the same rights to equality of access to all services, including education, training and  employment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Whenever I meet disabled  young people, their families and representative groups, the issue of  transition is raised consistently. That is the process by which a young person  moves from childhood into young adulthood. It is a time of many changes for all  young people and their families, and it involves making many important  decisions, including life decisions and life choices on further education,  training or employment, citizenship, and independent living. However, research  has shown that that period is more difficult for a young disabled person. At  the age of 16, young disabled people have the same career hopes and aspirations  as their non-disabled peers. However, in early adulthood, the experiences of  the disabled and non-disabled young people  diverge with regard to education, training and employment. That  inequality must be addressed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Services must be developed for young people that will  support their transition into adult life and that will actively promote social  inclusion, challenge discrimin&shy;ation,  promote personal control and choice, and encourage inter-agency partnership and collaboration. It is  important to take a holistic approach to that transition period.  Disabled young adults are entitled to the same educational opportunities as  their peers. However, that does not seem to  be happening at present. I have spoken to many families who have been  left without support and direction and who have felt that there were no  opportunities for them when their children reached a certain age. Given that  several agencies have a remit for dealing  with young people in transition, I accept that this is a cross-departmental issue, not one just for the Department for  Employment and Learning (DEL). Therefore, a multi-disciplinary approach  to supporting young people during the transition period is needed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Parents are being left in limbo about what is next for  their children when those children reach the age of either 16 or 19. Children  with a moderate learning disability will be offered compulsory education only  up to the age of 16, and those with a severe learning disability will be  offered it until the age of 19. After that,  the young person and their family face a minefield.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Children who have attended schools in mainstream education, perhaps with the aid of a classroom  assistant, are expected to leave school at 16 years of age. No provision is made for those who are unable to  participate in further education or  cope in the real world by finding employment.  Those attending special-education schools are expected to leave at the  age of 19, and no provision is made for suitable follow-up services that  promote life skills and independent living. Those young adults are expected to  go to day-care facilities that have been established  for the elderly, stroke patients and dementia sufferers, even though  those facilities are not age appropriate or conducive to an individual&rsquo;s  continued development.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Parents have told me that that situation often leads to  their children losing their spark for life, forcing them to become old and  withdrawn before their time. One parent has told me that most parents of  children with disabilities are heartbroken. That lady has battled continually  for access to services across the board ever since she had her son, who is 19  years old and who has a severe learning disability. She feels that as the  Government have not made the education and training of young disabled people a  compulsory provision, they do not value it. She suggested that, if provision  were more suitable, were regarded as an automatic follow-up to special  education and were considered to be a right, more people would avail themselves  of it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department for Employment and Learning wrote to that  parent explaining that it was keen to ensure that its colleges play a full role  in developing the skills of people with a learning disability but that it is  the responsibility of colleges to determine what courses are offered, subject  to the level of demand. The Department may state its policy &mdash; that it is  committed to ensuring access to education &mdash; but if that is not followed through  by making such access compulsory, I believe that the Department&rsquo;s policy is  contradictory. As I said in my opening remarks, young disabled adults must be  encouraged into supported employment, as many of them want to move into such  employment and become economically active in  their own community.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Northern Ireland  Union of Supported Employment and several other voluntary agencies do a  lot of good work in that field by promoting employment for people with disabilities. In a recent launch in the Long  Gallery, the union reported its  findings on a cost-benefit analysis of employment for people with  disabilities. One of the key findings was  that people with disabilities who have engaged with supported-employment  programmes have reported that they are not just financially better off, they  also have an improved quality of life.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Another key finding was that, for every &pound;1 that is invested  in supported employment, there was a return of &pound;6&middot;17 over a five-year period,  thus proving that that investment is also economically good.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am interested to hear the Minister&rsquo;s comments on what his  Department is doing, and I expect him to talk about  the additional support fund, among other elements. However, I hope that he will take on board my  concerns and those that I hope  others will make when contributing to the debate.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">2.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">More needs to be done immediately to address those  inequalities. On the face of it, it appears that all further education courses  are accessible and open to all. However, the Further Education Means Business  strategy results in funding being directed towards courses that are pitched at  level 2. The majority of young people with disabilities are entering education  at pre-entry level or at level 1.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Community education courses would have been a crucial  starting place for many young people with disabilities through recreational  courses and pre-entry courses. However, the budget for such courses is all but  gone, which means that those who are already experiencing difficulty with learning  will end up being further marginalised because they need more time and support.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Reasonable adjustment and a greater degree of flexibility  is required to allow people with disabilities to access the appropriate  provisions. That would provide them with positive outcomes, but it would not necessarily provide them with recognised  qualifications in all cases.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I call on all Members to  support this important motion. I want to see an improved provision and  more support, as of right, for those young people with disabilities. Go raibh  maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I beg to move the following amendment: Leave out all after &ldquo;expresses&rdquo; and  insert</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;its continued commitment to securing training and  employment opportunities where appropriate for young people with disabilities;  and awaits the outcome of the review of such provision undertaken by the  Minister for Employment and Learning.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">In proposing the amendment, the Ulster Unionist  Party is not in defensive mode. In fact, I ask Members to consider how we can  find a responsible way in which to deal with this important issue.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The proposer of the motion outlined her concerns. I will  also outline my concerns and make suggestions as to how they can be addressed. I recently had the privilege of  meeting people in Aghalee and Dunmurry who have severe learning disabilities. I  also attended a fund-raising event at Musgrave Park   Hospital for young people  with disabilities that raised &pound;70,000 for new equipment. By meeting such  people, it is possible to understand the challenges that they face in their  everyday lives.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Through the Assembly&rsquo;s excellent Education Service, I have  also been fortunate in being able to speak to Mencap and the young people whom  its representatives brought to the Assembly. Those young people explained  eloquently and in great detail why they want jobs and what they want to do. Due  to the success of that meeting, I invited them back to the Assembly, and they  visited again last week. We talked about the  difficulties that they face and about employers&rsquo; attitudes. I said that  I am willing to provide an opportunity for someone with learning disabilities  to work in my two offices in an attempt to set an example in progressing this  issue. Such matters must be addressed, and it is important to understand that  there is always more that can be done. It is almost like trying to boil an  ocean.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">During my meetings, I became aware that people did not  appreciate that those with learning disabilities are not a burden; rather, they  provide an opportunity. If people with learning disabilities are given the  right skills and support, they can contribute not only to the enrichment of  their own lives but to society as a whole. I am keen to find out how those  skills and that support can be provided.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Why is it necessary to table the motion at this time? Other  channels exist through which the issue can be addressed. The Member who  proposed the motion, and, I assume, the  Member who will make the winding-up speech serve on the Committee for  Employment and Learning. That provides ample opportunities to discuss the issue  with departmental officials and with the Minister. Regardless of that, it is  right that questions are asked.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs O&rsquo;Neill</strong>:  For clarification, I am not a member of the Committee for Employment and  Learning. Furthermore, I have taken the opportunity to table a number of  questions to the Minister, as have other Members.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I stand corrected. Someone who looks awfully like Mrs O&rsquo;Neill was a member of  that Committee at one stage.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  The Member to whom Mr McCrea is referring is older.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I get confused. Mrs O&rsquo;Neill serves with me on the Committee for Education.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My point is that it is possible to discuss such issues with  the Minister or departmental officials in Committee in order to find out what  is going on. Had that happened, the Members would be aware that the position is  positive. Although no one is denying that there is a difficulty with the number  of people with learning or other disabilities who are in full-time education,  the situation is improving.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">This Minister for Employment and Learning will be unable to  address the issue alone. He will be able to give us the facts. However, to my  knowledge, he is fully committed to resolving the issue.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The last time that we held a similar debate, the Minister  announced that there would be a review. That review  is ongoing and the Minister will, no doubt, inform us of the details  shortly. Rather than pre-empting that review and having the discussion now, it  might have been better to wait for its outcome.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is concern that other Ministers&rsquo; Departments take a  long time to take decisions and get things done. That has been apparent in  discussions on the Maze and other matters. The Minister for Employment and  Learning cannot be accused of that, and certainly not on this issue. The  Minister is producing the goods. I hope that the House will unite on this  subject, rather than turn it into a political football. We should gather the  relevant information and make progress on implementation. I hope that that is  taken in the manner in which it was intended and that we can secure the  necessary support.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The range of further education courses that is offered is  extensive. More can always be done, but good provision is available. Records  for the latest academic year show that there were 1,338 enrolments. Of those,  650 were on discrete courses, an increase on the figure from a couple of years  ago. The situation is vibrant, with all the  figures heading in the right direction.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Adult  day centres account for 11% of further education  provision for young people with disabilities. As has been discussed in  relation to respite care, etc, we must examine the placing together of people  of different ages in adult day centres. That is one of the issues  that will the review will address. Funding for the sector has increased, and  was a major part of the Programme for Government and the Budget. That financial  commitment will be met.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Significantly, the relationship with the voluntary sector  is strong. We must all work together. Nobody has all of the answers and it is  incumbent on all of us to listen carefully to those who have to care for young  people with disabilities for the whole of their life, not just during the  working day. We want to help parents, children and young people, and ensure  that those people have access to gainful employment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Helping young people with disabilities is not restricted to  the provision of further education. The Department can also help by providing  vocational training and supported employment. Along with other Members, I  witnessed the making of bedspreads, and was very encouraged to see how people  dealt with that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is important to recognise that one size does not fit all  &mdash; a range of challenges and a range of support can be provided. We must try to offer all of the right support to all  of the right people, in the most appropriate way possible. The most important  measure that the Department can take is to engender a positive attitude. The  Department has an advisory service and an action plan to help to do that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">After talking to my friends and colleagues in Mencap, I  have been struck by their feeling that the biggest issue that they face is that  many people do not properly understand the position. One side of Mencap is the  fundraising and campaigning that they do so well. Another side to their work is  the quest to find companies to take young people with disabilities on board.  Some of the bigger companies, such as Tesco, have taken people on board.  However, there are many opportunities in other areas, and often people are  simply unaware of the very positive role that people with a learning disability  can play.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is a danger of appearing trite in respect of young  people with disabilities. However, I was completely bowled over by the young  people who told me about what they wanted to do. The challenge for us all is to  get those young people into the appropriate level of training or education.  Surely, that is one of the useful things that the House can achieve.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I intend to bring those young people back to the Long Gallery  and I hope that other Members will join me in talking to them.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  I thank the Member for giving way. He will get an extra minute, so he is using  my intervention strategically.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">One group of people has not been mentioned and has almost  been silent. It is the people who leave school &mdash; sometimes special-needs  schools &mdash; and have no further education provision made for them. Does the  Member agree that the needs of that group of young people should be addressed  urgently? Further education colleges wash their hands of them, and no provision  is made for them in the special needs sector.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  The Deputy Speaker will, no doubt, clarify that I do not have an extra minute.  However, it was still worth Mr Wilson putting his point forward. I am coming to  the conclusion of my speech. I look forward to the Member&rsquo;s contribution, and  he will have my support. I urge all Members to take a holistic view of the  issue. The Minister is delivering results, and we will see a proper review, be  able to scrutinise it and ensure that it is right. I thank the Members on the  Benches opposite for tabling the motion. However, I ask them to consider  accepting the amendment.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>: As Question Time commences at 2.30 pm, I  suggest that the House takes its ease until that time. This debate will  continue after Question Time, when the next Member to speak will be Mr Jimmy  Spratt.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The debate stood suspended.</p>

	      <p class="H3SectionHeading">Health, Social Services And Public Safety</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Impact of the Internet on Suicide Prevention</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">1. <strong>Mr K  Robinson </strong>asked the Minister of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety to detail the discussions he has had with  ministerial colleagues throughout the United Kingdom on the impact of the  Internet in the area of suicide prevention, and whether he plans to meet with  Internet providers again.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2734>(AQO  2734/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mr McGimpsey)</strong>: In July 2007, I  met Home Office Minister Vernon Coker and key Internet providers to outline my concerns regarding the damaging impact  that harmful Internet content can have on vulnerable people. I have also raised  the issue at North/South Ministerial Council and British-Irish Council  meetings, and, more recently, with my ministerial colleagues in Scotland and Wales.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, I met Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State  Ivan Lewis to discuss the impact that the Internet can have on health-related  issues such as suicide and self-harm. We agreed to host a further joint meeting  with key Internet providers following the publication of the Byron Report on  harmful material on the Internet and in video games.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his comprehensive and encouraging response. I commend  him for the work that he has done in this area and his proactive approach to  this very serious problem.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Does the Minister agree that the social networking and chat  room providers need to take this issue much more seriously than they have done  up to now? That industry is potentially profitable, but its social  responsibility must be looked at seriously. To that end, does the Minister  agree that the Byron Report is a useful publication? Will the Minister take all  steps to ensure that the measures contained in the report are implemented in Northern Ireland  as soon as possible?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  I met Dr Byron while she was preparing her report. It was specially  commissioned by the Prime Minister, and I agree with much of what I have seen  of the report. Certain websites and chat rooms undoubtedly encourage people to  take their own lives. Those websites can have undue influence over vulnerable  people, particularly the young. It is not sufficient for Internet providers to  say that they are merely conduits and that the content of those websites is not  their responsibility.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">This issue is a reserved matter because of the law.  Therefore, more robust legislation is needed to ensure that Internet providers  take responsibility for the information that is provided.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Adams</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s remarks. In  January, he wrote to me about these issues, and I thank him for his letter.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister propose that suicide prevention become an  area of priority under the tutelage of the North/South Ministerial Council?  What arrangements have been made to provide dedicated resources for west Belfast, particularly the  Shankill area? The Reaching Across to Reduce your Risk of Suicide and Self-Harm  (RAYS) project is in considerable financial difficulty, and I raised that with  the Minister some time ago. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  Suicide prevention is an area of priority. I have had discussions with my  counterpart in the Republic, Mary Harney, and I have raised it at North/South  Ministerial Council and British-Irish Council meetings. Other Health Ministers  agreed that the issue was important. That was the tenor of my discussion in Edinburgh last week with Ministers from Scotland and Wales.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Funding streams have been set aside for this issue.  Provision has been made for community groups and others who are active in this area.  I cannot be specific regarding the breakdown of funding in west Belfast, nor can I be  specific as far as the RAYS project is concerned. The Member knows well that  north and west Belfast  are areas of great pressure regarding the incidence of suicide. They,  therefore, receive support and funding.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his reply to the various questions, and I welcome what  he said. Does he agree that it is essential that Internet providers should be  made to restrict access to potentially harmful websites, especially  social-networking sites, which are a great source of potential harm,  particularly to young people? Will the Minister make progress on restricting  access to those sites?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  I agree wholeheartedly with Mr Maginness on the need for restricted access to  social-networking websites, and robust legislation is needed. The  responsibility for that legislation lies, in the first instance, with the Home  Office. I have had discussions with the Home  Office, and I will have further discussions.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The substance of the Byron Report is about harmful content  on the Internet and in video games. I anticipate that it will produce a  response from the Government, and I look forward to seeing that response.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">One of the responses will be to set up a council for the UK. I  anticipate that all the regions will be represented on that council to take the  matter forward. Internet providers are international, multi-billion-dollar organisations that are mostly based outside the UK, and the ability to reach them from  regional Administrations in Belfast, Wales,  Dublin or Scotland is limited because  of our critical mass. Working together, particularly given the interest that  the Prime Minister has shown, will give us the critical mass to allow us to  influence Internet providers to ensure that they take their responsibilities  seriously. However, robust legislation is needed.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Regional Public Health Authority</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">2. <strong>Mr  Bresland </strong>asked the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety to  outline the role a future regional public health authority will have as part of  the review of public administration.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2730>(AQO  2730/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  The new multi-professional regional public health agency will give renewed and  enhanced focus to achieving public health goals and will ensure better  co-ordination and delivery of interventions to protect and improve health. It  will also ensure public health input to the commissioning and design of  services. In addition, it will offer support to, and work in partnership with,  local government, the education sector and others in achieving improved health  and well-being across Northern    Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bresland</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his response. Will he outline his plans regarding the  location of the original public health authority and the various other health  bodies that are to be established under the review of public administration?  Does he intend to locate any of those bodies in the west of the Province?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  Although it is early days for me to start to give assurances, I can tell Mr  Bresland and other Members that there is potential to locate bodies throughout  the Province. There is a need for strong local representation and influence in  public health, particularly around  commissioning. Therefore, it follows that  there is a need for locations across Northern Ireland. That will also apply to the common services  organisation, which will create an organisation to deal with the back  office jobs that are not necessarily particular to health but without which the Health Service could not  function. The Bain Report, which is due in July, has been especially  commissioned on the location of Government jobs, and the Department will also  bear that in mind.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gardiner</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his insistence that public health is at the centre of  reform &mdash; that is much appreciated. Will he tell me whether the public health  authority will work closely with local government in the future? If so, will  local government be represented on the authority?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  I see a very strong correlation between the work that local government does and  the work that the regional public health agency will do. I plan for the agency  to have representation from local government. I plan for the commissioning  groups in the regional health and social care boards to have such  representation, too.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The agency will play a key role in the provision of  healthcare in Northern    Ireland, and it will be involved in  public-health matters, health improvement, health protection and service  development. It will deal with health inequalities, promote positive health and  well-being and provide the local population with the ability to take  responsibility for its own health. Local government will play a vital role in  all that delivery.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Deeny</strong>: I  would like the Minister to provide some more detail about the regional public  health agency. How many people will it employ, and what will be the ratio of  health professionals to civil servants? Will GPs be involved? Finally, will the  new regional public health agency work along the same lines as the Health  Promotion Agency?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  Dr Deeny is aware that, under the old direct rule model of a single health  authority, the Health Promotion Agency was to be abolished and its functions  were to disappear into that giant body. I saw that as being a retrograde step;  it would have moved the service in exactly the opposite direction to which I  wanted it to go. I have, therefore, proposed the creation of a regional public  health agency, which will have much greater  powers than the current Health Promotion Agency. I envisage it not only  taking on the functions of the Health  Promotion Agency, but those public-health functions that are held by  boards and trusts. I anticipate that around 300 staff will be employed in the new agency, and that they will have expertise in public-health medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, nursing,  infectious disease specialisms, health promotion, partnership working, community development and health  education. Thus, a whole range of expertise will come together in that  key area.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As Members are aware, I have said that the future of the  Health Service depends on three elements: it requires investment, it must be  efficient and it must engage with the local population. Each one of those  elements is of equal value and importance. The Health Promotion Agency will  deal with the third element.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Mental-Health Facility: &nbsp;Craigavon   Area Hospital</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">3. <strong>Mr  Molloy </strong>asked the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety to  confirm if the new mental-health facility at Craigavon Area   Hospital will cater for  the entire Southern Health and Social Care Trust area.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=AQO2698> (AQO 2698/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  The new psychiatric unit at Craigavon   Area Hospital,  which is scheduled to open in May, will provide 74 inpatient beds, an  outpatient unit and a day hospital. Of those 74 beds, 20 will accommodate  patients from across the Southern Trust area and will cater for older people  experiencing functional mental illness. The remaining 54 beds will be for  general adult psychiatry, providing for the Newry  and Mourne, Banbridge and Craigavon districts.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his answer. I emphasise the importance of maintaining  and properly resourcing the service. The disruption in mental-health services  in the Southern Trust area over the past years has caused tremendous trauma for  patients at different times, and they need some certainty about the future of  the service. We do not want patients to arrive at Craigavon Area   Hospital only to find  that the services are not available, like the patients who arrived at the  accident and emergency department of the Mid Ulster Hospital on Friday. Will  the Minister give an assurance that services  will be maintained and resourced properly?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  That is exactly the type of assurance that I  am happy to give. I have just mentioned the new psychiatric unit that  will open in Craigavon, and a similar facility will play a key role in the new  enhanced hospital in Omagh. In addition, a new day centre will open in  Dungannon, and St Luke&rsquo;s Hospital in Armagh  will continue to provide general adult psychiatric beds, intensive care beds,  dementia assessment beds and addiction unit beds.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We are aware that, as  far as mental health is concerned, the direction of travel is very much  in accordance with the recommendations of the Bamford Review. The key principle  of the review was for treatment to be carried out, as far as possible, in the  community, rather than in institutions. Such an approach leads to enhanced  quality of care, shorter hospital admission times, more rapid discharge and access to home treatment packages. We are  taking that direction, and, as a result of the final Budget settlement, extra  moneys have been earmarked and ring-fenced for mental health.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  The Minister may be aware that the Committee for Health, Social Services and  Public Safety visited Craigavon and Altnagelvin hospitals to look at the new  facilities. One of those is open, and the other is due to open in May 2008. The  Committee felt that the facilities were  excellent, and that much thought had gone into their layout and  user-friendly design. Will the Minister, therefore, agree that it is an  equality issue of much importance that we should see those models replicated at  all acute hospital sites? I speak especially of the Ulster Hospital,  given the dire conditions that exist at Ards psychiatric nursing unit, which we  both visited some time ago, and certainly not the  planned model of beds located in the main hospital? Does the Minister  agree that that is not the best use of money  or the best location and the beds should be on site?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  As far as provision is concerned, I repeat that we are moving in the direction  of the Bamford Review, whose recommendations will take 10 to 15 years to roll  out and will require considerable investment. The basic principle of the  Bamford Review is that community placement is preferable to hospital placement;  nevertheless, we will never get away from the need for hospitals.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mrs Robinson illustrated an issue in Newtownards, and I  agree with her on the matter of provision. However, the difficulty surrounding  the Ulster Hospital rests with the capital  provision. For example, Ulster  phase B of the hospital&rsquo;s redevelopment programme requires about &pound;340 million.  That money is not in the capital budget at present. `However, I am looking hard  to find that money because, as an equality issue, people in north Down who  attend the Ulster Hospital are entitled to the same provision as they would  receive were they visiting Omagh or Craigavon.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I, too, took the opportunity to visit the new hospital in Craigavon; it is  exciting and of the future. The Minister spoke of the need to keep patients at home as much as possible and not to have  admissions to hospitals. What additional resources will, therefore, be  put into community care? The Minister spoke of a day centre but preventative  treatment and care require much more than that.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  The Bamford Review estimated that the level of additional investment needed  over the next 10 to 15 years will be &pound;300-&pound;400 million. We have made a good start as far as the Budget is  concerned with a 12.5% increase. Over the next three years, the  allocation will be &pound;12.3 million, &pound;14.2 million and &pound;26.6 million. That  provides us with a good start and allows us to move the recommendations of the Bamford Review, particularly in and around  community placement, and treatment  and away from institutionalising those who have mental-health needs.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Questions 4 and 5 have been withdrawn.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Reallocation of Finance Staff</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">6. <strong>Mr  Storey </strong>asked the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety to  detail the implications of the reallocation of finance staff of the Northern  Health and Social Care Trust from Ballymoney to Ballymena.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2704>(AQO 2704/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  The establishment of the Northern Health and  Social Care Trust, under the review of public administration, replaced  three former legacy trusts, namely Causeway, Homefirst and United Hospitals  health and social services trusts. The rationalisation of common-service functions,  such as finance, is an essential element of  the review of public administration process to maximise the potential  for efficiency savings for redeployment in the front-line services.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In relation to certain finance functions, I understand that  the Northern Health and Social Care Trust is consulting  local staff representatives and that no decision has been taken on the  relocation of those staff.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>: There is grave concern in my constituency, particularly among  staff employed in Ballymoney, that, despite  what the Minister has said, advanced discussions have taken place. In  fact, decisions on the relocation of staff took effect on 1 April 2008.  Therefore, will the Minister assure the  House that there will be no relocation of jobs from Ballymoney to any  other location until the Bain Report, to  which he referred previously, is published in July?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister meet me and other representatives to deal  with the issue and to ensure that a Health Service presence will remain in  Ballymoney, which has suffered greatly over recent years with job losses?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  I never refuse any Member a meeting. However, in the first instance, that  matter is a local trust management issue, and the Member should direct his  concerns to the local trust.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As far as that matter is concerned, everyone is aware of  the need to be efficient in the Health Service and to provide the required  savings under the review of public administration. I have said over and over  again that I would find those savings, and the reduction of 1,700  administrative jobs, which will save &pound;54 million a year and which was planned before the amalgamation of the 19  trusts into six, is part of that. That work is progressing, and I understand  that reducing the finance jobs from 185 to 161 will eliminate duplication, and  so on. However, I can assure the Member that those reductions will not result  in any permanent member of staff losing his or her job. Staff will be properly  supported throughout the whole process of change. I have said repeatedly that most  of the savings have been earmarked through the rationalisation of the trusts and that I will aim at a target of no  compulsory redundancies, and I repeat that aim today.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: It  is strange that a DUP Member should complain about efficiency savings, given  that his Minister required them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister guarantee that staff will be fully  consulted to ensure that their views are fully known and considered by the  trusts&rsquo; senior management? Furthermore, will he accept that it is preferable  that front-line health staff, rather than administrative staff, remain in  locations that are easily accessible to the public?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  The 1,700 jobs in question are all administrative jobs. The &pound;54 million that  will be saved will be reinvested in front-line services. As far as the reduction process is concerned, we undertake to  do that through the human-resources framework. Discussions with staff  and trade union side are continuing, and, by using a variety of measures, such  as vacancy control, voluntary early retirement and voluntary redundancies, we  anticipate that no permanent member of staff will lose his or her job.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  was going to ask the Minister to confirm that there will be no compulsory  redundancies and no reduction in permanent  staff &mdash; because vacancies already exist &mdash; and that the savings that will  be made will be directed into enhancing the number and quality of front-line  medical services, however, as he has already done so, I welcome his statements.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As he moves to the next stage of shared services, will the  Minister assure the House that his decisions on locations will be made in a  context that recognises the distribution of all public-sector jobs in Northern Ireland  and ensures fair and equitable distribution throughout the region?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  I welcome Mr O&rsquo;Loan&rsquo;s clear understanding of the RPA process. The next stage  will be the creation of common services organisations, which will generate  opportunities to spread jobs around the Province. My Department will be  governed in that by the Bain Report and by the DFP framework. The need for  strong local representation on, and input to, commissioning, the public health  agency and shared and common services organisations will be the guiding  principle that will impel my Department to ensure that the jobs are properly  distributed.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Recruitment of Midwives/Maternity Staff</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">7. <strong>Mr  O&rsquo;Dowd </strong>asked the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety to  detail the measures being taken to recruit midwives and maternity staff for Craigavon Area Hospital.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=AQO2766> (AQO 2766/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  Although recruitment is a matter for the trusts, the Southern Health and Social  Care Trust has advised me that all possible steps, including placing additional  advertisements in the relevant press and exploring potential return-to-practice  initiatives are being taken to fill the vacancies in Craigavon Area Hospital.  The trust has also initiated a review of maternity services.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">For the academic year 2008-09, my Department is  commissioning an additional midwifery cohort of 12 places at Queen&rsquo;s  University, specifically for the Southern Health and Social Care Trust. On  successful completion of an 18-month training programme, those trainee midwives  will be eligible to apply for posts in the trust.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his answer. I  am aware that the trusts are responsible for recruiting midwives, but anyone  who has recently been in the maternity wards at Craigavon Area   Hospital, will be acutely  aware of how much pressure the staff are under. It is only through their  professionalism and dedication to their jobs that those wards are surviving.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am concerned by the proposals to increase the number of  births at Craigavon Area Hospital  by transferring patients from Lagan   Valley Hospital.  I urge the Minister to do everything in his power to address that situation.  Has he considered offering employment packages or financial incentives to  midwives who have retired early, or increasing the funding to the Southern  Health and Social Care Trust to allow it to recruit midwives from whatever  source?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  There are six vacancies for midwives in Craigavon Area Hospital  and 20 vacancies regionally. The Southern Health and Social Care Trust  has undertaken a review of maternity services with the aim of devising a plan  to manage capacity, demand, and staffing issues.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member made a point about retired midwives. The trust  has placed adverts in the relevant press, and it has written to midwives who  have retired or who are on maternity leave to offer them the opportunity to  return to work.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">No expectant mother has been referred elsewhere due to  pressures at Craigavon   Area Hospital,  and the number of mothers who request to be transferred there from the other three board areas is increasing.  Therefore, there is confidence in the maternity unit at Craigavon Area Hospital,  and as the trust and management look to the future, they are taking on board  the points that the Member has made.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Will the Minister tell the House whether a final decision has been taken to  close the maternity unit at Lagan   Valley Hospital?  Its closure would put additional pressure on the maternity unit at Craigavon Area Hospital.  Is he prepared to consider increasing the number of training places for  midwives in Northern Ireland?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  There are no proposals on my desk to close the maternity unit at Lagan Valley   Hospital. I am aware of  press reports on the subject, but I am not dealing with any such proposal. I  anticipate that I will have to do so; at which point, I will be in a position  to make a decision.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As part of its review, the trust is considering how changes  to services at Lagan Valley Hospital  might increase the pressure on the  maternity unit at Craigavon Area Hospital. The trust is basing its plans on a birth rate of between 6,000 and 6,500  per annum in its area.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That is the result of a large increase in the number of  births in the trust area, which has risen from 2,691 births in 2002-03 to 3,588 births in 2006-07. Therefore,  although the birth rate has risen throughout Northern Ireland, it has risen  faster in Craigavon. The Southern Health and Social Care Trust has taken that  on board. The Department is offering extra training places and will continue to  do so to deal with the demand.</p>

	      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="5"></a>Regional Development</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Dualling of the A26</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">1. <strong>Mr McKay </strong>asked the Minister for Regional Development to provide an update on the  proposed dualling of the A26 to the Drones    Road.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=AQO2759> (AQO  2759/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development (Mr Murphy)</strong>: The Department&rsquo;s Roads Service is progressing plans for the provision of a 7 km stretch  of dual carriageway on the A26 between Glarryford crossroads and the junction  with the A44 Drones Road at the Ballycastle  fork. Detailed assessment of the five route corridors that are under  consideration is ongoing. After a number of  popular consultation days, the second stage of the three-stage  assessment process is expected to be completed by June 2008. The process will  conclude with the selection of a preferred route, which I hope to announce  publicly around mid-2008.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McKay</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. It  is an understatement to say that the choice of route for the new  dualling between those two points could have a massive impact on people who live  on, and close to, Frosses Road.  If the Department chooses one of the two eastern routes that have been  proposed, that will have a massive social and economic impact, particularly for  agriculture. Does the Minister agree that any decision in favour of one of the  two eastern routes will have a serious detrimental impact on existing farm  businesses?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>:  The Member has highlighted the process that must be undertaken when decisions  are made on major road schemes. Sometimes, Members get frustrated that the  statutory processes take so long. However, when a major road project is planned  to be built on farmland or any other type of land, that will affect farmers and  the environment. Therefore, time must be taken to consider the options and to  carry out proper consultation to examine all the effects.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">With regard to the  eastern routes to which the Member refers, the Department has employed  an agricultural consultant to assess the expected impact of all five route  corridors on affected farm businesses. The impact of each of the route options  on land use will form part of the stage-two assessment and will inform the  decision-making process.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gardiner</strong>: Will the Minister indicate what criteria his Department has  used to establish a Province-wide prioritised  list for road improvements? What mechanisms exist for introducing  flexibility into the system?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>: The criteria for prioritisation of projects are well  established and are available. I will ensure that the Department sends a copy  of that information to the Member. There are projects that are of key strategic  importance; there are projects that are important to economic development; and  there are projects, such as the one under discussion, where the road has an  unfortunate history of accidents, and there is strong local demand for road  improvements in the area. Sometimes, priorities compete. Nonetheless, there are  established criteria to assess roads and options, and, in doing so for route  corridors, to determine the best options. That is in line with my previous  answer.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A detailed manual for assessing such matters is available,  and I will ensure that a copy is sent to the Member.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>:  The Minister will be aware of the enormous disappointment of people who live on  the other main route to the north-west, the Glenshane Pass  &mdash; in particular, the people of Dungiven. Will he assure the House that a bypass  for the most polluted town on these islands is now, without a shadow of doubt,  his number one priority?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>: Last week, I visited Limavady Borough Council, and I took the  opportunity to meet people in Dungiven.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have no doubt that there is congestion and that those who  live along Main Street  in Dungiven suffer also from the pollution caused by the congestion. I have  assured them that that road, and the Dungiven portion of it in particular, is  of the highest priority for me, and they seemed reasonably satisfied with the  meeting. I intend to deliver on that.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Development Control Section, &nbsp;Roads Service</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">2. <strong>Mr S  Wilson </strong>asked the Minister for Regional Development to detail the average  response time by the development control section of the Roads Service to  requests from the Planning Service.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=AQO2691> (AQO  2691/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>:  Roads Service does not maintain records that  will enable calculation of an overall average response time by its  development control sections to consultation  requests from Planning Service. In addition, the range, scale and complexity of planning applications mean  that the calculation of an average response time across all application types would not give a meaningful  indication of performance.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, I confirm that Roads Service meets its target of  returning 70% of planning consultations to the relevant divisional planning  office within 15 working days from date of receipt. In the period from 1 April  2007 to the end of February 2008, Roads Service received 30,694 planning  consultations, of which 76% were responded to within the 15-working-day target.  Bearing in mind the significant number of applications received, I believe that to be a very a good performance.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Each year, Roads Service and Planning Service sign up to a  service-level agreement, which sets out the basis on which each delivers  services to the other. It defines the nature and quality of the required  outputs to be delivered by each agency, along with associated performance  targets. Although the service-level agreement is not legally binding, both  services act in accordance with it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members are aware that Roads Service&rsquo;s role as a consultee  in the planning process is to provide advice to the Planning Service on  applications that may affect the public-road network. Typically, Roads  Service&rsquo;s assessment will examine road safety and traffic-progression issues.  However, applications related to larger developments may also require  consideration in the context of relevant development plans, and transport  assessments may be required from the developer  to demonstrate the impact of the development on the roads network. In  general, each application is assessed against the relevant policies, design standards  and guidance documents.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his answer. Perhaps it is as well that no detailed  records are kept by the Roads Service as to the length of time that it takes to  respond to some planning applications. The Minister indicated that 25% of  applications are not responded to within  the 15-day period that he mentioned. Many of those are major planning  applications and have economic significance for local areas and for Northern Ireland  in general. There is great frustration that Roads Service does not deliver that  well. Will the Minister tell us what steps he will take to remedy that?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>: I  understand where the Member is coming from. We want to ensure that there is no  undue delay. Many of the larger applications, which take a longer time, have  significant economic benefits riding on the decision. It is the Executive&rsquo;s  intention to streamline the planning system as far as possible, and the  Minister of the Environment shares that goal. We must bear in mind, however,  that projects must be developed correctly and have no detrimental impact on the  roads network, or any other facet of public life.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The scale and complexity of some projects mean that  decisions on them take longer. I am keen that the process is as smooth as  possible; however, Roads Service advises me that much of the delay is caused by  the need to refer back to applicants to seek further information. Not all the  information is provided in the first instance. Developers, architects and  planning consultants should be able to  anticipate what is requiredfor a  major application and ensure that all the information is delivered to  Roads Service at the start. Much delay is caused by the toing and froing  between the Planning Service, and the developers and their consultants in  seeking further information.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Nonetheless, I share  the Member&rsquo;s interest in ensuring that these projects are dealt with as  quickly as possible.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burnside</strong>:  The Member for East Antrim raises the issue of  the effectiveness and efficiency of the planning  system. Does the Minister agree that an unreal distinction is made  between the regional planning function in his Department and the local planning  function in the Department of the Environment (DOE)? That is a major problem.  Will he initiate discussions with the  Minister of the Environment? The two Departments should merge as soon as  possible. Prior to that, those two planning functions, regional and local,  should be put together in a single, new, efficient department. That would speed  up the efficiency and effectiveness of the planning process.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>:  My Department is responsible for the regional development strategy, and  planning issues, per se, rest with the Department of the Environment. As a  consequence of the court case on draft PPS 14, many planning policy issues have  been transferred from my Department to the Department of the Environment in the  past six months &mdash; that might have the streamlining effect that the Member  mentioned.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister of the Environment is considering ways to  speed up the planning process. Roads Service is a consultee to the planning  process, and we want to ensure that it plays its part as efficiently as it can.  However, my Department is responsible for setting the overarching policy for  the regional development strategy, which will affect various Departments, not  just DOE. That remains the responsibility of my Department, but planning policy  statement issues have been transferred to DOE in the past six months.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>: I  want to return to development control. The Minister of the Environment recently  circulated advice to her Department on the cumulative effects of development.  Does Roads Service also consider the cumulative effects of road traffic and  parking when examining applications, particularly if they are one of a series  in a neighbourhood?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>:  When dealing with a series of applications in the same neighbourhood, there is  an immediate question on how the developments would affect the road on which they  are being built. Roads Service is conscious of the development potential that  has been unleashed in the past 10 years, and there is quite a bit of cumulative development.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I had a discussion with Roads Service officials, among  others, in west Belfast  where a great deal of development is planned for the Glenmona area. Roads  Service told the planners that it wants transport infrastructure built across  planning developments in the area instead  of in a piecemeal fashion. Roads Service is conscious of the cumulative  effects of development.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Planning approvals are a matter for DOE, but Roads Service  wants to assert that proper transport provision is increasingly a feature of  planning applications. The cumulative effects of planning applications  transcends the number of applications.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Public Transport: Student Use</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">3. <strong>Ms S  Ramsey </strong>asked the Minister for Regional Development what action he is taking  to encourage students to use public transport when travelling to and from  college or university.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=AQO2745> (AQO  2745/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>:  Students will benefit from the full range of steps that are being taken to  improve public transport. In addition, Translink has advised me that it offers  a student discount card that provides access to reduced fares on bus and rail  services. Translink also organises an annual series of roadshows at  universities to distribute promotional material and information on services,  fares and promotions.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat. I thank the Minister for his response. I am keen to get  more detail. What discounts can students  expect?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>:  Students in full-time education can obtain  up to 13 months&rsquo; discounted travel with a Translink student discount  card, which costs &pound;7; reductions are also available on cross-border services.  Discounts include special student single and return fares on many Ulsterbus  routes; a discount of up to 15% on standard adult fares of &pound;2 or more; a  discount of up to 33% on Northern Ireland Railways adult single fares; and student day-return tickets that cost twice the  student single fare.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  The Minister mentioned the 15% discount as one of the proposals that he is  considering. However, he will be aware, as are many Members, that students  spend up to &pound;500 on books &mdash; I am aware of one  book that costs &pound;38. Since students are under financial pressure, will  the Minister consider increasing the discounts  that are available to them? Increasing discounts would go a long way to  help students through their courses at university.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>: There is an issue of the student discounts that are provided by  the Translink promotions, and there is also an issue of concessionary fares.  The Department bid for money for concessionary fares in the budgetary process.  The Member is aware that some people with disabilities do not qualify for full  concess&shy;ionary fares. The Department bid for money so that children between 16  and 18 years old who stay in school would qualify for more than the half fare,  but we were not successful.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I appreciate the  Member&rsquo;s concern about the financial problems that students face.  However, various interest groups have made a strong case for receiving concess&shy;ionary fares, and the Department is trying to  accommodate them as best it can. One of those groups represents  students, but I cannot guarantee that it will have any more advantage.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  Is the Minister concerned that students who travel by rail to the University of Ulster&rsquo;s  Magee campus in Derry cannot get there in time  for morning lectures? Derry must be the only  city in Europe in which that happens.  What has the Minister done, or what does he intend to do, to improve the  situation?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>: I  was not aware that students there were arriving late for lectures. I am happy  to raise the issue with Translink, and if there is a problem with the Translink  timetable, it can be altered to ensure that students arrive on time. I know  that Derry students are conscientious and will  want to be at their lectures in time. I am more than happy to raise the issue  with Translink to try to get a result.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">European Funding: Scotland</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">4. <strong>Mr Beggs </strong>asked the Minister for Regional Development to detail the discussions he  has had with his counterpart in Scotland, in  relation to the &pound;220 million of European funding given to Scotland to  boost links with Northern Ireland.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2676>(AQO  2676/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>: I  am delighted that the territorial co-operation programme for Northern Ireland, the border region of Ireland and western Scotland, which aims to promote  greater territorial cohesion, has been approved by the European Commission. The  programme will bring a welcome &euro;192 million EU investment from the total budget  of around &euro;256 million. I have not had any discussions with my counterpart in Scotland about  the European funding that is available.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  Considering that Northern    Ireland is taking the lead on transport in  the British-Irish Council, does the Minister agree that it is important that he  has discussions about how that money might be spent? Does he accept that  improved and upgraded transport links at Larne harbour and Cairnryan would  enhance travel between Northern Ireland  and Scotland  and encourage tourism? Furthermore, does he accept that improvements to the  road from Stranraer to Carlisle and to the road northwards from Cairnryan to  Ayr would improve road safety and encourage more people to travel and stay in  Northern Ireland?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>:  There are two issues in the Member&rsquo;s question. He mentioned transport links  between the North and Scotland  and some of the links beyond. Following a discussion with some of the East  Antrim MLAs, I have arranged a meeting with Scotland&rsquo;s Minister for Transport,  Infrastructure and Climate Change to discuss some of those issues, and I think  that that meeting is due to take place at the end of this month.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The funding that has been made available from the European  Union, to which the Member referred, is funding between member states. It will,  therefore, involve Scotland,  here and the South; it is a three-way arrangement. We are looking at themes and  areas that are available for funding under that arrangement, and I will be happy to discuss those with my Irish  counterpart, Noel Dempsey, and the Minister for Transport,  Infrastructure and Climate Change in Scotland, when the propositions are  ready to be advanced.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  The Minister will be aware of current active discussions in relation to the  Ballycastle to Campbeltown ferry. Will the European funding contribute to that  project? If it does, in what way will it contribute? Subject to the outcome of  the study on the ferry route, will the Minister state whether he is supportive, in principle, of the reinstatement of  the ferry?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>:  The Ballycastle to Campbeltown ferry service is not my responsibility; it is  the responsibility of DETI. I am supportive of the reinstatement of the ferry.  However, the projects and the availability of finance to which the Member  referred must involve not only a linkage between Scotland and the North, but with  the border region of the Twenty-six Counties. It is a three-way arrangement; it  is between member states. I would that we were a separate member state from Scotland and the rest of Britain, but that is another day&rsquo;s  work. As things stand, that funding will  only be available if a project involves the border counties region on  the southern side of the border. We are examining what opportunities might lie  in that. The Ballycastle to Campbeltown ferry is an issue for DETI, and I am  sure that the Member will raise it with the relevant Minister.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Neeson</strong>: I  endorse the reopening of the Campbeltown to Ballycastle ferry route. Will the  Minister assure me that he and his counterpart in Scotland  will consider the high ferry fares between Scotland  and Northern Ireland?  They are 50% per mile higher than those on ferry routes between England and France and internal Scandinavian  ferry routes.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>:  The Member will be aware that a private company runs the ferry service between  here and Scotland.  Road difficulties on the other side &mdash; in Scotland &mdash; were brought to my  attention by East Antrim MLAs as well as by that company, which is in talks  with the Scottish Minister for Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change. I  am not sure what influence the Assembly can have on the company&rsquo;s prices, but  we are nonetheless committed to improving access to and from the ports here and  in Britain.  I will discuss that matter with the Scottish Minister at the end of the month.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Hillhall    Road</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">5. <strong>Mr Craig </strong>asked the Minister for Regional Development to outline the steps he is  taking to (i) reduce tailbacks on the Hillhall    Road between Lisburn and Purdysburn; and (ii)  investigate the causes of flooding during heavy rains, which results in closure  of this road and subsequent long delays.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2701>(AQO  2701/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>:  Roads Service has made several improvements to address tailbacks on the Hillhall Road, Ballylesson Road  and Purdsyburn Hill; the most recent, which was completed in November 2006,  being at the junction of Glen Road  and Hillhall Road.  A recent review of the previous route study identified areas for further  improvement. Those schemes will include realigning the bend between 218 and 224 Hillhall    Road,  and they will be considered for inclusion in Roads Service&rsquo;s minor works  programme for the Lisburn area.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, those route studies are for feasibility purposes  only, and no proposal is guaranteed to be implemented, as they depend on the  availability of land and funding and must compete against all other minor  roadworks proposals in Roads Service&rsquo;s eastern division area.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am sure that Members are aware that the Hillhall Road is used as an alternative diversionary route  during the ongoing works on the M1 motorway and the Westlink. The  underpass at Broadway is due to be opened to traffic this summer, and full  completion of the Westlink works is due by spring 2009. Therefore, traffic  volumes on the Hillhall Road  are expected to reduce as that work progresses.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">On average, the Hillhall    Road closes completely due to flooding once a  year. However, after heavy rain, it is liable to pond in places. Roads Service  endeavours to limit the problem and, on receipt of severe weather warnings,  takes proactive steps such as checking road-gully gratings and removing any  debris that may cause flooding. Roads Service carries out regular maintenance  activities such as gully cleaning and road sweeping. All planned maintenance  operations on the Hillhall Road  are undertaken outside morning and evening peak traffic periods. However, Roads  Service has no proposals to renew or provide additional drainage systems on the  road between Lisburn and Pudysburn.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>:  Given that the Hillhall Road  has already been closed once this year, perhaps the Department should revise  its figures on flooding incidents. That aside, I welcome what the Minister has  said about the new works on that road.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, given that the road is being used as an  alternative route due to work on the Westlink, reassurances were given that no  major works would be carried out on the road &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. The Member is well aware that this is Question Time, not  Members&rsquo; statement time, so will he please ask a question.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>:  Certainly. Does the Minister agree that such an agreement was made? Does he  also agree that the heavy traffic on that road cannot be tolerated for much  longer?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>: I  hope that the heavy traffic on that road will not have to be tolerated for much  longer. We expect the Broadway underpass to be open by the summertime. That  will, hopefully, remove a substantial amount of traffic.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I use the Hillhall    Road regularly to get here, and I know that it can  be difficult. Roads Service is trying to keep any substantial work to a minimum  but, in instances such as flooding, it will have to take remedial action.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that the Westlink scheme will be substantially  advanced by the summertime and fully opened by this time next year. That will  reduce the traffic on the Hillhall    Road. Some minor works will be submitted to  Lisburn City Council as part of the minor works programme for that area.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Butler</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat. Given that Roads Service&rsquo;s maintenance of gullies has been  criticised in the past, does the Minister have plans to increase the frequency  of the clearance of gullies on rural roads?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Where necessary, Roads Service  aims to inspect and clean all gullies in urban areas twice a year and gullies  in rural areas once a year. That is line with the road-maintenance guidelines  that apply across all council areas. That policy ensures that a reasonable  level of maintenance to drainage systems is carried out, taking account of the  Department&rsquo;s finite funding and staff resource levels.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In addition to the scheduled operation, further cleaning is  carried out to deal with blocked gullies, especially at locations where fallen  leaves create an ongoing problem at certain times of the year, or where gullies  have a history of blockage for other reasons. Where an area has a history of  flooding, Roads Service will pay particular attention to that, particularly in advance of severe weather  warnings.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  Unfortunately, the problem of flooding on the Hillhall Road is not unique. Will the Minister provide the House with details of any  assessment that he has made of the state of storm drainage across the  Province? What impact does the ever-increasing area under tarmac in housing and  commercial developments have on reducing the capacity of surface water to drain  away, thereby increasing the frequency and intensity of flooding incidents?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>:  It appears from anecdotal evidence &mdash; although I would like to see a scientific  study &mdash; that we have experienced more flooding in recent years. Some people  will attribute that to more tarmac-surfaced areas, which create a greater  run-off of water. Others attribute it to more severe weather patterns, and I am  aware that serious problems have been created by heavy flash-flooding  incidents. It is difficult to create the type of service that will accommodate  those types of storms, which are rare, even though they appear to have been  more frequent in recent years.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The type of drainage system that would be required to deal  with heavy flash-flooding would be above and beyond the means of this  institution, or perhaps any institution. Under the current standards and guidance  that have been adopted, Roads Service endeavours to clear urban gullies twice a  year, and rural gullies once a year. However, Roads Service will pay particular  attention to areas in which there are likelihoods of flooding or other  instances that would cause the blockage of gullies.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Cycling Trips</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">6. <strong>Mr Cree </strong>asked  the Minister for Regional Develop&shy;ment whether the number of cycling trips are  on target to be quadrupled between levels in 2000 and 2015.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2678>(AQO 2678/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>:  The targets that are set out in the regional transportation strategy 2000-2012  are to double cycling trips between 2000 and 2005, and to quadruple them  between 2005 and 2015. To date, cycle usage has not met those challenging  targets.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Roads Service measures cycle usage with a series of fixed  cycle counters across the North. Cycle usage increased by 57% in Belfast between 2000 and  2006, and the average increase across all locations was 26&middot;3%. Although cycling  infrastructure has been provided, persuading the public to abandon the car in substantial  numbers has yet to be achieved. Based on the current trend, it is unlikely that  the number of cycle trips will be quadrupled between 2000 and 2015.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his answer. What plans does he have to increase the  cycle-track network so that more people can  avail themselves of such an environ&shy;mentally acceptable mode of  transport?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>:  There are several ways to promote sustainable transport, one of which is to  expand the cycle network, and Roads Service has been involved in doing just that. The targets that were set were  challenging; nonetheless, it is disappointing that they are unlikely to  be met by 2015.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The cycle network has been expanded, particularly in and  around Belfast.  The Department has made it a requirement that cycling infrastructure be  included in roads networks around major developments. The Department also  promotes a range of activities such as the Bike 2 Work scheme, the Safer Routes  to School initiative and the walking maps  networks. The Department launched a walking map of Belfast, and walking maps are also available  for routes in various towns across the North.  Although cyclists have had several opportunities to meet some of the  relevant organisations since I came into office, I am keen to see much more  being done. We are trying to do as much as  we can to promote cycling and other forms of sustainable transport.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. The Minister has addressed ways of  promoting sustainable transport. I ask the Minister to take seriously the need  for footpath provision in many villages and towns where there are established  evening and weekend walking routes. Will the Minister provide details of any  current thinking in that regard?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>:  It is interesting that we had trouble in securing support during an earlier  debate for walking provision in a community project. Nevertheless, we are keen  to establish safer places for people to walk. The issue of footpaths in rural  areas is difficult to solve. It is a matter of targeting resources towards  making walking routes as safe as possible. Matching the level of expectation  that exists across rural communities for footpaths and other amenities is an  ongoing struggle.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Nonetheless, we are trying, within our resources, to work  out the most beneficial scheme for rural areas, and we are liaising closely  with councils and elected representatives to ensure that we target the areas  that have the greatest footfall and that present the greatest danger to  pedestrians.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>:  Time is up for questions to the Minister for Regional Development.</p>
	      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="6"></a>Social Development</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Social Housing Projects: Foyle</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">1. <strong>Ms  Anderson </strong>asked the Minister for Social Development to detail the additional  social housing projects she has planned for the Foyle constituency given her  enhanced budget and the acute need for social housing in the area.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2699>(AQO 2699/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development (Ms Ritchie)</strong>: I thank the Member for recognising that I  negotiated a considerable increase in the draft Budget. However, it gives me  nothing more than the realistic budget that I sought in the first place, so  there is not much scope for many new projects over and above the level being planned by the Housing Executive.  However, I am committed to achieving or bettering the Govern&shy;ment&rsquo;s  target of 1,500, 1,750 and 2,000 new social housing starts. That represents a  steady increase over recent years, and I will  ensure that the Foyle constituency receives its fair share.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Anderson</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat. I remind the Minister that she told the House on 26  February that:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;I have been given the money, and I am building the  houses.&rdquo; &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Official Report, Vol 28, No 2, p61, col 1].</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Now we are being told that she did not get enough  money.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the context of the acute need for social housing in  Derry, will the Minister confirm whether all privately-rented properties in the  Derry area and beyond, where the tenant is in  receipt of housing benefits, are inspected to ensure that they are fit for  habitation?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  Obviously the Member did not listen to what I said. In October 2007, I clearly  indicated that the budget that was allocated for my Department was inadequate.  Even though some Members to my right said that I should stop whingeing and get  on with it, I decided to continue the analysis and negotiation until I achieved  a much enhanced budget. In fact, in my original answer to the Member, I thanked  her for recognising that fact.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is a requirement for 1,081 units of accommo&shy;dation in  Foyle over the next five financial years. The social housing development  programme, which I have approved, provides for 1,136 dwellings to be built. I  have taken on board what the Member said about privately-rented properties, and  I will ensure that inspections take place.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burnside</strong>: I know that the Minister has a problem in getting a decent budget from the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in, and I  have sympathy for her. I realise that she is trying to meet social housing  targets for new houses, but will she consider initiating a scheme to refurbish  disused properties? The cost would be lower, and she could produce more social  housing for the marketplace by implementing  a strategy for refurbishing disused, empty houses, rather than simply  opting for new housing.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  In May 2007, I instructed the Housing Executive to carry out an empty homes  survey. The research indicated that there are 39,000 empty homes in the public and private sectors. Of those,  approximately 5,000 houses could be refurbished, which would not cost a great deal of money. Research into the  ownership of those houses is ongoing, and I will receive a report on  those findings shortly. I hope that I can bring some of those houses back into  the allocation category, so that they will be available for people to live in,  thereby easing the housing crisis.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>: I  welcome the Minister&rsquo;s indication that the north-west will receive its fair  share of the housing allocation that has been made available in the Budget.  However, does the Minister recognise that Derry  bears an unfair share of acute housing need and that the fair response has to  be proportionate to that? In making progress on those matters, the key issue  will be delivery. Will the Minister use her influence with the Environment  Minister to ensure that land that would be available to provide new housing  developments alongside existing developments will be brought into the planning  zone?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  I thank Mr Durkan for his question. I will be happy to talk to my ministerial  colleague the Minister of the Environment about planning issues in order to  ensure that land is properly zoned to reflect housing need in the Foyle  constituency. The current social-housing development programme that I have  approved contains enough new builds to meet the current assessed need. However,  as I said to Ms Anderson, I want to see whether those plans can be surpassed.  One idea that has been suggested by the Member of Parliament for Foyle was to convene  a special housing seminar involving all stakeholders in the Foyle constituency,  with a view to identifying priorities for action. I wish to assure the House  that I shall proceed with such a move in the very near future.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Warm Homes Scheme</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">2. <strong>Mr Craig </strong>asked the Minister for Social Develop&shy;ment to detail how much was budgeted  for the warm homes scheme in (i) 2005-2006; and (ii) 2006-2007, and how much  has been allocated under this scheme for 2007-2008.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2700>(AQO 2700/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">15. <strong>Mr  Hilditch </strong>asked the Minister for Social Development to detail her plans to  take forward the warm homes scheme.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=AQO2789> (AQO  2789/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  With your permission, Mr Deputy Speaker, I will answer question 2 and question  15 together. The warm homes scheme has been very successful, and it will  continue. I have increased my Department&rsquo;s allocation to the scheme from &pound;16&middot;85  million in 2007-08 to &pound;21&middot;4 million in 2008-09, and I will be looking for  additional funding in-year. I will also examine the delivery of the scheme, and  look at introducing prioritisation of applications to ensure that people in  greatest need get help first.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It may be helpful to provide some statistics about the  scheme. My Department&rsquo;s warm homes scheme budget for the last three years was  as follows: &pound;11&middot;85 million in 2005-06; &pound;15&middot;85 million in 2006-07; and &pound;16&middot;85  million in 2007-08. Funding for the scheme has remained relatively constant  over the past two years, due to funding from the Department of Enterprise,  Trade and Investment, through the environment and energy fund. That fund came  to an end at the end of the fiscal year last week, but, in order to offset that  loss of funding, I have increased my Department&rsquo;s budget for the warm homes  scheme to &pound;21&middot;4 million for the current financial year. I will also be looking  to the in-year monitoring process to provide additional resources for that  important work.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>: I  thank the Minister for that answer, and for  her commitment to that element of social deprivation. However, given the  fact that there will be an almost 10% increase in the number of people who are  eligible for the fuel-poverty scheme, is the Minister happy that the additional  budgetary increase will be enough?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  I have heard those expressions of concern about the warm homes scheme, so I  welcome the opportunity to set the record straight. Funding for the scheme has  increased from &pound;3 million in 2001 to &pound;16&middot;25 million in 2007-08 &mdash; the fiscal  year that has just ended. That represents a major percentage increase on last  year&rsquo;s DSD funding, which in itself was a record for any one year. I remain  totally committed to the warm homes scheme, which, since it commenced, has  impacted on the lives of 60,000 people throughout Northern Ireland. I have instructed  my officials to ensure that the warm homes scheme is prioritised and targeted  at those who are most in need to ensure that it has the best possible impact,  and provides the best deal for the people of Northern Ireland, particularly  those who are at disadvantage.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hilditch</strong>:  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s answer and her commitment to the warm homes scheme.  Will she also acknowledge the positive contribution that that scheme has made  not only in improving the quality of life of  our constituents but its unexpected role in helping the benefit uptake campaign by successfully identifying  people who were missing out on other benefits?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  I agree with Mr Hilditch&rsquo;s analysis, and, at the end of the month, I intend to  announce the benefit uptake campaign for older people and those who suffer from  mental ill health or disability, for this financial year.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cobain</strong>:  Further to that point, the Minister has contact details for all individuals who  receive pension credits or attendance allowance. Will she assure the House that  those people will be contacted directly to ensure that they are apprised of  their entitlement under the warm homes scheme?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  I can assure Mr Cobain that I will instruct my officials to ensure that that  happens. It has always been my intention to ensure that benefits are targeted  towards those who are in need of, and entitled to, them.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her answers, and I wish to take this opportunity to  express my gratitude for the work by those who administer the warm homes scheme  through Eaga plc. My questions have been answered, and the Minister clearly  stated her intentions for future years; however, one important fact is that the  people most in need of the warm homes scheme must be targeted &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. We are not here to get facts from you; we are here to ask questions.  Given that the Minister has already answered the question, we will move on.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Housing Contracts</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">3. <strong>Mr S  Wilson </strong>asked the Minister for Social Development to detail (i) the number  of housing contracts that were started in 2007/2008; and (ii) the number of  those contracts that were signed on 31 March 2008.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2692>(AQO 2692/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  In the last financial year, the social-housing development programme faced a  funding shortfall; however, I made successful bids in the October and December  monitoring rounds, and that enabled the budget to be restored to the full  amount required to deliver in excess of the target of 1,500 new-housing starts.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As of 31 March 2008, 189  social-housing development programme contracts had been started in  2007-08. Those schemes comprise 1,595 accommodation units and, as of 31 March 2008, 22 contracts had been  signed.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  The Minister&rsquo;s answer illustrates one of the failures of the social-housing  programme. Many contracts that should be signed throughout the year are not  signed until the last minute, which delays the availability of houses for the  incoming year. Will the Minister indicate what steps she is taking to up the  game, and improve the performance, of housing associations, which consistently  wait until the last day of the financial year before signing contracts?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  I am sure that Mr Wilson is well aware of the fact that, in the last financial  year, when I took up ministerial office, only 600 new-housing starts were  planned. As a result of successful negotiations with the Finance Minister in the October and December  monitoring rounds, I was able to secure additional funding that enabled  me to increase that figure to 1,595. That happened near the end of the year,  which explains the late signing of contracts. Nevertheless, I take on board  what the Member said, and I hope that, with greater planning, the Northern  Ireland Housing Executive &mdash; which is the  strategic housing authority for Northern Ireland &mdash; my Department and others that are involved in  delivery, such as the Strategic Investment Board, can ensure that better  targets are put in place and that houses are built. We want delivery in order  to offset the disadvantage felt by many people throughout Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.45pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs McGill</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Will the Minister detail any  discussions that her Department has had with other Departments about joining-up  the promotion of household energy efficiency measures with the promotion of the  adoption of sustainable energy appliances, which will make homes warmer and  more cost-efficient for households in the long run? Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  Until recently, my Department was in contact with the Department of Enterprise,  Trade and Investment constantly, because that Department part-funded the warm  homes scheme. Obviously, I have also written to the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment about some grants that have now ended, asking if it is possible to  restore them.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her previous replies. Given the importance of tackling  the housing backlog in Northern    Ireland, will the Minister assure the House  that her social and affordable housing programme will attempt to deliver more  starts than have been achieved in previous years and that it will result in  significantly reduced waiting lists?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  I assure the Member and the House that I intend to deliver the house starts  that were set out in the Programme for Government; that is, to provide 1,500,  1,750 and 2,000 new homes over the next three years. That represents a steady  increase on the level of new social-house building in recent years. In the  fiscal year just completed, we pushed up the level of house starts from a  target of 600, when I took up Ministerial responsibility, to 1,595 new house  starts as of 31 March 2008. Therefore I assure the House that we are always  trying to raise the bar.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am hopeful that the new housing agenda will have a  positive impact on waiting lists, but I am pragmatic enough to know that the  number of people on those lists is determined by factors outside my control and  outside the control of my Department, such as demographic change, immigration,  household formation and other social trends.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Mandatory Tenancy Deposit Scheme</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">4. <strong>Mr  Kennedy </strong>asked the Minister for Social Development what plans she has to  introduce a mandatory tenancy deposit scheme for shorthold tenancy agreements,  similar to provisions in England  and Wales.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2711>(AQO 2711/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  I have no immediate plans to introduce a mandatory tenancy deposit scheme.  However, such a scheme will be considered in my assessment of the impact of the  Private Tenancies (Northern Ireland)  Order 2006 and in a new strategy for the private rented sector in Northern Ireland.  If legislation is required for such a scheme then provisions could be included  in a future housing Bill. The strategy will  include the positive consideration of measures that give added  protection to landlords and tenants, which  is an issue that I understand the Member is particularly concerned  about.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s initial answer. Does she agree that we need  improvements in standards in Northern Ireland  and increased confidence in our private rented sector, and that the  introduction of a scheme, such as that which exists in England and Wales, would be a good first step  in protecting tenants from rogue landlords while promoting confidence in the  sector?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  First, I assure the Member that I will be considering the issue in the new  housing Bill, which I hope to bring to the  Assembly. I also advise the Member and the House that I recently met  with representatives of the Landlords&rsquo; Association of Northern Ireland and gave  them a commitment that my housing officials will engage with them on my behalf  and, if possible, attend future meetings. That will enable landlords to present  their views on issue relating to the  private rented sector.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am conscious that the  private-rented sector provides a proportion of houses in the  social-rented sector and that some measure  of protection for tenants and landlords is required. Therefore, I shall  be taking those measures and what the Member has said into account.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Disability Living Allowance: Epilepsy</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">5. <strong>Mr G Robinson </strong>asked the Minister for Social Development what plans she has to review the  criteria used to assess disability living  allowance claims in respect people suffering from epilepsy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2671>(AQO 2671/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  People with epilepsy are entitled to disability living allowance (DLA) on the  same basis as anyone else with a severe disability. They qualify if they meet  the entitlement conditions for the benefit, which depend on the effects that a  severe physical or mental disability has on a person&rsquo;s need for personal care  and/or their ability to walk. People do not qualify for the benefit based on particular disabilities or diagnoses. That ensures that all claims from people with  disabilities are treated equitably. To consider separate criteria for  specific disabilities would make the decision-making process unnecessarily  complicated and possibly unfair.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I know that the Member and one of his colleagues tabled  questions for written answer about disability living allowance in the recent  past, which were no doubt precipitated by many cases that they have become  aware of through their constituency work.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Robinson</strong>: The Minister has already answered my supplementary question. I  thank her for doing so.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Decisions assessing a person&rsquo;s  medical condition and, as a result, their entitlement to DLA, are currently  made by decision-makers who are not medically trained. Does the Minister think  that that provides the best method for ensuring that people who are entitled to  that benefit actually receive it?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  I recall that Mr Brady raised that concern in June 2007 during the debates on  the Second Stage and Consideration Stage of the Welfare Reform Bill. I said at  that time that the people who assess the information do so based on the best  possible medical information that is available to them. If he has any details  concerning particular cases that he is not content with, perhaps he will write  to me or have a word with me about them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is important to remember that the rules that govern  entitlement to disability living allowance are complex. Eligibility is based  not on a person&rsquo;s particular illness or medical condition, but on the impact  that the illness has on a person&rsquo;s daily living. Decisions on entitlement  involve a high degree of judgement and interpretation of detailed medical  evidence. I have no doubt that the people employed in the Social Security  Agency are qualified to do that job.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  I have listened to the Minister&rsquo;s convoluted explanation of various  entitlements. Will she look into the simplification of the bureaucratic  processes for those suffering from epilepsy who are seeking travel concessions?  Will she examine the cost of providing free public transport, as happens in  other parts of the UK, as  opposed to the half-priced fares that are currently available in Northern Ireland?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  Mr Robinson has strayed into the responsibilities of another Minister. I am  content to write to the Minister for Regional Development about that issue, and I encourage Mr Robinson to do  likewise.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member referred to  the convoluted arrangements for social security benefits. I listened to  one of my officials discussing the particular circumstances of disability living allowance and the complex  arrangements on &lsquo;The Stephen Nolan Show&rsquo; this morning. I have regular  contact with my ministerial counterpart in the Department for Work and Pensions  &mdash; the governing body for the issue &mdash; about that benefit and about the complex  arrangements of other benefits. In light of the comments made here today, I am  happy to discuss the simplification of the process the next time I meet the  Minister for Work and Pensions.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Environmental Improvement</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">6. <strong>Mr  Brolly </strong>asked the Minister for Social Develop&shy;ment to detail the funding  available for environmental improvement schemes in older housing estates.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2810>(AQO 2810/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  Some &pound;2&middot;6 million was spent on such environmental improvement work in 2007-08.  Environmental-improvement works are undertaken as part of renewal work in older  Northern Ireland Housing Executive estates.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In addition to the funding that is provided by the Housing  Executive, my Department is carrying out a range of environmental-improvement  works in our cities and towns, in neighbourhood renewal areas, and along  arterial routes. Much of that investment will benefit those who live in older  housing estates.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brolly</strong>:  Does the Minister agree that the design of most of those older estates &mdash; with  their dark alleyways and communal backyards and car parks &mdash; encourages  so-called antisocial behaviour? Does she accept  that a progressive and comprehensive programme of alley-gating would  contribute to the establishment of better order and peace for the residents of  those estates; and of the general neighbourhood in which those estates are  located? Will she seek to initiate such a programme? Alley-gating is strongly  favoured by Housing Executive officers in my constituency.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>: I thank Mr Brolly for his supplementary question. All of the  relevant offices are already actively pursuing alley-gating on my behalf. That  it is the case whether it is done through  the Northern Ireland Housing Executive, the regional-development offices  &mdash; as an element of urban regeneration &mdash; the  Belfast Regeneration Office, or the  North-West Development Office in Derry.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Alley-gating has already been undertaken in areas of West Belfast and &mdash; and as the Member suggested &mdash; that has  contributed, in no small measure, to a reduction in antisocial behaviour.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Alley-gating is a programme that I will continue to encourage and it is one in which we are already  directly involved, whether through the Department&rsquo;s urban regeneration, or the Northern Ireland Housing  Executive.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her response. It is important that environmental  schemes are in place for sufficient  parking, planting and traffic management. We also need a better plan for  homes to provide not just concrete, but  greenery, in the true sense of the word.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In my constituency of Strangford, the Minister has ensured  that the excellent West Winds scheme has gone ahead. However, there are three  other estates in the Newtownards which have not yet benefited from any such  schemes.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">When does the Minister hope to implement schemes for the  Glen, Bowtown and Scrabo estates? Improve&shy;ments to those estates have been  delayed many times and it is therefore important that they are dealt with as a  matter of urgency.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  I thank Mr Shannon for his question. I am happy to examine those issues and  respond to him in writing.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">On 13 November 2007, I announced that the Scrabo area had  been designated as an area at risk. That means that it was viewed to have a  considerable level of disadvantage and that funding would be provided for  projects in that area. Therefore, measures have already been taken to help the  Scrabo area.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I was pleased to visit Newtownards at Mr Shannon&rsquo;s  invitation, and to see the estates that he mentioned. I saw for myself the need  for neighbourhood renewal, urban regeneration and revitalisation in those  areas. I take on board what the Member has said and will respond to him in  writing.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">All-Island Policy: Disadvantaged Areas</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">7. <strong>Mrs M  Bradley </strong>asked the Minister for Social Development what consideration she  has given to an all-island policy dimension to community development and  Government support for disadvantaged areas.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=AQO2797> (AQO  2797/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  I have visited Dublin several times to meet a number of Ministers who hold  responsibility for policy areas that are  similar to those of my Department: Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, Minister of State at  the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government with special  responsibility for housing, urban renewal and developing areas; &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v,  Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs; and Pat Carey, Minister of State at the Department of  Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs with special responsibility for  drug strategy and community affairs.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We share common interests in the issues of tackling  disadvantage and promoting the social and physical regeneration of communities,  while operating in different policy and legislative contexts. I will be working  closely with my Southern counterparts to examine how we achieve best practice  in housing and regeneration of communities North and South, and we can learn  much from each other. I will be addressing the all-island housing conference in  Cork in two  weeks&rsquo; time, along with Mr &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.</p>

	      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="7"></a>Private Notice Questions</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Post Office Closures</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion"><strong>Mr</strong> Attwood asked the Office of the First Minister  and the deputy First Minister, in light of the announced six-week consultation  period on proposed post office closures and  the impact on rural and urban communities and disadvantaged and  vulnerable groups, to detail what representations it will make to the Post  Office and to the Secretary of State.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister) (Mr  Donaldson)</strong>: I thank the Member for West Belfast Mr Attwood for tabling the  question. As a constituency MLA, I had a meeting last week with the National  Federation of SubPostmasters in Northern    Ireland to hear directly about its concerns  on the recent announcement by the Post Office, which reflects the position of  the UK Government and is not a devolved matter.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Post Office has issued those proposals for  consultation, and the Office of the First Minister and the deputy First  Minister will consider, with other interested Departments, what representations  or action would be appropriate on what is now a matter of implementation rather  than of policy development. In the  meantime, we urge all Members to consider carefully the proposals with  the communities that they represent and to make their views known to the Post  Office.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I thank the Speaker for accepting the emergency question, and I thank the  junior Minister for his attendance.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Will the junior Minister ask the Office of the First  Minister and the deputy First Minister to put the matter on the agenda for  Thursday&rsquo;s Executive meeting as a matter of emergency? Will he concur, given  that the matter was decided by the British Government and the Post Office before restoration, that it would be  reasonable to have a long period of consultation &mdash; certainly more than six weeks &mdash; to determine the right approach  for post office provision in the North? Will he agree, given the higher  social, economic, and community disadvantage in the North compared to other  parts of these islands, that there is a need to ensure that services are  locally provided so that vulnerable people have access to them? Will the junior  Minister also consider the model adopted by  Essex County Council, where a local council provider is getting involved  in the provision of post office services? Is there not something in that model  that could be usefully adopted in the North and in any future conversations that OFMDFM has with the British Government  and the Post Office?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Donaldson</strong>:  Mr Attwood asked whether OFMDFM could put the matter on the agenda as an urgent  issue to be discussed at the Executive&rsquo;s meeting this Thursday, and I will  consult with colleagues in OFMDFM to see  whether that can be done at this stage.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member also mentioned the issue of a longer  consultation period. It is true that the six-week consultation period has met  with some criticism with regard to the Post Office&rsquo;s proposals. Under the code  of practice on post office closures and relocations agreed in November 2005  between Post Office Ltd and Postwatch, six weeks is the standard consultation  period and was announced by the UK Government last year in their response to  the public consultation on the future of the network.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The UK  Government have indicated that it is important to minimise further uncertainty  for customers and sub-postmasters. The purpose of the area consultation is not  about the principle of network change, but  how best to implement closures and new outreach operations.  Nevertheless, the Member made a valid point, which has been echoed by others  publicly. It is a matter that OFMDFM can consider with its departmental  colleagues as it prepares a response to the Post Office. I will ensure that  that is included in the context of his request for the Executive to consider  the matter on Thursday.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member also raised issues concerning access, social  disadvantage and vulnerable groups in Northern Ireland. The Department of  Trade and Industry, which initiated this review of the post office network, was  advised of the requirements of section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 when  it was developing its change strategy. At that stage, individual closures were  not specified.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The UK Government have accepted that there is a need to  support the network beyond 2011, and they claim that the new access criteria  provide a framework to ensure that vulnerable consumers in deprived urban,  rural and remote areas are protected. Post Office Ltd stated that steps are  being taken to modernise the network, and it is examining innovative ways to  deliver cost-effective services. However, the points that the Member made on  access and vulnerable groups can be considered and responded to in the  consultation process.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member mentioned the model used by Essex County  Council, where services have been developed through a local provider. That is a  model that can be considered, but I stress that those are not issues for the  devolved Administration; they are issues for the Westminster Department and  Post Office Ltd. However, suggestions concerning Northern Ireland can be made in the  context of any responses that Departments make to the consultation.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">The Chairperson of the Committee for the Office of the  First Minister and deputy First Minister (Mr <strong>Kennedy)</strong>: I am grateful to Mr Attwood for bringing this important  issue to the Assembly and for the attendance of the junior Minister. In the  junior Minister&rsquo;s initial answers, he appears to accept that those who will be  most affected by the changes and closures are elderly people.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In light of the Office of the First Minister and deputy  First Minister&rsquo;s cross-cutting responsibilities for older people, and for  tackling poverty and social exclusion, will the junior Minister advise the  House whether he has received any information from the Post Office or the  Secretary of State for Northern Ireland that gives him confidence that the  interests of elderly and vulnerable people have been adequately taken into  account?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Given that many older people entrust the Post Office with  their savings and are reluctant to place them with any other institution, does  the junior Minister agree that it is important that the Post Office assures the  public that it continues to be committed to providing safe, accessible, local  opportunities for older people to save and manage their finances?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Donaldson</strong>:  I thank the Committee Chairperson for his comments and questions. In the  Member&rsquo;s constituency of Newry and Armagh,  there are eight urban branches and 38 rural branches. It is proposed that two  will close, and eight will be replaced by outreach services. In Mr Attwood&rsquo;s  constituency of West Belfast, two branches are  proposed for closure. The closure of the Blacks Road branch is perhaps the most  controversial, and the Member has spoken about that publicly.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Chairperson of the Committee for the Office of the  First Minister and deputy First Minister raised pertinent points about the  impact that those proposals will have on older people. The Department has a  responsibility to work with that sector, and it has been developing a strategy  with many of the groups and organisations that represent older citizens.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There are concerns about the impact that those closures  will have on elderly people, particularly those who live in rural communities,  where the greatest impact could be felt. Older citizens rely on the Post Office  for their savings, the payment of utility bills, and so on. Beyond the  proposals that have been published, no further proposals or assurances have  been given that address the impact of the closures on elderly people or a  commitment to safe and accessible Post Office services.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I accept that it is a generalisation, but over 99% of  people who live in the UK  will still live within one mile of a post office. However, that does not offer  much comfort to people in rural communities who are losing their local sub-post  office. In response to the request from the Member for West Belfast Mr Attwood  for the Executive to consider the issue, we will take on board what the Member  has said.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Any discussions that take place between the Department and  the other Departments will consider the impact on elderly people with regard to  safety and accessibility. Our response to the Post Office will ensure that  those issues are highlighted and that the concerns that both Members have  raised are brought to its attention. As I said earlier, I encourage all Members  to take up the invitation to respond to the consultation. It is important that  communities have a voice in the process; Members are well placed to ensure that  that voice is exercised.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading"><a name="8"></a>Mid-Ulster   Hospital</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion"><strong>Mrs</strong> O&rsquo;Neill asked the Minister of Health,  Social Services and Public Safety to detail  (i) how the decision to reduce healthcare in the Mid-Ulster Hospital  from 11.00 pm to 5.00 pm was equality impact assessed and (ii) the measures he  will implement to ensure that staff shortages are addressed as a matter of  urgency.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mr McGimpsey)</strong>: Over the weekend,  services at the accident and emergency department at the Mid-Ulster Hospital  were reduced. The department closed at 5.00 pm on Friday, Saturday and Sunday  due to a lack of appropriate medical cover. I understand the views of Members  and the local community that that is an unacceptable position. The Northern  Health and Social Care Trust has apologised and has advised me that it was an  exceptional circumstance and one that left the trust with no alternative but to  reduce the opening hours of the accident and emergency department. Later today,  I will meet the trust&rsquo;s chief executive, and I will seek her assurance that  such an unacceptable situation will not arise again.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I understand that the decision that was taken at the  weekend was an operational decision, and an equality impact assessment was not  appropriate in those circumstances. The trust&rsquo;s measures were to address an  immediate issue of patient safety, and they do not signal a change in the  normal opening hours of the accident and emergency department at the Mid-Ulster Hospital. To address staff shortages,  the trust has recently completed a recruitment exercise for staff-grade doctors  in accident and emergency. It expects one additional doctor to commence work in  April, with a further two commencing work in August.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs O&rsquo;Neill</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. The situation is disgraceful. The  Minister said that it was an &ldquo;exceptional circumstance&rdquo; and that he intends to  meet the Northern Trust to seek assurances that it will not happen again. This  morning, I spoke to the Northern Trust, and it cannot guarantee that it will  not happen again. It cannot guarantee that it will have doctors this evening,  tomorrow evening or for the rest of the week. That is totally unacceptable, and  I ask the Minister for assurances about what he can do, and to outline to the  House what work he will undertake to ensure that this does not happen again.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Does the Minister agree that it is a management problem,  and not a staff problem? The staff at the Mid-Ulster Hospital  continue to do very good work daily, but this is a problem of poor management.  No doctors were on call to serve a rural population; that could have led to a  death in mid Ulster  at the weekend. That cannot possibly be allowed to happen again. It is not good  enough, and Members should not accept that there is no guarantee that it will  not happen again.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister confirm whether that action is an  indirect attempt to run down services at the Mid-Ulster  Hospital, as was the case when the South Tyrone   Hospital was closed? For  a number of years, a direct attempt was made to run down services at that  hospital. I want assurances that that will not happen again and that the people  of mid Ulster  will not be put at such risk this weekend or any time in the future.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  The accident and emergency department at the Mid-Ulster Hospital  is a type-2 department, with attendances of just over 20,000 per annum. It operates  from 9.00 am until 11.00 pm, seven days a week. It was forced to shut last  Friday, Saturday and Sunday at 5.00 pm, but that was an exceptional  circumstance, and it will not happen again. I will seek those assurances, and I  will report back to Mrs O&rsquo;Neill in due course.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">4.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As I said, this does not signal a plan to change the  services that are currently provided at the Mid-Ulster Hospital.  The decision taken at the weekend does not reflect any intention to do that.  Normal accident and emergency hours have resumed, and the accident and  emergency department will continue to provide services.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mrs O&rsquo;Neill says that the problem is one of management. In  fact, the accident and emergency department requires four doctors, and it has a  complement of two doctors at the moment. On Friday, Saturday and Sunday, the  department did not have the staff to cover the accident and emergency hours. It  needs staff-grade doctors with the appropriate skills who are capable of  dealing the responsibilities involved, but those doctors were not available.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As I said, I will raise the issue in my discussions with  the trust&rsquo;s chief executive, and when I meet the trust&rsquo;s board tomorrow night.  It is disgraceful that an accident and emergency unit was shut at such short  notice, and I would not want a repeat of that situation. I assure the Member  that this event does not signal any attempt to change the normal opening hours  at the Mid-Ulster   Hospital.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mrs I Robinson)</strong>:  I agree wholeheartedly with my Deputy Chairperson on this matter. It beggars  belief that such an unacceptable and appalling situation could arise in the  twenty-first century. I also agree that the blame falls fairly and squarely on  management. If management knows that four doctors are needed to cover accident  and emergency services over a weekend, then surely it should know that those  doctors should be in attendance.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">What contingency plans are in place to deal with the  situation in the two hospitals that were primarily used, the Causeway Hospital  in Coleraine and the Antrim Area Hospital? Does the Minister understand the  frustration and the potential fallout for those patients who had to bypass the  Mid-Ulster hospital and travel to the other hospitals? I am just thankful that  there were no fatalities. I too would like a firm reassurance that, in future,  the Mid-Ulster Hospital will have four doctors in place  to provide the service that is needed for that widespread rural area.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  I am advised that the Antrim Area Hospital and the Causeway Hospital were able  to manage the extra patients as part of their normal business, and that the  reports that 20 or 30 people had to wait on trolleys at Antrim Area Hospital  are not true.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As far as recruitment is concerned, we need staff-grade  doctors. Some 20 accident and emergency departments operate in Northern Ireland,  and recruitment is difficult in the smaller accident and emergencys. That is a  fact; I am in no way using that as an excuse for what happened at the Mid-Ulster Hospital this weekend. The Royal College  of Surgeons has advised that an accident  and emergency department that has  less than 40,000 attendances cannot be sustained. That is the advice  that we have received. However, a number of accident and emergency departments  operate with well below 40,000 attendances, and that requires the recruitment  of staff &mdash; and persuading them to stay in post &mdash; when they would do much better  in a busy accident and emergency that could offer them the challenges that they  expect in their career. Staff who have to sit around, as it were, and who are  not fully employed rapidly deskill. However, those who work in a busy accident  and emergency department &mdash; such as those at the Craigavon  Area Hospital  and the Royal Victoria Hospital,  which have over 70,000 visits a year &mdash; experience the full range of challenges  that they expect from their job.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As I said, I will meet the trust&rsquo;s chief executive, and I  will explore that issue with her and with the trust&rsquo;s board. If an accident and  emergency department is in operation and the opening hours appear on the door,  then we expect those hours to be maintained.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The accident and emergency department provides a valuable  service, but not the full service: it does not have emergency medicine; it does  not have emergency surgical services; it does not deal with adult trauma; it  does not deal with head injuries; it does not deal with paediatric emergencies,  nor does the hospital have in-patient paediatric services.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Nevertheless, the department provides an important service  to the area and it is a service that people in the area expect to be available  at a particular time. They understand that it closes at 11.00 pm and,  therefore, do not attempt to visit after those hours. What I find difficult to  comprehend fully is the particularly short notice of the closure that was given  and that is a matter that I will be exploring with the management of the trust in  due course.</p>

	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Which amendment was: Leave  out all after &ldquo;expresses&rdquo; and insert</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;its continued commitment to securing training and employment  opportunities where appropriate for young people with disabilities; and awaits  the outcome of the review of such provision undertaken by the Minister for  Employment and Learning.&rdquo; &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Mr B McCrea.] &nbsp; [Mr McClarty]<span class="Italic"></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Spratt</strong>: I  thank the proposer of the motion. I also know that a review is in place. I hope  that, given what Mr Basil McCrea said earlier, there will not be any division  in the House at the end of the debate because this issue is too important for  those with disabilities for that to happen. I hope that people will reflect and  be able to accept the motion and not divide the House.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">When the motion is dissected, there is nothing in it that  anyone could oppose. It is about opportunity and young people being afforded  the opportunity to fulfil their potential. It is up to the House to ensure that  the right opportunities are in place for young people with disabilities in  order that their potential is reached.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Disability should not be a hindrance to education, and I  admire anyone who wants to further their education in order to maximise their  potential. If Northern    Ireland is to become an area of economic  prosperity, we must ensure that everyone has the opportunity to contribute.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">About 100 young people with learning difficulties or a  disability leave special schools in Northern Ireland each year. That is  a significant number with significant potential. Unfortunately, there is a  perception &mdash; indeed, perhaps more than a perception &mdash; that there is little  opportunity for that group and no accessible route to further education.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Article 13(1) of the Further Education (Northern Ireland)  Order 1997 requires governing bodies of further education institutions to have  regard to the needs of students who are over compulsory school age and who have  a disability. Furthermore, the Special Educational Needs and Disability (Northern Ireland)  Order 2005 requires colleges to make their premises and curriculum accessible  to those with disabilities. An additional support fund ensures that financial  resources are in place for colleges and students. Those are positive moves, but  are they enough? At times I fear that the approach of Government is to throw  money at areas such as this without any real consideration of how that money is  best spent.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Colleges have raised various issues as problems: have  colleges got the capacity to provide for students with learning difficulties  and disabilities; are college staff appropriately trained to provide the level  of service that students need; are the progressive routes that are required and  suitable accreditations in place? Those issues still have to be addressed adequately  by the Department for Employment and Learning. The issue is not about just  money: it is about targeting resources; providing the necessary environment;  giving the right opportunities, and targeting spending in those areas where it  is most needed. The needs of students must always be at the forefront of the  decision-making process and the strategy adopted.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I understand that the Department for Employment and  Learning is reviewing the nature and extent of the provision of further  education opportunities for those with special needs. The Department must act  in light of the fact that 10% of people aged 18 to 30 have a disability, yet no  more than 5% of students in further education have a disability. That disparity  must be redressed, but it can be redressed only when the obstacles that prevent young people who have  disabilities from entering further education are removed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am glad that the Minister has been present in the House  throughout the entire debate, and I urge him to take the issues that I have raised  into consideration as part of the review. We want to provide the opportunities  that young people with disabilities are crying out for. I hope that the  Minister will assure the House that the amendment takes nothing away from the  wording of the original motion. I reiterate the hope from this side of the  House that there will be no Division on the matter, because it is too  important.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I welcome the second opportunity in recent months to debate this matter. It is  worth debating for two reasons. First, there are the reasons that Members have  outlined &mdash; namely that the group of young people that we are discussing is  under stress and is particularly vulnerable. If the Assembly is to measure up  to expectations, it must demonstrate the benefits of devolution to those  individuals and their families in the way in which it addresses this matter.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, this matter has returned to the House because of a  structural flaw. It is not necessarily a comment on the Minister for Employment  and Learning, but in the six months since the matter was first aired in the  House, the Department has made no substantive report to the Committee on the  progress of the review. Departments must provide stocktaking reports to their  Committees on the progress that they make in implementing the will of the  Assembly, as expressed in its resolutions. I hope that, in that respect, we can  learn something from this matter.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, we must know precisely what stage the review is  at; what issues it is addressing; and what the time frame is for its  completion. I invite the Minister to confirm  whether the following matters will be addressed during the review. In  opening the debate, Mrs O&rsquo;Neill referred to transition provision. Probably no  need is more acute than that for transition provision, given that the young  person is moving from a situation in which he or she has been surrounded for  many years by the architecture of schooling, social services and health provision to a new situation with a different  architecture. We need to hear more about whether that transition can be  better managed so that the young person has all the support and provision that  he or she needs in order to move successfully from childhood to adulthood.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister comment on the issue that was referred to  by his colleague Mr Basil McCrea, namely day care, or daily care and support?  As Mr McCrea said, not only are young people in day care with a wide range of  other age groups, but there will be greater demand on day-care services as our  population ages. Consequently, some families are beginning to discover that  their young people are receiving fewer hours of day care than they might have received previously. Given that we  have an increasing older population, we must know  whether there will be increased day-care provision to ensure that those young people receive the  daily care and support that they require throughout their lives.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">4.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Thirdly, I want to talk about supported learning, which has  also been mentioned. I acknowledge that the Minister was in correspondence  recently on how Invest NI may or may not, for example, support Ulster Supported  Employment Ltd (USEL). The project, based in the upper Shankill, has been  highly successful and requires a great deal of support. The SDLP needs to know  how such initiatives will obtain additional resources, from bodies that include  Invest NI, to ensure their continued provision of dedicated training for  people, whether young or old, with particular needs.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The fourth matter that I want to flag up is the Minister&rsquo;s  ongoing review of the Training for Success programme. The Minister said that  any aspect of Training for Success that is not working must be fixed. That  applies to the part of the programme that caters for students with particular  needs, whether they are part time, over 25 years old or young people.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I invite the Minister to respond to those four points,  because they will all influence how the SDLP votes on the motion and thereby  whether the House supports it.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>:  I thank Mrs O&rsquo;Neill for proposing the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is a legislative framework for the protection of  young people who wish to exercise their right to be educated. The Disability  Discrimination Act 1995 aims to protect  disabled people from all forms of discrimination and to integrate them  in the life of the community. However, as the Act requires major changes to  employment practices and the provision of services, including education, it is  being phased in over several years. The Act ensures that the needs of disabled  people who wish to study are recognised and that comprehensive information on  disability issues is provided to students and their parents or guardians.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, the Special Educational Needs and Disability (Northern Ireland)  Order 2005 developed the right of children with special educational needs to  attend mainstream schools. It made discrimination on the grounds of disability unlawful in schools, further and higher  education institutions and qualifications bodies.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Official statistics show  that approximately 100 young people with disabilities and/or learning  difficulties leave special schools in Northern Ireland every year. Of  those, about 20% are classed as having complex and multiple disabilities and  those young people have no option other than day-care provision. Disabled  people are twice as likely to have no qualifications as their non-disabled  peers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The solution is not to set up courses specifically for disabled people for which existing legislation  mandates, because that would remove them from mainstream society. The  solution is to improve access to existing courses. Disability Action&rsquo;s stance  is that, where possible, disabled people should be part of mainstream education  but with the necessary support to ensure their full participation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In general, the voluntary and community sector is extremely  concerned at the economic focus of the FE Means Business strategy. Non-NVQ  provisions receive only 5% of the budget for further education, and colleges  tend to prioritise level-2 and level-3 courses, which attract weighted funding. Although it is important for  colleges to meet employers&rsquo; needs to upskill the workforce, a balance must be struck to ensure that that is not done to the detriment of disadvantaged  communities that need education to give them a second chance.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Often, level-1 provision is not considered a priority.  However, the vast majority of disabled people who have learning disabilities  access provision at level 1 or below. Disability Action is concerned about the  Department&rsquo;s systematic reduction of the amount of provision that is available  at level 1 and below. The option to  participate in further education will be reduced dramatically for that group of people, thus marginalising them  further in society.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Programme for Government advocates a shared and better future for all. Therefore, economic  development cannot be the Assembly&rsquo;s only concern. Building a fair and  inclusive society must be the basis for a future in which people are not  prevented from reaching their full potential simply because of their  disability.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I support the amendment and look forward to the  Department&rsquo;s review and to a holistic approach being taken towards employment,  training and education opportunities for all.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Newton</strong>: I  agree with my colleague Jimmy Spratt&rsquo;s remarks on the matter. I hope that all  Members agree that the matter is of such serious concern that the House must  not divide on the issue. There is no need for it to divide. I concur with the  remarks of Alex Attwood, who has just left  the Chamber, on the transition from school to further education and,  particularly, on USEL. When the organisation attended the Committee for Employment and Learning, members were  impressed by the work that it does for disabled people.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">All local politicians have a responsibility to support the personal development of the most vulnerable  people in society, regardless of their background, physical or mental  needs, age or gender. A society that cannot accept the basic principle to  support the people who are in greatest need does not deserve to be described as  progressive.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Some Members have quoted statistics and figures; no doubt  others who speak after me will do the same. I do  not want to discuss statistics, specifics and essentials. It would not  be possible for me to cover the whole story in the time that I have been  allocated. However, I want to address the supporting principles that the Assembly must adopt &mdash; guidelines that should  underpin all that it does if it is to improve the circumstances and  well-being, not only of the group of people that we are discussing, but of  everyone.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is a great need for the Assembly to listen to people  who have learning difficulties. To some extent, the Assembly has engaged,  through pilot studies, with school pupils who have disabilities and has  attempted to deal with their identified needs. However, that must be extended  and expanded in order to take note of needs in further education areas. The  Assembly must speak up for people who have needs, not just when an opportunity,  such as this debate, arises, but through an ongoing and unremitting campaign  that articulates the specific needs of those young people, who often have  complex and multiple disabilities.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is a need to provide support and to ensure that the  necessary infrastructure that Alex Attwood talked about is available during the  transition in order to help teachers, lecturers and students and to guarantee  the best learning experience. Young disabled people need to feel safe. Their learning experience must be  satisfying and rewarding and must provide them with increased confidence  as part of their holistic development.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, that cannot be a one-way process, nor should we  expect it to be. We need to challenge the students to make choices about their  lives and careers. We need to provide all the support that we can, but we also  need students to make choices and decisions. We should help to stretch them to  achieve their dreams and aspirations. We need to help them take their rightful  places in society, ensure that they have the opportunity to contribute to the  community in a positive manner, and fully value their contributions.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Moving from school &mdash; we  have been talking mainly about special schools &mdash; to further education  can be a traumatic experience for those  with learning difficulties and disabilities. They need support at that  challenging time, as they make the transition, but they also need encouragement  and assistance to empower them to make their own choices about post-school  provision and to allow them the opportunity to avoid care centres or  intensive-support units. As many as possible should enjoy a fully empowered and  comprehensive life, and the opportunity to make a full contribution to society.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">This matter is important. A society that ignores people is  not progressive. I hope that the House will not  divide on this issue, and that those who seek support from us will  receive it from a united Assembly.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Butler</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I welcome the debate  and broadly support what other Members,  particularly the members of the Employment and Learning Committee, have  said. After 12 years of primary and post-primary education, many young people  who suffer disabilities and learning difficulties are denied the opportunity to  enter further education &mdash; an opportunity given to so many others.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Research shows that in Northern   Ireland, a lower percentage  of young people with disabilities or learning difficulties than in Britain  participate in further education programmes and courses. Statistics also  show that approximately 100 of them leave special schools in the North every year. Of those, 20% are classified as  having complex or multiple disabilities. Most of those kids have no  choice but to go into day care. They have no opportunity to access further  education courses. The debate needs to reflect that, and we must do something  about it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We should also  acknowledge the good work that goes on  in further education colleges. In Belfast   Metropolitan College, many courses are provided for young people with  disabilities and learning difficulties. Many young people have been enabled by  that college to progress into employment or to acquire skills.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The motion is aimed at offering educational opportunities to young people with disabilities.  Further education colleges are at the heart of lifelong learning in our  communities; they enhance social cohesion and advance  the skills and learning of individuals. For many years, further education colleges have provided a second  opportunity for people to gain qualifications and, consequently, employment  opportunities. The vast majority of full-time students in further education are  drawn from the 16-to-18 age group. The  sector has close historical links with our secondary schools. Further education colleges attract 27% of all school  leavers, and almost one in three of all 16- and 17-year-old school  leavers. Some 170,000 students attend such colleges every year.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Further education colleges are at the heart of our  community; there are roughly 400 out centres, 47 campuses and, in 2007, our 16  colleges merged to form six super colleges.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In accordance with  equality legislation, the Department for  Employment and Learning has produced a disability action plan to address existing problems, and &pound;1&middot;5  million has been put into an additional support fund. I know, from my experience with Belfast Metropolitan   College, that capital funding has been allocated to make  buildings more accessible for people with disabilities.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">4.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">One area that has not been covered in the debate are the universities, because the motion focuses on  further education colleges. We must examine the concerns about the  ability of people with disabilities to access university courses.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Anna Lo mentioned the  FE Means Business strategy, which was raised in the Committee for  Employment and Learning. The Committee accepts the main thrust of the strategy that there should be more focus on young people gaining qualifications.  However, that undermines the community dimension at many colleges, where  people with learning difficulties &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member&rsquo;s time is almost up.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Butler</strong>: The requirements of people with learning difficulties have not  been addressed by the strategy, which I ask  the Minister to examine. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: The  DUP has stated that it is content with the  thrust of the motion, but that it will not unnecessarily divide the  House.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Education is the building block of life and should be  available to all, irrespective of social background, age or disability. As the  Member for Lagan Valley Paul Butler said, the problem of education provision  for young people with disabilities exists in further education colleges and in  universities. We must ensure that young people with disabilities can not only  receive education and training, but get a good job afterwards.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As some Members stated, the Committee for Employment and  Learning visited the factory of Ulster Supported Employment Ltd, which employs disabled people in their competitive commercial  premises and receives support from the Department. USEL is a good  example of disabled people getting jobs &mdash; in that factory and in the wider  community. Therefore, when debating this subject, Members must bear in mind  that there are wider issues involved, particularly in employment, which has  been referred to by the proposer of the motion and other Members who spoke.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Specific mention is made in the motion about courses that  are exclusively for disabled people, which are necessary for those who are  severely disabled. In an intervention earlier, my colleague Sammy Wilson  highlighted the lack of options in further education for those students who  leave special schools. In that sense, I disagree with what Ms Lo said, although  we should aim to help disabled people progress to, and gain qualifications  from, mainstream accredited courses where that is suitable.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A disability should not be an obstacle to learning;  unfortunately, however, many people who live with a disability do not feel that  they have the same access to educational courses as able-bodied people. Unfort&shy;unately,  having a disability has proved to be a hurdle in life &mdash; fewer people with  disabilities have good qualifications, and a higher percentage face poverty in  later life.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Along with many Members, I have asked questions on widening  access to courses and was informed that, in 2006, students at further education  colleges included 488 blind or partially sighted people and 839 who were deaf  or had hearing impediments. Those are people who can go into mainstream courses if certain provisions are made.  Therefore, it is imperative that access to mainstream courses is made easier  and that the requirements of disabled people are met. Some measures are simple, such as making physical  access easier, much of which is already covered in legislation. My colleague Mr  Spratt referred to a range of legislation  that exists in that field.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There are practical difficulties for people with  disabilities who, on entering further- or higher-education courses, should  perhaps be individually assessed to evaluate  their specific learning requirements. It is also important that the  tools for learning are available, such as DAISY &mdash; digital accessible  information system &mdash; technology or Braille, scribes or note takers, or the provision of individual assistants for some  students.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">One of the most important elements of that &mdash; and it has  been mentioned by a number of Members &mdash; is ensuring that further education  lecturers and support staff have the relevant training to deal with and teach  people who have different needs than the average able-bodied learner. That may  be particularly relevant to part-time staff.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is also important that people with disabilities receive  careers advice. I have mentioned USEL; some other companies have the right  support mechanisms in place for those with disabilities. The further education  colleges should be working to build up relationships with employers in that  area.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Additional funding has been made available to help colleges with the extra costs associated with  specialised courses that mainstream education cannot deliver. Money has  been given to colleges to widen access, and legislation has been passed to  ensure that college premises are more suitable for people with disabilities.  The Department has taken a number of steps to widen participation in recent years, and that is to be commended.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A review of the provision of further education  opportunities for those with special needs is under way. Mr Attwood said that  the Committee has not been kept up to date on how that review is progressing.  It would be useful if Members could hear how the review is progressing and be  informed of when that review will be  complete. I hope that support for the amendment will not mean that  Members will allow the Department to take its eye off the ball, and that it  will continue to work to deliver choices and opportunities for those with  disabilities.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  Members are aware of the problems that families and young people with learning  and physical disabilities face. Although I welcome the debate, the  responsibility for solving the problems of these young people is on more than  one Department. It is important that the Department of Health and Social  Services and Public Safety, the Department of Education and the Department for  Employment and Learning are involved and that they plan for the needs of the  young people. That planning should start when children are14 years old so that  their individual needs can be met. Individual needs are crucial to the motion;  only if an individual is considered on his or her own circumstances will his or  her needs be resolved. A one-size response will not fit all.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The last action plan, which, I think, was published in 2006  or 2005, was weak, so we must get this one right. If all Departments play their  part, and if a time frame and budget are imposed in which to address individual  needs, we can do that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I ask the Minister for Employment and Learning to table the  issue at the ministerial subcommittee on children. I also support Mr Ross&rsquo;s  comments about the importance of including young people with disabilities in  mainstream education.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I support the  amendment. I hope that all Departments get involved and that we receive  a report on this as soon as possible.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I support the motion and the amendment.  This issue has come to my attention through my constituency office and  the people with whom I have engaged, as is the case, I am sure, with other  Members. There are many levels of disability, ranging from one scale to another, and the broad spectrum makes it difficult to cater to all. I understand that.  However, that is no excuse for a  system that appears to be failing some of  those who need the most help to reach their potential.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members are not alone  in that concern. The Education and Training Inspectorate report of  2003-04 published the results of a survey carried out over five further  education college campuses. It found that there was a marked improvement in the  provision of education for students with learning difficulties and  disabilities. However, three of those five colleges were concerned that the  demand for community classes was greater than their ability to supply. The  colleges were also concerned that there were no suitable accreditation and  progression routes for students with severe learning disabilities.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is not just the public&rsquo;s concerns that are being aired  by its representatives in the Chamber today  &mdash; the colleges are acknowledging that something must be done to help  students, because there is a gap in the provision. That is why the motion and  the amendment are before the House.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Education and Training Inspectorate report also stated  that colleges considered that there was a limited availability of courses with  appropriate and nationally recognised accreditation for students with more  severe learning disabilities. The need is outlined in the report, and it is  based on the opinions of the colleges. The Minister must acknowledge that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am aware that the Minister for Employment and Learning  has set aside a further &pound;1&middot;5 million to further entice colleges to cater for  more students with learning difficulties  and/or disabilities. This is good and necessary.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, it does not go far enough. Much of the funding is  for support and not for the establishment of courses that would improve the  lives of young people with disabilities. It would be prudent to set aside a  dedicated fund to ensure that colleges can offer a full prospectus to students  with disabilities rather than a couple of courses of little practical help.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although funding is crucial, a strategy must be devised to  train teachers and to ensure that resources are used for the benefit of  students. Statistics released by the National Bureau for Students with  Disabilities show that about 100 young people with disabilities and/or learning  difficulties leave special schools in Northern Ireland each year. About  20% of those are classed as having complex and multiple disabilities, and for  those young people, there is often no option other than day-care provision.  There are few opportunities and too few support systems to enable them to enter  further education.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The &pound;1&middot;5 million additional funding should be distributed  equally across all colleges. However, the South Eastern   Regional College,  which is represented in Strangford, includes  the former North Down, Lisburn and East Down campuses, and yet its share  of the pot is only &pound;138,861 &mdash; less than one  tenth of what it should be. How can the South Eastern   Regional College  provide education for those young people when the budget is too small for  practical support, never mind the administration of courses?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I visited the South   Eastern Regional   College campus in  Newtownards last week and met some of the people who participated in the excellent Prince&rsquo;s Trust scheme, in  which colleges should increase participation. Those people are educationally  disadvantaged and, as elected representatives, we must ensure that they have  the opportunity to get a foot on the ladder, find work, have ambition and move  forward.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I know a 16-year-old girl with slight Down&rsquo;s syndrome  problems, yet no provision is made for people with that disability who want to  stay at school and learn.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is difficult for any child to make his or her way in the  world and find success and happiness, but that task is much more difficult when  no provision addresses the needs of those with disabilities, despite their  needing extra help. I implore the Minister to devise a dedicated strategy to  address the issues raised by Members and to begin a process that will change  the future for many vulnerable people in the Province. I support the motion and  the amendment.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  It is difficult, at this late stage in the debate, to raise an issue that has  not already been mentioned; nevertheless, I welcome the opportunity to speak in  the debate. I share the concern that young people with physical or learning  disabilities do not benefit from further educational opportunities, and I share my colleague&rsquo;s concern that the available  funding does not appear to be spread equally across the boards,  particularly for the South   Eastern Regional   College in the heart of  our constituency. Will the Minister clarify why there appears to be an  inequality in funding prospects for constituents in Strangford? Of course, I  realise that this is a cross-cutting issue that involves the Department of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety as well as the Department for  Employment and Learning.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Strangford has a high rate of young people with special  needs, and I would like to pay tribute to a charity-based project at Daisies  Caf&eacute; in Ards Community Hospital,  which trains young people with learning disabilities, particularly Down&rsquo;s  syndrome.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is an absolute delight to see those young people feeling  valued and looking forward to going to work, and to see the buzz that they get  from feeling that they are in control. Even  if they are only cleaning tables, they can  feel that they have some value and some contribution to make to society.  Anyone who wants a very good lunch with good-quality food at a very good price  should go there.</p>

	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I ate all their meringue pie. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  It is a killer, but it is lovely. The food is excellent, and I pay tribute to  those who are involved in that wonderful work. However, it should not always be  down to the voluntary sector alone. Everyone has a part to play.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The challenges faced by an individual should not spell the end of his or her further education or a  promising career. As local representatives, we cannot stand by and let  any sort of discrimination occur. Thankfully, much has been done to provide  more opportunities for young people with disabilities. DEL has played an important role, and I do  not wish to take away from that; however, we must encourage the Minister to  have more input into funding.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is always easy to blame the lack of funding, and other  options could be considered. Although it is important to secure funding to  provide long-term resources, equipment and  qualified teaching staff, other options must be made available to  further education colleges. For example, colleges should co-operate and  collaborate, share best practice and offer teacher training. Nevertheless, it  is important that not all of the emphasis is put on the colleges alone to come  up with all of the answers. They, too, need our support.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Students with learning or physical disabilities should be  encouraged, without differentiation from their peers, to pursue their further  education and career plans. First, however, the colleges must be prepared for  the intake of students with particular needs. Extra staff and resources must be accounted for so that the  demand for classes is met in colleges that are accessible to young  adults with disabilities.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The transfer to further education should be made as fluid  as possible, with the appropriate carers advice having been offered alongside a broad range of suitable courses.  Work experience and placement should also be considered as viable options, and,  where possible, young people with disabilities should be afforded exactly the same opportunities as their peers.  They should be able to enjoy learning in the same mixed classes.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">More can always be done to ensure, first, that further  education is marketed effectively, regardless of the student&rsquo;s individual  needs.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member&rsquo;s time is almost up.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  Secondly, applications for places on courses must be considered without bias or  discrimination.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning (Sir Reg Empey)</strong>: It is in debates such as this that  the Assembly is at its best, Mr Speaker. Although we have already discussed  this subject in the past six months, the fact that it is on the agenda again so  soon indicates the clear commitment and concern of many Members from all sides  of the House. I welcome the opportunity to speak on these issues, and I will  address as many of them as I can in the time available.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I assure the House that my Department is committed to the provision of educational training and  employment opportunities for all disabled young people and adults. It  is, however, important to note that further education is only one of a number  of options for young people with disabilities and/or learning difficulties. In  addition to further education courses, training places are provided under my  Department&rsquo;s Training for Success programme. Furthermore, the Department&rsquo;s  disability advisory service provides a range of vocational and pre-vocational  programmes to meet needs of disabled people whatever their age.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The motion refers to:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;the lack of further education courses specifically  targeted at young people with learning and physical disabilities&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">In the academic year 2006-07, some 16,856 students  who enrolled in further education colleges declared a disability. That  represents 8&middot;2% of total further education college enrolments; the Member for  West Belfast Mr Butler raised the issue of the percentages. That is an increase  from 2005-06, when the percentage was 6&middot;6%, and from 2004-05, when it was 5&middot;9%.  Clearly, it is a growing issue. I suspect that more people are declaring that  they have a disability, which covers all sorts of difficulties, including  dyslexia.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, colleges are obliged to have regard to the  needs of students who are over the compulsory school age and who have learning  difficulties. All colleges offer discrete provision for students who cannot  access mainstream courses. Through the college development plan process,  colleges regularly examine and improve the  provision for students with special needs.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Over the next year, the Department will work with colleges  to introduce an individual learner programme for every young person entering  further education. It will be a personalised programme of learning, which will  be agreed with every young person, and it will take account of their  aspirations and potential. It will be  particularly valuable to young people with disabilities and learning  difficulties.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">To support the enrolment of students with learning difficulties  and/or disabilities, the Department provides funding  through the further education funding mechanism. It ensures that  colleges can meet the costs of students with a disability who may require  specific help or assistance. As part of the Further Education Means Business  review of funding, the Department, after consultation with the sector, has  agreed to ring-fence funds to ensure the continued provision of discrete  courses for students with learning disabilities. Some &pound;1&middot;5 million has been set  aside for that purpose for the current  academic year. An additional support fund is also available, and that  will provide &pound;1&middot;5 million this year.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The motion refers to the lack of provision for young people  over the age of 19, and there is a particular concern about that. Members on  all sides raised that issue, so I will come back to it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Further education colleges cannot always provide the  attention, nursing or other personal care that some young people with disabilities require. However, colleges fully  collaborate with Health Service day centres to provide training and development  opportunities for people over 19 years of age who have left special schools or  who might benefit from targeted further educational provision in a suitable  setting.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In 2006-07, some 1,338 students between the ages of 19 and  25 who have learning difficulties and/or disabilities enrolled in further  education colleges. It is important to concentrate on some of the specific  points that were made, because it is obvious that many people are concerned.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">During a debate in October 2007, I indicated that the  Department was going to conduct a review, and Mr Attwood was keen to know the  timeline for it. We will go through that stage by stage. We engaged with the  Education and Training Inspectorate and invited it to carry out a review, which  has already taken place. In the past few weeks, the inspectorate presented an  early draft to the Department, and we are now going through it. We are also  engaging with the Association of Northern Ireland Colleges.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The final phase of the  review will involve engagement with third parties &mdash; that is, the  community and voluntary sector, many of whom have already engaged. The review  will be completed by June. I wish to make the timescale absolutely clear &mdash; it  is not open-ended. We are now in the final phase of the review, which involves  engagement with third parties. We did not employ outside consultants to conduct  the review; it was carried out internally. Having said that, I think that there  is much expertise in the Chamber, on the Committee, in the Department for  Employment and Learning and other  Departments, and if outside consultants had conducted the review, it  would probably have taken even longer.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We all know our own local areas as well as anybody else,  and we all know the experiences of individual constituents who bring their  cases to us. I see no reason why we cannot carry out some of those tasks  ourselves. I am confident that the Education and Training Inspectorate is  highly regarded throughout the public service, and I have no doubt that Members  will, when they are acquainted with the detail of the issue, be at least able  to make their own judgements.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Something that is worrying many people is the interface  between those students who have significant learning disabilities and the  statutory sector, that is, further education institutions or DHSSPS-run  day-centres. In proposing the motion, Mrs O&rsquo;Neill asked whether it was  appropriate for people of different ages to be grouped together, because young  people were mixing with people suffering from dementia and other difficulties.  She used a phrase that caught me when she said that such young people were:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;old and withdrawn before their time.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">We can all understand that. The further education  sector is urged, and, indeed legally required, by the Department to provide  facilities for people with physical difficulties. That requirement is laid down  in the Special Educational Needs and  Disability (Northern Ireland) Order 2005 &mdash; the SENDO legislation &mdash; which has  been mentioned. Something between &pound;16 million and &pound;18 million has been  spent on that provision in recent years, and more is available.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">At that interface stage each student has to be assessed individually;  one cannot paint on a broad canvas. Each individual has their own requirements,  and two are rarely the same. I understand fully that it is difficult to put a  young person in a day centre with a group of older clients, many of whom may be  suffering from dementia and other problems. However, people need to understand  that it is not always possible for a further education college to cope with a  young person who perhaps requires significant nursing facilities all day.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We face a dilemma. It is not a pass-the-parcel situation,  because the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety is aware of  that transitional issue; indeed, I have spoken to the Minister about it. The  fact is that individual students have such needs and face such barriers to  learning that in some cases the only thing a college may be able to do is  provide some form of intellectual stimulation. Some students perhaps have needs  that are so profound that a further education college setting is not always the  most appropriate solution for them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Given that, I think that my Department and the Department  of Health, Social Services and Public Safety have to examine that particular  issue. That interface is the one matter that is causing a great deal of concern  and, in some cases, distress to different families who are desperately anxious  to ensure that the young person involved is given every possible hope of  learning and of being able to have a life as best as can be arranged, given  their particular learning difficulties.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, my Department is conscious that we should not  get into a situation of claiming that the problem is for another Department and  not ours. It is a collective responsibility for everybody and for the Assembly;  otherwise, there is no point in having an Assembly. If we cannot discuss those  issues and do something about them to make a difference, we would all be better  out of here. I make the point clearly that we take the issue seriously, but I  must say that it is a huge matter. We can push the statutory sector as far as we can where further education colleges are  concerned. We do that already, and we have put a lot of money into  dealing with the issue. All the funds that I have considered are increasing in  every single category. For example, we have already discussed the additional  support fund of &pound;1&middot;5 million and the discrete provision of &pound;1&middot;5 million.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">For 2007-08, we have a further support fund of &pound;2&middot;8  million, which will enable colleges to help students to participate in further  education. The fact that colleges may be inhibited by financial considerations  has not been mentioned in the debate.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">5.15 pm.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Since April 2001, DEL  has spent &pound;18 million on capital funding; and, in the four years from 2003-04  to 2006-07, a further &pound;16&middot;7 million has been allocated to further education  colleges so that that they can provide additional auxiliary aids and services  for students with disabilities. Money is going into the system, but, sometimes,  problems are above and beyond money.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Parents &mdash; many of whom are in deep distress &mdash; have written,  lobbied and spoken to Members, and we all want to offer solutions; however, all  I can say is that the review is being completed as quickly as possible, and its  findings will be available by June 2008. The Assembly and the Committee will  then be able to progress to the decision stage. The problem is not just a  matter of money, and I get no sense from the Department that there is a  shortage of money; the problem is in knowing exactly what to do.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Shannon and Mrs Robinson asked about funding for the South Eastern   Regional College.  Unfortunately, I cannot answer their questions &mdash; I do not know why the division  is as it is &mdash; but I will deal with those points  by writing to them. Nevertheless, the Department is concerned to ensure that it does everything in its power.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Ross and Mr Attwood raised the matter of Ulster  Supported Employment Ltd, which I have supported. I wrote to the Minister of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment, Mr Dodds, and I await a reply in order to  ascertain how we can deal with that matter.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Earlier, Mr Spratt mentioned the percentage of disabled students who are in further education;  however, the figure is higher than he realises.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We must progress together on this subject. We have a  background of divisions about a range of issues, but this is an area in which  we can show the community real leadership. We have the ability to do something  about the problem; but, inevitably, there are some difficult cases, and the  only way to tackle them is through individual, personal assessments.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I do not dispute that there are instances in which young  people have been unable to arrange off-campus teaching at a third-party  location, such as a day centre. However, such arrangements can be provided and  would at least provide those young people with an opportunity for specific  teaching, which would allow them some separation from those who are suffering  from other concerns. That is possible: it happens, and colleges are prepared to  help teachers with their training, which can be done off-site.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I assure Members that the Department will pursue the  inquiry and the review as quickly as possible, and I will report back in due  course.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McClarty</strong>:  I thank all Members who took part in the  debate, and I thank the Minister for his encouraging response. I echo Mr  Spratt&rsquo;s appeal that there should not be division on this issue. Whether  Members spoke about the motion or the  amendment, we are all working towards the same goal.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">People with learning or physical disabilities face many  difficulties in today&rsquo;s society, and we should not underestimate the hurdles  that they and their families face. Although I again thank the Members who took  part in the debate, I share the concerns expressed by my colleague who proposed  the amendment. As always, more can, and should, be done. Statistics show that  throughout the UK  there are a significant number of disabled young people who are neither in  full-time employment nor in further education.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, there appears to be something slightly dubious  about the motion. At the moment, the situation is improving with regard to the  provision of access to further education for young people with disabilities and  helping young people with disabilities into employment. On top of that, the  Minister is clearly committed to achieving better outcomes for those young  people. The Minister has undertaken a review into his Department&rsquo;s provision of  further education opportunities for people with special needs in co-operation  with the Association of Northern Ireland Colleges and the Education and  Training Inspectorate. I agree with my colleague that it may have been better  to wait until that report had been published before tabling the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Ulster Unionist Party is by no means opposed to the  principle of the original motion, but I am concerned that the pre-empting of  any departmental report with critical motions could set a dangerous precedent in the Assembly. When the review is  published, we will be in a position to scrutinise its findings and to make recommendations and suggestions to the  Minister. As the Minister outlined in  his response, the Department for Employment and Learning has already  taken numerous steps in the right direction  towards improving the services and opportunities that are available to young people with disabilities, both in further  education and in helping them to gain access to employment  opportunities.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I particularly welcome the news that, in recent years,  there has been increased funding to support young people with special needs who  go through further education, and I hope that the Minister will pursue  additional funds for that in the future. The figures showing an increase of  8&middot;2% in total enrolment highlight that the extra money and support is beginning  to work. I hope that the ongoing review will ensure further improvements in  that provision.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am also encouraged by the services that the Department  currently provides to help young people with special needs to get into  employment. The work of the Disablement Advisory Service should be commended,  and I welcome the role of Training for Success, because it provides flexible  training to facilitate personal and social needs, as well as providing  essential skills training.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In tabling our amendment, the Ulster Unionist Party is not  suggesting that the Minister should not be held to account. The Assembly should  drive him to achieve the best possible  outcomes. However, we are concerned that a dangerous precedent is being  set in the House &mdash; of picking fights where there is no fight to be had. There  is also a danger of dividing the Assembly, even though it is evident that all  parties, and the Minister, seek the same outcome. As my colleague Basil McCrea  has suggested, there are plenty of examples of intransigence in this Executive,  but I do not believe that, with regard to this issue, the Minister is guilty of  that. Instead of seeking confrontation, we should be seeking collective  results. Of course we should scrutinise the Minister&rsquo;s work and make recommend&shy;ations,  and the publication of the Department&rsquo;s review will provide a basis for doing  exactly that. I urge all Members to support the amendment.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I thank the Members who took part in  the debate and I also thank the Minister for attending. I am happy to wind up  the debate on behalf of my party, because the motion &mdash; in my view, and as  others have stated &mdash; is a worthy one, which  recognises the inequality in further  education provision and supported-employment opportunities.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As the Member who proposed the motion stated earlier, I  brought a similar motion to the Assembly six months ago that raised issues,  concerns and stories that were similar to those that have been highlighted by  the majority of Members who spoke in today&rsquo;s debate. During that previous  debate, the Ulster Unionist Party tabled an amendment calling for a review of  services. I accepted that amendment because I did not want to divide the  Assembly on such an important issue, and I wanted to give the Minister the  opportunity &mdash; and the Department time &mdash; to make a difference on this important  issue.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">At that time, the  Minister told us that the Department agreed  to ring-fence funds as part of the Further Education Means Business  review of funding. We welcome that, because we have been fighting for a long  time for funds to be ring-fenced, to ensure that those funds benefit the most  vulnerable people in our society.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, in correspondence with Sinn F&eacute;in, a Mencap  representative said that the Further Education Means Business strategy:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;does not recognise the need to develop targeted initiatives  to address the exclusion and disadvantage experienced by people with a learning  disability when accessing FE provision. The priorities set by the government in  the Programme for Government and the criteria in place to provide financial  assistance for students can disadvantage young people with a learning  disability.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The Mencap representative went on to highlight  other issues, including the:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;failure, at strategic and operational levels, to take  account of the distinct needs and interests of young people with a learning  disability.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">David McClarty said  that there was something &ldquo;dubious&rdquo; about the motion. The motion was  tabled for one purpose only, which was to scrutinise the Minister and the  Department. As an MLA, that is my job. Most Members who contributed to the  debate, with the exception of those from the Ulster Unionist Party, welcomed  the fact that the motion was brought to the House. Six months have passed since  the issue was discussed, and I am glad that  the Minister has been given the opportunity to outline what stage the  review is at.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">During the debate on the motion on 16 October 2007, the  Minister told us that:</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;The Department, in co-operation with the&hellip;Colleges, is  currently undertaking a review of the nature and extent of special-needs  provision throughout the further education network to determine how provision  might best be improved&rdquo;. <span class="B3BodyTextItalicChar">&mdash; <span class="Italic">[Official Report,  Vol 24, No 8, p381, col 2].</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister highlighted that again today. There is a  concern about the issue of colleges deciding on the courses that they offer.  The Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for Employment and Learning, Jimmy  Spratt, outlined some of those concerns, and I will not go over all of them  again. Given the recent mergers, industrial disputes and the issue of early  retirement, one of the main concerns is whether the colleges are up to the  challenge of delivering such important courses to young people with disabilities.  We are entitled to ask questions about such issues, and we are entitled to get  answers to those questions.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">When proposing the amendment, my colleague from the  Committee for Employment and Learning Basil McCrea  informed us that the Minister is fully committed to addressing this  issue. I have no problem in accepting that; I know that the Minister is  committed to many issues. However, it is six months since the issue was last  debated, it affects vulnerable people in our society, and we have a duty to  send them and their families the clear message that we are trying to make a  difference.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Basil went on to tell us that there are ways of addressing  the issue without bringing it to the Floor of the House, and he appealed to us  not to turn the issue into a political football, which is fair enough. Had  there been any progress on the issue, we would not have felt the need to bring  it back to the Floor of the House. Basil&rsquo;s party leader commended us for doing  so; therefore, I think that Basil has an issue. The purpose of the Assembly is  to enable us to table motions in the Chamber. We have a duty to debate issues  that affect our community. Basil, being Basil, tabled a motion about the  classroom assistants&rsquo; dispute. Was he simply point-scoring on that issue? It is  a case of swings and roundabouts.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Research undertaken by Barnardo&rsquo;s in 2007 with the further  education colleges, training providers and disabled young people found that  disadvantage and discrimination was multilayered, as was mentioned during  various contributions. Mary Bradley said that this is a cross-departmental  issue. I do not dispute that, but the Department for Employment and Learning  has a duty to take the lead. If that results in the Minister for Employment and Learning encouraging the  involvement of other Departments on the issue, it is up to us to support  him.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Some of the young people who were surveyed by Barnardo&rsquo;s  indicated that, at age 20, they found themselves spending their time in a day  centre, even though they would have been capable of attending further education  colleges. Others simply found themselves sitting at home all day. A number of  young people described the experience as feeling as though they had been left  in a corner and ignored. We cannot get away from the fact that that is what the  young people are telling us.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As I said earlier, the Deputy Chairperson of the Committee  for Employment and Learning outlined some of the key issues facing young people  with disabilities, and he called on the Department to act. I support that call.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I agree with Alex Attwood &mdash; I am sorry that he is not in  the Chamber as it is not that often that we agree on anything &mdash; that the  Assembly should be seen to be making a difference to people&rsquo;s lives, especially  the most vulnerable in our community.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I will touch on some of the issues that the Minister  mentioned. It is important that he took the opportunity to outline to us what  stage the review has reached, and he said that it will be completed by June,  which leads me to ask some other questions. I am conscious that I will not be  provided with the answers today, but I would appreciate it if the Minister  could provide the answers at some point.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">5.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I look forward to the outcome of that review. I ask the  Minister whether there is an associated action plan that will be implemented in  the aftermath. Will he indicate a time frame for the review&rsquo;s completion?  Perhaps June would be a good time, since it is before the September intake of  some of colleges.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister give me a list of the community and  voluntary groups that provide such training and employment and outline their involvement in the review?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am not being critical. However, it is important that  Members have an idea of the nature of community and voluntary sector  involvement.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Sir Reg Empey</strong>:  I assure the Member on both those issues. There would be little point in having  a review if there was no plan to follow it up. That is unless, of course, the  review found everything to be perfect &mdash; which I am sure it will not.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The community groups will be dealt with in the third phase  of the review. We are happy to identify those groups &mdash; some of which are  already engaged &mdash; to the Member. Indeed, we are happy to talk to any group that  can bring some value to the table. I will provide the Member and the Committee with  details of the groups that we will engage with.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  I thank the Minister. It is important that  we get as much information as possible. All Members who spoke recognised &mdash; and indeed expressed  concern about &mdash; the lack of provision. That is not necessarily a  criticism of the Minister, but it is a genuine concern that must be addressed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In order not to divide the House on such an important issue  &mdash; and having heard the Minister&rsquo;s speech and the assurances that he has just  given me &mdash; Sinn F&eacute;in accepts the amendment. We do so with the caveat &mdash; and this  is not a threat &mdash; that our party will monitor the Department and the Minister  to ensure that we get the outcomes that we have been promised; I am sure other  Members will do the same.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  We will be back.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  Yes, we will be back. Hasta la vista.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Our disabled young people deserve no less. I support the  amendment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question, That the amendment be made, put and agreed to.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Main question, as amended, put and agreed to.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly expresses its continued commitment to  securing training and employment opportunities where appropriate for young  people with disabilities; and awaits the outcome of the review of such  provision undertaken by the Minister for Employment and Learning.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Adjourned at 5.32 pm.</p>
