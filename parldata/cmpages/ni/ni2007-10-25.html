	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The Assembly met at 10.30 am (Mr Speaker in the  Chair).</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Members observed two minutes&rsquo; silence.</p>
	      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="1"></a>Executive Business</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Draft Programme for Government and Investment Strategy  for Northern Ireland</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I remind Members that the first three items of business this morning are  statements and will follow the normal format. Therefore, after each statement  is made, Members will have the opportunity to ask questions of the relevant  Minister.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have received notice from the Office of the First  Minister and deputy First Minister that they wish to make a statement on the  draft Programme for Government and investment strategy for Northern Ireland.  Before I call Dr Paisley, I remind Members that the First Minister will deliver  the first half of the statement and the deputy First Minister the second half.  They will then answer questions alternately, with the First Minister answering  the first question.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister (Rev Dr Ian Paisley)</strong>: This is another momentous day for the  Executive. The deputy First Minister and I are today announcing the Executive&rsquo;s  first draft Programme for Government and draft investment strategy. Immediately  after this statement, the Minister of Finance and Personnel will <span style="letter-spacing:-.05pt; ">announce the Executive&rsquo;s draft Budget to the  Assembly.</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is worth pausing for  a moment to remind ourselves <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt; ">of the  sea change that has taken place since 8 May 2007.</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Government of Northern Ireland are now in the  hands of local politicians. Those politicians were elected by the people here  to be their representatives; they were born and bred here, and they know and  under&shy;stand the concerns of our people. They have a long-term interest in the  Province and its people &mdash; our constituents. Our destiny is now in our own  hands. We have a tremendous opportunity to shape our future, and we are determined to seize that chance with  both hands.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, we cannot fulfil our potential without engaging  with all the people of Northern    Ireland. We want to work with the business  people who generate wealth and who want to provide more highly skilled and  better-paid jobs. We must engage with the young people who are looking for jobs  and homes and a stake in a better future. We must consider the young parents  hoping for a better future for their children, just as they should. What parent  does not have high hopes for his or her children? We must engage with older  people, to whom we owe so much and who often suffer in their retirement as a  result of ill health and poverty. We want to bring comfort and security to them  &mdash; that is the only decent way for people who are in their twilight years to  live. Farming families are important: they struggle with falling incomes and  rising costs. We are all conscious of the difficulties that the farming  community faces. We must also acknow&shy;ledge the newcomers to our Province and  the growing ethnic minority communities who are already making a positive  contribution to our economy and who are full of hope for the future. However,  let us not forget the victims in our community who have suffered &mdash; and who are still suffering &mdash; as a result of the  legacy of the past. They, too, need to be engaged with and cared for.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As an Executive, we are determined to make a difference by  building a better future for all, and we will focus our energies on achieving  that. We shall not be satisfied unless we produce results that far supersede  all that has happened over recent decades in Northern Ireland. We want to  deliver those results through our Programme for Government and our investment strategy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive agreed a draft Programme for Government and a  draft investment strategy for Northern    Ireland on 23 October. Later this morning,  the Minister of Finance and Personnel will reveal the draft Budget, which was  agreed at the same Executive meeting. This process marks a significant  milestone for the Government of Northern Ireland. We are now laying the draft  Programme for Government and the draft investment strategy before the Assembly  for scrutiny and future approval once the Assembly Committees have examined  them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Through the launch of those documents, we are announcing  the start of a consultation process that will last until 4 January 2008. It is  fewer than six months since 8 May 2007, when devolution was restored. On that  day I said:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Today, at long last, we are starting upon the road &mdash;  I emphasise starting &mdash; which I believe will take us to lasting peace in our  Province.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">At the time, we recognised that it would be a long  and sometimes difficult journey, and one on which we must not falter if we are  to build a Northern Ireland in which everyone can live in the sort of peaceful  society that we all desire.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In May, many doubted the Executive&rsquo;s ability to work  together and to reach agreement on our priorities, key targets and spending plans for the next three years.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The achievement of the early publication of these three  draft documents &mdash; just over two weeks after the <span style="letter-spacing:-.2pt; ">Chancellor announced the outcome of the comprehensive</span> spending  review and the precise spending allocations for Northern Ireland &mdash; is no mean  achievement. That has required considerable effort on our part, and today&rsquo;s  publication of this suite of documents is clear evidence that this Executive  can and will work together in the interests  of all our people.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I turn to our approach to the Programme for Government. The  publication of these documents together will no doubt emphasise the close  linkages among them. Taken together, they set out the Executive&rsquo;s long-term  vision and direction; they also explain how our priorities and goals will be  resourced and delivered.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The draft Programme for Government represents a very  different approach to that which was adopted by the last Executive. We have  facilitated the creation of a more focused set of priorities and a smaller  number of key goals. The Executive feel that it is important to be clear about  our priorities and what we are trying to achieve.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I commend all Executive Ministers for the committed and  co-operative approach that they have adopted in agreeing our priorities and key  goals. I believe that we have produced a draft Programme for Government that  addresses the real challenges that face Northern Ireland today. We believe  that the Programme for Government offers a clear framework at a strategic level  for us to develop our policies and programmes over the next three years.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although the Programme for Government offers a clear steer,  it is, of course, not set in stone. We will have  the opportunity each year to review the Programme for Government and to  make any changes that we may consider necessary. We hope that any such changes  will be marginal, but that flexibility exists, should we need to deploy it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Programme for Government also indicates our longer-term  aspirations and intentions in some areas. However, the immediate focus relates  to 2008-11, <span style="letter-spacing:-.25pt; ">which are the years that are  covered by the comprehensive</span> spending review. In simple terms, we know  how much we will have to spend over those years, and we can, therefore, set  detailed goals, targets and outcomes for what we intend to achieve over that  period.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As Members will hear later from the Minister of Finance and  Personnel, this has been a difficult budgetary settlement, and hard decisions  have been made. We simply do not have the funding to do all that we would wish  to do.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In developing our draft Programme for Government, we have  also been conscious of the need for the Executive to look outward and to seek  the help of our friends in Europe, the United States, and elsewhere. We  cannot prosper without constructive links outside Northern Ireland. We will be  working to foster and promote our North/South and east-west linkages to take  forward mutually beneficial and practical co-operation with the British and  Irish Governments.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We will continue to work with the European Commission Task  Force that was created by the European President to consider how our region can  participate more effectively in any new initiatives. We are also planning an  investment conference for spring 2008, which will provide an opportunity for us  to position ourselves as a competitive business location for US companies in  information and communication technology, and in the financial and business  services sector. On the wider world stage, we are also looking forward to the  World Expo 2010 &mdash; we will make the most of that opportunity and participate  fully in it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText"><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt; ">The document that we  are publishing today is strategic</span> and  high level. We are also publishing a series of public service agreements  as an annex to the draft Programme for Government, and the deputy First  Minister will say more about that shortly.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">10.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The overarching aim of the Programme for Govern&shy;ment is to  build a peaceful, fair and prosperous society in Northern Ireland, with respect for  the rule of law, and where everyone can enjoy a better quality of life now and  in years to come. The Executive face many challenges  in achieving this overarching aim. Therefore, we have decided to focus  on five key priorities, which are interconnected and cannot be pursued in  isolation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Our approach to delivering our priorities will be  underpinned by two cross-cutting key themes. First, all our policies and programmes  must work towards building a better future; they must demonstrate fairness,  inclusion and equality of opportunity. Secondly, the need to build a  sustainable future will also be a key requirement for our economic, social and  environmental policies and programmes.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Growing a dynamic  economy will be our top priority during the lifetime of this Programme  for Government. Sustainable economic growth and increased prosperity will  provide the opportunities and the means through which we can enhance quality of  life, reduce poverty and disadvantage, increase health and well-being, and  build stronger and more sustainable and empowered communities.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">To underpin our commitment to developing the economy, we  have set ourselves a goal of halving the private-sector productivity gap with  the UK average &mdash; excluding the greater south-east &mdash; by 2015. It is an ambitious  target. However, we believe that we must have high aspirations if we are to  make the kind of progress that we desire to.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As an Executive, we recognise the characteristics of a  successful economy: a highly skilled and flexible workforce; and employment  growth. To that end, we will work to increase the employment rate from 70% to 75% by 2020. We will introduce  measures that are designed to address the structural weakness in our  economy, and that will help to develop a dynamic business culture in Northern Ireland.  We will create an environment that will support 45 new businesses and 600  existing companies to become exporters for the first time by 2011.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We will seek to secure inward investment commit&shy;ments,  promising more than 6,500 new jobs by 2011 and ensuring that at least 75% of  those jobs will provide salaries above the local private-sector average.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We aim to increase the number of tourists visiting Northern Ireland  and by 2011 to increase tourism revenue from &pound;370 million to &pound;520 million each  year.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We want to support business and create a culture in which  enterprise can flourish. We will work with the business sector to deliver widespread access for businesses to  the next-generation broadband network by 2011.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have mentioned the importance of a well-skilled  workforce. We aim to ensure that by 2011, some 70% of school leavers will achieve five or more GCSE passes at  grade A* to C. By 2015, we aim to ensure that 80% of the working-age  population is qualified to at least GCSE level or equivalent. We will increase  the number of adult learners achieving a qualification in literacy, numeracy, and information and communication tech&shy;nology  by 2015. In particular, we will seek to develop the science base that is vital  to the economy. By 2015, we will increase by 25% the numbers of students, especially from disadvantaged communities, at  graduate and postgraduate level, studying science, technology, engineering and mathematics. By 2010, we will  increase the number of PhD research  students at local universities by 300, and we will introduce a new  programme to increase the commercialisation  of university and college research  by the same date.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We will take steps to  address problems of economic inactivity and to promote greater  employment opportunities in rural areas and in disadvantaged communities. We  will invest &pound;45 million by 2013 to improve the competitiveness of the rural  sector.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If we are to create the conditions for economic growth and  deliver real improvements in health and well-being, we must continue to advance  social transformation and the inclusion of all. We want everyone in Northern    Ireland to be given the opportunity to  contribute to and benefit from, a better future. Promoting tolerance, inclusion  and health and well-being is, therefore, our next priority. Too many people,  particularly the most vulnerable, live in communities that continue to  experience high levels of poverty, disadvantage and exclusion. Those communities  face higher levels of poor health and low educational achievement and, as a  result, they fail to enjoy the benefits of progress. Therefore, a key goal for  the Executive will be to reduce child poverty by 50% by 2010, and to eradicate  it by 2020.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">By 2011, some 30% of school leavers who are entitled to  free school meals will obtain five or more GCSE passes at grade A* to C. By  2011, we will increase to 125,000 the number of children and young people who  participate in sport and physical recreation. By  2012, we will reduce by 50% the number of children killed or seriously  injured on our roads.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">At the other end of the age spectrum, I am delighted to  announce, as part of the draft Programme for Government, the extension of free  public transport during 2008 for everyone aged 60 and over.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First Minister</strong>: I must say that I have an interest in  that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We aim to support the most vulnerable, to create strong,  vibrant, sustainable communities and to build community capacity and leadership.  We will continue our efforts to address divisions in our society and to  eradicate sectarianism, racism and intolerance. We will regenerate our urban  and rural areas and will invest over &pound;500 million in regenerating disadvantaged  communities, neighbourhoods, towns and  cities by 2012.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We are also announcing a &pound;10 million package to combat rural social exclusion and poverty. We  will seek to remove the barriers to employment and independent living  for the most vulnerable and disadvantaged. In 2008, we will introduce a new  employment and support allowance to enable those unemployed due to ill-health  or disability to return to work. By 2010, we will also put in place a careers  advice service to meet the needs of people with disabilities.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We will seek to address the health of the population by  reducing treatment times and improving treatment outcomes, as well as taking  steps to improve physical and mental health. We will work towards reducing  mortality from strokes and bowel cancer by 15% by 2013, and by 2009, we will  introduce a screening programme to improve survival rates from bowel cancer. We  will help people with chronic illnesses to live more active lives and will  reduce unplanned hospital admissions for such patients by 50% by 2013.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Our rich and varied natural heritage is a key asset for the  people of Northern Ireland,  and, as our next priority, we will seek to protect and enhance our  environmental and natural resources for future generations. We recognise the  links between a healthy environment, a thriving economy and high quality of  life. Therefore, we are determined to take action to protect our natural and  built heritage.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am sure that many Members will be delighted to learn that  we are now committed to delivering a fundamental overhaul of the planning  system by 2011 to ensure that it supports economic and social development and  environmental sustainability.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive recognise clearly the potential impact of  climate change. We will deliver a new sewer project for central Belfast by 2010. We are  also determined to play our part in protecting the environment by reducing our  carbon footprint by 25% by 2025. We will seek to promote greater use of  renewables by ensuring that 12% of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s electricity is  generated from indigenous renewable sources by 2012. Finally, we will enable up  to 4,700 farmers to comply with the nitrates directive of 2009.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We must also invest to build our infrastructure. Through  making this a priority, we will invest to build a modern, efficient,  twenty-first century infrastructure, which  will help to deliver economic and social develop&shy;ment. This priority  will ensure that businesses can compete more effectively and will help to  attract investment and skilled workers. It promotes inclusion and access to  services, and raises the quality of life for everyone. The deputy First  Minister will say more about this priority in detail when he presents the  investment strategy to the House.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Our final priority is to deliver modern, high-quality and  efficient public services, demonstrating our commitment to world-class public  services that meet the needs of the people of Northern Ireland. We will take  forward key reform programmes in areas such as water, planning, health and  education, and establish a library authority and an education and skills  authority by 2009.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">11.00 am</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">To ensure that we have the most appropriate structures in  place, we will review the overall number of Departments by 2011. We will also modernise the structure and powers of local  government by 2011 and seek to modernise the infrastructure and  processes of the Civil Service. I am pleased to be able to tell the farming  community that we will reduce by 25% the administrative burden on farmers and  agrifood businesses by 2013. Our aim in doing that will be to bring the Government  closer to the people, revitalise public  services and achieve greater efficiencies. We will introduce a single  telephone contact point for public services by 2009 and streamline 70% of  Departments and agency websites by the same date.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The draft Programme for Government represents a blueprint  for Ulster&rsquo;s  future. We are building the foundation for a vibrant and successful future for  the people of Northern    Ireland. The deputy First Minister will continue by outlining the fifth priority and  presenting the draft investment strategy. I strongly commend the draft  Programme for Government to everyone in the House, and I intend to live to see  it through.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister (Mr M McGuinness)</strong>: A Cheann Comhairle, with your permission, I  welcome the presence of a sizeable delegation of Iraqi parlia&shy;mentarians and  politicians to Parliament Buildings. Some of them are in the Gallery listening  to Members&rsquo; deliberations, and I am sure  that I speak for all Members when I say that we wish them well during  their stay.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The First Minister has highlighted the progress that the  Executive have made in agreeing their first draft Programme for Government and  given Members an indication of what we plan to achieve under four of the five  priorities. I want to echo the First Minister&rsquo;s comments about the seismic  shift that we have seen since 8 May. This  place is truly under new management. Who would have believed how far we  have come in so short a time? The draft Programme for Government marks a real  difference from what has gone before. Its presentation  and content are different from that published by the previous Executive.  We have tried to clearly set out the  Executive&rsquo;s key priorities along with the high-level goals that the  Executive are working to achieve.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The First Minister referred to his speech of 8 May.  Similarly, I commented on that day that we would:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;strive towards a society moving from division and  disharmony to one which celebrates our diversity and is determined to provide a  better future for all our people.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Those sentiments are captured and expressed in the  draft Programme for Government. There is much hard work to be done if the  Programme for Government is to be delivered, but its publication after less  than six months in Government shows that we are determined and able to apply  ourselves to that task.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The First Minister mentioned that we are today publishing  for consultation the draft Programme for Government, the draft Budget and the  draft investment strategy. Today&rsquo;s announcement marks the beginning of a  10-week period of consultation that will conclude on 4 January 2008. I know  that many Members would like a longer time for consultation, but it is  important that the Budget in particular be agreed in sufficient time to enable  detailed spending plans to be drawn up and put in place by 1 April. There is,  therefore, an imperative to finalise and agree the documents as early as  possible in January so that the Executive&rsquo;s plans can be put in place and we  can ensure that the business of Government runs smoothly into the next  financial year.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As the First Minister has already explained, the documents  will be subject to revision as necessary as our policies develop and as we  respond to changing needs. However, we must be clear about the goals that we  are working to deliver, agree them and move forward collectively towards their  achievement. The close linkages between the three documents mean that we have  decided to undertake the consultation process in a co-ordinated fashion.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The consultation will be led by the Office of the First  Minister and deputy First Minister, but will also involve the Department of  Finance and Personnel and the Strategic Investment Board (SIB), which will be  responsible for the Budget and the investment strategy respectively.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The documents will need to be agreed by the Assembly in due  course. The Assembly Committees will have an important role to play in putting  forward their views for consideration, and will form an integral part of the  consultation process. We will be asking the OFMDFM Committee to play a  co-ordinating role in liaising with the other Committees and gathering their  views. We will also be seeking a take-note debate in the Assembly at an appropriate point in the consultation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Separately, we will consult key stakeholders and social  partners, as well as members of the public. We look forward to active  engagement with key interest groups throughout the consultation period. Once  the consultation process has concluded and we have had an opportunity to  consider the comments received, we will  present a final Programme for Government, Budget and investment strategy  to the Assembly &mdash; we hope to do that before the end of January.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The First Minister has provided the Assembly with an  indication of some of the contents of the draft Programme for Government, and I  do not intend to repeat what he has said. However, I want to emphasis that  these are the Executive&rsquo;s agreed priorities, and they provide the basis on  which we plan to move forward in the future.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The First Minister has also referred briefly to the draft  public service agreements that we are publishing today as a separate annex.  Those 23 public service agreements, or PSAs, confirm the key actions that the  Executive plan to take in support of our priorities alongside the outcomes and  targets that we are seeking to achieve. Again, they seek only to capture the  high-level targets and key cross-cutting issues and challenges. They will  provide the framework through which the Executive as a whole will monitor  progress, delivery of priorities and key objectives.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I will now provide some detail on the infrastructure  priority, which the First Minister referred to earlier. Investing to build our infrastructure will be an important priority through which we will invest to build a  modern, twenty-first-century infrastructure. All Members of the Assembly  will know of the significant challenges we face in this area: schools that have  gone on beyond their useful life; children who are still being taught in  temporary classrooms or schools in dire need of refurbishment and  modernisation; communities in need of new healthcare facilities; young families  looking for social and affordable housing; a business community that needs  better roads and modern information and communication links; and the legacy of a  long history of neglect and underinvestment in our basic water and sewerage  infrastructure, which we are all living with. All of those issues are  fundamental for the health and well-being of everyone.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members will know that we have inherited those huge challenges  from direct rule. However, an as Executive, we are rising to meet those  challenges. We are grappling with all of  those issues and are determined to address them and to give our people  the modern services and facilities that they need.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We will support infrastructure development, which will,  over time, address the major deficiencies in key areas such as roads, public transport, water and sewerage infrastructure, and social and affordable  housing. We will prioritise more balanced regional development, ensure compliance with EU directives, and address the  backlog of maintenance in the health and education estates.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">This will be delivered through the draft investment  strategy that we are announcing today. The investment strategy will put in  place a modern infrastructure that will provide a platform for us to achieve  our key economic, social and environmental priorities, which will enable  businesses to grow, tackle social and economic inequalities, and improve the  quality of life for everyone.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Recognising that Government procurement can play an active  and effective role in tackling socio-economic disadvantage, we have ensured  that we will seek opportunities to promote social inclusion and equality of  opportunity in the procurement of infrastructure programmes. That will impact  through employment plans, by building opportunities for apprenticeships into  major delivery contracts, and through a tendering process that prioritises the  most economically advantageous option in this context.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Similarly, the quality  of our environment is important, and our investment strategy will ensure  that we protect and enhance it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Those will be important considerations as we invest &pound;5&middot;6  billion into infrastructure over the next three years and at least &pound;18 billion  over the next 10 years. In those first three years, 25% more will be invested  than in the preceding three years, which represents a further step change that  the Executive is leading.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Strategic Investment Board Ltd &mdash; a wholly-owned company of  the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister &mdash; has taken the lead  in working with Departments to prepare the draft investment strategy for the  Executive&rsquo;s consideration. That document was agreed by the Executive at its  meeting on 23 October.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The first three years&rsquo; figures in the strategy are  consistent with those in the Budget, which the Minister of Finance and  Personnel will announce shortly. The figures for later years fall outside the  current Budget period but have been formulated within a financial framework  that has been agreed with the Department of Finance and Personnel.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, in order to provide a comprehensive picture of  anticipated future investment, the investment strategy reflects the impact of  additional sources of funding that lie outside of what is, by convention,  included in the Executive&rsquo;s normal public-expenditure Budget. That is clear in  the published document, and all sources of funding are included in the figures  that I am announcing today.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The draft investment strategy demonstrates our approach to  infrastructure investment and clearly links the major &pound;18 billion programme of  investment to the key priorities that are set out in the draft Programme for  Government. That is a significant funding envelope, which will enable us to  embark on what is, by any standards, an ambitious programme of infrastructure  development.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although &pound;18 billion is a considerable sum of money, it is  not enough to fully meet the needs that we wish to address. The Executive, with  the crucial advice of the Assembly, must come to a view on the optimum  investment package that can be achieved using the available resources. However,  it is also essential for the Executive to explore additional funding sources  that would enable us to deliver a more ambitious programme of capital investment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I cannot do justice to the full scope of what the Executive  are setting out to accomplish for all of our communities through these  investment programmes. Members will carefully study the draft investment  strategy and, through the Committees, will formulate the Assembly&rsquo;s views.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I will mention several areas in more detail to illustrate  how we aim to build a peaceful, fair and prosperous society, beginning with an  overview of how funding will be allocated up to 2018.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We intend to invest &pound;3&middot;8 billion in the strategic road  network and in public transport. Key transport corridors will be upgraded to  connect towns and cities to regional getaways, the Belfast metropolitan area and the Southern  road network. The development of a modern rapid-transport system for greater Belfast will begin, and  rail services will be improved by the introduction of new services and rolling  stock.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We will invest &pound;3  billion in the water, waste water and waste management infrastructures,  which will produce high quality water and waste water systems that will be  capable of meeting EU requirements. We will work in partnership with district  councils so that by 2011 we will deliver a new waste management infrastructure  that will recognise our EU regulatory obligations and make use of more sustainable  technologies.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There will be &pound;3&middot;5 billion invested in schools and youth  services and a further &pound;632 million in further education and libraries. Schools  are at the heart of communities, and our aim is to substantially modernise the  schools&rsquo; estate, enable schools to link better with the further education  sector and allow them to become better aligned with the needs of the population  and the skills that will be required in the future. Between 2008 and 2011, we  will progress major works in more than 100 schools.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The universities will be supported in order to help them  increase their research and teaching capabilities.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Further education colleges will be modernised, with a new  campus for Belfast Metropolitan College  and new accommodation at the North    West Regional College to open by 2010.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">11.15 am</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There will be investment of &pound;3&middot;5 billion in health and  social care. The Executive recognise the increase and changes in the need and  demand for health and social services that we can expect over the next 20  years. Therefore, we will make substantial investments across the key sectors of  primary and community care and acute and local hospitals.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We will develop a regional network of primary- and  community-care facilities to bring services to the heart of the community; an  acute hospital network that can deliver the best health outcomes; local  hospitals that will form a crucial bridge between acute hospitals and primary  and community care.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We plan to designate &pound;1&middot;4 billion for social and affordable  housing, together with more than &pound;600 million for regeneration and &pound;500 million  for culture, arts and sport. High quality and well managed housing is a cornerstone of sustainable communities.  Throughout the lifetime of the investment strategy, we will invest in  socially rented and affordable housing to address the needs of communities across the region. Our programme of  investment in social housing will enable us to work towards our ambitious target of completing up to 10,000 new  social housing units over the next five years.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We will continue with major public-sector-led regeneration  initiatives that will have a positive impact on social and economic issues. We  will also invest in the Ilex regeneration plan for Ebrington and Fort George and in the Crumlin Road jail and Girdwood sites.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Investment in arts and culture infrastructure will enable  us to keep pace with the artistic and cultural expectations of a modern society. We will have invested &pound;100  million in our sports facilities by 2011, thereby ensuring a lasting legacy  from the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We are also supporting the potential of our inland  waterways, where development is an area of practical North/South co-operation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although that represents a significant and ambitious  programme of investment by any standards, it still does not represent adequate  resources to meet all needs. Therefore, we have decided to create a capital  realisation task force. The first stage of the task force&rsquo;s work will be  complete in December 2007, when it will report on immediate additional  disposals that could impact on the capital affordability envelope for the CSR  years by increasing the available resources.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We hope that the task force&rsquo;s recommendations can be taken  into account when finalising the investment strategy in January 2008. The  Executive have agreed that social housing and schools will be priority areas  for consideration, if additional funds are identified as part of that work.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As I explained, the documents published today will be  subject to consultation before being finalised in the new year. I ask all those  who read the draft Programme for Government and the draft investment strategy  to look for the positives in them; to set aside narrow sectional interests and  naysaying; to pursue the general good, to understand the difficult choices that  we have had to make about priorities; to be optimistic and enthusiastic about  the future, and to join us in this great enterprise of shaping our future. In  short, I ask everyone to bend their energies to helping us to build the better  future that we all want.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive consider that our approach and plans mark a  radical change from direct rule and from the previous Executive. The style of  our plans is very different; we have adopted a more strategic and  outcome-focused approach. We have also adopted a more integrated and  complementary approach with the Programme for Government at its centre.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the documents, readers will find more details of our  goals, targets and spending plans than we have been able to cover today, and  which will demonstrate the course that we  are on. The plans provide a framework within which we will work. The  Executive must lead the development of our policies and the delivery of our  plans, so that we can demonstrate in practice the difference that we can make.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A Cheann Comhairle, the First Minister acknow&shy;ledged that  we cannot fulfil our potential without engaging all of the people.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to reinforce that point.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We must strive to  connect with all people, particularly those members of society who are  marginalised and disadvantaged and those who are new members of society. It is absolutely right that Government  should be close to the people and  should operate in their interests.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We want to make a positive difference in people&rsquo;s lives,  and we want to make a difference for everyone. As an Executive, we are  committed to the promotion of inclusion and a shared future built on equality  and respect for diversity, in which sectarianism, racism and other forms of  intolerance are a thing of the past. We want people to feel confident and  secure in their identity and in their place in society. We must build a future  in which people are cherished for their rich diversity and many talents, and in  which we all share in economic growth and prosperity. We want a future that is  fit for our children and our children&rsquo;s children. We believe that, by working  together, and harnessing the talents of all sectors &mdash; public, private,  voluntary and community &mdash; we can build a better future for all.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Those are the challenges that we have set ourselves, and  those are our commitments to those who elected us to represent them. We are  determined to fulfil those commitments. We owe nothing less to the people who  elected us to this House.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>: On  a point of order, Mr Speaker. The Programme for Government has just been  introduced to Members, and questions are about to be taken on it. However, a  significant number of pages appear to be missing from the documents that have  been circulated. The documents are exceptionally thin, and those sections to  which the First Minister and the deputy First Minister referred in respect of a  shared future and good relations appear to be absent &mdash; certainly from the copy  that I have. Is there a chance that those pages have been left at the printers,  and will it be possible to have them circulated later?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I understand the point that Mrs Long is making. However, that is certainly not  an appropriate point of order.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Before I call the Chairperson of the Committee for the Office of the First Minister and deputy First  Minister, I inform Members that more than 40 Members wish to ask  questions. That is understandable, considering the business of the House this  morning. I remind Members that if their questions are short, that will enable  their colleagues to also ask questions.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">The Chairperson of the Committee for the Office of the  First Minister and deputy First Minister (Mr <strong>Kennedy)</strong>: That is timely advice, Mr Speaker. As Chairperson of the  Committee for the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister, I  welcome the publication, for consultation, of the draft Programme for  Government 2008-11, and the draft investment strategy. I also welcome the clear  indication of the First Minister, confirming the status of the document &mdash; that  it is a draft Programme of Government, for consultation, which may be subject  to change.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Given the importance of the proposals, I have some concern  that, taking into account the Christmas holidays, the consultation period will  effectively last for a shorter period than normal. It is a pity that the  proposals could not have been published earlier to ensure that there is a full  12-week consultation period.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I inform the First Minister and the deputy First Minister  that, yesterday, my Committee &mdash; in the historic location of Magee College,  Londonderry &mdash; received an informative and  thought-provoking presentation from representatives of Save the Children on the  level of child poverty. That presentation was part of the Committee&rsquo;s inquiry  into that matter.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the commitment in the Programme for Government  that it will be a priority of the Executive to tackle the levels of poverty in Northern Ireland  in general, and, in particular, the intention to halve child poverty by 2010,  and end it by 2020. What are the specific actions that have been included in  the draft Programme for Government to achieve those aims?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In respect of the  co-ordinating role of my Committee, which  was outlined by the First Minister and the deputy First Minister, I can  advise the House that early indications suggest that my Committee will welcome  the opportunity to fulfil that role and work with other Committees.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I ask the Member to take his seat. I know  that he is speaking as Chairperson of a Committee, and I have always said that I will try to give  Chairpersons some latitude. However,  this morning, as is appropriate, other Members wish to speak in their  capacity as Committee Chairpersons. Therefore, I ask them to be as brief as  other Members in asking their questions.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  Given the criticisms of the first investment strategy, will the First Minister  and deputy First Minister indicate how the fundamental issues that are  connected to the ability of the public sector to deliver the proposed  investment strategy in full have been  addressed? Full delivery of the strategy is essential in order to  prevent the year-on-year high levels of capital underspend that have been a  regular feature.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Speaking not in my  capacity as a Committee Chairman but  as a Member, I ask the First Minister and the deputy First Minister to  describe the progress that has been made in securing an adequate financial deal  from the Treasury for Northern Ireland.  Both parties have placed importance on such a deal being a prerequisite  for the re-establishment of devolution in Northern Ireland. Bearing in mind  that the people were promised the mother and father of a financial deal to go  with the mother and father of a political  deal, when can Members expect to receive details of the package?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First Minister</strong>: I am surprised that the honourable gentleman  thinks that a 10-week consultation period is not long enough. The Executive has  to make a move. With every week that passes, poverty and difficulties in the  Health Service remain. The time has come for us to put on our running shoes.  The Assembly has been criticised for doing  nothing: now we are being criticised for  moving too fast. As far as I am concerned, we could not move fast enough  on those issues.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Does the Member not have any words of comfort for people?  We have said that we will overhaul the planning system fundamentally. What does  he have to say about that? He has forgotten about it. From today, all  large-scale investment planning proposals will be decided within six months,  provided that a pre-application consultation has taken place. The Member does  not have any words of comfort about that. He has forgotten all about the poor  old people such as me who want a free bus ride, and he has forgotten all about  the rapid transit system and many other  things that we have mentioned. Does he not have any words of comfort at  all, or is he here just to make a cheap political point?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McQuillan</strong>:  What priority will the Executive give to inward investment?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: Securing high-value inward investment is a key objective for the  Executive. The draft Programme for Government includes the key goal of securing  commitments on inward investment, promising over 6,500 new jobs by 2011. We  want at least 75% of those jobs to provide salaries that are higher than the  local private-sector average.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Given the events of the past six months, it is clear that  there is tremendous international interest in the political developments that  have occurred here. Many Ministers have already visited the United States,  particularly during the Smithsonian festival. It was obvious from that visit,  and from all the visits that have taken place, that the Irish-American,  Scots-Irish and Ulster-Scots business  communities are phenomenally interested in everything that happens here.  We hope that the build-up has commenced to what will probably be the most  important economic investment conference that has ever been seen in the North,  which will take place in May next year. We  hope that further delegations will arrive to tee up the agenda for that  conference to ensure that it will produce results and real jobs &mdash; particularly  for young people &mdash; rather than aspirations or fine words.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">11.30 am</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I welcome the statement from OFMDFM  and the publication of the draft Programme for Government. I welcome the  commitment from the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister and  the Executive to make a positive difference in people&rsquo;s lives.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Can the Minister advise how the Programme for Government  will address the needs of children and young  people? Which specific programmes for children and young people have  been included?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: I thank the honourable lady for her  question. Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  children are our future, and it is right that we support them and help  them to realise their potential. We are  determined that our children will  receive the support and help that they need through the PSA framework.  The Executive have outlined clear commitments to eradicating child poverty,  improving educational outcomes, particularly for the most disadvantaged, and  ensuring that all our children are cared for, live in safety and are protected  from abuse.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Enterprise,  Trade and Investment Committee (Mr Durkan)</strong>: I thank the First Minister and  the deputy First Minister for the statement, and the Executive for the draft  Programme for Government. As Chairperson of the Enterprise,  Trade and Investment Committee I welcome both the commitments to enterprise and  innovation and the interventions designed to ensure that Northern Ireland  has a competitive economy. The commitments are welcome, but they are not new,  as they are exactly what we had in the Committee on the Preparation for  Government and the Programme for Government Committee. The saccharine jargon  does not differ much from what went before, including during direct rule. Most  of the same phrases are there in statements by the former Secretary of State  Peter Hain. The deputy First Minister said that the Executive had inherited  challenges from direct rule &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. The Member has the Floor.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>:  It has also inherited some policies from direct rule.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee for  Enterprise, Trade and Investment looks forward to using the consultation  period for both the draft Programme for Government and the Budget to contribute  ideas that might amplify the plans to create a more articulate and effective  outlook. The deputy First Minister said that  he did not want naysaying, but both  the deputy First Minister and the First Minister have naysaid the achievements of the previous Executive. The  previous Executive put in place the basis for the investment strategy for Northern    Ireland and the Strategic Investment  Board, against opposition from Sinn F&eacute;in and the DUP. Now, those are the  centrepieces of their draft Programme for Government. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: The First Minister and I have both made it clear that we plan to  do things differently. We made no criticism of the previous Executive. The big  difference is that we have decided to take &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>:  Our ideas. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order, order. I remind Members that the business conducted in the House today  may give rise to strong emotions among some Members. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span> However, when Members are speaking on the Floor they should not be interrupted,  but should be allowed to speak.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First Minister</strong>: As I said, we have made it clear that we  plan to do things differently, and that this Executive are adopting a more  strategic approach to the Programme for Government, the Budget and the  investment strategy over the course of 10 years. People should accept that this  is a good day for everyone. After only five months in office, the Executive  have set out their Budget, Programme for Government and investment strategy, which is a remarkable achievement. I pay tribute to all of my ministerial  colleagues, including those from the SDLP, the Ulster Unionist Party and  the DUP, for the good work that they have contributed towards bringing us to  this position.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Programme for Government and the investment strategy offer: a good future for everyone, North,  South, east and west; thousands of new jobs; new schools and hospitals;  new roads; better public transport; better support for farmers and rural  communities; and better support for business. The Executive are determined to  make a difference. We will not be satisfied unless we produce results that far  supersede everything that has happened in the past.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  thank the Ministers for their statement. The deputy First Minister has urged  the House to look for the positives in the Programme for Government and the  investment strategy. I have tried to do that, but there is little to be  positive about in those fairly thin documents.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I remember when the previous Programme for Government was  presented to the House. I criticised it for its failure to take community  relations seriously, but at least it contained a reference to &mdash; and a  commitment on &mdash; that issue. This draft Programme for Government contains  nothing on that matter except a passing  reference by the First Minister and the deputy First Minister. Is a weak  statement about promoting tolerance not  completely inadequate when one considers the community-relations  problems that we face? Why is there no objective to implement the shared future  action plan alongside the racial equality action plan, if the Executive are  serious about making a difference in solving the problems that we face?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: The honourable Member either needs a new pair of glasses or a new  earpiece. I remind him about the inward-investment commitments, which promise  to create over 6,500 jobs by 2011. Is that not positive? Is the commitment to halve  the private-sector productivity gap with the UK by 2015 not new and concrete?  There are commitments to increase the number of tourists who visit Northern  Ireland each year to 2&middot;5 million, and tourism revenue to &pound;520 million; to  reduce child poverty by 50%; to ensure that every child leaves school with a  level of literacy and numeracy that will, at least, equip them for work and  life; and to make record investment of &pound;5&middot;6 billion in infrastructure during  the next three years. I could continue. I deeply regret that the honourable  gentleman has neither listened to nor read the commitments that have been made. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. I remind Members that they are not permitted to make an intervention  from a sedentary position.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I congratulate the First Minister and the deputy First Minister on the draft  Programme for Government, which was unanimously agreed by all parties in the  Executive. I welcome the centrality of economic development in the draft  Programme for Government, which was glaringly missing from the previous  programme. That fact has not been lost on anyone in the House or beyond;  except, perhaps, Mr Durkan. It is essential that economic prosperity benefits  everyone in Northern Ireland.  What priority have the Executive given to  the promotion of economic growth in all areas of Northern Ireland?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: I thank the Member for his  question. The Executive have recognised that, during recent years,  investment in business and industry has tended to focus on the greater Belfast area. A key aim  of the Programme for Government and the investment strategy is to promote and  facilitate economic growth and social progress everywhere. In particular, the  Executive are determined that investment in networks and roads infrastructure  will increase the attractiveness of the wider region as a destination for  business investment and will enhance the competitiveness of businesses that are based outside the greater Belfast area.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Like other Members, I  am somewhat surprised at the negativity of some Members. Recently, the  Executive have been criticised for not taking decisions.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Today, we have taken &pound;18 billion-worth of decisions that  will address the needs of our society, and our people, over the course of the  next 10 years. That is rapid progress.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Anderson</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat. I, too, thank the First Minister and the deputy First  Minister for their statements. Will the First Minister confirm that the Executive&rsquo;s collective decision to mainstream the  equality agenda, Section 75 duties, and the equality impact assessment  process into all strategic-level Executive functions &mdash; including the draft  Programme for Government and the draft Budget &mdash; is now a demonstration that the  delivery of equality and social justice can, and should be, the central premise  for governmental spending?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: I thank the lady for what she has said. The equality impact  assessment of the draft Programme for Government, and accompanying PSAs, is in  accordance with our statutory duties, which we will carry out to the full.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  I draw Member&rsquo;s attention to page seven of this hefty document, where it states  that there will be:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;free public transport during 2008 to everyone aged 60  and over&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I am sorry that Mr Ford has left the Chamber. I  have no doubt that &mdash;<span class="Italic"> [Laughter.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  He has been banished to the Back Benches for being bad.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  I see that he is in the Chamber. Since he is such a naysayer and a begrudger, I  ask him to take note of that item in the document. Will the First Minister and  deputy First Minister tell us, in more detail, the exact extent of the draft  Programme for Government that they intend to implement? The programme will be greatly welcomed by the  community.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: I agree that it is an excellent announcement that should be  welcomed by all right-thinking people. Reducing the age at which people can  avail of free transport from 65 to 60 means that women who reach retirement age  will no longer find themselves being penalised unnecessarily. This is only one  of a series of measures to improve public transport. We will also be  introducing concessionary fares on rural services and increasing public  transport provision for rural areas and rural communities.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  The deputy First Minister and the First Minister started off by asking that we  should, perhaps, have some words of comfort. Those of you who are familiar with  the television programme &lsquo;Yes Prime Minister&rsquo; will be aware that Sir Humphrey  used the famous phrase: &ldquo;a courageous speech, Minister.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A question that is closer to hand &mdash; and perhaps in line  with the points raised about the planning process &mdash; is that talk is cheap but  it takes money to buy land. What we are hearing are aspirations. Will the First  Minister, with his laudable aims to increase economic participation from 70% to  75%, tell me exactly how many people that represents? How will that figure compare with the figure of 140,000 that  Pricewaterhouse&shy;Coopers said that we needed to reach over the next 10  years? How does the First Minister intend to achieve that figure if, as stated  in his document, he is only going to create 6,500 jobs?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: This is not an Official Unionist document, which would be  published and then be forgotten. The &lsquo;Draft Programme for Government 2008-2011&rsquo;  will not be forgotten, for we will carry out the measures set out in the  document. The Member should look carefully at the overarching aim, which is to  build a peaceful, fair and prosperous society in Northern Ireland, with respect for  the rule of law. That is where we hang our colours in today&rsquo;s debate. If the  honourable gentleman does not like what is done, the process will move on and  he will be left behind.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  So, you do not have an answer.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for the Environment (Mr McGlone)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a  Cheann Comhairle. I have two questions. First, what measures or procedures will  be put in place to deliver, monitor and oversee the sustainable development  strategy and ensure that it is delivered on a cross-departmental basis?</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">11.45 am</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the commitment today to delivering an effective  Planning Service by 2011. There was mention of the delivery of draft and full  area plans by 2011. However, how will those plans be delivered, given that the  Planning Appeals Commission, which is involved in public inquiries into those  plans, is under severe pressure as it stands? In fact, this morning I was told  that an individual appellant can wait as long as three years for a decision. I  would like clarification of how the expectations that were created today will  be met and delivered on.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First Minister</strong>: Sustainable development is built on three pillars: economic growth,  social progress and environmental protection. As our Programme for  Government states, sustainability will be a key cross-cutting theme that will  underpin our approach to delivering our priorities. Building a sustainable  future will be a key requirement for all our economic, social and environmental  policies and programmes. We believe that sustainable development is not simply  about resources; it is about changing the culture and doing things differently.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As regards planning, we all know and understand that  workload pressures have been building for some time. Over the past five years,  the overall trend in the volume of appeal cases has turned sharply upwards.  Figures show that appeal intake in 2006-07 has increased by over 600% since  2002-03. There are a number of reasons for that. There are increasing demands  in relation to major planning applications and non-determination appeals, which  are cases taken to the Planning Appeals  Commission because the Planning Service and DOE have failed to reach a  decision within the permitted time.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The commission is also  required to take on the public inquiry work associated with the DOE&rsquo;s  development plan programme, as well as a range of other non-planning-related  appellate functions that have been assigned  to it over the years. Planning Policy Statement 14 (PPS 14), which was announced last year and which introduced  a presumption against development in the countryside, has also contributed to  the surge in appeal applications.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We recognise that the planning system is a key mechanism  for delivering sustainable development and for  enabling the delivery of jobs, homes, better transport and lively  communities. We are committed to securing the additional resources to tackle  the backlog. In recognition of the backlog, we supported a case made by the  Planning Appeals Commission for additional resources and submitted a bid. I  accept that this issue represents a real challenge, and it is a challenge to  which we must rise.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I  welcome the statement by the First Minister and deputy First Minister.  This draft Programme for Government is a  positive development and an improve&shy;ment on the first Programme for  Government in so far as we have prioritised  goals that have attached timetables. All Members, not just those in the  Executive, have a responsibility to match that programme with delivery, and  people are entitled to judge us on our performance.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My question is about the priority entitled &lsquo;Invest to build  our infrastructure&rsquo; and procurement policy. Will the First Minister and deputy  First Minister assure the House that local companies will not find themselves  in difficulty or at a disadvantage when  competing to provide services to the Executive as part of the delivery  of the programme?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: I can give the honourable Member the assurance that local  companies will have every opportunity to participate, in all fairness, in that development. I would like to see the people of Northern<span style="letter-spacing:0pt; "> Ireland</span> engaged in such work. As the Member knows well, laws have to be observed  with regard to procure&shy;ment, but I give him assurance on that matter today.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mrs I Robinson)</strong>:  I very much regret that the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety is absent from the Chamber. It shows  little respect for the draft Programme for Government.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the statement on the draft Programme for  Government and the investment strategy for Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am reminded of the  words of Franklin D Roosevelt:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The test of our  progress is not whether we add more to the abundance  of those who have much, it is whether we provide enough for those who  have too little.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">What reassurance can the deputy First Minister  offer that issues such as the prevention of illness and the promotion of a  healthy lifestyle will now be addressed in a much more holistic manner through  a Programme for Government that is fully meshed and dovetails with the Budget priorities to ensure the best possible  outcomes for our people?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: In formulating the Programme for Government, we identified health  as a major issue. Huge challenges face us as we move forward. I have no doubt  that the ambitious targets that we have set ourselves can be reached, given the  will of the Assembly and the ability of the  Executive to deliver. We are moving  forward with a joined-up approach, which will see all Departments &mdash; not  least the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety &mdash; recognise  the huge responsibilities that we have to improve the health and well-being of  all our people.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I congratulate not only the First  Minister and the deputy First Minister but the whole Executive on introducing a  draft Programme for Government for consultation with the general public.  Although some Members are looking through  the programme for words about a shared future, etc, the best way to  advance a shared future is through the example shown by the Executive in  bringing forward a draft Programme for Government for the future, instead of  some fluffy document that inevitably ends up in the employment of serving and  former members of the Alliance Party.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In their statement, the First Minister and deputy First  Minister said that the restraints on fiscal policy meant that the Programme for  Government has not been as adventurous as it could have been. What restraints  has a lack of fiscal independence placed on the Programme for Government?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: I am sure that the honourable gentleman will be in the Chamber  when the Minister of Finance and Personnel makes his statement, which will  bring even more comfort to him.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Continual pressure will  be exerted on the Westminster  authorities to do what is right for the people of this Province.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As the Member is well aware, there are certain military  installations that are not going to be used in the future. I have demanded and  will continue to demand that the money from  the sale of those properties is not taken out of the country.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  In welcoming the announcement of the Programme for Government, I am somewhat  amused at the emergence of Pontius Pilate  politics from Members who had previously lectured us about collective  responsibility and governance. Now it seems to suit their political agenda to  wash their hands of any responsibility, bearing in mind that their Ministers  did not table any amendments in the Executive. I would appreciate it if the  deputy First Minister would indicate the thinking behind the choice of the  strategic priorities that are set out in the Programme for Government.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: We have aimed to produce a Programme for Government that  addresses the big challenges facing us all. Our overarching aim is to build a  peaceful, fair and prosperous society in which everyone can enjoy a better  quality of life, now and in the future. In support of that aim, five emerging  strategic priorities have been identified: growing a dynamic and innovative economy; promoting tolerance, inclusion  and health and well-being; protecting and enhancing our environment and natural  resources; investing to build our infrastructure; and delivering modern  high-quality and efficient public services.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Growing the economy will be our top priority over the period of this Programme for Government.  However, the priorities are all interconnected, and we recognise that  they cannot be achieved in isolation. For example, we cannot grow the economy  in isolation from determined efforts to  transform our society and enhance our environment. Those priorities will  be supported by our key goals and public service agreements, which will help to  ensure that the Executive can focus on the key  issues and outcomes to which we are all committed.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  I thank the First Minister and deputy First  Minister for bringing forward the draft consultation. Will they give the  House an assurance that, following the consultation period, if any specific  proposals come forward that Committees believe should be included in the  priorities, the Executive will give them due consideration and include them?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: I can assure the Member absolutely that that will take place.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I thank the Ministers for their statement. The programme contains much detail, and it will  require analysis, scrutiny and public consultation. The SDLP will be heavily involved in that. The content is  significant, and our party has no objection to our good ideas being  built into the programme &mdash; as indeed they are.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The First Minister described the announcement as &ldquo;momentous&rdquo;. We will know that it is momentous  when it is delivered &mdash; that is the challenge for OFMDFM. The programme  contains ambitious plans, and we want to see them happen. Rather than seeing  today&rsquo;s announcement as momentous, the  Assembly will breathe a heavy sigh of relief that, at last, real  business and work is coming before it. It has been an arid time here.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The overarching aim of the programme is for a peaceful,  fair and prosperous society, and nothing is more important than that. The  deputy First Minister referred to truly new management and to setting aside  sectional interest. Those are also good sentiments. However, much of the  content of debates in the Chamber, and the manner in which those have been  debated, has been contradictory.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. I ask the Member to come to his question now.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  Much of that divisive content has come from the two parties that are  represented in OFMDFM. What contribution will those parties make to ensure that  the matters brought forward, and the manner in which those are debated, make a  genuine commitment to a shared society?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: It never ceases to amaze me how out of touch some members of the  SDLP are with the mood of public opinion. It is quite clear that the parties  that lead the Executive enjoy overwhelming support from the community, as was  clearly identified in the outcome of the Assembly elections.<span class="Italic"> [Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: People are delighted at the progress that has been made over the  course of the last four or five months. After today&rsquo;s announcement, people will  be even more delighted that we have taken, in the course of our deliberations  today, huge decisions that affect their lives. Those decisions are taken for  the betterment of our people, not to worsen the conditions under which people  live. The time has come for some Members to waken up and smell the coffee. They  must waken up and recognise that people are really pleased and delighted at the  efforts that are being made to move forward to put in place a real future, not  only for themselves, but for their children and their children&rsquo;s children.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Robinson</strong>:  I welcome the Programme for Government. How have the First Minister and deputy  First Minister decided on the key announcements and key goals?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: We are determined to make a real  difference. We will not be satisfied unless we produce results that far  supersede all that has happened over recent decades in Northern Ireland.  Our goals and key announcements are ambitious, and rightly so. They show how we  have listened to our people, and how we will  drive forward the type of change that is long overdue in our society. I trust that when the Committees  deal with the issues, and we take  our consultation from all outside authorities, we will be able to speed  the Programme for Government on its way as quickly as possible.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">12.00 noon</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms McGill</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I thank the First Minister and the  deputy First Minister for their statement, and I welcome the many positives  that it includes. How does the draft investment strategy address regional  imbalance, particularly west of the Bann?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: We sought to identify balanced regional development as a key  element in the cross-cutting strategic objective of the draft investment strategy. In seeking to prioritise more balanced  regional development, there will be a particular focus on cross-border  links and on developing infrastructure in the border areas.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The development and upgrade of transport links along the  Dublin/Belfast corridor will ensure that it forms a major axis for economic  development on the island. In the north-west and Donegal, we will tackle  regional disparities by further improving road links, enhancing the capacity  and resilience of energy support networks, strengthening telecommunications infrastructure and developing the City of Derry  Airport.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I also highlight the investment in health care: there will  be a developing network of health and care centres across the region and new  hospital facilities in the south-west. Schools will also receive a boost, which  will benefit communities across the region.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The list goes on. We have taken important steps in the  right direction. During the public consultation that is being launched today, I  look forward to hearing about what more should be done with the resources that  we have available.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>:  Before asking my question, I want to reassure Members that I have read all 17  pages of the document. I noticed that when Lord Morrow referred to a &ldquo;hefty  document&rdquo;, he was holding a 25-page speech, not the 17-page document.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the document, I cannot find any substantive reference to  many issues, such as a shared future, good relations, community relations,  post-primary transfer, sustainable schools policy, free personal care or the  environmental protection agency &mdash; amongst others. How long do the First  Minister and deputy First Minister intend to dine out on the feel-good factor  created on 8 May 2007? When will they back it up with substantive action to  deliver on a shared future and make that hope a reality?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: I am sure that the honourable lady enjoys dining out herself.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">She should read from page 3 of the document:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;our approach to delivering our priorities will be  underpinned by the two cross-cutting key themes:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">A better future: fairness, inclusion and equality of  opportunity will be watchwords for all our policies and programmes.</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">This places an overarching responsibility on the  Executive to proactively change the existing patterns of social disadvantage by  using increased prosperity and economic growth to tackle ongoing priority.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am sorry that the lady does not read more carefully  before making such statements.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Buchanan</strong>:  I too welcome the Programme for Government, particularly its commitment to  supporting businesses and helping the entire  business and enterprise culture to flourish. How do the Executive  propose to support local businesses across Northern Ireland, particularly the  small to medium-sized enterprises west of the Bann, which are the life and soul  of the rural economy?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: The Executive are totally committed to supporting local  businesses. There is a long history of business ingenuity and leadership. We  are determined to create the conditions that will unlock potential and to  assist local businesses to succeed in an ever more competitive global market.  That commitment is reflected in the priority that we have attached to  developing the skills base and investing in infrastructure</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Programme for Government also includes specific  commitments to supporting local businesses to enter the export market and  increasing expenditure on research and development. As one of the elected  representatives from west of the Bann, and the Speaker is another, I assure the  Member that, as we move forward, the Executive are committed to ensuring that  everyone gets a fair share.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. My question on the promotion of  equality has been answered.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>: I  also welcome the draft Programme for Government.  Given the commitments in the programme to reform the planning process,  can the Assembly be assured that, as part of that reform, private developers  will be forced to tackle the social housing problem that this Government face?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: Yes; I can say that in the Programme for Government, we have made  an undertaking that there will be 10,000 homes built in order to address the  very grave situation that we have. We all acknowledge its gravity, and we have  a good foundation on which to build.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  It is good to have the Executive&rsquo;s priorities set out, and they appear to be  framed by an overall aim of building a fair and prosperous society. The message  is coming through loud and clear that there is to be massive investment in  infrastructure in Belfast  and in Northern Ireland Railways. I am sure  that there are possible justifications for that, but given the neglect  of infrastructure in the west, particularly in Fermanagh and Tyrone, where we rely on the roads network, is the west in  that frame? There is to be a move to second-generation broadband by 2011, but parts of the west, despite claims to the  contrary, still do not have first-generation broadband. May I have a commitment  that that infrastructural problem will also be addressed?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: We refer to that issue and the need to ensure that broadband is  accessible to everyone. There are plans to do that specifically in the  Programme for Government. On the situation west of the Bann, we all accept  that, over the course of the years, many elected representatives have commented  on the state of the roads in different counties. No doubt, when the Minister  for Regional Development makes his contribution to that debate, he will outline  his plans to ensure that all areas get their fair share.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McKay</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I want, first of all, to put on record  our appreciation that OFMDFM recognises that the environment is an important  asset and that it is to be protected and enhanced through the investment  strategy. Will the First Minister assure the House that that will remain a key  priority for the Executive?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: I refer the honourable Member to the statement. We will  strengthen the protection of key areas. That will apply to all parts of the  report; everything will be strengthened in the way that it should be, with fair play for everyone in the  community.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Spratt</strong>: I  too thank the First Minister and deputy First Minister for this morning&rsquo;s  statement. How will the overarching aim to build a peaceful, fair and  prosperous society in Northern    Ireland, with respect for the rule of law,  guide the work of the Executive over the next three years?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: It is a very positive development that all Executive Ministers  have agreed that overarching aim. It sets out the type of future that we all  want to see here, and I am proud that, as an Executive, we have agreed on the  aim of building a peaceful, fair and prosperous society, with respect for the  rule of law. That represents huge progress for all of us. I want the Assembly to  understand that every one of the priorities and key goals in the Programme for  Government will contribute to the achievement of that aim. That is how it will  guide the Executive&rsquo;s work.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I welcome free public  transport&rsquo;s being extended in 2008 to those who are aged 60 and over.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>A Member</strong>:  That is a matter of self-interest.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>: It will be a matter of self-interest shortly.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">What other measures that will benefit older people are  contained in the draft Programme for Government?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First Minister</strong>: The draft programme rests on protecting  all sections of the community, especially those who, in the past, have not done  so well. No one will be left out; everyone  who has a right to be included under our propositions will be included.  We could not say that we want a fair and just society in which the rule of law  is acknowledged, but then not bring that to everyone. Therefore, we are pledged  to bring that society to all those who rightfully should benefit from certain  aspects of life that they do not currently have.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  I also welcome the announcement of the draft Programme for Government. I  noticed that the First Minister and deputy First Minister talk about investment  in schools. Direct rule Ministers, and, indeed, the previous Executive &mdash; which  Mr Durkan seems to think did such an excellent job in investing in schools &mdash;  delayed the schools building programme. That has meant that work on some school  buildings that was announced five years ago has not even started. Given that,  will the deputy First Minister tell us what plans have been included in the  draft Programme for Government to ensure  that finance, but, more importantly, procurement  are such that the new building programme will not face the same delays?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, will the deputy First Minister tell the House  whether the final Programme for Government will include a clear date for the  implementation of the new transfer arrangements from primary to post-primary  school? That matter is causing grave concern among teachers and parents.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: All those who have been involved in the education world in recent  years understand some of the difficulties that the Member outlined. However, it  is fair to say that committing &pound;3&middot;5 billion to our schools and youth services  clearly represents a massive investment in schools. The reason for that  investment is that schools are at the heart of our communities. Our aim is to modernise substantially the  schools estate in order to align better the links between further education,  the needs of the population, and the skills  that we will require in the future. Therefore, we will proceed with  major works on over 100 schools between 2008 and 2011.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Transfer mechanisms are  a matter for the Department of Education in consultation with the  Committee for Education and all the different interest groups. We all know and understand that the transfer system is a  vexed issue; however, it is not beyond us. Here we are, after four or  five months in Government, having completed a  massive amount of work to bring the draft Programme for Government to  the Assembly today. If we can do that, I think that we can do nearly anything.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>: The deputy First Minister has stated that he believes in  working together to harness all the talents that exist in our society. Does  that apply to all Members of the House? Will he guarantee that we will all be  represented and that he will not merely continue to work ever more closely only  with his Rt Hon friend the First Minister to achieve a more inclusive House?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: I would just like to say to the Member: better luck next time. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  Will the Executive confirm that children and young people remain a priority for  the Government? If so, how have they evidenced that in the draft Budget? What  overall level of investment are the  Executive making in early intervention and prevention services for  children and young people?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: The Executive&rsquo;s overarching  aim in the draft Programme for Government is, as I have already said, to  build a peaceful, just and prosperous society in which everyone, including our  children, can enjoy a better quality of life, now and in years to come. We  recognise that action is required to ensure that all our children receive the  support that they need to achieve their full potential, become more  independent, and grow into well-adjusted adults who can take their place in the  community.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">12.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The needs of children are taken into account in our  Programme for Government. In the PSA framework, the Executive have outlined  clear commitments to eradicate child poverty, improve educational outcomes &mdash;  particularly for the most disadvantaged children, and to ensure that all our  children are cared for, live in safety, and are protected from abuse.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Newton</strong>: I  join other Members on this side of the House in welcoming this morning&rsquo;s  statements. In response to the remarks of the Alliance Party Member for East Belfast:  yes; there is a feel-good factor, certainly on this side of the Chamber.  That comes from enjoying the confidence of the electorate, as is evidenced by  the growth of our party.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Newton</strong>: I particularly welcome the underpinning of the political  process through investment in the economy. That is essential, particularly in  preparing the way for more jobs, including the provision of skills training.  With that in mind, how will the investment strategy benefit the Northern Ireland  tourism sector&rsquo;s drive for more visitors to the Province, which will increase  the potential for job creation and prosperity?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: I thank my honourable friend for his words. We will provide  investment to enhance tourism infrastructure and will work with key partners to  continue to advance the implementation of our tourism signature projects. We  will also invest in our rural areas, which offer real opportunities for growth in  job creation and tourism.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burns</strong>: I  welcome the Programme for Gover&shy;nment. Do the plans for the rapid-transport  system for the greater Belfast  area include any proposals to reopen the Lisburn to Antrim railway line  and to build a new railway station at Belfast International Airport  to enhance our tourism industry?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First Minister</strong>: The Minister for Regional Development will outline his view of how those  matters should be taken forward.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  I also welcome this morning&rsquo;s announcement of the Programme for Government.  Will the First Minister inform the House how the Executive will ensure that the  proposed overhaul of the Planning Service contributes to economic growth?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First Minister</strong>: A key objective of the proposed overhaul  of the planning system will be to examine how we can speed up the  decision-making process and create more certainty. That is essential if we are  to be successful in promoting business  investment. Moreover, we are giving  a commitment that, from today, decisions will be made on all large-scale  investment planning proposals within six months, provided that a  pre-application consultation has taken place. That is the current position.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  The Programme for Government of the previous Executive, despite all their  faults, ran to 144 pages. The current Programme for Government runs to 17  pages. Either the Executive believe that all the problems that face Northern Ireland have been solved, or they are condemning Northern Ireland to three wasted  years. The Executive made great play of the  fact that they have had only since  May to prepare that document. Did the  Northern Ireland Office not fund the appointment of special advisers since January, specifically for  the purpose of preparing the Programme for Government? Will the Northern  Ireland Office be getting that money back?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: That is a ridiculous question.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">In formulating this Programme for Government, the  Executive have adopted a strategic and joined-up approach, which will be  welcomed overwhelmingly by everyone in our society.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  Like others, I welcome this draft document, and we do take hope from it.  However, I emphasise that we do not have to  buy the hype contained in the document. As regards hope, there are  36,000 families on the waiting list for houses in Northern Ireland. The document  makes reference to investment, but will the First Minister and deputy First  Minister assure me, and the people who are waiting for houses, that the finance for those houses will be made  available to the Minister for Social Development?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: It is all very well to be critical, but the Member&rsquo;s party, after  all, was associated with the last Executive, and they did not do very much.  Their record was despicable, and those in glass houses should not throw stones.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We have made it a point that our Programme for Government  and investment strategy are bound to be good news for the people of Northern Ireland.  We are going to tackle the issues: North, South, east and west. There will be  thousands of new jobs, new schools, new hospitals, new roads, better public  transport, better support for our farmers and rural communities, and better support for business. What more does the  Member want? We are determined to produce the goods, and I look forward  to the day when he will be able to enjoy the plum pudding on his plate.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>: I join others in welcoming the state&shy;ment. Following almost 40 years of conflict, my  question is about victims. What  priority is the Executive giving to the  needs of victims and their families, the vast majority of whom were  brought about by the party opposite?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: We recognise the need to support victims and survivors as we seek  to move forward and build a better future for all our people. That is clearly  reflected in the PSA framework and in our commitment to develop a new and  comprehensive strategy and approach to victims and survivors. More details will  be made available in due course.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Government are committed to making a real difference to  the lives of victims and survivors, and we made a public statement on 8 October  concerning the appointment of a new Commissioner for Victims and Survivors. The post has been re-advertised, and  we hope that we can announce the  appointment before Christmas. Re-advertising the post against the  background of a fully-functioning Executive  will bring forward a greater number of candidates. We will bring forward  detailed proposals shortly that will represent a comprehensive approach to  victims and survivors. In doing so, we will be focusing on three important  areas: services and practical help for victims; dealing with the legacy of the  past; and building a better future.</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading"><a name="2"></a>Draft Budget 2008-2011</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I have received notice from the Minister of Finance and Personnel that he  wishes to make a statement on the draft Budget 2008-2011.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel (Mr P Robinson)</strong>: I am pleased to present the new Executive&rsquo;s  first draft Budget. Lest anyone tuning in is beginning to wonder &mdash; it should be  pointed out that that is a four-party Executive. I am sure that all four  parties in the Executive, who unanimously  agreed the Programme for Government  that has already been outlined, will want to promote Northern Ireland  rather than talk it down.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">At the outset, I thank my officials for the assistance that  they have given me in the preparation of the draft Budget. I also thank the  Ministers and officials from all the other Departments, as they have assisted  remarkably over recent weeks and months.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The draft Budget marks a clear break with the past and a  new direction for the future. The days of direct rule Budgets with Labour Party  priorities are over. This draft Budget comes with the proud stamp: &ldquo;Made in Northern Ireland&rdquo;.  The primary focus on economic growth is an indication of our long-term  commitment to build a better future for the  people of Northern Ireland.  At a time when the public expects greater  public services, this is a Budget that demands more from Government and  more for the people. Now is the time for Govern&shy;ment to respond and for  devolution to deliver.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">For almost 10 years, we have seen increases in public  spending in Northern Ireland.  Now it is for the Executive to set a course that will meet the needs of the people, not simply by spending more, but by  ensuring that we get value for money for every pound that we spend. Our future success lies in our hands, and  we must seize the opportunities that  are before us. This is the first draft  Budget of a new era, and it must lay the foundations for a better future  for everyone in Northern    Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The First Minister and the deputy First Minister have set out the Executive&rsquo;s proposals for a  Programme for Government for the next three years. They have also  provided a draft investment strategy that will define our priorities for  investment over the next decade. Those documents set the context for the public  expenditure proposals that the Executive also agreed on 23 October to submit to  the Assembly and to the public for consultation. The draft Budget document published today provides details of proposed  expenditure allocations to Departments for the next three years. Those  are the resources that they will need and use to deliver the priorities and  targets that are highlighted in the draft  Programme for Government and in its annexes.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The last occasion on which a Finance Minister in a devolved  Administration confirmed public spending plans for Northern Ireland was in December  2001, when Mark Durkan announced plans for 2002-03. On that occasion, he  announced plans for current and capital expenditure totalling just over &pound;6  billion. The spending proposals that I will announce today will total almost  &pound;10 billion next year, growing to almost &pound;11 billion by 2010-11.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  Those figures reflect the growth in public spending that has occurred in recent  years. Our current spending will be over 28% higher in real terms than it was in 2002. For capital investment, the  increase has been even more  dramatic, with a real terms increase of  over 60% in annual public investment in new infra&shy;structure in 2010-11,  compared to seven years ago. We now have more money to spend in real terms than  ever before. However, we also face many new demands on those resources.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">During recent discussions with Executive Ministers on the  draft Budget, they highlighted the real pressures that they face in maintaining  and improving the public services for which they are responsible. However, the  challenge that we face here is no different from the challenge that confronts  every democratic Government around the world. Expectations of public services  are rising everywhere, but people do not want to pay more tax than is  necessary, and they certainly do not want the taxes that they do pay to be wasted  on inefficiency or on programmes whose purpose and value are no longer  relevant.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The First Minister highlighted the Executive&rsquo;s wish to  focus on a small number of key priorities and goals. That is the right  approach, if we are going to make differences that matter to the community.  That is the direction in which the Assembly should move.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is also the right  approach to take when we consider how best to allocate the use of public  expenditure. Consequently, that means that we have taken some difficult decisions  on how best to allocate resources across Departments. However, I believe that  the draft Budget proposals, agreed by the Executive for consultation, are fully  consistent with the key priorities as set out in the draft Programme for  Government.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">12.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I will now set out some of the basic facts about the  amounts of money that will be available to us over the next three years.  Greater detail is provided in the draft Budget document published today;  Members and Committees will want to examine that document further over the  coming weeks. Our main source of funding for public services is the Northern Ireland block grant, which will be  increased by the Treasury over the next three years on the basis of changes in  comparable spending programmes in England, using the Barnett formula.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Chancellor of the Exchequer announced the outcome of  the comprehensive spending review on 9 October 2007. As part of that review, he  announced that after the application of the Barnett formula, the Northern  Ireland departmental expenditure limit would increase  in real terms by an average of 1&middot;7% per annum over the next three years.  I must, however, clarify that Treasury figure by highlighting that it is  predicated on a reduced baseline figure for Northern Ireland that emerged just before the comprehensive spending  review announcement, and after adjustments were made to baselines of  some Whitehall Departments, particularly the Department of Health. The Treasury  made similar adjustments to baselines in Scotland  and Wales.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">After taking account of those adjustments, a more accurate  figure for the average real-term growth in expenditure in Northern Ireland over  the next three years is an average of 1&middot;2% per annum. However, after that  adjustment, our total resources over the next three years will be &pound;443 million  more than the position we had reached in our negotiations with the Chancellor  just before devolution in May.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In total, our departmental expenditure limit will increase  by &pound;254 million, &pound;622 million and &pound;1&middot;661 billion over the next three years. I  want to make it clear that we did not apply any reduction to our health baseline to match the reduction made to the  Department of Health in England.  In addition to those amounts, we will  continue to have access to borrowing for investment in infrastructure.  The amounts available to us will be &pound;260 million, &pound;246 million and &pound;200 million  over the next three years, to include amounts of available borrowing not drawn  down in previous years. This borrowing is a valuable source of additional spending  power for infrastructure investment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Thanks to the negotiations leading up to restoration, it is  now also borrowing without strings attached. The era of taxation for its own  sake is over. The agreement that the  previous Executive negotiated with the Treasury included a punitive  clause that required us to increase domestic rates each year, year-on-year,  above the average council tax increases in Great Britain. That had to be done  whether or not we needed the extra revenue, and led to regional rate increases  of up to 19% per annum. What householder does not remember that bill falling on the mat? The removal of that  linkage was a key priority in our  negotiations with the Treasury, and I am pleased that we succeeded in  having that imposition removed by the Chancellor earlier this year. Instead of  our regional rate effectively being set by local government in England, we are  now free to make our own decisions on how much we must raise from domestic  rates.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">An additional source of spending power for the Executive  and the Assembly over the next three years will be our capacity to draw down  funds under the end-year flexibility arrangements. I stress that those sums  reflect the amounts of money that were left unspent in previous years, and, in  that sense, is not new money. However, it is money that is now tightly  controlled by the Treasury. By gaining access to those funds now, on a one-off  basis, we can address some of the costs  facing Departments as they move to restructure and reform public  services over the next few years.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Chief Secretary to  the Treasury previously restricted our access to those funds. Members will  recall the position that we reached with the Chancellor in May &mdash; a position  that I regarded as unfinished business. I am pleased to report to the Assembly  that after further negotiations with the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, I  have secured access to our full stock of end-year flexibility over the next  three years. That represents an addition of some &pound;295 million over the next  three years, which is greater than the position that we reached in our  negotiations with the Chancellor in May. I have also been able to secure the  significant front-loading of those resources to enable us to address the costs  that Departments will face as we move to restructure and reform the way in  which we organise and deliver public services.</p>
	      <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Molloy] in the Chair)</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Finance Ministers in the previous Executive introduced the  use of planned over-commitment to manage the implications of rapid growth in  public expenditure and to reduce year-end underspends. The use of planned  over-commitment continued under direct rule. We have reviewed its future under  the new Executive and concluded that although it will still have some use, the  size of the over-commitment must be reduced to below the levels that we  inherited from direct-rule Ministers. That is essential if the Executive are to  have greater flexibility to respond to the new and unexpected financial  pressures that can arise in the course of any financial year. Therefore, the  draft Budget is based on a planning assumption that the level of  over-commitment will be reduced to &pound;100 million in 2008-09 and further reduced  to &pound;80 million and &pound;60 million over the following two years.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Taking account of those funding sources, the total current  expenditure that is available for allocation by the Executive across the three  years is &pound;8&middot;28 billion, &pound;8&middot;55 billion, and &pound;8&middot;93 billion. In addition, public  expenditure allocations of &pound;1&middot;64 billion, &pound;1&middot;5 billion, and &pound;1&middot;83 billion are  available for investment in infrastructure over the same three years. In  addition to those amounts &mdash; and under the direct control of the Executive &mdash; we  will receive funding to support social security and other expenditure that is  managed directly by the Treasury. If those sums are added to the above figures,  we will receive total public expenditure allocations that exceed &pound;19&middot;7 billion  by 2010-11.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Before explaining how our proposed financial allocations  have been deployed, I will say a few words about how we will work to make our  public services more efficient. The outcome of the comprehensive spending  review (CSR) has confirmed that the years of rapid growth in public spending  across the United Kingdom  are over. We can look forward to continuing real increases in public spending  over the next few years, but at a much reduced rate of growth. That means that  we must place a renewed emphasis on ensuring that we deliver maximum value for  money from every penny that we spend on behalf of the people of Northern Ireland.  Our public services will suffer if we do not take that challenge seriously. The  formula is simple: if we free up resources through greater efficiency, they  will remain in Northern    Ireland for reinvestment in improving  front-line services. However, if we allow inefficiencies to remain  unchallenged, the people who will suffer will be the young, the old, and the  vulnerable in every community across Northern Ireland. The only people  who benefit from public-services inefficiencies are those who have a vested  interest in resisting change and maintaining a status quo with which they have  grown comfortable.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to serve notice today to the Assembly and to the  wider community that I am determined to take the drive for greater efficiency  in public services to a new level. I am not prepared to simply stand back and  leave unchallenged the countless instances &mdash; large and small &mdash; across all our public bodies in which taxpayers&rsquo; money is  being wasted on overstaffing, absenteeism, poor working practices, and a  resistance to radical change in the way in which we go about delivering  services. We owe that not only to those who use and need our public services,  but to the many public servants who want changes to and improvements in how  they can do their jobs.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have also asked my officials to examine the recent report  published on the cost of division, to see whether there is any scope to free up  resources. Their work is not yet complete, but the indications are that the  areas in which there would be most  potential to make savings are also  those areas where there is little realistic prospect of radical change  in the short term.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Clearly, we can make savings with different arrangements to  educate our children, and new arrangements for local government could free up  money, but it seems unlikely that those reforms will deliver significant savings in the CSR period. However, that  does not mean that we should not start the journey now. We have made a giant  political step forward, and we must examine the benefits that can flow from the  resultant growth in community stability.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Other costs associated  with the division in our society fall to policing and security budgets,  which, of course, fall outside the scope of the present Budget.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have already announced my intention to create a new  high-level public sector efficiency task force &mdash; the performance and efficiency  delivery unit (PEDU) &mdash; to examine the scope for generating new cash-releasing  efficiencies and improving delivery and performance across the public sector.  The unit&rsquo;s membership will be limited to a  few respected individuals with a strong track record in overseeing  successful organisational change, and it will be supported by a small number of  staff. The unit will include individuals from outside the public sector, and it  must be prepared to challenge even the most  widely accepted assumptions about how we go about the business of  delivering public services.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive have  already agreed that Departments and public bodies here should deliver  cash-releasing savings of 3% a year over the  next three years, including a 5% per annum real-terms reduction in  administration costs. That will produce an additional &pound;790 million by 2010-11  for reinvestment in our public services. However, I believe that we can go  further than that in finding ways to free  up more resources for reinvestment in public services.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Between now and my announcement of the final Budget in  January 2008, I want to finalise and publish details of how Departments will  deliver on their efficiency programmes. I also want to examine the scope for  delivering even higher levels of efficiency beyond the 3% a year targets  already set &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>: A mobile phone is interrupting the audio  recording. I apologise, Minister.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  I will announce new targets for reductions in the size of the Civil Service  over the next three years. What we are going to do to release funds from  current expenditure for better use, we also intend to do to increase funds for  capital investment. We want to maximise the  opportunity presented in the Chancellor of the Exchequer&rsquo;s financial  package to retain receipts from asset disposals for reinvestment in our local  infrastructure.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">To that end, we have set up a task force to identify  further opportunities to dispose of surplus and under-utilised assets. We  believe that with a professional and focused approach to asset realisation and  reuse, we can plan for even higher levels of investment in new infrastructure beyond the figures in the draft investment  strategy published today. The capital realisation task force has been asked to  report its initial findings to the Executive  by December so that they can be incorporated into the final Budget and  investment strategy to be published in  January. Therefore, a glance at departmental allocations will not reveal  the full extent of the new Government brand. We are not content to simply  accept the present resources at our disposal and dole them out. We are actively  and aggressively seeking to grow the pot.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Moreover, it is not simply the amount of funding each  Department will enjoy that counts. The key to success will be the use to which  those resources are put. The Executive intends to squeeze value out of every  pound spent. That means cutting out waste; getting more for the same or more  for less; doing things differently and better; challenging the worth of staid  programmes; testing the way things are done; and reforming the public sector so  that it delivers services of a kind and in a manner that people deserve.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">12.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive are committed to delivering the economic  vision of an innovative, entrepreneurial, wealth-generating, export-orientated  economy. In order to achieve that, we must ensure that policies are in place  that will encourage private-sector growth and enterprise. For too long, the  local private sector has been constrained by the dominant influence of the Northern Ireland  public sector. Now is an opportune time to change the focus of economic policy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We have the lowest unemployment rate of the UK regions, and  employment growth is at unparalleled levels. Despite that favourable  transformation in the labour market, there has been no material improvement in  our relative prosperity. Indeed, our GVA (gross value added) per capita, when  benchmarked against the UK  average, has actually deteriorated in the past five years.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That is confirmation of the fact that we must change tack in economic development policy, and it is a  warning that we cannot be complacent  about the serious economic challenges that confront us. The focus should  now be on creating better jobs &mdash; not just more jobs. We must encourage  private-sector growth in sectors that deliver high-value employment. Although  Invest NI and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment (DETI) have a  key role to play in that transformation, co-ordinated input will be required  from many other stakeholders, inside and outside the public sector.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The private sector has signalled that it understands the  nature of the challenge that it faces. The challenge for the Executive and the  Assembly is to ensure the delivery of the  infrastructure, skills and communication networks which are essential in  order to raise regional productivity.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Particular emphasis will also be placed on ensuring that  innovation funding promotes new and innovative ideas that can be turned into  opportunities for wealth creation in the economy. There must be a co-ordinated,  cross-departmental approach to the management and targeting of innovation  funding sources, including the Chancellor&rsquo;s financial package, EU  competitiveness and employment programmes, and Irish Government support for  collaborative research and development.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In highlighting the implications of the proposed budget  allocations for Departments, I will not attempt to repeat the details that were  published today in the draft Budget, and which, during the coming weeks, will  be subjected to separate and detailed scrutiny by the Assembly&rsquo;s Committees.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In line with the priority given to economic growth, it is  proposed that the reductions experienced by the Department of Enterprise, Trade  and Investment in recent years be reversed. Over the Budget period, there will be average growth of 4&middot;8% in the amount  available to spend. That additional funding will be used to support  Invest Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  efforts to stimulate exports, promote higher value-added activity in firms that  already operate in Northern    Ireland, and attract high-quality foreign  investment. That Budget proposal will also allow for increased investment in  marketing Northern Ireland  as a tourism destination, as well as visitor servicing and tourism signature  projects.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Recognising our  responsibility to minimise the impact of  climate change, DETI will be able to provide support for sustainable  energy projects and to meet the legal and consultancy costs of planned energy  initiatives that promote a greater use of renewable energy sources.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The additional &pound;87 million allocated in the draft Budget  will enable the Department for Employment and Learning to complete its roll-out  of the Pathways to Work scheme and support the introduction of the employment  support allowance, which will enable people who suffer from ill health or a  disability to return to work.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In order to underpin our commitment to promote a dynamic,  innovative economy, a highly-skilled and flexible workforce must be created. An  outcome of the draft Budget allocations will be that support will be provided  to help 42,000 adult learners to achieve a recognised qualification in  numeracy, literacy or ICT &mdash; or in all three.  In addition, by 2010, a comprehensive careers advice service will be  introduced to meet the needs of all &mdash; including disabled &mdash; people.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department would also be able to provide comprehensive  support to enable people to overcome the obstacles that they face in finding  employment. The capital allocations in this draft Budget will fund new further  education colleges in Belfast  and the north-west, along with the modernisation of existing colleges, in  recognition of the importance of those institutions and their contribution to  equipping our future workforce with the skills that it will require.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Turning to education, over the next three years, the challenge will be to continue to raise overall  educational standards while reducing the gap in achievement between  those who have the highest and lowest levels of attainment. The proposed  allocation will increase the Department&rsquo;s budget by 4&middot;3% per annum over the  period to 2010-11, with further resources coming from efficiency savings, which  allow for a significant increase in the aggregated schools budget.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, the allocation will support the imple&shy;mentation of the various elements of curriculum  reform to give our youngest pupils an  improved start to primary school, as well as placing a greater emphasis  on developing the skills that young people  need for life and work and to provide  greater flexibility for schools to tailor what they teach to best meet  the needs of their pupils.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">To ensure that our children are properly equipped for the  future, it is essential that we have a modern and sustainable schools estate  that provides them with the opportunities to excel that they deserve.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The draft Budget allocation will enable over 100 major  schools projects to be taken forward &mdash; along with 18 PPPs over the period, including  those for eight special-needs schools &mdash; as well as providing for continued  investment in the youth estate.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have told the Minister of Education that I share her  ambition to add to her Department&rsquo;s capital resources from funds freed up by  further asset disposals to enhance her capital programme.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety  has not only the largest spend of any Northern Ireland Department, but it has  also been allocated an increasing share of the overall resource budget in  recent years.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The proposed Budget allocation of an additional &pound;450  million by 2010-11 will enable the Department to meet all of its very  substantial cost pressures over the Budget period, including inflationary  pressures in respect of pay, non-pay and pharmaceuticals.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That will be the largest amount of money ever invested in  the Health Service in Northern    Ireland and the largest share of available  resources ever allocated for investment in the health and well-being of our  community, which reflects the importance that the Executive attach to that key  service.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The proposed allocation will address many of the key determinants of ill health as well as issues  of actual illness. That includes reducing the number of persons  institutionalised in learning-disability and mental-health hospitals, as well  as a reduction in hospital admissions for those suffering from severe chronic  disease, such as heart disease or respiratory conditions.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There should also be increased access to specialist drugs,  as well as improvements in cardiovascular and cancer services, with the aim of  reducing the mortality rates associated with those illnesses. The proposed  allocation will also enable the Department to provide additional resources to  public-health programmes, including those aimed at reducing the level of  suicide in society.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The draft Budget provides significant capital resources for  investment in the Health Service. That recognises  the importance of providing a complementary service with investment in  primary- and community-care programmes, acute hospitals and local hospitals.</p>	      
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The proposed Budget allocation for the Department of  Agriculture and Rural Development (DARD) will enable it to continue to support  the improved performance of local farmers in the marketplace through lifelong  learning at the College of Agriculture, Food and Rural Enterprise, the  provision of processing and marketing grants, and the delivery of agrifood  scientific programmes by the Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The allocation will also enable DARD to provide full  funding of the 2007-13 Northern    Ireland rural development programme and to  address rural poverty.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The programme is worth &pound;500 million and is aimed at  improving the competitiveness of the agriculture and forestry sector, improving  the environment and the countryside, and contributing towards improving quality  of life in rural areas and the diversification of the rural economy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">DARD will continue to develop a more sustainable  environment through: further increasing the public and <span style="letter-spacing:-.2pt; ">private forest area; developing more sustainable fisheries;</span> and  producing flood-protection measures through the Rivers Agency.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure will want to  attend to matters that concern the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games. The  proposed Budget allocation of an additional &pound;18 million by 2010-11 to <span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt; ">that Department should enable it to increase  participation</span> of local people in sport and physical recreation through  the phased implementation of the strategy for sport and physical recreation. As  I have indicated, that allocation will help to realise significantly the  benefits that the 2012 Olympic Games and Paralympic Games will bring to Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, the proposed Budget allocation will enhance  the accessibility of information on our cultural assets, enabling as many people as possible to experience, and, I  hope, appreciate the excellence of our cultural assets. The proposals should  facilitate growth in the activities that are funded by the Ulster-Scots Agency  in line with what was negotiated at St Andrews.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department for Regional Development will experience  average annual growth in its budget of 6&middot;4% over the period to 2010-11. That  growth does not include the funding for water and sewerage services, which is  being considered separately. The growth will enable  the Department to implement a range of measures, in particular the  extension in the incoming financial year of the concessionary-fares scheme to  those who are over 60 years of age. Like the First Minister, I appreciate that  particular project, and I am glad that I have been able to comment on it before  I need to use it and am required to declare an interest.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The draft Budget allocation will also allow continuation of  work on a number of major roads schemes on the key transport corridors, most  notably the improvement work on the Westlink, as well as completion of the  dualling of the A1 Belfast-border route, and the A4 from Dungannon to  Ballygawley. In addition, further funding will be available for structural  maintenance, reversing the short-sighted decision that direct rule Ministers  made in reducing funding for that essential activity.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The draft Budget also makes provision for a major bus- and  train-replacement programme to ensure that a modern, high-quality service is  provided. Preparation on the introduction of a rapid transit scheme in the  greater Belfast  area will be advanced, and the draft Programme for Government sees the  Executive setting their target for work starting on that project.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The proposed allocations should allow the Department of the  Environment to implement an enhanced approach to road safety and to establish  an environmental crime team. Although my statement says &ldquo;environmental crime  team&rdquo;, I hope that we have set up an anti-crime team. The purpose of that team  will be to combat the illegal dumping of waste, which is a serious issue.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, and in direct response to concerns that  Members and other stakeholders have raised, the <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt; ">proposed draft Budget allocation will allow the Minister</span> of the  Environment to further reform our planning system. The aim is to develop  reforms that will enable the planning system to play its part in delivering on our  Programme for Government priorities, particularly by contributing to growing a  dynamic, innovative and sustainable economy. The Minister of the Environment  wants to advance proposals to fast-track job-related planning applications.  That initiative should be encouraged, and it needs to be properly resourced.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The draft Budget will part fund the capital costs that  district councils will incur in complying with the EU landfill directive  targets, thus reducing the financial burden on local ratepayers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The draft Budget allocation for the Department for Social  Development will facilitate the continued modernisation of social security  services and welfare reform over the period to 2010-11. That will enable the  provision of improved services to clients.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">1.00 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In respect of the voluntary and community sector, the draft  Budget will enable the establishment of a charities commission for Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">With regard to capital, the Department will be able to make  some progress towards the achievement of the target of delivering 10,000 new  social housing completions over the next five years, in conjunction with its  goal of eradicating fuel poverty in the most vulnerable of households.  Moreover, I am a fully signed-up member of  the Social Development Minister&rsquo;s club, which aims to aid her in  identifying further land disposals that may  become available in order to increase the number of affordable and  social housing units that she can deliver.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">On the matter of town and city-centre regeneration, the  draft Budget provides significant resources for a number of initiatives that  will have a positive impact on social and economic issues. The draft Budget  allocation will allow the Office of the First and deputy First Minister  (OFMDFM) to deliver a new compre&shy;hensive approach to victims and survivors,  including the appointment of a Commissioner for Victims.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My Department will also work to enhance the rights of older  people. The higher-than-average increase in the OFMDFM budget is linked to the  additional costs associated with the restoration of devolution.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As far as my own Department is concerned, the main focus  over the Budget period will be to advance the process of Civil Service reform  and to set the foundations for modern, high-quality and efficient public  services that will allow further resources to be redirected to front-line  services.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We must ensure that public services match the standards  that our community now expects. That means investing in new technology and the  new systems that are required to support modern and more efficient ways of  delivering high-quality services. The Department will also enable the necessary  preparations for the delivery of the 2011 census, and allow Land and Property  Services to conduct a revaluation of non-domestic properties.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I will also introduce Northern   Ireland&rsquo;s equivalent to New York&rsquo;s &ldquo;311&rdquo; scheme. When it is fully  rolled out, that scheme will enable the public to reach all Government  Departments by using the same three-digit telephone number.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The draft Budget proposes new financial allocations for  Departments. In every case, Ministers would like to have been allocated more,  had more been available. However, that also  underlines the importance of ensuring further improvements in the  quality of financial management in Departments. If Departments have argued  successfully for more money, they must ensure that they spend that money when  they said they would. <span style="letter-spacing:-.05pt; ">I will therefore be  monitoring Departments&rsquo; under</span>spend figures  in the future, and will report those figures to the Finance and Personnel Committee and to the Assembly.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The spending proposals  contained in the draft Budget will now be subject to consultation with  the Assembly, its Committees and the community. The Committees and the wider  community will want to examine those proposals  and comment on them. However, this exercise needs to be earthed in  reality if it is to be worthwhile. There is no point in simply stating that  more money must be spent in this Department or on that project, without recognising that some other allocation  will have to be reduced to make way for such additional funding.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We also need to ensure that consultation includes scrutiny  of how Ministers allocate money to priorities in their Departments. Setting a  new direction for public spending cannot just mean spending more money &mdash; it must also mean spending existing money more effect&shy;ively,  in line with our priorities. It is not just a question of how much we spend; it  is also a question of how well that money is spent.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Earlier this year, I  informed the Assembly that I would carry out a review of the policy on  industrial derating that we inherited from direct rule Ministers. Like other  Members, I have met representatives of the manufact&shy;uring sector to hear their  concerns. The Department commissioned a study from the Economic Research  Institute of Northern Ireland (ERINI), and I have received its preliminary  report. The final report is expected within days. In the light of that  preliminary report and, in particular, of the institute&rsquo;s assessment that there is a risk to some of our manufacturing  firms in phasing out derating, the  best approach would be to hold the current level of rates at 30% over  the CSR period.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is simply no point in making economic development our top priority while, potentially,  making life even more difficult for certain key businesses. I would have  preferred it if the Committee had been able to  address the subject before I had to make any judge&shy;ment but the timing  of the Budget has intervened and I am  required to make the call. However, before our final <span style="letter-spacing:-.25pt; ">Budget position is agreed in January 2008, the Co</span>mmittee  for Finance and Personnel will have  considered ERINI&rsquo;s final report, and the Executive will have had the  opportunity to take a strategic look at the whole issue in light of the  evidence presented. I believe that the Executive must demonstrate their  encouragement for our manufacturing industries with more than words.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My final announcement  is on the regional rate. In the last three years there have been  regional rate increases of 9%, 19% and 6% respectively. Under direct rule,  similar increases were planned for the years ahead. In fact, the average  regional rate bill has increased by 62% since 2002, and, too often, that  additional money has funded Government  inefficiency rather than front-line services.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The cushion of  above-inflation regional rate increases encouraged the Government to  avoid tackling bureau&shy;cracy and waste. Now  is the time to remove that comfort blanket and demand that the  Government share the strain that ratepayers have borne for years.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Our approach must reflect the decisions on water that were  outlined in the statement to the Assembly by the Minister for Regional  Development last Monday. We have given the commitment that households will see  the benefit of the contribution that they already make to the cost of water  through their regional rates payments, which is an average of &pound;160 per rates  bill. I believe that we need to go further. We must ensure that each household  sees the full benefits of that in their rates bills as we introduce new  arrangements for increased contributions from households towards the cost of  water over the next three years.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If we were to introduce parallel increases to regional  rates bills, no matter how small, at the same time as we are phasing in the new  water arrangements, we would be seen as giving with one hand and taking away  with the other.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, in addition to the reduction of an average of  &pound;160 per rates bill from 2009-10 I propose that we should freeze the domestic  regional rate for the next three years. This represents a cut in real terms in  the regional rate and offers much needed relief to every ratepayer.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Devolution is about making a difference. In the area of local taxation, during the coming four-year  Assembly term the average householder in Northern Ireland will be more  than &pound;1,000 better off than would have been the case if direct rule had  continued and direct rule proposals had been implemented.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The position is different for the business regional rate as  there have been more modest increases in their bills, averaging about 3&middot;3% over  the past five years. However, over the next few years, businesses will also  face increased water costs, therefore, I propose that we commit to reduce the  average increase in their rates to 2&middot;7% a year for the next three years. That  is the level of inflation forecast for the next three years, and will maintain their contribution at present levels in  real terms.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The first draft Budget  for the new Administration sets a new direction for Northern Ireland.  It is the first step in a new journey that  we are all embarking upon together. The challenges and opportunities  facing Northern Ireland  have never been greater and will increase in the years ahead. The old answer of  ever-increasing public spending is no longer available. Yesterday&rsquo;s solutions  will not solve tomorrow&rsquo;s challenges. Only a relentless commitment to delivery,  innovation and efficiency will allow public spending to deliver the kind of  outcomes that we all wish to see.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">This draft Budget not only seeks to move Northern Ireland  in the right direction for the next three years, but seeks to set its  trajectory for decades to come.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Even though, as a result of the comprehensive spending review, growth in public spending in Nort<span style="letter-spacing:0pt; ">hern Ireland</span> is lower than has been the case in recent years,  the draft Budget announces the highest-ever level of public spending in Northern Ireland.  However, the real success or failure of the draft Budget will not turn on what  is spent, but on what is delivered. It is not the input, but the output, that  will count with the public.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have announced the highest-ever spending plans for Northern Ireland;  made the economy the number-one priority; and delivered a freeze in the  regional rate. The draft Budget offers some much-needed relief to householders  and a platform on which to grow the economy. Ultimately, devolution will be  judged on its ability to make a difference to people&rsquo;s lives.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The draft Budget will allow the Executive and the Assembly  to deliver for the people of Northern    Ireland during the next three years. It will  allow Northern Ireland  to build a stable, fair and prosperous future. I commend the draft Budget to  the Assembly.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Finance and Personnel (Mr McLaughlin)</strong>: I congratulate  the Minister on the presentation of the new Executive&rsquo;s first draft Budget. I  welcome the draft Budget and the Minister&rsquo;s statement, which together are an  important step forward for the Assembly, setting out the clear intention to map  out a social and economic step change for everyone in the community. That is  why people have such hope for this Executive.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee for Finance and Personnel, in concert with  all the scrutiny Committees, will examine the minute detail of the draft  Budget. My Committee will also take the  views of the other statutory Committees on the draft budgets of their  respective Departments and will produce a co-ordinated report on the draft  Budget before the Christmas recess. Clearly, all of that is predicated on the  timeline laid down by the Minister for final decision being met.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee will also table a motion for full debate on  the draft Budget and hopes that the outcome of its report will inform and influence  the Executive when they produce a revised Budget statement in January. One key issue among many that have  exercised my Committee is the culture of underspend, which has persisted  for years in Government Departments. The Minister has addressed that issue,  both in the Budget and in his statement. What steps does he envisage can be  taken to improve financial forecasting, monitoring and spend in Departments in  order to eradicate the culture of underspend and to ensure that there is  delivery on the strategic spending priorities?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  I thank the Chairman of the Committee for  Finance and Personnel for his comments. I hope that, in the coming weeks  and months, my officials and I can work  with the Committee to examine the documentation with which it has been  provided and to answer the searching questions that I have no doubt it will  ask. Of course, the Executive will be happy to participate in any debate that  the Committee may seek to bring to the Assembly.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In relation to underspending, the Chairman has put his  finger on a key issue that will affect the Executive&rsquo;s ability to do the job  that they have outlined in the draft Programme for Government and, indeed, in  the draft Budget. As I said in my statement, it is absolutely essential that,  when Ministers come to me to make a strong case for spending programmes and  projects &mdash; and convince me to the extent that they are provided with money &mdash;  they actually spend that money within the  timeframes that have been set. The backcloth against which that issue must be considered is the fact  that there is no automatic access to end-year flexibility. Money that is  not spent during the course of the financial year is tightly controlled by the  Treasury. That brings the Executive to a position where we must bid for that  money and argue for it, and we will not always get it when we want it or in the  quantity that it is needed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, it is absolutely essential that each Department  can meet the type of spending proposals that it has indicated that it wishes to  take forward. It will be impossible for every Department to be able to meet  exactly &mdash; on a pound basis &mdash; the allocation that has been made to it.  Nevertheless, Departments must substantially work towards that. That is a  matter on which I want to recruit the Chairman and members of the Committee for  Finance and Personnel, who will play a powerful role in that exercise.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Unlike the situation  under direct rule, the Assembly&rsquo;s Committees have a scrutiny role. That  means that the Committee for Finance and Personnel will be able to monitor  departmental spending throughout the year, thereby ensuring that Departments  meet their targets. I hope that the Committee will be tough on Ministers &mdash;  including me &mdash; if they do not meet those targets. Together, we can ensure much better  performance than has been the case heretofore.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">1.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I congratulate the Minister of Finance and Personnel on his Budget. He will  know that people in constituencies such as Strangford were hammered hard by  direct rule&rsquo;s double-digit regional rate increases. I am sure that those people  will warmly welcome the Minister&rsquo;s announcement that he intends to freeze the  regional rate over the next three years, effectively providing a cut in the  regional rate.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am also sure that Northern Ireland&rsquo;s manufacturers  will particularly welcome the Minister&rsquo;s announcement that industrial rates  will be held at their present level. Will the Minister explain to the House how  the average householder in Northern    Ireland will be better off by &pound;1,000 over the period of the Assembly&rsquo;s current mandate as compared to direct rule?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  Already, householders in Northern    Ireland are considerably financially  advantaged by the existing devolved Administration. The first step that the  direct rule Administration would have taken &mdash; if there had not been devolution  &mdash; would have been to introduce the first  phase of water charging in the current financial year. That would have  constituted one third of the overall expected bill. That charge would have increased to two thirds in the following year,  and would have increased to the full charge in the year after that.  Under the proposal announced by the Minister for Regional Development, there  will not be a charge for water in the current financial year, or in the next.  Already, for water alone, there is a significant saving, and a consequent  reduction thereafter.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As for rates, the pattern is &mdash; as indicated in my statement  &mdash; that rates had increased in Northern    Ireland by over 60% in a five-year period.  There has been an increase of 37% in the regional rate in the past three years.  That is why the ratepayer in Northern    Ireland deserves some relief. However, I  would not like to see local government taking advantage of the regional rate  being frozen by increasing the district rate. I hope that, rather than take  advantage of that, local government will attempt to mirror what has been done  by the Executive, and that we can keep down the burden on ratepayers in Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  The Budget is one of the tightest that we have  experienced in Northern    Ireland in recent years, with only a  1&middot;2% increase in real-terms spending. Will the Minister agree that, although  the regional rate will be frozen over the  next three years, in the long term signi&shy;ficantly more money will be  raised from householders when regional rates and water rates are combined?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Will he also give some  indication on how the Varney Review can have a significant impact in  achieving his primary focus in the Budget &mdash; economic growth? Are there any indications yet of significant changes  that will help businesses and job creation in Northern Ireland?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>: The Minister for Regional Develop&shy;ment set out the agreed  position of each of the four parties in the Executive on phasing in water  charges. Rightly, he indicated that &mdash; in  line with all our commit&shy;ments during the election campaign &mdash; we will  not allow people to be forced to pay twice for their water.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We have therefore reduced the rates bills by &pound;160 for the year in which payment will begin; the  Consumer Council for Northern    Ireland, my Department and the review panel  have all agreed that that is an appropriate figure. The very reason why I want  to freeze rates over the period is to take account of the phasing-in of the  water charge and allow it to be assimilated, rather than applying further  pressures through the regional rate.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member asked about Sir David Varney&rsquo;s review. I have  not yet seen the report. Bits and pieces of information have started to vibrate  around the system, and, as I understand it, the report is likely to take the  form of an economic analysis that indicates the strengths and weaknesses of our  economy, rather than providing a set of recommendations. It will therefore be  left to the Chancellor to determine what action will be taken on that matter.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My best guess is that, in responding, the Chancellor is  likely to deal with the kind of instruments that would help our economy, rather than simply consider financial inputs.  We are likely to be talking about schemes and projects  to encourage investment in our economy and to improve skills and  training. I hope that the Chancellor will consider those types of issues. The  First Minister indicated earlier that no stone will be left unturned as regards the pressure that the entire Executive  will apply to get the best deal possible from the Chancellor, and from  the United Kingdom Government as a whole.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his statement on the draft Budget. It is very important  that we not talk down our potential. I want to say clearly at the outset that I  believe that this is a real Budget that involves real decisions.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As the Minister has said, rises in public spending have  been very substantial in recent years, although they are now much less so.  Nonetheless, there has been a real rise in public expenditure. I am sorry to  hear that the increase is 1&middot;2% per annum in  real terms rather than the previously publicised figure of 1&middot;7%.  Nevertheless, it is an increase.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I congratulate the Minister on his welcome emphasis on  efficiency in Government. Inefficiency has been a perennial problem that has  not been easy to crack. We must all play a part in addressing that issue  through our different roles in the Assembly. It has been too easy to simply  raise more revenue. I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s freezing of the domestic regional  rate to cushion the imposition of water charges and the similar restriction on  the rise in the business regional rate.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have three brief questions. First, can the Minister  assure me that the end-year flexibility (EYF) figure of &pound;295 million is not  included in the 1&middot;2% increase in real terms in depart&shy;mental spending?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, I note that the Minister said that the Department  will:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;make some progress towards the achievement of the  target of delivering 10,000 new social housing completions&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That language strikes me as being somewhat more cautious than that which was used in the earlier  statement on the draft Programme for Government. Can he give me a clear  assurance of his commitment to providing those much-needed social houses?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Thirdly, the Minister referred to the report on the cost of  division, and then immediately went on to say that:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;we can make savings with different arrangements to  educate our children&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Can he assure me that he is not planning an  onslaught against the Catholic education system?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>: I thank the Member for his generous comments about the draft  Budget, particularly the proposals on the regional rate and industrial  derating.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member&rsquo;s first question was about EYF, and I can give  him an assurance that the additional amount that we managed to secure from the  Chancellor is not included in the 1&middot;2%. The  collective figures are provided in the draft Budget, although I accept  that Members must trawl through 120 pages to find them. However, in my view,  the figure of 1&middot;2% reflects the real-term growth &mdash; the Chancellor might say  1&middot;7%, but he adjusted the baselines. In my view, the honest figure for the  Assembly to work from is 1&middot;2%, which does not include the EYF figure.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member commented on my more cautious use of language  when talking about social housing. He will know that I am always very cautious  in my use of language. However, that says nothing about my determination to  address the need for social housing.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am at one with the  Minister for Social Development in seeking to secure every pound  possible to meet our targets. I have  indicated to her that putting the targets in the Programme for  Government places responsibility on the  whole Executive to provide the funding necessary to ensure that they are  met. The targets will not be met just by supplying cash to build houses; there  are other important aspects, not least the use of article 40 of the Planning (Northern Ireland)  Order 1991 to ensure that a proportion of each large development is set aside  for social and affordable housing. Releasing additional land by all Departments  &mdash; not just the Minister for Social Development&rsquo;s &mdash; will give us the flexibility  to move towards those targets, which are undoubtedly challenging. A target is  of no value unless it requires us to stretch.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  am not sure that Mr O&rsquo;Loan should have been so welcoming of the Budget, given  that the SDLP&rsquo;s Minister&rsquo;s Department is one of the few that will have its budget cut in real terms over the  three-year period. Nonetheless, I welcome the economic thrust of the  Budget while stressing that delivery is critical.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">What are the projections for the public share of GDP over  the lifespan of the Budget, given that we are starting from a baseline of 71%?  This morning, the First Minister said that gross value added (GVA) conversions  were a target for OFMDFM and the Executive. However, the goalposts are being  moved towards us because the south-east of England is being excluded from GVA  calculations. Will the Minister confirm that we are lowering our sights?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Budget was also supposed to contain the regional  economic strategy: has that been included in the  Minister&rsquo;s statement? I note that we are still focusing on essentially  the same four drivers that were in the draft regional economic strategy and  that attracted so much criticism by the business sector. How does the Minister anticipate making a step change in our  economy if we do not have the tools to do so?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is no provision in the Budget for a differential rate of corporation tax in the event of that  being granted by the Varney Review. Under the terms of the Azores ruling, that  provision must be made. Does the Minister&rsquo;s statement do what it says on  the tin?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  The Member&rsquo;s questions would have been better if he had been given more time to  think of them and some assistance in their compilation. The Executive, in their  Programme for Government, quite rightly felt that the proper GVA comparison  that we should make is with that of the UK  after the south-east of England  has been removed. That is the level that we hope to achieve. We have already  moved ahead of Wales, in GVA  per capita, and Scotland is  in our sights, but the average UK  level is our target. It will not be achieved in one year or three; the target  set by the direct rule Administration was a 0&middot;5% increase in GVA over a 10-year  period, so we are being considerably more ambitious.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I thought that the Member was someone who wanted to  encourage the additional productivity that is needed to increase GVA; encourage  exports from Northern    Ireland, and encourage foreign direct  investment (FDI). If bad-mouthing every document produced is all that the  Alliance Party has to offer, then that is a fairly poor contribution to make to  a very serious debate. The Member is usually much more positive on matters &mdash;  perhaps he got out of the wrong side of bed this morning.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Regardless of whether that is a party line that the  Alliance Party feels it must take, Northern Ireland has an excellent  opportunity over the next number of years to  grow its economy considerably. It gets that opportunity on foot of the  stability and progress that is being made. The fact that our business community  is indicating its enthusiasm and confidence  in the economy to DFP shows that we have that opportunity. I say to the  Member for North Down: do not talk Northern Ireland down.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">1.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I remind Members that the Speaker has asked that the questions be brief  and to the point so that the Minister can  answer as many questions as possible. We must move in that direction.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  am sure that the Minister will be delighted to hear that I will ask him only  one question, rather than five or six. I welcome the Budget &mdash; it is clear that  it is a Budget for economic growth, which will be welcomed by ratepayers and  manufacturers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Budget will also be welcomed by prudent local councils.  Over the last several years, councils that have sought to be efficient and prudent,  such as my own council in North Down, have been overwhelmed by massive regional  rates rises and found that all their good work was somewhat undone. The Budget  will be welcomed not simply because of the freezing of the regional rate, but  for the support that has been given to help meet EU targets. In his statement,  the Minister rightly highlighted that the link between the level of council tax  in England,  and our ability to borrow under the RRI initiative &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  This is a short question?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  will obviously aspire to &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong><span style="letter-spacing:-.3pt; ">Mr Deputy Speaker</span></strong>: Will  the Member ask a question?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  always aspire to the level of brevity of the Member for Lagan Valley,  although I do not always succeed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister said that the link between the level of council  tax in England  and our ability to borrow under the RRI initiative was successfully removed  during the negotiations with the Chancellor in May and earlier this year. Can the Minister indicate what the implication  of that change is for the Budget, compared to what was negotiated by the last  Executive?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>: I thank the Member for North Down; I am glad that there are some optimistic people living in that  constituency. I have announced a business-friendly Budget; the business  community will welcome it, as it has long wanted to see an Executive that are  prepared to put the economy at the centre of their priorities, to seek growth  in the economy and to encourage the business community by reducing some the  pressures on it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The reinvestment and  reform initiative was introduced by the previous Executive, and it is a  good initiative. It provides additional  borrowing capacity, which is welcome to the Executive. The constraint  that the Chancellor applied to the previous Executive was that they could not have access to the reinvestment and reform  initiative unless they narrowed the gap between local taxation here and in Great Britain. Therefore, Northern Ireland&rsquo;s rates rises were governed by the level of rises  in Great Britain.  That is what caused our rates to go up by 19%. That was not because we needed a  19% rise here, or because people could afford it, but because people in Great  Britain had that rise and it had to be mirrored in order for the Executive to  have access to RRI.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If that link had not been broken in our negotiations with  the Chancellor, there would not have been a freeze on the regional rate. Over  the next three years, under direct rule, the rates were set to increase by more  than 10% per annum. Anyone who wants to consider that, on top of the additional  water charges that people would already be paying, will know the real benefit  that devolution is bringing to the pocket of Mr, Mrs and Ms Average.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Anderson</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat. I thank the Minister for his statement. I also thank him  for his answer to the last question because I welcome the fact that the  Executive have been able to abolish what became known as the &ldquo;Durkan tax&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The draft Programme for Government clearly states that the resources from public expenditure and  economic growth should be used to tackle existing patterns of  disadvantage and target those in greatest objective need. Will the Minister  detail how the draft Budget meets that objective?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  From my earliest days at the Dispatch Box, I have made it clear that a massive  imperative has, unquestionably, been placed on the Executive to work towards  economic growth in Northern    Ireland, particularly at a time when there  is a window of opportunity. However, we should not be unmindful of the  vulnerable in society who need the most help, whether they are young people,  older people or other sections of the community. Unless the Assembly makes a  difference to the lives of everyone in society, it is not making the best use  of devolution.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I cannot micromanage the Departments that are responsible  for dealing with issues at the coalface, but the increase in departmental  allocations enables the Ministers to put in place the necessary funds that will  make the biggest possible difference.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The draft Budget is based on the current available funding.  However, there are, potentially, two additional sources of income. The first  arises from the work of the PEDU, which will examine the resources of every  Department to establish what additional efficiencies can be made to allow money  to go to the front line, where it is of greatest value. The second potential  source of further income comes from the consideration of whether there is more  of an asset base that can be used to fund new projects.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Potentially, they have a critical role in providing the  cherry on top of the cake, by enabling Ministers to do what they urgently want  to do, but are constrained from doing by the size of the current cake that the  Assembly has been given.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  I too congratulate the Minister on bringing forth a draft Budget, the prudence  of which will help to alleviate the pressure on hard-pressed taxpayers. At the  same time, it introduces innovative spending programmes that will help to  improve infrastructure and, I hope, the economic structures.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have three questions  for the Minister. Funding from the Irish Republic  will be available for several road projects. However, one such project, the  upgrading of the A8, is not included in the draft Budget. Has that project now  been ruled out of receiving funding for the next  three years of the comprehensive spending review?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister made much  of the fact that Departments have underspent. Often, it was capital  underspending, which is partly due to difficulties with public finance  initiatives. What steps is his Department taking to ensure that the delays in PFI schemes are not due to the  procurement method that is used, which subsequently leads to an underspend?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, given that the draft Budget is based on the  Barnett formula, which included an increase, in real terms, of 2&middot;5% in spending  on education in GB, why is that not reflected in the spending on education in  today&rsquo;s proposal?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  I will deal with the questions in reverse order. None of the spending plans  that the Chancellor provided for GB are reflected here because of devolution.  We decide our priorities; we slice up our cake to reflect local interests and  our knowledge of where the need lies. The Assembly does not mirror the  percentages that are attributed in GB.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Were it to do so, the Health Minister would be extremely  upset today at the significant reduction in baseline spending on health in Great Britain.  However, that reduction has not been passed  on to the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety here.  That is just one example of how essential it is that we take decisions, as a  devolved Government, based on the priorities in Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I recognise that the Member has not had a great opportunity to look at the documents in detail.  However, if he looks at the draft investment strategy, he will see  reference to the A8 there. Happily, therefore, he will be able to get into the  &lsquo;East Antrim Times&rsquo; to tell people that progress is going to be made.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  And I will give the Minister the appropriate praise.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  I welcome that; coming from the honourable gentleman, it is praise indeed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As regards PFI schemes, the Member is well aware &mdash; as he  worked very closely with me in east Belfast  before going to greener pastures &mdash; of my misgivings about PFI. It is not a  concept that I am ideologically connected to. I look at PFIs and PPPs to see  whether they are the right solution for a particular set of circumstances, or  whether other procurement methods would be better.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member has put his finger on one of the issues that has  caused massive problems. In my own constit&shy;uency, there have been massive  delays because of PFI schemes. That is something that the Ministers who are pushing those forward &mdash; and particularly, in OFMDFM,  the SIB &mdash; need to tackle. We must oil those wheels to ensure that we do not  have inordinate delays in the rolling-out of those schemes. The Member has,  rightly, identified an issue that has to be tackled. It has not been tackled in  the past, and it is a challenge for this Executive to do it effectively.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>: I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s announce&shy;ment on the regional rate  and industrial derating.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Turning to health, the Minister will know that there has been a 4% increase in spending in GB, yet Northern    Ireland&rsquo;s spend is only increasing by 1&middot;2%. Does he feel that that divergence is  sustainable? Does he accept that the Barnett formula may now be working against  us in the area of health spending?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Also, if children and  young people are to be a priority, can  the Minister guarantee that he will address the 30% underfunding of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s children&rsquo;s services?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  I think it might be worthwhile to put the health debate into a proper context.  I have to provide allocations for 11 Departments, three minor Departments and  this Assembly. The funding total for all of those together is such that almost  48% of the total amount goes to one  Department: the Department of Health. It is very clear that health is a very  significant priority for this Executive. Not only that, but the Minister of Health will have more money at his disposal  in the next three years than any of his predecessors have ever had.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  Where is he?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>: I hope that he is using the allocations to good effect and  opening new health provisions around the Province. I recognise that we cannot  have all the Ministers here at all times; however, it would show some  solidarity with the Executive as a whole if each Minister could be here at some  point.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As far as health is concerned, I also want to point out  that not only does the Minister of Health have the highest health budget ever  in Northern Ireland, he also has the largest-ever percentage of the Northern  Ireland block for his Department. That indicates the priority that we have  given to health.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is no question that, with Health as with every other Department, the ambition of the Minister  outstrips the resources available. During the course of the next three  years, at in-year monitoring rounds and whenever any other money may be freed  up through the work of the two new units that we have established, we will  obviously look at the pressures that every Department faces.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As far as children and young people are concerned, the  previous Administration had the Secretary of State set up a fund that  particularly identified children and young people and allocated money to them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">This Executive&rsquo;s decision &mdash; and I believe it was the right  one &mdash; was that along with the establishment of funds from the centre goes a duplication of bureaucracy. That  simply wastes money; therefore, it was felt that the best people to deal with  those issues were the Ministers in the appropriate Departments. OFMDFM has a  particular function in relation to children and young people, and it will  exercise that function in a co-ordinating way in putting forward policies that  can be pursued. However, delivery of those policies will come from the various  Departments.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The money previously set by the direct rule admin&shy;istration  and identified particularly for children and young  people was allocated as part of the overall Budget to all of the  Departments; as a result, therefore, the water  rose for everyone. It was then up to each Minister, particularly those who had responsibility for that  matter, to determine its priority in his or her funding. Having looked  at some of those rankings, I decided, in the allocation of additional money  received from EYF and as a result of the Barnett consequentials, to recommend  to the Executive that I put in a further &pound;21 million pounds, specifically  identified to help the Ministers in relation to children and young people.  Therefore, I take the matter very seriously, and I hope that, throughout the  year, I can be of even further assistance to the various Ministers in that  regard.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">1.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Commmittee for Enterprise,  Trade and Investment (Mr Durkan)</strong>: I congratulate the Minister on his  statement and on a very good Budget plan, in the context of what has been a  very tight CSR round, not only with regard to this year&rsquo;s allocations but over  the three-year period. I commend the Minister for what he has set out today  and, through him, his Executive colleagues. It involved decisions that were not  always easy, and implementing them will not be easy. All of us who are tasked  on Committees must, therefore, bear that in mind over the next few years.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A week is a long time in politics. Last week, the Minister  of Finance seemed to want to &ldquo;club&rdquo; the Minister for Social Development. Today,  he joins her club, and I welcome that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As Chairperson of the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Investment, I particularly  welcome the indications of the budget increases in that area over the coming  years; however, again, I agree with him that we must make sure that that money  is used to get real productive impact in the economy and not just extra  activity at Government level.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">With regard to cash releasing, in his statement, the  Minister identified &pound;790 million that will be delivered by 2010-11. Is that in  addition to the &pound;800 million that the Chancellor indicated in his package, or  is it that the same &pound;800 million? Similarly,  with regard to the capital realisation task force that was announced in  an earlier statement, will that be aimed at making sure that we actually get  the &pound;800 million in asset sales that was identified in the Chancellor&rsquo;s  package, or was that about identifying extra asset sales?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  I thank the Member for Foyle for his kind comments about the Budget statement.  He is right to identify that setting a programme out is one thing, and  implementing it is another. It will, I hope, be the task of all Ministers and  all parties to ensure that we can make good the commitments that were made in  this House today.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I assure the Member that I am quite happy to be in the same  club as the Minister for Social Development. In  no circumstances would I want to &ldquo;club&rdquo; the Minister; I simply want her  to operate by the same club rules as everyone else. I may return to that theme  in future &mdash; to do so now would be to break the harmony of this occasion.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I assume that the Member refers to the &pound;790 million from  efficiencies. Those efficiencies have been identified by our Ministers, and not  by the direct rule administration.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">People will read the publication, and they will consider  the fact that there will be a real terms increase of approximately 1&middot;2%.  However, if the Departments make the efficiency savings that are required, the  outcome over three years will be significant. All the Ministers have proposed  efficiency savings, therefore the percentage for each of the Departments,  including those savings, will increase to the high teens and the low twenties,  as those efficiencies will be released within the system.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There was a comment, snide or otherwise, from the Alliance  Benches, that Mr O&rsquo;Loan should not have thanked me for the draft Budget,  considering the allocation that has been given to the Department for Social  Development. Nevertheless, three Departments will receive allocations beyond  the figures that are provided here. The Department for Employment and Learning  and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment will receive innovation  funding, which is not included in our global figures. We also hope that the  Department for Social Development will receive benefits that will accrue  through the Pathways to Work scheme, from the Department for Work and Pensions  in the UK to our block in Northern Ireland.  I hope that I am not leaking one of the great Executive secrets &mdash; if there are  any left &mdash; but they made it clear that they would look favourably on directly  passing those benefits to the Department for Social Development. That would  have a substantial impact on its budget.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I  congratulate the Executive and the Minister of Finance and Personnel for  bringing forward the draft Budget. I doubt  whether this time last year anyone would have believed that we would be  debating a draft Budget and a future Programme for Government today, but it is  good to be in this position.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The draft Budget will now go out for public scrutiny and for scrutiny by Assembly Committees. Earlier in  the week, I touched base with the Minister on the proposed performance  and efficiency delivery unit. When will he be in a position to give us the full  remit and scope of that unit? How will those &ldquo;respected individuals&rdquo; will be  selected? What reporting mechanisms will the unit have to the Assembly?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  This morning, I met with the Chairperson and the Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for Finance and Personnel. I told them  that it would be worthwhile if the  Committee, or its Chairperson or Deputy Chairperson, were to meet those  who will be involved in the performance and efficiency delivery unit and those  who will be involved in the capital realisation taskforce. Their  representatives will be happy to talk to the Committee about the task ahead and  about how they intend to undertake it. Ultimately, I am responsible for such  issues, so I can be brought before the House or the Committee at any time.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that I am wrong, but I get the impression that the  Member fears the existence of a performance and efficiency delivery unit. I  believe that it is overwhelm&shy;ingly in the interests of everyone in the Assembly  that such a unit is encouraged, that it goes about its job, and that it finds  cash-releasing savings that can be pumped into front-line services. There is  nothing for anyone in the Assembly to fear. Within days, we will provide the Committee for Finance and Personnel and the Executive  with the remit for the performance and efficiency delivery unit. The Office of  the First Minister and the deputy First Minister has issued letters to  Committee members regarding the establishment of the capital realisation  taskforce.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member has a particular interest from an audit point of  view, and my Department will be happy to copy  him into that correspondence. However, Members must encourage those two  units to do their jobs, because they can release funds that can be used on top  of the draft Budget that has been announced today.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>: I  welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement and the challenge that he has issued to local  government to play its part in ensuring prudence in the financial management of  Northern Ireland plc. I also welcome the establishment of the capital  realisation task force and the performance and efficiency delivery unit, and  look forward to engaging with those units to identify further resources that  can be released.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister said in  his statement that some progress had been made in the negotiations with  the Treasury in recent months. Will the  Minister tell the House how this Budget announcement compares with the  Chancellor&rsquo;s package earlier this year?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>: Comparisons with the Chancellor&rsquo;s package can be made in  several ways. We can compare it with where we are now, and the additions that  have been made to that package; or we can compare it with the past. We can  compare it to packages that were brought to the table by others when they  entered negotiations. If those are the criteria for comparison, then the  Assembly will see that the package obtained from the Chancellor on the two occasions  that we met him in Downing Street and the  additions that we have now received, considerably improve our position.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">None of our negotiations with the Chancellor would have  resulted in a package that would have met all of our requirements, but Members  will be aware that &pound;100 million was immediately made available, &pound;70 million of  which was used to forestall the payment of water charges in this financial  year. The remaining &pound;30 million will be allocated in this year and over the  next three years to innovation funding, all of which will help to stimulate Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  economy. We were able to secure a significant change in the operation of the  reinvestment and reform initiative. That has allowed me to hold rates rather  than increase them by probably more than 10%, which would have been the outcome  if we had not negotiated that change in the Chancellor&rsquo;s package.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, we have been able to secure a significantly  higher level of block grant than was offered by the Chancellor. I have already  outlined those figures in my statement and do not want to go through them  again. The Chancellor allowed us to use resources obtained from asset disposal,  which we have taken full use of, and which amounts to about &pound;1&middot;1 billion of  disposal already identified in the investment strategy. As the Member knows, we  are not satisfied with that, and will look for more.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Several other issues arose from the overall package. The  Government of the Irish   Republic advanced  proposals amounting to about &pound;400 million to assist us with two particular road  programmes. Those proposals are progressing, although one of them is unlikely  to fall within the period of the current comprehensive spending review.  However, it will begin as soon as the legal and other processes have been  completed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Government of the Irish Republic  provided funding that we will be able to use as part of our innovation  initiative, and will add to that provided by the UK Government. Along with  European funding, it will create an overall package that will be meaningful for the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment  and the Department for Employment and Learning.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  A Cheann Comhairle, I thank the Minister for his statement on the draft Budget.  It is a big document, which I have only glanced through, but there appears to be a significant focus on the  promotion of the role of the private  sector in building the economy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Does the Minister agree that the public sector also has a  vital role to play in building the economy? Can he assure the House that the  much-needed front-line services that the public sector delivers &mdash; particularly  to the most vulnerable and disadvantaged &mdash; will not be affected by any cuts to  that sector?</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">2.00 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  The debate about the balance between the public and private sectors has been  long. There will be no greater defender of the public sector than the Minister  of Finance and Personnel. I have the highest regard for our Civil Service. Its  officials act impartially and provide us  with the best of information. Civil  servants&rsquo; ideas help Ministers to form their policies. I will defend our  Civil Service against attacks, no matter whence they come. Civil servants are  objective and thorough in their work; however, the Civil Service is at the  forefront of a campaign to reform the way in which it works. The essential  element of reform in this modern day is to ensure that we interface  meaningfully with the public and provide information on services in the  responsive manner that that public deserves.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The reform package that is coming through my Department  will suggest better ways of providing information. Technology, particularly  information technology, will be better utilised for storing and accessing  information on accounts and other data in Northern Ireland; however, I will  not go into that today in any great detail. The Department has also dealt with  Workplace 2010, which is concerned with improving the conditions of the Civil Service. The implementation of a New York-style &ldquo;311&rdquo; system has been  proposed. That would mean that anybody  in Northern Ireland  who wants to contact the public  services will not have to go through 12  pages of the telephone directory to find out who they need to contact;  they will merely need to remember and dial three digits. Staff at a centre who  have been tasked and trained to deal with such queries will put the customer  through to whatever public service they wish to contact. That will make  communicating with the Government much simpler for people.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The reform package goes to the heart of the Executive&rsquo;s draft  Programme for Government, which aims to achieve better interaction and  communication between the Government and the public. The proposed system will further provide us with data that will  inform the decisions that Ministers will take, for example, on issues  such as potholes that must be filled or roads that need to be resurfaced. It  will provide us with the necessary  information on a series of areas of Government life. That data will come  through the system so that we can better serve the public. A bigger public  sector does not necessarily mean a better public sector, and it is a better  public sector towards which we are working.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  As one would expect, I welcome the statement on the draft Budget. Since the  Health Committee&rsquo;s establishment last May,  the implementation of the findings of the &lsquo;Bamford Review of Mental  Health and Learning Disability (Northern Ireland)&rsquo; has been identified as our top priority. There is universal  agreement &mdash; not only in the  Committee, but among other Assembly Members  and the community &mdash; that services for people who have mental-health and  learning disabilities have been seriously and gravely neglected over many  years, and it is only now that the needs of those people are getting the  attention that they deserve. I, therefore, wholeheartedly welcome the  identification of specific resources in the Budget that will begin to address  those issues over the next three years. Will the Minister assure the House that  the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety will be able to  retain any efficiency savings that it identifies to further robustly tackle  this issue over the coming years?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  I have already described the significant portion of the Budget that will be  allocated to the Department of Health,  Social Services and Public Safety and, therefore, will not repeat it.  However, one must recognise that people are living longer, their expectations are rising, and new drugs are coming  on to the market. Those developments open up possibilities that previously  were not considered.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is continuing pressure on the Minister of Health,  Social Services and Public Safety to do more and to do it better, and I  recognise the need for funding. I must hold the position that if efficiencies  are made in Departments, they come back to the centre, and that relates to  efficiencies beyond those that have already been identified by 3% of the Budget  or 5% of administration costs.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, I believe in incentives for Ministers &mdash; as for  others. I would have thought that if a Minister were to come to the Executive after identifying further effi&shy;ciencies, he or she would be in a strong position  to argue with colleagues that, having made those efficiencies from the existing Budget, at least part of those  efficiency savings could be used to fund new programmes. That would be  significant, but the Executive must allocate whatever resources are available.  The Minister of Finance and Personnel  cannot give an overall guarantee that a Minister could do that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, the Health Minister knows my mind on efficiencies.  If he examines the Appleby Report, he will find that there is a significant  fall in productivity among healthcare staff in Northern   Ireland, as opposed to that in England,  Scotland and Wales. If we  could get ourselves up to the same level of productivity as that in GB, that,  in itself, would generate substantial savings in the region of &pound;150 million to  &pound;200 million.</p>
	      <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Speaker in the Chair)</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  There are several measures that I welcome. I welcome the attention on the  economy as the number one driver for the Executive. Further &mdash; and I have  already notified my interest on industrial derating  &mdash; I welcome the fact that the Executive and the Assembly have listened  to the plight of the manufact&shy;uring industry, and that more will be done.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I turn to the  fundamental point &mdash; and I am interested in what the Minister will have  to say: if we are exper&shy;iencing lower levels of employment along with lower  productivity, in essence, we are working harder for less. If, as the draft  Budget states, the problem is not really the  size of the public sector, but the comparatively smaller size of the  private sector, where will we find the people to create that step change in our  economy?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Given that the Minister is the champion for the public  sector &mdash; as he has just said &mdash; and that the premium of 18% for pay rates is the  highest in the United Kingdom, how will he convince people to leave the  security of the public sector to go to work in the private sector? That must  happen in order to generate the wealth that we require to provide for all the  people of Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>: I thank the Member for his remarks, particularly those about  growing the economy, his agreement with that as the prime objective, and his  remarks about industrial derating. I have asked my officials to examine a  series of options on industrial derating.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly, in its pre-devolution mode, sought to have  industrial rates for manufacturing pegged at 25%. I asked for several options, including whether industrial rates  could be reduced to 25%, or whether they could be reduced to zero. Neither of those options was legally  allowable because of EU state-aid rules. Industrial derating is rather a blunt  instrument to give some assistance to the private sector. However, as I have  said to colleagues on several occasions, it is the only instrument that we  have. Therefore, it is right for us to use it, and to use it to the best extent  that we can, within the law.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member&rsquo;s remarks about the public and private sectors  allow for only one logical conclusion &mdash; and I hope  that he will take note of the danger &mdash; which is that public-sector pay must be reduced. The Government  have no control over private-sector wage levels. However, the public  sector is tied up by wage agreements that are largely dictated by the Treasury,  which identifies pay policy as a macroeconomic variable that it wants to control. Therefore, public-sector pay policy is  outside the remit of the Assembly.  We could take such decisions, but we would be punished if those  decisions caused any repercussive effects.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">To address the disparity highlighted by the Member, if the  public sector is the only sector that we can control, we must encourage the  private sector as best we can. The conditions that the Member described, in  which there are fewer people to do the jobs, will result in increased wages.  Where are those people to be found? It is a step process.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">People with university degrees, who currently have  low-value-added jobs, could be doing much more productive work that would repay  society for its investment in their education. However, those people are stuck  in low-value jobs, such as those found in call centres. A healthy  private-sector economy would enable such people to move into higher-value jobs.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We must also help those who could be working to get out of  economic inactivity. DEL  and DETI are considering schemes to help such people. Those are the areas in  which the private sector will find the people that it requires.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Other people will come  into our society from outside Northern Ireland. They should be  considered as adding to the overall wealth, productivity and prosperity of Northern Ireland  rather than being seen as coming to take our jobs. The current generation is  experiencing the highest ever levels of employment in Northern Ireland, which has the lowest level of  unemployment of any part of the United    Kingdom. That is a good base from which to  move forward to the next stage.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  That ends questions to the Minister of Finance and Personnel on his Budget statement.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. When you were absent, I consulted with the  Chair about making this point of order.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">During the Minister&rsquo;s statement, and in several questions,  pointed references were made to me and to the supposed role of the previous  Executive. People have a right of reply if they are criticised or challenged  and in my question to the Minister of Finance and Personnel, I did not seek to  use that right of reply.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Ms Anderson spoke about the &ldquo;Durkan tax&rdquo; and suggested that  rate increases came from the borrowing power negotiated under the reinvestment  and reform initiative. First, the reinvestment and reform initiative was agreed  by the entire Executive. Secondly, at no point did that Executive agree, impose  or even propose a rates increase &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: I have given the Member some latitude. That is not an  appropriate point of order. The Member may be about to raise a point of order  about a right of reply. He does not have a right of reply on that issue.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>:  When can I exercise my right of reply? The Deputy Speaker told me to do so at  the end of the debate on the Minister&rsquo;s statement.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member&rsquo;s comments have been noted. However, he does not have a right of  reply on that issue.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>:  Do I not have a right of reply?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  That is exactly what I am saying.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>:  Does no one have a right of reply any more?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member has been around this House for a long time &mdash; and for a longer time  around another House. He knows that the  issue that was raised is not serious  enough to warrant a point of order and a reply.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>:  In another House, if a Member is named, or where it is clear that a Member is  being personally identified, he or she has a right of reply.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member should read page 32 of the Northern Ireland Assembly Companion,  because the answer is there.</p>

	      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="3"></a>Ministerial Statement</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Rural Planning Policy and PPS 14</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I have received notice from the Minister of the Environment that she wishes to  make a statement on the judicial review of Planning Policy Statement 14.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment (Mrs Foster)</strong>: I am making this statement, with the  agreement of the Minister for Regional Development, to advise the Assembly that, from today, my Department is  assuming responsibility for rural planning policy, as set out in draft Planning Policy Statement 14 entitled &lsquo;Sustainable  Development in the Countryside&rsquo; and commonly  known as draft PPS 14. I will lead cross-departmental work to review  draft PPS 14 and develop new policies.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The review will be focused and short in timescale. Until  then, the Planning Service cannot operate in a policy vacuum, and speculative development  is still a real threat to our countryside.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The extent of that threat is demonstrated by the fact that  approximately 4,500 applications under draft PPS 14 were received between 16  March 2006 and early September 2007. Following the initial judgement given by  Mr Justice Gillen on 7 September 2007, a further 1,900 applications for single dwellings in the countryside were  received. Most of those were in the Omagh planning division, which covers  Fermanagh, where almost 1,200 applications were received by the end of September. Therefore, I consider it prudent to  reissue the policy provisions of  draft PPS 14 today and to continue to apply them to planning  applications received after 16 March 2006 until a review has been completed and  new policies have been developed. I will publish a new draft PPS 14 within six  months, and that will be followed by a period of consultation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My statement today is an expression of my Department&rsquo;s  policy made under the powers conferred by article 3 of the Planning (Northern Ireland)  Order 1991. It is the duty of planning decision-makers to regard relevant  statements of planning policy as legally material considerations, and this is  such a statement.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Draft PPS 14 was published on 16 March 2006 by the  Department for Regional Development. It was accompanied by a ministerial  statement by the then Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern  Ireland with responsibility for the Department for Regional Development, Sean Woodward, which advised that the  provisions of draft PPS 14 took immediate precedence over existing rural  planning policies and should, therefore, be accorded substantial weight in the  determination of planning applications received after 16 March 2006.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The planning policies contained in draft PPS 14 were  introduced to address the significant development pressure affecting rural Northern    Ireland. Sean Woodward concluded  that, in the public interest, action designed to minimise irreversible  environmental damage could not be delayed, and, through his statement, he sought  to address substantial concerns that the policy direction of draft PPS 14 could  be seriously frustrated by a large influx of planning applications.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The introduction of draft PPS 14 provoked a widespread  debate about rural planning and more than 8,500  responses were received in the public consultation. A judicial review challenging draft PPS 14 was  subse&shy;quently lodged. In his judgement of 7 September 2007, Mr Justice  Gillen concluded that the Department for Regional  Development did not have the statutory power to prepare and issue draft  PPS 14.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In light of the court judgement, which was finalised today, I am issuing this statement to  advise that, from today, my Department is assuming responsibility for  PPS 14 and its ongoing review.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Before the restoration of devolution, all parties on the  Preparation for Government Committee agreed that draft PPS 14 should be  subjected to a fundamental review and new policies developed. The Minister for  Regional Development&rsquo;s proposal to establish an Executive subcommittee to  review rural planning was agreed by the Executive in July. The Minister started  the review process by meeting a range of stakeholders and, with his agreement, I have taken over as Chairperson of the  subcommittee.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Conor Murphy will continue to be involved in that Committee, along with other Ministers who have a  policy interest in rural planning.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In taking forward this  review, my Executive colleagues and I wish to develop a policy based on  the principles of sustainability that strikes a balance between the need to  protect the countryside from unnecessary development and supporting rural  communities so that they can flourish both socially and economically.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is my intention, prior to publishing the final rural  planning policy document, that there will be an opportunity for all those with  an interest in this matter to make their views known through a further public  consultation exercise.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In assuming  responsibility for PPS 14, I am conscious of the large numbers of people  who responded to the public consultation last year, and of the variety of views  that were expressed. However, the policy review process remains incomplete,  and, in the meantime, there continues to be evidence of a significant threat to  the rural environment from development. Therefore, there is still good reason  to proceed as previously with a precautionary approach, pending the completion  of the review process.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Taking all those matters into consideration, I have decided  &mdash; in the public interest, and as a short-term interim  measure &mdash; to today reissue the policy provisions of draft PPS 14 under  the powers conferred by article 3 of the Planning (Northern Ireland) Order 1991.  Furthermore, I consider that those policy provisions should continue to take  precedence over the existing policies of &lsquo;A Planning Strategy for Rural  Northern Ireland&rsquo; &mdash; which are listed in an  annex to my statement, copies of which have been posted in Members&rsquo;  pigeonholes &mdash; and should be accorded substantial weight in the determination of any planning application received  after 16 March 2006.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In taking this course of action, my officials have  carefully reviewed and considered all the steps and procedures followed by DRD  in the preparation and publication of draft PPS 14. In addition, I am aware  that in the judicial review, there was no challenge of any kind to the  substance or the merits of draft PPS 14. I  am also conscious that the due process and procedural challenges that  were made were all dismissed by the court.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, I note that Mr Justice Gillen, in his judgement of  7 September 2007, observed that:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;had PPS 14 been issued by the DOE the contents might  well have been unobjectionable.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for the Environment (Mr McGlone)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for her statement,  a copy of which I have received.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Draft PPS 14 has been  judged to have been unlawful. A number of cases that fell specifically  under the remit of draft PPS 14&rsquo;s farm viability, farm retirement, replacement,  and/or infill categories were subsequently refused. As we have found out today,  that refusal was based on an illegality. The Minister stated that she  considered it:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;prudent to reissue the policy provisions of draft PPS  14 today and to continue to apply them to planning applications received after  16 March 2006&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">What advice has the Minister sought regarding the  retrospective application of a policy in the context of today&rsquo;s decision? There  are numerous people who, having had applications refused under a policy now deemed to be illegal, have justifiable and fair  grounds to seek to have those cases reviewed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I realise that the Minister&rsquo;s first meeting as Chairperson  of the Executive subcommittee will in fact be the first meeting of that  subcommittee. Will the Minister give an assurance that diligence and some  refreshing new enthusiasm will be given to the application and the pursuit of  developing a rural planning policy for a rural society? Will the Minister also  give some indication as to the timescales that she has in mind for that?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>: I thank the Chairman for his comments. He knows that I  approach everything with enthusiasm, and we will be doing so in the  subcommittee as well. I pay tribute to the  work of the subcommittee to date. There has been a lot of work carried  out with stakeholders, and I know that that will continue.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have already said that I want the review to be focused and time limited. I take the view that we  should have a draft policy ready in  six months&rsquo; time. Therefore, what I have announced today is an interim  short-term measure which &mdash; from a Planning Service and an environmental point of view &mdash; is a necessary measure.  I am sure that the Chairman will agree with that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have taken legal advice in respect of the Member&rsquo;s first  point about the legality of decisions that were taken between 16 March and 7  September. The judicial review litigation included no challenge of any kind to the substance or merits of draft PPS 14. All due  processes and procedural challenges that were raised on behalf of the  applicant for judicial review were dismissed by the court. Bearing that in  mind, cases decided during that time under draft PPS 14 will stand.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The judgement that was handed down today by Mr Justice  Gillen was a continuation of his judgement of 7 September. He has added a  number of paragraphs and, in those, he seeks to distinguish between declaratory  relief, which is what he has granted today, and an order quashing draft PPS 14.  He explained why, in the public interest, he decided not to make an order  quashing draft PPS 14. Much work had been carried out by the Department for  Regional Development. Mr Justice Gillen considered all the work that went into  drafting PPS 14 and its four-year gestation period. He stated very clearly that  that still stands.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  thank the Minister for her statement, and for the speed with which it has been  brought to the House, given that the final judgement on draft PPS 14 was delivered only this morning. In view of the  planning and legal mess in which we  have been left by direct rule Ministers, people will realise that the  interim measure that was announced today is the only feasible option that was  open to the Minister, and that that measure will help in getting things right  in the long term.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My question follows on from that asked by the Chairperson  of the Environment Committee. How will the  Planning Service deal with fresh applications in cases where the  Planning Appeals Commission has turned down an application on the grounds of  draft PPS 14?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  I thank the Member for his comments. Final judgement was made today, but the  Department had a clear view as to where the matter was going because we  received 74 paragraphs of the judgement in September.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As for the Planning Appeals Commission, the Planning  Service can decline to consider a repeat application if the original one was  refused and, within the previous two years, was also turned down by the  Planning Appeals Commission. However, that is a discretionary power, and I will be directing the Planning Service  to exercise discretion and accept fresh appli&shy;cations. Therefore, if an  application has been turned down by the Planning Appeals Commission in the past  two years, I will direct Planning Service to reconsider any new application for  that site.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Boylan</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister  for her statement. She is aware that, before the restoration of devolution,  parties now represented on the Committee for the Environment reached a consensus on rural planning and rejected  draft PPS 14. I hope that Members&rsquo; remarks reflect that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in has completely rejected draft PPS 14, and responded to it in a document of June 2006. As a  matter of priority, will the Minister  outline her immediate plans for dealing with this issue, not only in the  forthcoming review, but in the development of a new policy? When will the  Executive subcommittee meet? Are resources in place to ensure that a proper  planning policy for sustainable rural communities is developed?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  I am well aware of the difficulties of all  the political parties with draft PPS 14; the Member&rsquo;s party is no  exception to that.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">2.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It may be helpful to set out the list of policies that the  Executive have asked the subcommittee to consider during its review. Those  include whether we should have a localised policy; farm viability, which was  mentioned by the Chairperson of the Environment Committee; the role that  replacement dwellings should have in a new  policy; the role that social and affordable housing will have in a new policy; farm clusters; whether  environmentally friendly housing should be addressed by a new policy; health  and personal circumstances; and economic development. Moreover, the issue of kinship has been raised several times. We are considering  that and whether we should continue with the language of presumption in favour  of, or against, a development.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The subcommittee is examining those issues, and much good  work has been done. It is not the case that the subcommittee has not been  working, and we will continue in partnership to make a policy of which everyone  in the Chamber may have ownership. Part of the difficulty with draft PPS 14 was  that no one felt any ownership of it, and people, therefore, felt that they  could attack it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We must take into consideration the environmental impact  and those who live in the countryside, bearing in mind what we can do for them  on a social and economic basis. Furthermore, we must be aware of our  environment and, this morning, that was referred to as one of the key strategic aims of the draft Programme for  Government. We would do well to recognise the importance of the environment  from the perspective of both the natural and built heritages, and I will give  cognisance to that in any new draft PPS 14.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gardiner</strong>:  I thank the Minister for bringing her long-awaited statement to the House.  There has been great confusion in the Planning Service, particularly in  relation to applicants. Will the Minister ensure that a revised rural-planning  policy takes account of the needs of the rural economy, the social cohesion of  rural communities, and a sustainable rural environment? Following the court  ruling, will the Minister also consider  refunding those people who were turned down by PPS 14, or will the  Department of the Environment write to all the refused applicants and ask them  to resubmit their applications for further consideration?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  I addressed the first issue in my last question when I said that I will look at  economic development in the countryside and environmentally friendly housing.  Sustainability must be at the heart of a new planning policy to be endorsed by  the Assembly. Undoubtedly, any such policy will cause great debate in the  Assembly in the near future.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The honourable gentleman has raised the issue of fees  before. I have no provision in law to waive the fees of those who made applications between 16 March 2006 and 7  September 2007. The cost of processing their applications is unrecoverable and  has already been used. Those people may reapply in relation to their site;  however, they may wish to reapply after the new draft PPS 14 is in place,  rather than under the current draft.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Those people who have submitted applications since 7 September, of which there are a considerable  number, will have the option to withdraw their applications, and will be  offered refunds. The Department is taking that exceptional measure in unusual  circumstances. There was a hiatus between the first and final judgements, during which many people rushed to submit applications  as they thought that PPS 14 had ended. In  such except&shy;ional circumstances, it is fair that they should be given  the opportunity to withdraw their applications and wait. The measure is  exceptional, and planning officers will  write to all those concerned to ask them whether they want to withdraw  their application.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: On behalf of my party, I thank the Minister for the content of her statement, particularly the  recog&shy;nition of the necessity of the precautionary approach at this  stage, and her recognition of the courts&rsquo; decision that there is nothing fundamentally wrong with PPS 14.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to correct a minor mistake that the Minister made  when she said that prior to the restoration of devolution, parties on the  Preparation for Government Committee agreed on the need for fundamental review.  She will find that it was the four parties that were on the Programme for  Government Committee that agreed on that; the fifth party, which was excluded  from that Committee, most certainly did not agree.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">First, given the current pressures on the Planning Service,  particularly with regard to staffing, can the Minister tell the House what  implications the decision will have on other planning policy statements that  are currently the responsibility of the Department for Regional Development  rather than the Department of the Environment? Secondly, what resources will be  transferred as a result of today&rsquo;s statement? Lastly, what further resources  may be needed in order to ensure that those other planning policy statements  can also be dealt with properly?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  The Member is absolutely right: that was, of course, a mistake &mdash; I should have  said &ldquo;the Programme for Government Committee&rdquo;. I recognise his party&rsquo;s view on the matter. I hope that my  statement reflects all the views of all parties in the Chamber.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My Department is currently in discussion with DRD about  which of the other planning policy statements that remain with it at present  should be transferred and which resource allocations should follow them.  Obviously, the regional development strategy will remain with DRD. However, the  Departments are actively discussing what should happen to the other planning  policy statements.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>: I thank the Minister for her statement. It is about time that  the policy found its way home to the Department of the Environment, which is  where it should have been in the first place.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am concerned at the number of applications that have been  lodged since 7 September 2007, and I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s announcement that  those applicants will have the right to withdraw them and that refunds will be  given. Given the Minister&rsquo;s legal background, can she outline for the House  exactly what the judgement means for planning, particularly with regard to PPS  14?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  I thank the Member for his question &mdash; I think. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As the Member will be aware, and as Mr Ford has already  mentioned, there was no challenge during the judicial review litigation to the  substance and merits of draft PPS 14. The court dismissed all due process and  procedural challenges that were raised. The judge has in effect concluded that  the Department for Regional Development did not have the statutory authority to  promote draft PPS 14, and that only the Department of the Environment has that  power under article 3 of the Planning (Northern Ireland) Order 1991. In  fact, the judge said that had DOE issued draft PPS 14, it may have been  unobjectionable. Essentially, the judge is saying that the DOE should have  issued draft PPS 14 in the first place, if that was what it was minded to do.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I do not wish to pass the buck to Mr Justice Gillen.  However, it would be helpful to tell the House what he said in court, because  it makes a distinction between the effect of declaratory and certiorari relief.  He said that the former is:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;a formal statement by the court pronouncing upon the  existence or non-existence of a legal state of affairs. It is not capable of  being coercively enforced. It states the existing legal position and opens the  way to the use of other remedies for giving effect to it, if that should be  necessary. It is particularly appropriate where it is undesirable for a  decision to be rendered a nullity for all purposes.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">In other words,  the judge said that draft PPS 14 was not null and void but that it is  now being declared illegal.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In contrast, certiorari is a quashing order in the sense  that it destroys the legal validity of the action that is quashed by the order.  The remedy given by Mr Justice Gillen was a declaratory order that states that draft PPS 14 is illegal for the reason &mdash; and for  no other reason &mdash; that it was made by the wrong Department.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong><span style="letter-spacing:-.35pt; ">Mr McKay</span></strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a  Cheann Comhairle. I thank the  Minister for her statement. Given the fact that draft PPS 14 lacked public  input and was so contentious, what format will the public consultation on the  new PPS 14 take? How comprehensive will that exercise be?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  Part of the difficulty was that there was no  devolved Government at that time, and no input from locally elected  Members who knew Northern    Ireland&rsquo;s countryside and how it works. In  that respect, the situation has been remedied, and the subcommittee has already  spoken to stakeholders. We will take that work forward and I hope that in six  months&rsquo; time, we will be able to publish  our new draft PPS 14 for consultation. I have no doubt that it will  reflect the views of the Chamber given that the Ministers involved are broadly  reflective of the Chamber.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>: I, too, welcome the statement because it brings closure to an  unsatisfactory situation that has been  ongoing for some time. I also note in the Minister&rsquo;s statement that she  felt it worthwhile to bring to our attention that 1,900 planning applications  for single dwellings in the countryside have been received. Furthermore, she  said that most were for dwellings in the Omagh planning division, and that  almost 1,200 had been received for dwellings in Fermanagh by the end of  September. What significance does the Minister draw from those figures? In addition,  will she tell the House that she will be assuming responsibility for all  planning policy statements as of now? Will she also tell the House whether that  is a tidying-up exercise? Will she tell us that her Department will deliver on  all planning policy statements &mdash; something that the direct rule Minister with  responsibility for planning, but who seldom got anything right, could not do?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  The Member has highlighted one of the reasons why it is important to stop the  confusion that the general public feels about the status of draft PPS 14. I am  sure that many Members will agree that there have been wild rumours circulating  about there being an opportunity to submit planning applications that would not  be judged under any rural planning policy &mdash; that it would be, basically, a  free-for-all. I was determined that that would not be the case.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The judgement was given on 7 September 2007. As the action  was brought by a council in the west of the Province, it is no coincidence that  many planning applications are sitting in the planning office in that division.  The applicants will be written to and will be given the opportunity to withdraw  their applications at no cost to themselves. They will be able to get a full  refund, and each of them should consider the matter carefully.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have indicated that there is ongoing discussion about my  Department taking responsibility for all planning policy statements, and we  will have to come to a decision quickly. My Department will also have to be  given the resources to undertake that function. The regional development  strategy will remain with the Department for Regional Development. However,  there is a need to bring clarity as regards the other planning policy  statements.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I thank the Minister for making her statement to the House. What is the  position regarding those planning applications that were refused under, what  might be described as the original PPS 14? Potentially, those applications were  subject to appeal. Will the Minister and  her Department consider allowing people who were refused planning  permission under the original PPS 14 a concessionary fee when re-submitting an  application when a new planning policy has been established?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  The planning applications that were determined during the period 16 March 2007  to 7 September 2007 were determined under the policy that pertained at that  time. The application fee has been expended as far as the Planning Service is  concerned.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If the Member is asking me whether people will be able to  lodge fresh planning applications and whether they will be dealt with as if the  site were blighted, the answer is that the site will not be blighted under the  old policy. We will look at the prevailing policy at the time of the  determination &mdash; that is the new policy that will be in effect when the new  applications are lodged.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member mentioned the possibility of a reduction in  fees. Some Members believe that I do not charge enough for planning  applications and that the fees should be increased. I have no facility to ask  for a lesser fee if a decision has already been determined under draft PPS 14.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  I welcome the fact that the Minister has made a statement on PPS 14, but I have  some criticisms of the content of the  statement. Most Members will know that, for people in rural areas, one  day of PPS 14 is one day too many. Although I have some sympathy for the  Minister&rsquo;s position, she has told us that PPS 14 will, in effect, be extended  for another six months, after which there will be a consultation period &mdash; that  could mean an extension of nine months, in total. Moreover, the legislative  stage will follow the consultation period, and that could take a further nine  months. Thus, the time frame will be longer than has been portrayed in the  statement.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I ask the Minister to reconsider this matter. How long will  the consultation period be? It does not have to be three months. Reference has  been made to the report of the Committee on the Preparation for Government,  which will help to shorten that process and ease the waiting period for so  many.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister also mentioned the earlier consultation period  and the variety of views that were expressed. Can the Minister clarify some of  those views? As I understand it, the majority of views expressed were very  clearly opposed to draft PPS 14, and I would like some confirmation of that.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  I thank the Member for his comments &mdash; I think. I thank him for his initial  comments, at any rate.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to explain the matter to the Member. I have already  said that the review of draft PPS 14 will be focused and time-limited. The new  policy will go out for consultation in six months&rsquo; time, and, at that stage,  the new policy will become draft PPS 14. The current PPS 14 will then fall. The  Member is right; the new draft PPS 14 will go out to consultation, and it will  be confirmed. I hope that the Member appreciates that I am trying to make the  timescale as short as possible. I think that he will agree that we have to get  the policy right this time.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Some of the issues involved are very complex, and it is  important that we take on board the views that will be expressed by the  Executive subcommittee and other stakeholders. The decisions that we hope to  put before the people in six months&rsquo; time will have far-reaching consequences  for the environment, rural people and anyone with an interest in the future of  the countryside. Although I want the review to be focused and time-limited, I  am aware that we must get on with the job and ensure that the policy that goes  out to consultation is the right one.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Like myself, Mr  Gallagher is from a rural background, so I know exactly where he is  coming from. However, a variety of views have been expressed, many of which  have been aired in the Chamber today. Concerns have been raised about environmental issues and, as Minister of the  Environment, I must take all those views into account. Each view will be given  its due weight and will be considered by the Executive subcommittee. Indeed, I  am sure that many Members will also put their views to me.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Buchanan</strong>:  I am glad that PPS 14 now falls within the remit of the Department of the  Environment &mdash; the Department that should have responsibility for it. I am glad  that the matter has been cleared up. I thank the Minister for bringing this  statement to the House so swiftly.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I ask the Minister to clarify whether the new policy will  allow for any flexibility in respect of vernacular buildings. That issue is  currently causing a conflict between the  Housing Executive and the Planning Service.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Also, will any clear guidance be given to Planning Service  divisions regarding applications of that nature that are already in the system?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  I will answer the Member&rsquo;s last point first. If there are applications in the  system that come before councils prior to the new policy&rsquo;s being imple&shy;mented,  I will allow councils to defer them until it is implemented. That includes  vernacular buildings, which are part of the subcommittee&rsquo;s discussions and have  been mentioned to me by a wide range of councillors and MLAs from rural areas.  That will form part of our deliberations. At present, the role of vernacular  buildings in the countryside is &mdash; as the Member rightly said &mdash; covered by draft  PPS 14 and is within the ambit of the review. The Department will continue to  discuss the matter with stakeholders and interested Members.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Given her rural background, the  Minister will be well aware that she carries  the rural community&rsquo;s hope that the unlawful draft PPS 14 will be  succeeded by a policy that is more sympathetic to them. Draft PPS 14 has had a  hugely negative impact on rural communities. Will the Minister take full  account of the rural stake&shy;holder consultation events that have already taken  place in the Ballinascreen and Draperstown area and in county Armagh?  Those events were hosted by the Minister for  Regional Development, Conor Murphy, and I hope that the Minister takes  full account of what was said at them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister begin to look at a policy that gives some  advantage to family members &mdash; the &ldquo;kinship clause&rdquo;  that has been referred to? Personal circumstances are also a big issue. I am thinking about  specific families where one family member has a major health require&shy;ment;  they are very worried and want the Planning Service to adopt a more sympathetic  attitude.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, there are many applications that were submitted to  the Planning Service before March 2006 but returned to the applicant because of  minor errors in the application &mdash; for example, the misspelling of a townland  name. When those applications re-entered the system after 16 March 2006, they  were subject to the rules of draft PPS 14. Will the Minister consider  revisiting those applications, which were submitted before 16 March 2006 but  validated after that date?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  The Department will take all the rural stakeholder events, and the issues that  emerged from them, into account. As I said, Conor Murphy will continue to sit on the subcommittee, as will the  Members who have been sitting on his subcommittee. I have already met  the GAA &mdash; a body close to the Member&rsquo;s heart &mdash; to discuss draft PPS 14.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member also mentions health, personal circum&shy;stances  and kinship, which are matters that are being addressed, and will continue to  be addressed, by the subcommittee. The Member made a specific point about  applications validated after 16 March 2006 &mdash; there were a number of such  applications in the Omagh area, and in other areas. Any planning application  that was not validated before that date was treated under draft PPS 14. There  is nothing that I can do about that because  the date was set by the previous Administration.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her response; she has taken the policy out of  no-man&rsquo;s-land and into her Department. With no disrespect to anyone else in the  Chamber, she has made sure that draft PPS 14 will be reviewed and new policies  developed by her Department, which is good news. Does the Minister agree that PPS 14 has been draconian and discriminatory,  and the quicker that it is replaced the better?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Out of the 8,500 responses that the Minister said that the Department received to the public consultation,  can she tell the Assembly how many were opposed to draft PPS 14? I understand  that a vast number of people were against it. Is the Minister carrying out a  review of all draft PPS 14 regulations as part of the review, or just the  operation of draft PPS 14 in the first six months?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The consultation that the Minister is establishing will  include local councils. Sometimes, local councils need to be reassured. Can the  Minister assure us that, when the consultation documents are sent to the local  councils, and they reply, their viewpoints will be taken on board and that the  consultation process will not be the subject of mere lip service?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  The Member probably asked about 10 questions, but that is no surprise. First,  DRD would not like to be characterised as no-man&rsquo;s-land, but I am sure that the  Minister for Regional Development will take that up himself on some occasion.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member is right to state that a higher number of  consultees complained about draft PPS 14 from the point of view of not being  able to develop in the countryside, than from an environmental perspective. However, I want to get away from the divisive  argument that if someone is pro-development, they are anti-environment,  and vice versa. The Department wants a policy that everyone in the countryside  can buy into. It is divisive to get stuck on terms such as &ldquo;pro-environ&shy;ment&rdquo;  and &ldquo;anti-developer&rdquo;. I do not want to engage in the use of those types of  terms when introducing any new policy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member is a councillor, and he knows that I have been  working closely with local government in another area &mdash; the review of public  administration &mdash; and we have been working  well in partnership. Any time local government brings me an issue, I  seek to address it, and I will do the same in respect of consultation on  planning policy.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>: I  welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement. Did the Minister see the pain on the face of  the Minister for Regional Development at having responsibility for rural  planning policy torn from his bosom and brought to the Department of the  Environment? Can she see his angst at the prospect of other contentious  planning policy statements being torn from his Department and taken to the DOE?  Perhaps that is not as evident as some Members might suspect.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">On a more serious note,  I welcome that development, and I  refer to three written answers that the Minister has given me in recent  weeks, which graphically illustrate the difficulties that her Department faces  in dealing with that policy. First, in the year leading up to the introduction  of draft PPS 14, 15,000 applications for single dwellings were lodged at  divisional planning offices in Northern    Ireland. No one will convince me that all 15,000 of those were deserving cases;  there must have been a large element of speculation among those.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, since 7  September, when Mr Justice Gillen made his initial judgement, there have  been 1,900 applications for single dwellings on the mere hint that draft PPS 14  may collapse.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Thirdly, in a written answer to me, the Minister stated  that the Planning Service is short of 72 members of staff. Does she agree that  any decision other than the one that she made today would have opened the  floodgates and put the Planning Service under the most enormous pressure,  which, given those statistics, would have been impossible to sustain.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  I thank the Member for his comments. I will not make any comment on the state  of mind of the Minister for Regional  Development about the policy passing to DOE; I will let him do that  himself during his next ministerial statement or at Question Time.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member well knows, along with the rest of the House,  that there are considerable pressures on the Planning  Service. That is something that the Programme for Government seeks to  address, and, hopefully, those pressures can be relieved soon. However, that is  not the main reason for my statement; rather it is to protect the environment  in Northern Ireland  and to ensure that the speculative development to which the Member referred does not take place, and that there is no  window of opportunity for people to do whatever they like.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.00 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is vital to have a  balance, and that will be achieved in six months&rsquo; time. The difficulties  of the Planning Service were secondary to what I was charged to do in my  ministerial role.</p>
	      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="4"></a>Private Members&rsquo; Business</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">IVF Fertility Waiting Lists</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to one and a half hours for the  next debate. The proposer of the motion has 10 minutes to propose and 10  minutes for the winding-up speech. All other Members are allowed five minutes  to speak. One amendment has been received and published on the Marshalled List.  The proposer of the amendment will have 10 minutes to propose and five minutes  for the winding-up speech.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly calls for a review of the policy on IVF fertility waiting lists, including urgent  consideration of the introduction of age-weighting criteria.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I thank those  who agreed to the motion&rsquo;s being debated in the House. I give particular thanks to the British Medical  Association (BMA), the researchers in this Building and the Infertility Network  UK  for their briefings.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I must walk gently when talking about IVF, because I walk  on the hopes and disappointments of many families in this part of the world. At  the start of the debate, it is important to record that, prior to 2001, there  was no publicly funded fertility treatment in Britain  or Northern Ireland.  Therefore, the situation is much better now  than in the latter years of the twentieth century. In the past year, changes to the criteria governing  treatment mean that women up to the age of 40 can now receive treatment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">When the policy was changed a year ago, the Department  stated that it would request that:</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;Boards monitor referrals and waiting times for treatments  over the next 12 months. This will facilitate assessment of the demand for  services and the capacity of the RFC to meet that demand.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I met the Minister in September to urge that his  Department conduct that review. Earlier this month, he replied that he would  ask the boards to review the impact of the new criteria for access to publicly  funded fertility services and specifically report on referrals, patient  activity and waiting times. Although I welcome that commitment, I urge the  Minister to instruct his Department to conduct a fully fledged review into all  matters arising from access to fertility services in the North, rather than  leaving it to the boards. Whether the review is conducted by the Department or  the boards, several matters must be  addressed, and I ask the Minister to comment on them during the course  of the debate.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence  (NICE) recommends that couples receive three cycles of IVF treatment. However,  in September 2007, the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety  in Northern Ireland  issued guidance that offered only one cycle. Therefore, I ask the Minister to  confirm whether he and his Department will work to achieve the NICE  recommendation of three cycles. In July 2007, the Department of Health in England sent a  note to primary care trusts advising that they work to a three-cycle treatment  programme. Has the Minister&rsquo;s Department  issued any similar advice here? The clinical evidence is that one cycle  of treatment is often a trial run and that the second and subsequent treatment cycles are those that may deliver  success.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I ask the Minister to  explain what is meant by a cycle of  treatment. When a woman&rsquo;s eggs are being harvested, additional valid  eggs are often stored for potential use.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is a view that, in  addition to a first implantation of an egg or eggs, a cycle of treatment  should enable subsequent implantation of a further egg or eggs, given that they are in a valid state, where there is as  a conse&shy;quence limited cost to the Department&rsquo;s budget as the subsequent treatments have reduced drug requirements.  I ask the Minister to confirm whether the review, however it is constructed,  will address that matter.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I also ask the Minister  to confirm whether the review will deal with the issue of waiting lists  generally. As of May, there were 27 patients in Northern Ireland who had been  waiting for more than 24 months; 48 patients who had been waiting for between  18 and 24 months; and 63 patients who had been waiting for between 12 and 18  months. There is some guidance in England that there should be an  18-week waiting time for all medical  interventions. Can the Minister confirm whether the review will address the length of waiting lists? Will it  address the issue of an 18-week limit on waiting lists and, if not, will  resources and capacity be built up to enable women who have been waiting for  many more than 18 weeks for treatment to have it in much less than 18 or 24  months?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In September 2006, the Department confirmed that an  additional &pound;50,000 per annum would be allocated towards the enhancement of existing counselling services, with  the requirement that access to the services be equitable across Northern Ireland.  Some people who have knowledge of these matters advise me that that money may  not have been spent. In any case, the intention behind building up money for  counselling services to provide better services across Northern Ireland, and in particular in the north-west, has not  been fulfilled, and is not fulfilled by having a counselling outreach  facility in Cookstown.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My interest in this issue was prompted by a couple who came to me anxious that the woman in the relation&shy;ship was approaching the age of 40 and would, therefore,  be &ldquo;discharged&rdquo;, as hospital people say,  from the medical regional waiting list. It so happens that, in the past  two weeks, she has passed 40 and been discharged, when she was around tenth on  a waiting list of 500. I have the authority to refer to those people&rsquo;s  circumstances in this debate. I have to say to the Minister, to the Department  and to the House that that situation should not have arisen.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It seems to me that, during the stewardship of the current  Minister and that of the previous, direct rule Minister, Paul Goggins, this  issue was not properly addressed. Why do I say that? If the criteria were  changed in September 2006 to enable women to get treatment up to the age of 40,  when the previous limit was 38, it should have been anticipated that there  would be a spike of people going on the waiting list who may have been over the  age of 38, in advance of their turning 40. In those circumstances, it seems to  me that the Department should have legislated to legally and properly  accommodate those couples and those women. However, in correspondence to me,  the Department maintains that:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&nbsp;&ldquo;a process that  awarded priority to any particular group of women would have a negative impact  on others awaiting treatment and would seriously compromise the ability to  ensure that the population have equitable access to specialised fertility  services.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I agree with that. Of course, if you treat older  women approaching the age of 40 before they fall off the list and ahead of any  other age category, it has a negative impact on younger women, because they  have to wait <span style="letter-spacing:-.05pt; ">longer. However, the test is  not about what the negat</span>ive <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt; ">impact on  younger women is; the test should be whe</span>ther that impact is  disproportionate compared with the impact on the older women who get treatment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have said to the Minister that earlier treatment of a  woman because of her age, and who is, therefore, disadvantaged, does not have a disproportionate impact upon the  treatment of a younger woman. If the older <span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt; ">woman  does not receive treatment, she will never rec</span>eive it. Over recent  months, I have put that issue to the Department  of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, but there has been no  concurrence.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I urged the Department  to run a computer programme whereby all details and profiles of the  women on the waiting list could be compared to determine whether there was  indeed a disproportionate impact upon younger women. As far as I know, that  simple exercise has not been conducted.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Moreover, I outlined a series of measures by which, legally and properly, women who approach the age  of 40 could have treatment without significant disadvantage to women of  any other age group. None of those proposals was accepted by the Department.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I urge Members to  support the motion and encourage the Minister to introduce legal and  proper mechanisms to ensure that the example of a couple who, two weeks ago,  lost out on IVF treatment, is not duplicated in other parts of the North.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M O&rsquo;Neill</strong>:  I beg to move the following amendment: Leave out all after &ldquo;calls&rdquo; and insert</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;on the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety  to commence a comprehensive review into the current criteria used to assess  eligibility, including the age weighting  criteria, the ongoing problem with waiting lists, and the number of IVF  treatments available on the NHS, with a view to establishing a more equitable  and accessible policy.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I thank  the Member for bringing this very important topic to the House. The amendment  has been put forward with a view to establishing a more equitable and  accessible policy. It enhances the motion, and calls for a comprehensive review  of the criteria currently used to assess eligibility, including age-weighting,  the ongoing problems with waiting lists, and the number of IVF treatments  available on the NHS. I recognise, however, that there have been recent  improvements in criteria and availability.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I immediately took an  interest in the motion, because friends and members of my family have  been in that situation. They have made numerous hospital visits and undergone  test after test. They have described the experience as an emotional  rollercoaster &mdash; a journey that was, from start to finish, painful.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It took six years for one couple that I know to find <span style="letter-spacing:-.2pt; ">the courage to visit their GP. Surely that is not  accepta</span>ble. We must ensure that that is not allowed to continue. The  overall impact of a couple&rsquo;s inability to conceive cannot be underestimated. We  must be concerned about the effect on the couple&rsquo;s mental health and the  knock-on effect on their family circle. As elected representatives, we have a  duty to ensure that an adequate support  service is in place to meet their needs.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In 2001, my party colleague Bairbre de Br&uacute;n announced her  intention to consult on the future of fertility  services and, thankfully, she introduced interim criteria to carry us  through until the outcome of the consultation  process. For the first time in the North, IVF became available as a publicly funded service.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although those measures were not ideal, they were an  improvement on the previous situation and were carried forward on the recommendation of the Regional Medical  Services Consortium. They continued until 2006, when the British direct rule Minister Paul  Goggins introduced revised criteria as the outcome of the  process that had begun five years earlier.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The changes impacted on  several areas; for example, the upper age limit for women who use their  own eggs was changed from 37 years old to 39. That was a welcome improvement. Couples with dependent children  who live with them are now able to access publicly funded services. That, too, must be a welcome develop&shy;ment, because the previous criteria led to an inequitable  situation that discriminated against a partner in a new relationship who had no  children from a previous relationship.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Another welcome development is that couples who have been  diagnosed as infertile will no longer be subject to a qualifying period before  being eligible for publicly funded treatment. However, those with unexplained  infertility still have to complete the three-year  waiting period, and that must be disappointing for them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As Alex mentioned, one of the main downsides of the revised  measures is that couples will be offered only one cycle of publicly funded IVF  treatment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The flexibility to provide more than one cycle of treatment  will depend on the demand for the service and on the funding available. We  should all share that concern, as it may  mean a return to the postcode lottery for those who need to access the  service. If there is a high demand in a trust area, couples may suffer. We  should not stand by and allow that to happen: we must nip it in the bud now.  The issue must be addressed through a review.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Infertility Alliance has broadly welcomed the new  changes. However, it is deeply disappointed that the NHS will now only  guarantee one cycle in contrast to the two-cycle minimum under the interim arrangements.  We call on those boards that provide two cycles to resist the temptation to cut  their service levels. Two or three cycles of IVF are normally regarded as the  optimal treatment approach, and the National  Institute for Health and Clinical  Excellence advises providing three cycles of treatment. A senior  lecturer in reproductive medicine at the University of Bristol  has said that three attempts would be acceptable, as that would offer couples a  50% chance of conceiving. Surely, we must take those comments on board, and the  Department must take them into account in  taking forward a review.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The other area that must be addressed is support and  counselling for couples who are going through the IVF process. There are many  pressures on couples as they go through the process. We must ensure that  sufficient resources are in place to support groups such as the Stork  infertility support group, the Tiny Feet infertility support group, and the  Craigavon patient support group. I am sure that those groups offer wonderful  support, but we must ensure that we further develop that and identify whether  new groups are required.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, I ask the House to support the motion and  amendment. In doing so, we will send a clear message to the Minister that we  want a consistent, equitable and accessible service for those who need it. I  have outlined some of the concerns. There is a common thread in what I have  said and in what the proposer of the motion has said.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs O&rsquo;Neill</strong>:  I am nearly finished anyway. I hope that the Minister takes on board what has  been said in the debate. We have an opportunity in this new Assembly to carry  out a comprehensive review that reflects the needs of those who are going  through this difficult process.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mrs I Robinson)</strong>:  I support the amendment because it includes more detail. The matter before us  is, undoubtedly, very emotive. Some complex  issues must be considered. There are difficult questions about how and  where precious resources ought to be  directed. Fertility services occupy a particular category in the health  care sector, as they do not deal with life threatening illnesses and the patients are not in pain &mdash; physically anyway.  Some would question the degree to which such treatments should be freely  available through public money. Undoubtedly, however, fertility services are  incredibly important, and denial of such treatments can prove traumatic to the couples affected. Furthermore,  we must consider how we should manage access to treatments that are considered to be expensive. We must also  predict the expected level of demand in the future, and the services  that we will need to deal with that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am always saddened when I hear about young couples who  have difficulty in conceiving a baby, especially when they are unable to avail  of fertilisation services due to the great expense. Raising the money to pay  for IVF treatment presents a terrible dilemma for individuals, as success can  never be guaranteed. Indeed, success in the first attempt at anything is always  unlikely. Recent statistics indicate that the success rate for IVF is as low as  15%, with only 19% of women who embark on such treatment ever having a baby.  Couples who have experienced unsuccessful attempts have the added fear that  they will be deemed unsuitable for further attempts.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is absurd that, for a long time, access to IVF treatment has been variable across the United Ki<span style="letter-spacing:0pt; ">ngdom</span>. Depending on where someone lived, they may have  been entitled to free IVF treatment on the National Health Service, while their  neighbour a few hundred yards away may have had to fund the treatment  themselves. The total cost of providing IVF treatment often extends to many  thousands of pounds, which puts it beyond the reach of many couples.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Recent improvements in the success rates of fertility  treatments are encouraging, but a wide disparity in results remains between  different clinics. The UK  public ought to be able to expect more standardised fertility service outcomes.  Many young couples in Northern    Ireland are unable to avail of IVF treatment  because of the cost. I have sympathy with  the suggestion that special  consideration should be given to how women at the upper end of the  permissible age spectrum can be accommodated. Couples are frustrated that  waiting lists and waiting times have been so long.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Reaching the stage at which treatment is eventually  obtained tends to follow a number of appointments to assess suitability and  carry out further investigations. Patients can feel as if they have been  dragged from pillar to post, and all the while, time is moving on, and the cut-off age at which certain treatments are  allowed is coming closer. A couple  who contacted my constituency office described a sad catalogue of  experiences. When they were referred by their general practitioner, they were  comfortably within the appropriate age range for all treatments. However, long  waits and cancelled appointments meant that when they were finally deemed ready  to be treated, the upper age limit for the only treatment that would make a  difference had been exceeded. Appointments had to be cancelled because the  consultant was ill, or on holiday, and the couple missed the age deadline to  receive treatment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Imagine the resources that had been used to get that couple  to that point, all to no avail. If we are to place a special emphasis on those  women who reach the upper age limit for  treatments, we must consider other possibly relevant criteria. For  example, some might make a distinction between couples who have no children and  those who seek fertility treatment having already had children. One partner in  some couples may have had children in a previous relationship. I hope that the  Minister will investigate the procurement practices and use of particular drugs  and treatments at the regional fertility centre as part of any review that may  occur. In previous years, there would appear to have been a preoccupation with particular drugs when less expensive  versions were available and proven to deliver equally successful outcomes.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is crucial that the resources directed towards fertility  services are used wisely. Excessive spending for no gain only reduces the  number of couples who can be treated over any given time frame. I support the  amendment.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  I thank the Member for West Belfast Mr Attwood for securing a debate on such an  important subject. It is recognised that once people get access to IVF  treatment, the vast majority of recipients are delighted with the quality of  care that they receive. In 2006, Northern Ireland&rsquo;s fertility  clinics obtained extremely high satisfaction scores, with more than 80% of  recipients having had satisfactory experiences and outcomes. However, despite  the excellent quality of care in fertility clinics and the sterling work of  their staff, access to such a clinic is a very different matter.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Waiting lists have already been mentioned. They are far too  long, and remedies must be found to ensure that all those women who require  this provision can receive it. As I understand it, there seems to be a postcode  lottery for IVF treatment across the UK, with wide variations in waiting  times for that treatment. I use the word &ldquo;treatment&rdquo; deliberately, because  infertility is an abnormality that can, for many, be addressed success&shy;fully.  Everyone, regardless of postcode, should be entitled to receive fertility care.  However, the UK is the poor  relation of Europe for fertility treatment.  That is why many Spanish clinics, for example, are making a good profit from  treating couples from the UK,  including people from Northern    Ireland, who cannot get treatment at home.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Infertility is not a rare problem. As many as one Northern  Irish couple in six are affected by fertility issues. What can be done to  change the situation? Some people say that donors are put off by the lack of  anonymity, while others point to the lack of investment in NHS clinics and the  insufficient numbers of embryologists. Those are good points: supply cannot  meet the current demand for treatment. Neither is it acceptable to continue the  current situation, where many people are told to opt for private healthcare &mdash; a  course of action that many cannot afford to pursue.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I understand that the cost of private IVF treatment in the United Kingdom  can be as much as &pound;100,000, and that is certainly beyond the reach of a lot of  people. One relatively low-cost step that might be taken is a public awareness  campaign to highlight the length of IVF waiting lists and to challenge the  social stigma surrounding donation and infertility. With such a poor donation  rate in Northern Ireland,  we must look at what steps other European countries have taken to encourage  donation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Member for West Belfast Mr Attwood for raising  the issue of age-related criteria. Ageism in all its forms is unacceptable and  should be a thing of the past. We must ensure that our waiting lists are  managed properly. As long as we are short of capacity, we must ensure that the  couples who are in most need &mdash; particularly those who are in the upper age  range for eligibility for the treatment &mdash; are given some sort of priority  access.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The best long-term solution is to encourage more donors and  train more embryologists, as has proved possible in other European countries.  To do that, we must challenge the stigma surrounding donations; raise public  awareness of the need for donations; and learn from our European neighbours how  to encourage people to become donors or train as embryologists. I support the motion  and the amendment.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  This is an emotive topic to bring to the Floor. It might well be useful for the  Health Committee to discuss it in greater detail and hear from the Minister,  the Department and the relevant experts &mdash; the clinicians.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The subject of IVF  waiting lists is, as I said, emotive, particularly for couples affected  by fertility problems. However, in a world of health budgets, it is unfair to  raise false hope among infertile couples and lead them to believe that an  Assembly motion, proposed by a Member with no Executive responsibility for  health matters, will somehow change things. Is that even the best way forward?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Today, we heard some of the figures for the Depart&shy;ment of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety&rsquo;s budget, and they will hit these  types of services hard. I am sure that the Health Minister will say more about  that in his speech.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">IVF treatment has been available on the National Health  Service in Northern Ireland  since December 2001. Its associated costs are a major reason for not expanding  the service. The NHS estimates that the average cost of one cycle of IVF  treatment is &pound;2,771. Since 2001, the interim service has been provided with a  cost envelope of expenditure of &pound;1&middot;4 million per annum. It has, therefore, been  necessary to restrict access to the service. This lack of resources is the main  reason why IVF treatment is not more freely available.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The upper age limit at which female partners using their own eggs can access publicly funded IVF  treatment was raised from 37 to 38 in October 2006 and from 38 to 39 in  April 2007, and an additional &pound;50,000 was made available for counselling  services in 2006.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That is, of course, an important measure.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Health and social services boards do not always have  detailed figures for fertility service waiting times. The Department has proved  to be responsive, with a tranche of reforms  and measures over the past few years. However, the Committee could look  at the subject in much more detail than the Assembly would be allowed to do.  The Member has raised an important issue.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  Not that long ago &mdash; possibly in August &mdash; I proposed that the Department for  Regional Development should provide free transport to the over-60s. Thankfully,  the announcement on that matter was agreed today. Does the Member not think  that by bringing this important subject to the Floor of the Assembly that the  Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety might be minded to do  something similar in the not too distant future?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  First, it probably was not in August &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  It was in August &mdash; 19 August &mdash; that I brought the matter to the Floor of the  Assembly.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  In here?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  Yes.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Was the Assembly not in recess? I doubt that it was in August. However, if the  Member says that it was &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  It was on the Floor of this Assembly anyway.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  That is probably why the Member got it passed. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I take the Member&rsquo;s  point. We were all very supportive of that measure &mdash; particularly my  colleague for North Belfast Fred Cobain, and  I am sure that he will welcome it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We are looking at a fairly meagre increase. Taking inflation into context, there may almost be a cut  in health spending. Set against a  backdrop of delivering the other measures that the Assembly has made it  clear that it wants, such as free personal care, and given that the Minister and the Department may not have the resources  to deliver, we do not want to be raising false hopes.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Buchanan</strong>:  I support the amendment, as it is fuller and gives more detail on the way  forward. The motion will generate interest in many couples across Northern Ireland.  In 2006, a leading Belfast doctor estimated that  40,000 couples in Northern    Ireland suffered from infertility. For many  couples seeking to start a family and who are faced with the difficulty of infertility, few Members, if any in the House,  can begin to identify with them or understand the frustration, anxiety  and pressure that that can bring to bear on a relationship or on a married  couple.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Many couples see IVF treatment as the lifeline to resolving  their problems. However, it must be noted that IVF is successful in only a  percentage of cases. Although 30,000 women in the UK undergo IVF treatment each year,  statistics show that it results in approximately 8,300 births, which is less  than a 30% success rate.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, it must be acknowledged that there is a growing  demand for IVF treatment. Although demand for treatment among women in their  forties has soared, statistics show clearly that older women have a lower  overall success rate. For example, in 2004, women who underwent fertility  treatment at 28 years of age had a success rate of 25&middot;7%, while women of 40  years of age had a success rate of only 11&middot;8%. Therefore, in light of that, it  is important that the waiting lists should be addressed urgently.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is a dangerous scenario for couples to think that simply  because IVF treatment is available, they should delay their attempts to start a  family until later in life when they have finished a career or feel more ready  to settle down.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The matter of IVF treatment is complex. It presents difficulties for some Members because it is so expensive  and is not always successful. During IVF treatment, many embryos are created in  the laboratory. They are then graded, and at least two or three are transferred  into the womb. The remainder are frozen or, if they do not look healthy, they  are discarded.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Some of us believe that life begins at the point of conception. Therefore, life has begun before the  embryo is implanted in the womb in order for it to complete its  development. As soon as an embryo exists, it has the full status of any other person. To disregard the embryo in that  way is to kill it, which, in reality, is abortion. Nevertheless, some fertility  clinics in Northern Ireland  have enrolled infertile couples in IVF programmes on the proviso that only two  or three embryos would be produced for implantation. None would be frozen,  meaning that there would be no question of any fatal reduction in numbers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">With that in mind, it is important not only to address the  issue of waiting lists and age-weighting criteria but to consider the wider  aspects of such treatment. The NHS was founded on the principle of fair and  equal access to healthcare services for  all, yet, clearly, current IVF-treatment policies are neither equal nor  fair and are failing many people in Northern Ireland. I support the  amendment.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>:  It is ironic that earlier this week the Assembly dealt with the subject of  abortion and that today, Members are discussing the availability of IVF  treatment. It was interesting to hear how those who campaign to make abortion  more widely available reacted to the Assembly&rsquo;s call to protect the lives of  unborn children. Today, we are speaking in support of those who are anxious to have a child and who can offer the love,  happiness and security of a caring family.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">For many people, the inability to have a child is a colossal blow that causes great sorrow and unhappiness.  That often goes unnoticed because other people are concentrating on their own  concerns. It is difficult to imagine how couples who cannot conceive feel when  they realise how many abortions occur every day.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members may not be  surprised to hear that the United Kingdom is a world leader in the scientific research and  technology that is involved in IVF treatment. In spite of that, however, the United Kingdom  is at the bottom of the European league on the availability of treatment. In Denmark, the chances of receiving treatment are  three times higher than in the UK,  and they are twice as likely in France  and the Netherlands.  In addition, there is a postcode lottery in the United Kingdom for the provision of  a service that will materially change people&rsquo;s lives.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is an interesting exercise to go on the Internet and  find that all over Europe, IVF treatment is privately available at a moment&rsquo;s  notice at a fraction of the UK  cost from highly skilled and qualified physicians. Therefore, it is vital that  we here in Northern Ireland  do all that is in our power to emulate our European neighbours.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the Province, the numbers seeking IVF treatment are  relatively small; therefore, I appeal for sufficient resources to be made  available to the Health Service in order to help those people.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly is committed to developing a society that puts  the needs of people to the forefront of its thinking, to supporting the family  and family values and to creating a future in which children grow up in a loving and caring family relationship. It is of paramount  importance that Members unequivocally support those who require IVF treatment  in order to have children. I support the call for resources to be made  available to bring the Province in line with  countries such as France, Denmark, and the Netherlands. It is vital that  special consideration is given to that relatively small percentage  of people who require treatment in order that they can know the joy of having a  child of their own.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">With 48% of Northern  Ireland&rsquo;s overall Budget being spent on health, and considering that so  much of the health budget is spent on art &mdash; a policy that I know that the  Minister reviewing &mdash; perhaps some of that money could be redirected and made  available for IVF treatment. I hope that the  Minister will perhaps consider that today. I support the amendment; it  is a much better proposition than the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Hanna</strong>: I support the motion in the name of my colleague Alex Attwood,  and I thank him for bringing it to the House. The Floor of the House is the first  port of call for such a debate, not to give false hope, but to raise awareness of the issue, which can then be  matched against need and availability of resources.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In vitro fertilization via the National Health Service is  characterised by long waiting lists and a restricted number of treatment  cycles. Important issues that have been  raised by patients include the lack of understanding of what it means to be on a waiting list. Initial  predicted waiting times can be greatly underestimated. When patients eventually  receive treatment, they consider it worthwhile, but they have legitimate  concerns about the time that they had to  spend waiting for it. For many, the wait is too long and too uncertain.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Concerns have also been raised about the fact that IVF  waiting lists involve hidden costs for patients and for the National Health  Service. IVF creates a human dilemma. Although the Assembly talks up the idea  of supporting families, it must give them more practical support.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Dozens of couples are  struck off the waiting list every year, and they either give up trying  to get treatment or pay for it privately. Fertility experts have concluded that conception rates for women who use their own  eggs decline after the age of 39, and that was the reason for raising  the bar to 40. However, most women turn to IVF treatment only after trying to  become pregnant for several years. Naturally, they may be approaching the age  of 40 by the time they apply for IVF.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">For women using donated eggs, IVF is permissible up to the  age of 49. However, access to the treatment is patchy, and, as a result of  delays and inconsistencies, many couples, despite meeting the age  qualification, miss out.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Some experts recommend that the current rules for those on NHS waiting lists should be relaxed.  Infertility can have devastating effects, and, after years of trying  unsuccessfully to have a family, many couples face very long waits. For many,  as I said, the treatment comes too late.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although I appreciate  that a cut-off point is necessary, it is important to take all factors  into account and to consider that couples who want to conceive children go  through an emotional and anxious time, particularly those who are growing older  and facing their last chance to have a baby.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Medical science is moving on, and many women in their 40s have children. Doctors can do much more  these days, and I hope that medical advances will continue in that area.  Infertile couples need better services. Reducing waiting lists and extending  the age limit for IVF might not be the whole answer, but cutting the waiting  time is extremely important. If people are fortunate enough to join a short  waiting list, they will have a greater opportunity to avail of IVF treatment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As has been said, our fertility treatments are falling  behind those of our European counterparts, as has the number of babies born as a result of IVF. I know women who have  gone abroad to receive treatment, but that option is not open to everyone  because of the cost.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The NICE guidelines, &lsquo;Fertility: assessment and treatment  for people with fertility problems&rsquo;, which have been mentioned, recommend three  cycles of treatment. However, despite that recommendation, only one cycle of  treatment is currently available.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In September 2006, the then Minister with respons&shy;ibility for health, Paul Goggins, announced new  criteria for assessing Health Service IVF treatment under the headings of waiting lists, counselling services,  and intra uterine insemination (IUI) treatment, but, at present, there  is a lack of guidance from the Department on how to prioritise treatment for  patients, and the social criteria vary.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I call on the Department of Health, Social Services and  Public Safety to consult interested parties with a view to renewing the  criteria in order to overcome the current inequalities, which can restrict some  couples from receiving the same treatment as others.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Access has to be fair and equal. During what is an already  stressful and traumatic time for those involved, couples are still being forced  to wait for up to three years &mdash; that is unacceptable.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Motherhood, and preparing for motherhood &mdash; whether through pregnancy, adoption, surrogacy, or  IVF &mdash; has many challenges, which are  often unsatisfactorily dealt with by contradictory plans and treatments  that are in place. I have contacted the Minister of Health, Social Services and  Public Safety regarding some of those issues.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member&rsquo;s time is almost up.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Hanna</strong>:  Finally, we need to have a comprehensive review to get better and fairer  access.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  Thers naethin laek tha feilin that ye git whun ye furst haud yer sinn&rsquo; er  dochter in yer erms. It jist canny be explained an tha experience is a real ee&rsquo;  apener. An as a&rsquo; prood fether o&rsquo; three strappin sinns&rsquo; aa&rsquo; cann sae this tae  ye: the feelin disnae gaun awa wi&rsquo; mare wanes er tha passin o&rsquo; tiem. It is fer  this raison that whun aa&rsquo; think o&rsquo; tha yins that his nae hed this apertunity.  It is my desire tae help them in tha yin wae aa&rsquo; caun &ndash; an that is tae be ahint  ther claim fer IVF in tha Provance.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is nothing like  the feeling that you get when you first  hold your son or daughter in your arms; it cannot be expressed or  explained. It is an experience that cannot be equalled and as the proud father  of three strapping boys, I can tell you that the strength of feeling does not  diminish with subsequent children or, indeed, with the passing of time. For  that reason, when I think of people who do not have such opportunities, it is  my desire to support them in the only way that I can &mdash; and that is to support their claim for IVF in the Province.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The proposer of the motion made a good case, but I am supporting the amendment, because it is more  detailed and gives the issue the  focus and attention that it needs.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The figures are clear. It is estimated that over 40,000  couples in Northern Ireland  have problems conceiving a child, and one in seven couples have problems with  fertility. As elected representatives, we are aware of the stress, trauma and  heartbreak that results from those cases. People go to their GP, only to learn  that in order to qualify for IVF treatment, they must have been infertile for up to three years. That is an issue  that I have a problem with. The modern age must be considered. People  are no longer necessarily getting married at 18. These days, women have careers  that they want to pursue. Therefore, they  put off having children until well into their 30s, instead of their  mid-20s. That can mean that when it comes  to having children, their opportunity &mdash; without their knowing &mdash; may have  passed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is important to realise that the prerequisite of having  three years&rsquo; infertility recognised by GPs will carry some women over the  desired age range. The age limit for IVF treatment of 38, which was previously  in place, should rightly be upped to 40. That would mean that women who have chosen a career without realising  that they have a problem would be able to  take advantage of the treatment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Couples are currently offered the opportunity of three  cycles of treatment. That gives a 50% chance of success. Some ladies that come  to my office have had successful IVF treatment, which resulted in wonderful  experiences, but others have been unsuccessful, and it has cost them a small  fortune. I know of ladies who &mdash; rather than buy a house, as some of them could  have done, and perhaps should have done &mdash; spent all of their money on IVF  treatment that was unsuccessful. Real trauma and disappointment can be seen in  those people&rsquo;s faces. I know of one lady who spent &pound;13,000 on unsuccessful  fertility treatment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It may seem that three cycles is more than generous.  However, it is hard to tell that to a couple whose third pregnancy has failed  and who are heartbroken. I know people who have gone to Bulgaria and Istanbul for treatment &mdash; again, at great  personal cost. Some of them have been successful, and some have not. Those are  issues that must be focused on.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In Denmark,  more cycles per million couples are offered &mdash; these are technical issues, but Great Britain  is far behind, having only 600 cycles per million couples. Those figures need  to be considered.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Scottish Executive have suggested that five cycles  should be offered, in order to boost the success of IVF treatment. That is  something that the Assembly should ask the Minister to consider. The waiting lists  are too long, the opportunities are too restricted, and the medical  professionals are too far stretched.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There are, of course, couples who cannot carry a child,  which is heart-rending. However, we have got to try to help those who want to  find out whether fertility treatment can help them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Northern    Ireland must have more NHS facilities with  the capacity to carry out fertilisation programmes. I urge the Minister of  Health to recognise the lack of facilities suffered by this field of medicine,  in the UK as a whole, and in  Northern Ireland  in particular. He must put in place the makings of change.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I support the amendment and ask Members to do likewise. It  is important for a woman to experience the unparalleled joy of having a child.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>: I commend my colleague Alex Attwood for bringing this important  issue to the Assembly. Like other Members, I acknowledge that the amendment is  a positive contribution. This is not a contest between the original motion and  the amendment; it is such an important issue, and Members should reinforce what  they hear each other say, to amplify our concern for the people who need those  services.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As politicians, we often say that we are doing something  for our children and our children&rsquo;s children. We  heard it said today. It is natural for people to presume that every  adult or married couple has children, or, if it is their choice, that they will  have them. Often, in a glib and natural way, when we use such phrases, we  unintentionally remind people who go to all sorts of lengths, and cope with infertility and stress in the absence of  children, of the pain that they suffer. Because we make that assumption, people  who wait, hope and make all sorts of endeavours to have a child find the way in  which we talk about these things painful and &mdash; literally &mdash; thoughtless.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Yet again, the Minister is present to hear Members&rsquo;  concerns on important issues. As well as addressing our remarks to him and his  Department, it is important that we all look at the way we talk about families,  at the assumptions we make and, sometimes, at the jokes we make about  infertility and its treatment. All of us could be more sensitive in that  regard. I speak as one with experience. It was nearly 12 years before my wife  and I were blessed with a child. At times, the way in which things are said can  hurt. For that reason, I am always open to people who raise these issues.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That is also why I pay tribute to the former Minister of  Health in the previous phase of devolution, Bairbre de Br&uacute;n, who took an  important step back in 2001 in commissioning a consultation about fertility  treatment. Because it involved financial  implications, I, as Minister of Finance and Personnel, had to agree that  with her. In 2006 we finally obtained an  outcome from the document &lsquo;From People to Parents: A Public Consultation  Document on the Future of Fertility  Services in Northern Ireland&rsquo;. I was pleased with some of the changes that emerged. It was realised that the limit on the  number of cycles that people could have was a grave disappoint&shy;ment. Many people had campaigned for a good outcome  from that consultation; many had spent years waiting for its outcome; and many  others had spent years waiting for treatment or working with people waiting for  treatment. As so often the case in this situation, the success that they saw  was tinged with other sadness and frustrations.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I felt, in late 2006, that the Minister responsible, Paul  Goggins, did not go as far as his predecessor had seemed to promise me in the  House of Commons. That predecessor was  Shaun Woodward, the current Secretary of State for Northern Ireland,  who talked up a much bigger and more  sensitive outcome to the &lsquo;From People to Parents&rsquo; consultation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is right, therefore, for the Assembly to ask the  Department to look at this again. In supporting the amendment, I do not direct this to the Minister alone, or  suggest that the Committee should have no role in this.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As we have heard today, both the Health Minister and the Health Committee can make a serious, sensitive  and purposeful contribution to ensure that we make progress and achieve good  outcomes.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We must create a  situation in which people can access the services that they have been  told are available, and can understand the criteria. Neither the couple nor the  professionals who are dealing with them should find that they must cope with  gobbledegook, as though they are a problem or an unwarranted demand on a system  that has better things to do and better people to look after. This issue is fundamental to people&rsquo;s ambitions for themselves, not only as private couples and  individuals but as people who want to be part of a wholesome, healthy  society &mdash; the type of society that Members have talked about aspiring to today.  Families are at the centre of that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Those people who are struggling to become a family need  every bit of support that we can give them. Those for whom treatment does not succeed also need support, so there must be more emphasis on counselling services  for those who are awaiting treatment, and for those who have had treatment and  have been disappointed.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mr McGimpsey)</strong>: For those  affected, infertility can be a shattering problem that affects every area of  their lives. It is important that their concerns in relation to its treatment  are addressed openly and fairly, and that everyone is clear about who may have  publicly funded fertility treatment. It is also important that people know why  there are conditions on access to services. Therefore, I shall briefly outline  how those conditions were decided.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In April 2001, there was no publicly funded IVF service in Northern Ireland.  As Mr Durkan has said, in response to increasing demand, the then Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety, Bairbre de Br&uacute;n, initiated a public  debate on the future of publicly funded fertility services and, specifically,  which services should be funded by the Health Service.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">While proposals were prepared for consultation, interim  arrangements were put in place in order to allow access &mdash; albeit limited access  &mdash; to publicly funded services. In the light of other competing priorities in  healthcare services, limited funding was allocated to the provision of IVF. In  2001, that funding was &pound;1&middot;2 million, which was to allow for two cycles of treatment for women up to 37 years old. The  consultation document &lsquo;From People to Parents&rsquo; was issued for public  consultation, and that document sought views on a wide range of matters in  relation to IVF treatment. Opinions were sought on the specific conditions for  access to the service, and those included, among other issues, the upper age  limit at which the female partner could be provided with publicly funded  treatment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">An analysis of the responses to the consultation was used,  along with NICE guidance, where applicable, to develop revised access criteria.  Those criteria were introduced in October  2006, and all the proposed changes were subject to a full equality  impact assessment to ensure that they did not unfairly disadvantage any  patients who wished to access the service. Many of the changes that were  introduced were designed to make IVF treatment accessible to a larger number of  women. The upper age limit for women using their own eggs was raised from 37 to  38 on 1 October 2006, and from 38 to 39 on 1 April 2007. That was in line with  the NICE guidelines, and with the latest advice from the Human Fertilisation  and Embryology Authority, the body that regulates such services. Restrictive  criteria on couples with dependent children, who until then had not been  eligible, were also removed. In addition, a previous policy was removed that  had forced women to wait for three years before they could join the waiting  list if they had an appropriately diagnosed cause for infertility.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members will have heard me say many times that funding for  health services remains very tight, and will become tighter. We have not been  able to allocate additional funding for fertility services, and could do so  only at the expense of other high-priority services.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Before my time as Minister of Health, Social Services and  Public Safety, in order to allow a greater number of women to avail of  treatment, the decision was made to reduce the number of fertility treatments  from two to one per woman.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">NICE guidelines recommend that three treatments  should be provided. However, at the time, the number of treatments was two,  which was then reduced to one. Although that  is not ideal, the argument was that priority be given to making the  opportunity for publicly funded treatment available to the largest number of  women possible. During transition to the  new policy, qualifying couples who were already on the waiting list and  who had had one unsuccessful cycle of treatment were offered a further cycle in  order to honour assurances that they had been given.</p>
	      <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Dallat] in the Chair)</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">4.00 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I recognise that NICE guidance recommends the provision of  three cycles. Approximately 420 cycles are provided each year. However, 590  patients are waiting for IVF treatment. Therefore, even though one cycle per  person is provided, there is still a shortage. That is why there is a waiting  list. The waiting list depends purely on  resources, rather than on capacity, the number of doctors, and so on. To  provide three cycles on the current resource level would reduce the number of  women who can avail of treatment by two thirds.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The policy is also based on age considerations. It is,  however, not an ageist policy; it has had an equality impact assessment and  equality assurance. The chance of a live birth for each IVF treatment cycle  drops as women get older; from 20% to 15% after the age of 35, to 10% aged 39  and to 6% aged 40. Therefore, the argument is that to skew resources towards  women who are at the upper end of the age limit would be less likely to achieve  a successful result.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That is the current context in which the waiting list  operates. Patients are dealt with chronologically from the date on which they  go on the list. Waiting times are determined by the date of the consultant&rsquo;s  referral to the fertility clinic. Waiting times for appointments with the  consultant are determined by the date of the application. In order to ensure  equity, patients are added to the waiting list from the date on which their  consultant at the regional fertility centre decides that they are suitable for  treatment. They are then treated strictly in chronological order, in line with  the systems that are in place for all other health services.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It has been suggested that women who are likely to reach  the upper age limit for treatment before they reach the top of the list should  be prioritised so that they are treated before their fortieth birthday. That is  difficult to justify. Moving women up the waiting list can only be done at the  expense of other couples who may have been  waiting considerably longer for treatment. It is also recognised that  the likelihood of fertility treatment being  successful decreases with age, as I have explained. Therefore, skewing  resources accordingly would cause a delay that could affect the chances of  others who have effectively been leapfrogged on the waiting list. As I have  said, those chances reduce to 6% by the age of 40. Those are the proven  outcomes of fertility treatment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is also important to point out that when annual  resources have been allocated to individual patients, no further publicly  funded treatments can be provided during  the financial year. In other words, when resources are used up  determines when treatment is no longer offered; not other reasons, such as  doctors&rsquo; time, and so on. The issue is purely one of resources. In those  circumstances, it would almost always be the youngest patient on the list who  would be disadvantaged.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, it is recognised practice that when the date for  treatment is set, the revised policy is not applied retrospectively, nor should exceptions normally be made. I  must ensure that service provision is equitable and accessible to as many women  as possible and that it provides the best possible chances of successful  pregnancy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As regards a postcode lottery, and the issue of  differential treatment in different parts of Northern Ireland, funding is  provided by the four area boards on a capitation basis &mdash; in the same way that  all other Health Service funding is provided &mdash; in order to ensure equity of  access and spend. The current policy &mdash; and  all of this went through the review &mdash; encourages early access to  treatment. Therefore, it is possible that the access criteria that we currently  have on offer provide a fair and equitable chance for all women who need  publicly funded services.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Moreover, at the time when the new criteria were  introduced, boards were asked to monitor referrals and waiting times over the  first year in order to assess demand for services and the capacity of the  regional fertility centre. The first year in which the boards have been  operating under the new criteria is now complete, and the boards have been  asked to report on the situation. That report will be made available at the end  of November. I must emphasise that, in reviewing the policy, we are always  going to return to the issue of available resources and the resources to be  devoted to that service. That, of course,  in times of limited resources means that there must be prioritisation of  services.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There has been a review and a consultation. Criteria have  been set, and they have been widespread. They do not follow NICE guidelines as  regards three-cycle funding. Rather, they follow NICE guidelines on one-cycle  funding. The risks were taken into account during that review. It has only been  in operation for a year. The Department is about to undertake monitoring and  referral of the scheme.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Having said all that, I hear the views of the House, and I  understand the points that have been made. Mr Attwood has spoken to me about  the issue on a number of occasions, as have Mrs O&rsquo;Neill and Mrs Hanna. If it is  the will of the House, I will be happy to revisit the review. In due course, I  would return to the House and report on the matter. However, I would need to  wait until November, by which time the referrals will have come through &mdash; that  is only another four weeks. I would then be in a position to consider  undertaking a review, specifically, of the  issues of waiting lists, skewing for age and &mdash; the key factor &mdash; funding  limitations. With regard to funding limitations, whatever the UK Government  says, the trusts throughout the UK  operate a funded single cycle of treatment for each patient. That is the  situation. If Members request a review, I will be happy to accede to that  request.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat. I apologise for being late in joining the debate. I had  been chairing the Public Accounts Committee meeting. I came to the Chamber as  soon as possible.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I declare an interest in the motion. I am one of the lucky  people; I have a two-year-old daughter as a result of IVF treatment. I am  doubly lucky, because my wife is expecting a second child as a result of IVF  treatment. So, we are doubly blessed in that matter. We have been through the  mill over the past six to eight years. It is an experience that is not unique  to us as a couple &mdash; or, perhaps, to others in the Chamber &mdash; and it is  definitely not unknown to those in wider society.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Anyone who has experienced infertility, and the treatment  for it, has been through hell. That is the only way in which I can describe it.  At one level, I would not wish IVF treatment on anyone, because of the physical  and emotional demands that it places on the woman, firstly, and the tremendous  emotional demands that it places on the couple and their relationship. The  treatment is very difficult for the woman. In this debate I have heard terms such as &ldquo;ICSI&rdquo;, &ldquo;donor eggs&rdquo;,  &ldquo;donor sperm&rdquo;, &ldquo;harvesting of eggs&rdquo;, &ldquo;hyperstimulation injections&rdquo; and  &ldquo;frozen embryos&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Many a time, my wife and I have said that we could write a  stage play based on the humorous side of IVF treatment.  Humour was what got us through the darkest days of the treatment. The  many situations in which people who are  receiving IVF treatment find themselves are often a source of humour,  and that humour gets people through the dark days.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We underwent a number of treatments under the original  system, and those treatments were free. However, we ended up having to opt for  private treatment. The average cost of treatment is &pound;2,700, but that cost can  rise to as much as &pound;3,500. The costs of individual treatment and the specific  drugs, and so on, all add up. If Members consider the physical and emotional  pressures that people who are going through the treatment are under, and then  add to those the worry that is experienced about bank loans, credit-card  repayments and overdrafts, it becomes clear that the pressure on couples is  great.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Moreover, that tension and pressure does not help the woman  when she is receiving treatment. When the eggs  are put back in at the start of the process, the woman is told that she  must relax. However, she cannot do so because of the worry about whether the  treatment will work and whether the couple can afford it. My wife and I were  lucky because we were in reasonably paid jobs at the time of our treatment, so  we could meet the bills. However, many couples cannot do so. Many find it  impossible to afford the repayments on a &pound;3,500 extension to a loan or  mortgage, and that means that they cannot have children. That is not fair.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I know that the Minister&rsquo;s budget is very tight and that he  has to apportion funds where they are needed and in response to high-profile  demands. However, the fact that Mr Attwood has brought this motion to the House  shows that there are wider concerns in society about infertility and that  further action is required to address the issue. I welcome the motion, and I  clearly support the amendment, which adds to the motion. The views that have been  expressed in the Chamber show that wider society wants a more concentrated  approach to be taken to infertility and for couples who cannot have children to  be given more support.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I particularly noted Mr Durkan&rsquo;s remarks on the comments  that are sometimes made to couples who do not have children. I have heard them  all &mdash; both the well-meaning ones and the smart-alec ones. People should take a  step back and think about what they are saying. Such comments are like a stab  through the heart. People sometimes intend their remarks as a joke, but they  are not funny. I appeal to anyone who is listening to this debate to think  twice before making comments to couples without children, as there may be a  deep-seated reason for why they do not have any.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s saying that he is prepared to take  on board Members&rsquo; views and report back to us in mid-November. I applaud the  Minister for that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have one criticism of counselling services. I appeal to  counsellors to remember that a man is involved in the process, too. I have the  greatest respect for those who work in the regional fertility centre at the Royal Maternity  Hospital in Belfast. From the moment that we walked in  the door, we were struck by how brilliant the staff were &mdash; from the first  person we met to the highest-level medic in  the building. They are all brilliant people. However, when accessing and  receiving counselling services, men  sometimes feel that they are an add-on. They must be fully included in  the counselling process.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I say at the outset that the SDLP will, of course, support the Sinn F&eacute;in  amendment. The amendment is welcome, as is any amendment that enhances a motion  and that adds detail and direction.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I shall focus on some themes that have run through the debate. Mrs O&rsquo;Neill was the first Member to  mention the three cycles of treatment, which other Members, including Mr  Durkan and Mrs Hanna, also mentioned later. The provision of three cycles of  IVF treatment is a touchstone of fertility services in Northern Ireland,  and it must be dealt with if progress is to be made. I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s  remarks, but, given the flavour of the debate and the fact that so many Members  spoke in favour of a three-cycle outcome, I believe that the Assembly will  ultimately be judged, and must judge itself, on whether it works to achieve  that outcome. This issue, as much as any  other, will be a touchstone as to whether there are benefits to  devolution.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the comments of Iris Robinson. After reading the  House of Commons Hansard reports, I know that she has been diligent on this  issue over a long period, and has asked many useful and probing questions &mdash; as  has my colleague Mark Durkan &mdash; in trying to advance this issue. I agree with  her that there have been problems in the administration of regional fertility  waiting lists.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although I acknowledge Mr O&rsquo;Dowd&rsquo;s comment about the good  work that is carried out in the regional fertility clinic, there are problems  of management and bureaucracy, which I have experienced. I wrote a letter to  the regional fertility clinic in November 2006, asking about the number of  people on waiting lists in the North, and whether there could be any indicative  time frame for those people to receive treatment &mdash; I did not receive a reply  until 1 June 2007. I suggest to the Minister that any forthcoming review looks  at how to enhance the capacity and management of the regional fertility clinic  so that couples know when they might anticipate treatment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the comments of Kieran McCarthy and John  McCallister. I suspect &mdash; although it is not for me to say &mdash; that there is a  role for the Health Committee in all of these matters. We can also learn from  the European experience. If &mdash; as Mr McCarthy says &mdash; we are the poor relation in  Europe in respect of the provision of  fertility treatment, is it beyond the wit of the Assembly, the Minister and the  Committee to become a shining example, rather than remain behind the game?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText"><span style="letter-spacing:-.25pt; ">I concur with Mrs  Hanna&rsquo;s response to Mr McCalli</span>ster; I do not attempt to build up the  hopes of couples who come to see me. The advice that I gave to women to whom I  spoke on the phone yesterday afternoon was based  on a premise of &ldquo;expect little and hope for much&rdquo;. I know from the  experience of the couple that I mentioned earlier that couples can have their  hopes completely dashed. Therefore, there  is a need for a high level of caution when Members speak to constituents  about this matter.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">4.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department, the Minister and the Assembly must be  challenged to turn this issue around. Mr Durkan and Mr O&rsquo;Dowd were quite right  to remind the Assembly that, for the all  the joy that people experience from having children &mdash; I have a young  child &mdash; we cannot forget that that same joy is not enjoyed by many people. On  my behalf, and that of the Assembly, I wish Mr O&rsquo;Dowd and his wife well in the  time until their second child is born. The  content of Mr O&rsquo;Dowd&rsquo;s speech was a  personal, intimate and compelling narrative that should be a guide for  Members, the Minister, and the Department in how to advance the issue.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the fact that the Minister is present and I  welcome much of what he said. I particularly welcome his statement that, if it  were the will of the Assembly, he might be minded to look again at how a review  is carried out. I very much welcome that, and I hope that the Minister acts  accordingly.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister noted that, ultimately, these matters &mdash; and  all such matters &mdash; are subject to constraints on funding. I was reminded that  the Minister of Finance and Personnel mentioned greater end-year flexibility in  today&rsquo;s statement on the draft Budget.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There would be greater end-year flexibility when it came to  financial opportunities during and at the end of the financial year. I suggest  that, given that that now appears to be the  case, it might be opportune to consider, as soon as possible, how to  front-load some of that funding to provide additional flexibility for fertility  services in order to try and achieve the target of three cycles of treatment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I ask the Minister, when he is considering how to take  forward the review, to take into account the questions that I and other Members  have asked, and that he has the opportunity  to respond to, because those questions will inform how the review is  constructed. There is a range of issues to be considered, some of which might  be dealt with if they were in the review&rsquo;s terms  of reference. I do not believe that the Department has proven the case  that a woman who is about to attain the age of 40 is leapfrogging, as the  Minister described it, a younger woman. I do not think that it has been proven that the older person gets an  advantage that is disproportionate to the disadvantage of the younger  woman.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Hard cases do not make good law, but in recent days I have  been speaking to women, one of whom attained the age of 40 and was unable to  get treatment. I spoke to another woman, aged 27, who last month completed her  first cycle of treatment and is now looking for a second cycle. I suggest that  treating women who are approaching 40 does not materially disadvantage those  who are 27, 26 or 25. The clinical and medical judge&shy;ments are difficult,  because every case is different. However,  it has not been proven to me, or to the couple who spoke to me about the matter, that they would have been  disadvantaged in a way that was disproportionate to other categories of people.  Given that nothing can be done about the couple that I have spoken about, I ask  the Minister to reconsider the matter and find another way for women who are  about to attain the age of 40 in the next few months to be accommodated  properly and legally.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank everyone for  their contributions to the debate; the tone and character was proper. I  urge Members to support the motion, as amended.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText"><span class="Italic">Question,</span> That the amendment be  made, <span class="Italic">put and agreed to.</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText"><span class="Italic">Main Question, as amended, put and  agreed to.</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText"><span class="Italic">Resolved</span>:</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly calls on the Minister of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety to commence a comprehensive review into the current  criteria used to assess eligibility, including the age weighting criteria, the  ongoing problem with waiting lists, and the number of IVF treatments available  on the NHS, with a view to establishing a more equitable and accessible policy.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading"><a name="5"></a>Windscale/Sellafield</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Business Committee has agreed  to allow up to one and a half hours for this debate. The proposer of the  motion will have 10 minutes to propose and 10 minutes for the winding-up  speech. All other Members will have five  minutes. Two amendments have been received and have been published on  the Marshalled List. Members who move the amendments will have 10 minutes to  propose and five minutes for their winding-up speeches.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McKay</strong>: I  beg to move:</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly expresses concern at the findings of the  report on the impact of the Windscale Piles accident at the Sellafield nuclear  plant and the implications that this has for the health and well-being of  people living on these islands and in Europe;  and calls upon the Government to discontinue  all operations at the Sellafield nuclear plant.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Sinn F&eacute;in has  brought the motion to the Assembly, not only out of concern for the public  health of people who live on the east coast in places such as Antrim, Down and  Louth but also because it is concerned at the threat that Sellafield poses to  the well-being of people who live throughout Ireland, as well as in Britain and  western Europe. Sinn F&eacute;in will not be supporting either amendment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The DUP amendment supports nuclear power, which directly  contradicts the motion, and the SDLP amendment adds nothing substantive to Sinn  F&eacute;in&rsquo;s motion. A motion to the same effect has been passed in the D&aacute;il. Today,  the Assembly has an opportunity to send a clear message to the British  Government that all the major political institutions on this island want the  nuclear plant at Sellafield to be shut down.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Fifty years ago, there was radioactive fallout from a major  accident at the Windscale nuclear reactor. New research shows that the incident  generated twice as much radioactive material and caused dozens more cancers  than was previously thought. At the time, the Windscale  fire was the world&rsquo;s biggest nuclear disaster. The methods used to  extinguish the fire could have caused an explosion, but, fortunately, they did  not.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Tom Tuohy, who was the deputy general manager on the site,  led the team that had to contend with a nightmare  that no one at that time had thought possible. He said:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Mankind had never faced a situation like this&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, the Windscale accident was not a one-off. Just two  years ago at Sellafield, there was a leakage of highly radioactive nuclear  fuel. Approximately 20 tons of uranium and plutonium &mdash; enough to make 20  nuclear weapons &mdash; dissolved and escaped through a cracked pipe. Nordic  parliamentarians recently met the owners of  Sellafield and told them that safety procedures at the nuclear plant  needed to be tightened up. The British authorities have granted permission to  resume reprocessing of nuclear waste at the THORP, which was closed several  years ago because of a radioactive leak. The controversial THORP has aroused  strong feelings in Nordic and Irish politicians. Ministers with responsibility  for the environment from Norway,  the Twenty-six Counties, Iceland and Austria have demanded that  it not be reopened.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A devastating official inquiry recently found that safety  alarms had been routinely ignored, operating instructions flouted and safety  equipment left broken at the controversial plant. The inquiry report, one of  the most damming ever of a British nuclear installation, condemned the Cumbrian  complex for its &ldquo;alarm-tolerant culture&rdquo;. It also identified:</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText"><span style="font-size:8.5pt; ">&ldquo;long-standing failings in  some key safety arrangements&rdquo;</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">and a</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;failure to learn from previous events&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The accident at the THORP was disclosed by &lsquo;The Independent on Sunday&rsquo; in 2005 and was the focus  of the investigation. Some 83,000 litres of highly radioactive liquid leaked at the plant for at least eight  months before the spill was detected.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The daughter of a man who died at the Sellafield reprocessing plant in the 1960s condemned the  secretive nature of the British nuclear industry. In 1962, Jean McSorley&rsquo;s father died from a heart attack at the  nuclear plant at the age of 39, and his body was taken for an autopsy  without his family&rsquo;s consent. The body parts of 65 other workers who died at  the plant between 1962 and 1991 appear to have been secretly examined for  evidence of radiation. Ms McSorley said:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Openness and transparency and the nuclear industry  are mutually exclusive. They are always looking for reasons not to be fully  open with the public.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Indeed, the nuclear industry has never been open  with the public.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Sellafield remains a  significant threat to people on this island, particularly to those who  live in the north-east. Ministers as well as private Members should press the  British Government on the issue at every opportunity. Irish people have been  living with the consequences of the fire at Sellafield for many years, and  there are particularly high rates of cancer and birth defects in County Louth  and south Down. Sinn F&eacute;in has called on the  Irish Government to convene round-table talks on Sellafield. Those  invited should include non-govern&shy;mental organisations, environmentalists,  campaign groups and northern European states, particularly Norway, whose  representatives have been highly vocal on the issue. Assembly representatives  should also be involved in such a process.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">An independent group has taken meter readings in the  Twenty-six Counties. Recent readings show that the highest levels of nuclear  contamination are to be found in areas of County  Louth, County  Meath and along the north Dublin coast &mdash; all are a  stone&rsquo;s throw away from Sellafield. A similar exercise should be carried out in  the Six Counties to establish how much nuclear  contamination has affected the entire east coast.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in has consistently called for the closure of  Sellafield. Reprocessing there must end immediately. It is a discredited plant and remains the most dangerous and  unstable nuclear facility in western Europe. Sinn F&eacute;in will continue to fight  for its immediate closure and calls on the Assembly to back the motion. Go  raibh maith agat.</p>

	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>: I beg to move amendment No 1: Leave out all after first &lsquo;plant&rsquo;  and insert</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">&lsquo;; notes the improving safety standards within the nuclear  power industry; believes that the United Kingdom should have a safe, secure and  diverse energy supply that takes account of the need to address the issue of  increasing carbon emissions and the need to end dependency on fossil fuels;  recognises that nuclear power plays an increasing role in power generation in  several EU states; and calls upon the Government to consider carefully a  well-regulated nuclear sector, operating to the highest safety standards, as  one element of the United Kingdom&rsquo;s energy supply.&rsquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The general opinion of nuclear power is sometimes  clouded by our thoughts or media images of disasters such as Windscale Piles,  Three Mile Island and Chernobyl, and,  although they are unrelated, Hiroshima and Nagasaki. There is  undoubtedly concern about what has happened in the nuclear industry in the  past, not least in the Windscale Piles accident, which forms part of the original motion. There is warranted  concern, especially in the underestimation of the fallout, and in some  of the insinuation of cover-up at that time. However, we cannot judge the  nuclear industry of the twenty-first  century by 1957 standards. Even Chernobyl, which is regularly used as an example in debates of this nature,  collapsed when the Soviet Union was on the  verge of collapse and people were barely able to get a loaf of bread in the  shops, never mind properly run nuclear power plants.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We should recognise the marked improvement in safety  standards in the nuclear industry. Windscale Piles happened when there was  little knowledge of reactor physics, and there was a rush to build the facility  at that stage. Simon Taylor, a noted academic at Cambridge University,  said that if there was any benefit in that accident, it was that it focused  minds on safety issues. A safe, secure and varied energy supply will surely be  our common objective, and nuclear power can help to achieve those aims.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Great strides have been made in other countries, such as South Africa and China, who are pioneering the  development of well-recognised, safer, smaller, pebble-bed reactors.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The security of supply is an important aspect, as it is  essential. We are sourcing our oil from volatile regions around the world, such  as Saudi Arabia and Venezuela.  Europe gets its natural gas from countries such as Russia. We all remember the recent  example where Russia  literally turned off the taps to the supply in the Ukraine and left the country with  nowhere to go. We must avoid that sort of situation. Nuclear energy can perhaps  play a part in solving that problem.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A varied energy supply is also important. We need less  fossil fuel and more renewable energy, whether that be wind, wave or biomass.  Nuclear energy must also play a part.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Another benefit of exploring the possibility of expanding  nuclear power is that it creates lower carbon emissions and contains almost no  carbon dioxide. Such an expansion would assist the United Kingdom in reaching its  targets and in combating climate change. Reducing our dependence on fossil  fuels is an essential element of any energy  strategy. We are currently sourcing fossil fuels from volatile regions  round the world, but that is a dangerous policy in the longer term. Fossil  fuels are a finite resource, and they will run out at some point. Various  targets suggest that, even in this century, some of those sources may dry up  and disappear. There is the spin off that if we were to reduce fossil fuels, we  would reduce pollution. No notable sulphur dioxides, nitrogen dioxides or other  particulates are present in nuclear fuel.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It would be unwise in a debate on nuclear power not to pay  attention to what other EU states are doing. We have heard mention of attitudes  in other countries, but I do not think that that typifies what is going on  among our near neighbours in Europe. France  generates 78% of its electricity from  nuclear sources, and that figure is set to rise. Finland started a nuclear power renaissance in 2002, and other countries in Europe, such as Lithuania, are also exploring that option. There are 300  nuclear reactors in over 30 countries across the world. The amendment in my  name and in the name of David Simpson accepts the reality of the situation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Nuclear power is already being used to produce 20% of the UK&rsquo;s energy. I  imagine that the proposers of the motion and the SDLP amendment want to do away  with nuclear energy altogether. If we got rid of Sellafield, what would we  replace it with? To get rid of one fifth of  the UK&rsquo;s  energy overnight has consequences, not  least in the cost of, and dependence on, other sources of energy, some  of which are finite or dangerous to the environment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although there are alternatives, some of which I have  already mentioned, the Northern    Ireland grid is currently unable to cope  with any further input from renewable sources. Expansion into that sphere is  not without its problems. Furthermore, the fact that there is considerable  opposition in Northern    Ireland and elsewhere to some forms of  renewable energy, such as wind or wave power, is sometimes ignored when nuclear  power is discussed. Whether it is because someone&rsquo;s view is obscured, or  because birds or seals are affected, some  people are opposed to the <span style="letter-spacing:-.3pt; ">introduct</span>ion of those sources of energy. That is a problem  that we have to face.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Nuclear power is already used in our energy system, through  the Moyle interconnector, and will also be used in the proposed interconnector  from the Republic of Ireland  to Wales.  Both interconnectors will be attached to the mainland UK national  grid. The lights in this House could conceivably come from a nuclear power  station in the future; the reality is that nuclear power is already part of the  system: it cannot be ignored or easily done away with.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Public opinion on the issue is beginning to turn because of  those realities. The most recent edition of &lsquo;The Economist&rsquo; published an Ipsos  MORI poll, which showed that public support for nuclear energy has risen over  the past six years to a point at which more Britons are in favour of nuclear power  than oppose it. That poll is backed up by other support, sometimes from strange  sources. The Royal Society has gone on the record in support of nuclear power,  as well as some leading environmentalists. Patrick Moore, a co-founder of the  Greenpeace movement, is now on record as saying that he regrets his opposition  to nuclear power 20 years ago. James Lovelock, a supporter of an organisation named Environmentalists for Nuclear Energy, said  that:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;We have no time to experiment with visionary energy  sources; civilisation is in imminent danger and has to use nuclear - the one  safe, available, energy source - now or suffer the pain soon to be inflicted by  our outraged planet.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">We must ask some questions in this debate. Is it  desirable to have an energy source that is cost-effective, efficient, low in  pollution, produces little or no carbon emissions, is not dependent on overseas  imports, and is, possibly, infinite? Surely the answer is yes. We must consider  the development of a safe, well-regulated nuclear sector and overcome issues of  safety, disposal of waste and health.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The proposer of the motion concentrated on health issues in  his speech, but, inevitably, there is a counter-argument. In 1991, the National  Cancer Institute in the United States announced that a large-scale study that  it had carried out of nearly one million cancer deaths in American counties  close to nuclear facilities &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McKay</strong>: I  thank the Member for giving way. Given the fact that the Member is more  comfortable with the security of nuclear plants than I am, would he have any  problem supporting the establishment of a nuclear facility in his constituency?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  Given that it is a reserved matter, there is little point in having any  position, which, perhaps, shows the flaws in having a debate at all. It is not  a matter that we can give any opinion on. There are no plans to have a nuclear  power plant anywhere in Northern    Ireland at this stage. We must recognise  that there are counter-arguments to the propaganda that has been put about over  the years that nuclear energy is all bad, and there is no other argument to be  had. Studies, not only in the United States, but in Britain  and Ireland, have shown that there are no particular problems  related to health in areas in the vicinity of nuclear power plants. Those  studies have been ignored, but I accept that concerns exist that must be  overcome in an educated debate about the issues, not least the issue of safety,  which has been highlighted already.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Anyone who is an avid fan of the American political TV  drama &lsquo;The West Wing&rsquo; will remember that a politician who ran for president  completely ruined his chances by saying that nuclear power was completely safe.  I would not say that it is completely safe, but a well-regulated and safe  nuclear sector would bring immense benefits for us all.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Hanna</strong>: I  beg to move amendment No 2: Leave out all after &ldquo;Europe&rdquo;  and insert</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;, calls upon the Department of Health, Social Services and  Public Safety to make public any data, which it may have available in relation  to this matter; and further calls upon the Government to discontinue all  operations at the Sellafield nuclear plant within an agreed timescale,  acceptable to the Government of the Republic of Ireland and the Northern  Ireland Assembly.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I thank Mr McKay for proposing the motion. I am  disappointed that he does not accept my amendment, which makes the motion much  more specific.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The amendment comprises two parts. First, it calls on the  Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety to make available any  information that it may have in relation to the Windscale disaster in 1957.  Secondly, it seeks an agreed timescale for the closure of the Sellafield  nuclear plant in Cumbria  &mdash; formerly Windscale &mdash; which has bedevilled  relationships between two sovereign  Governments &mdash; the Irish and the British &mdash; for decades. Moreover, the  amendment foresees a role for the Assembly in agreeing such a timescale.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Today&rsquo;s debate is on health-and-safety matters, not on  nuclear power &mdash; that debate is for another day. In that case, I do not believe  that amendment No 1 is relevant to the debate.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is said that sunlight is the best disinfectant. The political fallout from Windscale has continued  for more than 50 years, thanks mainly to good investigative journalism  over those years. The recently published academic  research by Professors Garland and Wakefield suggests that the radioactive debris spread by the  Sellafield fire in October 1957 may have been twice as widespread as was  reported at the time. It may also have caused 240 more cancers across Britain and northern Europe  than originally estimated.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Of particular concern at the time was the release of the  radioactive isotope of iodine, which is taken up and stored in the thyroid  gland and often leads to cancer of that organ. I note that there is no specific  health data in the Garland  and Wakefield research for Ireland, but that there is considerable information for England  and Wales.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It has become  increasingly clear that for over 50 years, there has been a cover-up at  many levels concerning Windscale, and that  has been admitted. It was the worst nuclear disaster in the world up to  that point, and was at least as bad as the Three Mile Island incident in 1979,  although not as catastrophic as Chernobyl. The international nuclear event  scale has eight levels, ranging in seriousness from 0 &mdash; the least &mdash; to 7; Chernobyl was rated at 7  and Windscale was rated at 5.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In 1957, the world was in the grip of the Cold War and  Macmillan was Prime Minister. The United States did not trust the  British, and Macmillan gave orders to cover up the disaster. I was 10 years old  and living in Warrenpoint at the time of  Windscale. Belfast is directly across the Irish Sea  and about 60 miles from Windscale. Towns such as Warrenpoint, Newry,  Dundalk and, of course, Dublin  are within a 100-mile radius of Sellafield across the Irish   Sea. People remember a very high level of sickness that autumn.  That was ascribed to the Asian flu, but some people still wonder if that was  really the cause.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Cancers have had a devastating effect in my family in the  decades since 1957. Six of my siblings and I have had cancer, and four of them  are dead. However, I accept that there may be genetic or other reasons for  those cancers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Sellafield is owned by  the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority in the UK and it was previously owned by  British Nuclear Fuels Limited. It provides reprocessing facilities, not only  for the UK  but for other countries. It is no exaggeration to say that Sellafield is the  nuclear bin for much of the world. It separates the uranium, plutonium and fission products from spent nuclear  fuels. The uranium can then be used in the manufacture of new nuclear  fuel, and the plutonium can be used in the manufacture of mixed-oxide fuel.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">4.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In 1957, at Windscale, a fire in pile 1 destroyed its  graphite core and radioactive material was released into the atmosphere. It  beggars belief that the UK Atomic Energy Authority only commenced plans in the  1990s to clean up pile 1. Even now, that job is unfinished and there is no  timetable for its completion.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Since 1957, Sellafield has had well-documented appalling  safety record. There have been hundreds of safety breaches, including the  falsification of data, the release of radioactive substances into the  environment, and the contamination of workers and equipment. Consequently, it  has been necessary to classify 60% of the buildings on the site as nuclear  waste. Every day, the Sellafield reprocessing plants discharge 8 million litres  of nuclear waste into the sea &mdash; the Irish Sea  is the most radioactive in the world. Nuclear waste remains radioactive for  tens of thousands of years.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Ireland  has been contaminated by radioactive material from Sellafield. On the east  coast, measurable amounts of plutonium can be found in seaweed. Most of that is from discharges over the years from  Sellafield. Given that THORP and the  MOX plant are operational, discharges will increase, not only into the  sea, but in gases that are discharged into the air as a result of the burning  of radioactive materials. Among other radioactive isotopes, there is more than  half a tonne of plutonium in the silt of the Irish Sea.  Traces turn up in fish catches and in  seaweed off the Irish coast.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Following the events of 9/11, there is also a risk that  terrorists could target somewhere such as Sellafield for bombing, releasing energy and toxins. The vulnerability  of Sellafield and other nuclear plants is increased by the transportation of  radioactive materials on land, air and sea. An attack or a hijacking could net  enough material to make a crude nuclear bomb.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">After 50 years, I appreciate that medical statistics that  might be relevant to the situation may not be available; however, I ask the  Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety to search his  Department&rsquo;s archives and to place in the public domain any relevant  information &mdash; particularly data on leukaemia, lymphoma and stillbirths.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 2 calls for the United Kingdom Government:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;to discontinue all operations at the Sellafield  nuclear plant within an agreed timescale, acceptable to the Government of the Republic of Ireland  and the Northern Ireland  Assembly.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I pay tribute to the constancy and consistency of my SDLP  colleagues in South Down &mdash; Eddie McGrady, Margaret Ritchie and P J Bradley &mdash;  who have camp&shy;aigned against Sellafield for decades, as well as the  British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body, with whose members I have visited  Sellafield.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">All shades of political opinion in the Republic, and many in Northern Ireland, are opposed to  the continued operation of Sellafield. The majority of the population on  the island of Ireland  is concentrated on the east coast, with the two major conurbations &mdash; Belfast and Dublin  &mdash; accounting for approximately half that population. Any big disaster would  have a catastrophic impact on the island  of Ireland, and, indeed, on a large  part of Britain,  which would lead to death and material destruction. Sellafield is a risk with  which we should not have to live.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Irish Government have repeatedly complained to the United Kingdom Government, and it is the  policy of all parties in the D&aacute;il that Sellafield should close. Recently, the Radiological Protection Institute of  Ireland and, significantly, an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have been permitted access  to the Sellafield site. One could ask why the police should be allowed access.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Norwegian Government have also demanded that the United Kingdom Government close Sellafield, even though Norway  is many hundreds more miles than Ireland away from it. They are  particularly concerned about the potential effect on their fish stocks. Thanks to the institutions that were set up as a result  of the Good Friday Agreement, there has never been greater democratic  accountability for all the people of Ireland. We now have representative  institutions, although we await the meeting of the British-Irish Council, at  which Assembly parties will be represented. I hope that Members can build the  widest possible cross-party consensus, and use our democratic clout, the EU institutions  and the British and Irish Governments in order to secure a firm timetable for  the closure of the disaster that has been Sellafield.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gardiner</strong>:  As Ulster Unionist environment spokesperson, I have a natural disposition to  support environmentally friendly suggestions. As a resolute human being and a  public representative, I also have a duty to react sensibly to certain  situations of public concern. I am a committed environmentalist, but, like many  environmentalists, I am aware that some people spoil our credibility by citing  dubious evidence and making outlandish claims. That does not help the  environmental cause; rather it brings it into disrepute.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The incident referred to in the motion occurred in 1957 &mdash;  that was 50 years ago. Surely no one in the Assembly is seriously suggesting  that nuclear safety is of the same standard as it was in those days, when  Anthony Eden was Prime Minister, our Queen had been on the throne for only five  years, Charles de Gaulle had yet to become president of France, and Eisenhower was still president of  the United States.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The nuclear option for our future energy needs is now regarded by many environmentalists as a safe  option, when burning fossil fuels is out of date, and power stations,  which are belching carbon emissions and greenhouse gases, are contributing to  global warming.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">New nuclear plants  could use generation III+ reactors, which would create less than one  tenth of the waste produced by current nuclear generators. Many environ&shy;mentalists  now regard the nuclear option as safer, cheaper, cleaner, and &mdash; it must be said  &mdash; inevitable, given that the United    Kingdom is unlikely to be able to put any  other viable option in place before our present power stations must be  replaced. In fact, if we do not take that option, we are a great deal more  likely to face an economic meltdown than a nuclear meltdown.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Of course, we must express concern at the nuclear accident in 1957, but that must be done in the  same way as we might express regret at the Holocaust of 1939-45, the Vietnam war or the First World War of  1914-18. It is a fact of history, of times past, not of the present.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although many environmental groups, such as Greenpeace and  Friends of the Earth, have rejected the use of nuclear power as a solution to  global warning, former leaders of such organisations have come out in support of nuclear power. Patrick Moore, the  co-founder of Greenpeace and chairman and chief scientist of  Greenspirit, commented in 2005 that nuclear energy &mdash; combined with the use of  other alternative energy sources, such as wind and hydro &mdash; remains the only  practical, safe and environmentally friendly means of reducing greenhouse gas  emissions and addressing energy security, saying also that:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The time for common sense and scientifically-sound  leadership on the nuclear energy issue is now.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The point to note is that nuclear power is combined  with other renewable energy sources.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In truth, a detailed discussion of those options in the  relevant Committee would be a far more rational way for the Assembly to proceed  rather than debating a motion in the House. The language used by many will, in  such circumstances, be erroneous, when what is really needed is cool, rational  debate in an atmosphere where scientific evidence is evaluated sensibly and  reputable expert opinion is sought.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I can share the hurts and feelings of the past, as Mrs  Hanna did. I also lost a mother and two sisters through cancer. Both of my sisters died, one of whom was 50 and the  other 53. However, thanks to their Christian faith they are in the Glory today. I support amendment No 1.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B Wilson</strong>:  I welcome the motion. I have no problem in supporting it, given that opposition  to nuclear power and the risks that it poses to human life and our environment  is one reason that the Green Party came into power &mdash; I am sorry; I mean  existence. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.] </span>We are in power.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We have always been concerned about the activities of  Windscale at the Sellafield nuclear plant, owing to its proximity to the Irish  coast and to the secrecy with which those activities have been carried out. We  are particularly concerned about the activities of the BNFL ship the Atlantic  Osprey and the reason that it spends a great deal of time around Beaufort&rsquo;s  Dyke. That raises serious safety issues: a ship that is carrying nuclear fuel  is spending so much time in an area in which large quantities of munitions have  been dumped.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Green Party was not surprised to learn that the initial  estimates of the radioactive contamination that spewed into the atmosphere from  Windscale were grossly underestimated. The Windscale/Sellafield site has been  shrouded in a mist of lies, misinformation and outright fraud from the day of  its inception. For example, after the Windscale fire in 1957, the men who  risked their lives to prevent that fire spreading were made scapegoats by the  Government&rsquo;s inquiry into the cause of the accident.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The name of the site may have been changed to Sellafield,  but the Windscale legacy of deception has persisted. In 2000, a damning Nuclear  Installations Inspectorate report painted an alarming picture of management incompetence and a culture of complacency  at the Sellafield site. The scandal concerned safety procedures in a factory that produced batches of uranium and  plutonium. One batch that was bound for Japan was found to have had false  records, and that prompted the investigation. Indeed, British Nuclear Fuels  later admitted that the records had been  deliberately falsified.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We are particularly concerned that earlier this year the  nuclear safety authorities in Britain  decided to reopen the facility for reprocessing at THORP in Sellafield. That  plant is considered to be a nuclear dustbin, taking in nuclear waste from all  parts of the world. Even if one supports nuclear power, the waste from the rest  of the world should certainly not be taken in at that plant, which is what  currently happens.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">THORP has been out of operation since April 2005, when a  major leak of radioactive material was discovered. My Green Party colleagues  and I have spoken to representatives of the Nordic Council, and they share our  grave concerns about the prospect of THORP reopening.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I ask the Assembly to support the Nordic Council&rsquo;s call to  the Government to permit a full, independent and international investigation  into the safety culture at THORP at Sellafield.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Despite years of campaigning for the closure of the nuclear  facilities at Sellafield, the prospect of its closure is distant. Indeed, a new  master plan that was drawn up by the west Cumbrian authorities sets out proposals  for the further development of nuclear power. Those proposals include the  construction of two third-generation, 1&middot;6 gigawatt nuclear reactors and the development of fourth-generation reactors at Sellafield.  Discussions have also taken place between Cumbria County Council and the  Government about the future storage of  highly active radioactive waste, even though, at present, Sellafield already holds 70% of the country&rsquo;s most  dangerous nuclear waste.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Green Party is opposed to any expansion of nuclear  activity. When the joint agreement between the Scottish Green Party and the SNP  was drawn up, the first point that was agreed with the new Scottish  Administration was that there would be no support for new nuclear power in Scotland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Nuclear power is not the answer to the energy crisis. It  will restrict investment in alternative technologies, and it does not make  economic sense. It produces radioactive waste that will create problems for  generations for thousands of years to come. Despite improvements in technology,  it is not totally safe.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Accidents can happen, and if one does, it will be a  disaster.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">5.00 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As many terrorist groups try to obtain nuclear weapons,  Sellafield&rsquo;s security has become an issue. We must look to alternative energy  sources. Sellafield serves no useful purpose &mdash; it should be shut down.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Simpson</strong>:  Were I to go around every MLA and ask each  about his or her knowledge of nuclear physics, I would probably be met  with a few blank faces.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  You speak for yourself.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Simpson</strong>:  I include myself in that. Yes, my face, too, would be blank, if asked my  knowledge of nuclear physics. If a Member were to tell me that he or she had a  degree in that subject, I would ask what the heck he or she was doing in the  Assembly. <em>[Laughter.]</em></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the debate. I understand the concerns that have  been raised in the motion. Other Members have spoken about timescale, referring  to events of 50 years ago. Whatever view we take on this issue, or on that of  climate change &mdash; and there are a variety of sincerely held views &mdash; there is  universal agreement that the world is at a  crossroads when it comes to the whole issue of energy supply. We need  viable and safe alternatives to fossil fuels. That is the bottom line, whether  we like it or not.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am encouraged that we have set a target, under the Northern Ireland  renewables obligation (NIRO), to obtain 12% of electricity from renewables by  2012. We must do all that we can to encourage use of renewable energy sources  such as wind, water and the sun, and that must be a priority. However, we must  be realistic. In February 2003, the Royal Society warned:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;in the short to medium term, it is difficult to see  how we can reduce our dependence on fossil fuels without the help of nuclear  power.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The previous Secretary of State, Mr Peter Hain, expressed  the view that he did not see nuclear energy as being a feasible option for Northern Ireland.  That was also the view of the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Investment in its 2002  report into its energy inquiry. However, whether we like it or not, we have a  duty to take a serious look at the potential that nuclear power offers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Nuclear power is a  frightfully powerful phenomenon. The very use of the word nuclear, given  its association with the horrors of nuclear  war, is enough to send shivers up anyone&rsquo;s spine. However, it can be  channelled and used in a way in which mankind will benefit. Amend&shy;ment No 1,  which stands in my name and that of my colleague Simon Hamilton, states that we  need to:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;consider carefully a well-regulated nuclear sector,  operating to the highest safety standards,  as one element of the United    Kingdom&rsquo;s energy supply.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">My colleague also mentioned that the grid is nearly  at maximum in my constituency. Members who represent that constituency &mdash; those  who sit opposite, as well as alongside me &mdash; will know that, in part of that  constit&shy;uency, we have the third-largest manufacturing base in Northern Ireland. We are running out of  electricity; there is not enough  electricity to feed the factories. Eventually, some other source will have to be looked at &mdash; something that is  well regulated and conforms to the highest safety standards &mdash; in order that  that we can generate electricity for our companies and create employment in  future. It is vital that we also consider price.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Following publication of the UK White Paper on energy,  &lsquo;Meeting the Energy Challenge&rsquo;, a consultation paper on nuclear power was  issued on 23 May 2007 by the Rt Hon Alistair Darling MP, in his former role as  Secretary of State for Trade and Industry. That Depart&shy;ment is now known as the  Department for Business, Enterprise  and Regulatory Reform (BERR).</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That UK-wide  consultation concluded on 10 October 2007, and its purpose was to seek  views on nuclear power from industry, non-Governmental bodies and any other  organisation or public body in the United Kingdom, including the  general public. I am glad that Northern    Ireland was included in that consultation,  which asked whether the private sector should be allowed to build new nuclear  power stations, and I await its outcome with interest.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P J Bradley</strong>:  I support the amendment proposed by Carmel Hanna. I ask Sinn F&eacute;in to consider  the fact that the amendment does not take away from the motion in any way;  rather, Carmel&rsquo;s  speech added to it. As Alex Attwood said earlier, amendments of value are often  helpful, and Carmel&rsquo;s  amendment was helpful.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The UK Government&rsquo;s consultation process on the disposal of  radioactive waste closes on 2 November 2007. It is important that the Assembly,  the Executive, or, at least, the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety, or the Committee for the Environment  should make a submission on the matter. Such a submission should remind the  British Government in no uncertain terms of the nuclear catastrophe of 8  October 1957, which was not made public until 10 October 1957 and was brought  under control only on 12 October. Fifty years later, many believe that the  contaminated material is still piled up at Windscale &mdash; or Sellafield, as the Government  renamed it in an effort to make us forget the disaster that has been with us  since 1957.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The volume of contaminated material is also a subject of  concern. Only the British Government knows how large that pile is, and, given  the secrecy that surrounds Windscale, it is unlikely that we will ever be told.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">For centuries, the British have intruded in the affairs of  countries around the world by putting down what they term as insurgents and by  becoming involved in arms issues and  decommissioning processes, as we know. Back in the heart of Britain, the  biggest decommiss&shy;ioning problem remains in Windscale/Sellafield, right on our doorstep. Since October 1957, that major weapon  of mass destruction has remained piled up in Cumbria and successive Governments  have failed to address the problem. All we know is that, in 1957, the British Government carried out a massive deception in  relation to the catastrophe and covered up its own records on the wind direction in the area at the time of the  incident. At the time, reports that  were backed up by the Meteor&shy;ological Office stated that the wind was  blowing seawards towards the Isle of Man and beyond to the Dublin area. However in 1974, 17 years after  the disaster, a Government agency claimed that the winds at the time came from  the northwest, thus blowing the radiation inland. The prime purpose of that  announce&shy;ment was to create the belief that no significant radiation made its  way to the Isle of Man or Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">When members of the Low  Level Radiation Campaign (LLRC) went  to the Meteorological Office in Windscale to find the truth, they found  that the original reports detailing the westerly direction of the wind, and its  speed, had been tampered with. Record sheets for 1957 had been removed and  replaced with new sheets that were slightly different in colour from the sheets  of previous and subsequent years. The new pages for 1957 read: &ldquo;No Record &ndash;  Mast Dismantled&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">According to the records, the mast reappeared in November  1957, which perhaps says something.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It may be wrong to despair, but I fear that we will never  learn the true facts about the catastrophe, or be able to prevent a reoccurrence of the event at Windscale. As  individuals we have no chance of discovering the truth, and, as much as we  might try, I doubt that the Assembly as a body would fare any better. However,  we must continue to try. I pay tribute to my colleague Eddie McGrady MP, as did  Carmel Hanna, for his endless efforts to keep the Sellafield debate alive. I am  sure that successive British Governments have wished that Eddie McGrady would  ease up on the issue, when they should have been admitting failure and warning  their people of the constant threat that exists.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As we have heard, the people of Dundalk, many people on the  east coast of Ireland and  the people of the Isle of Man do not need a  Government admission to confirm the facts. The death rate on the Isle of Man soared in the decade following the incident at  Windscale, and many mothers in County Louth believe that they know only too well of the consequences of the  radiation clouds that descended on their area in 1957 &mdash; conse&shy;quences  that they live with to this day.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The motion and the amendment correctly refer to the threat  to Europe. I would like to be slightly more  parochial and remind Members that the County Down coastline, as Mrs Hanna has  said, is only 60 or 70 miles from Cumbria. That is around the same  distance as from Stormont to Limavady or Derry,  and should another catastrophe occur at Sellafield, that short distance would  place us at the heart of the danger zone.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In supporting my colleague Carmel Hanna&rsquo;s amendment, I  believe that everyone present would agree that all information about Sellafield  should be made public. It is important that the Assembly and the Governments in  the Republic of Ireland  and the Isle of Man agree on a timescale for  the closure of Sellafield. The only acceptable action that the Assembly can demand is that the ticking time bomb that is  Sellafield is defused and that there is immediate clearance of the  contaminated material that is still stored at the plant in Cumbria.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I support the DUP amendment. There is little doubt that the production of fuel  and energy is a risky business. That is a fact. There are massive oil rig fires; coal-mining explosions; the effect of  renewable energy sources on the surrounding countryside; and the dangers  that are linked to the production of nuclear energy. There are hazards with  each and every method of production, and there comes a time when each method  must be evaluated to ensure that the benefits do not outweigh the costs of the  venture. Perhaps, now is the time for the Assembly to decide on that matter.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">At the outset, I want to stress that I am not living in a  bubble; nor do I have my head in the sand. I am aware of the dangers of  nuclear-energy production. I have read the newspapers and I have listened to  those with more scientific understanding. However, that cannot be the only  determining factor. My colleague, David  Simpson, mentioned nuclear physicists. I suspect that there is probably  no one in the Chamber with that particular knowledge.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  Barry, I will give you a chance, boy &mdash; that is all you are getting. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  A LeasCheann Comhairle, I have visited Sellafield. Is the Member surprised to  learn that inside the plant there is a poster stating that it has been 21 days  since the last minor accident? It is as though the poster is exhorting the workers to persevere towards the  magic figure of 40 days. Is the Member surprised that such a poster exists  inside the Sellafield plant?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I have visited the Sellafield plant and I have seen the poster. Every business  in the country has a book in which it must record accidents that have taken  place. That happens everywhere, and it is no different from what staff must do  in factories in West Tyrone or South Down. I thank the Member for his  intervention. I was a bit worried when I gave him a chance, but it was not that  bad.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The benefits of nuclear energy must be taken on board. They  far outweigh the risks, which is contrary to what my colleague across the  Chamber is saying. The fact is that as much as every Member would prefer all energy  to come from green sources &mdash; and I mean &ldquo;green&rdquo; in the best sense of the word &mdash;  that would neither harm people or the environment, provision is nowhere near  that stage.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Provision of energy from water turbines is being tested in  Strangford Lough. That is an example of what can be done. However, the turbines  can produce only enough energy for 1,000 homes. There are 20,000 homes in  Newtownards and 40,000 in the whole of Strangford. Undoubtedly, the time will  come when renewable energy sources can and will provide the necessary energy  for the future. However, that is not in the foreseeable future, so other  sources, including nuclear power, must be considered.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If nuclear power is dismissed, that leaves us with fossil  fuels, which will create a dilemma for us in the near future. The first environmental problem is obvious, and the UK Government  have pledged to lessen carbon dioxide emissions. However, were Northern Ireland  were to be completely reliant on fossil  fuels, that would significantly increase rather than decrease our carbon  dioxide emissions. Therefore, that is not a  viable option.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Another problem is that if Northern Ireland were dependent on  fossil fuels, it would be more dependent on other nations. That could be used  against us, and the stronger the hold that oil-rich countries would have on us,  the more we would be held to ransom.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We cannot always rely on the Middle   East if we are to do without nuclear energy. If we rely only on  fossil fuels and renewable energy we will undoubtedly pay the price on the  world stage. That is something that we should not even contemplate. I am  conscious of the time, Mr Deputy Speaker.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There are problems associated with nuclear energy  production; however, those, and safety issues, must be taken in context. For  example, when someone goes to the dentist,  his or her teeth might be X-rayed. In hospital, there is a probability  that he or she will be X-rayed. The microwave in a kitchen is another example.  All of those factors contribute. Nuclear facilities account for only 0.4% of  total exposure. We must consider all the issues involved in nuclear energy  production. We must not ignore the safety issues, but we must learn from them.  Windscale and Chernobyl  were awful disasters. However, the lessons on safety have been learned, and  safety is paramount.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In a perfect world we could do without nuclear energy and  use only renewable energy. However, we are not yet in that perfect world &mdash; far  from it. For that reason, the benefits far outweigh the risks. I support the  DUP&rsquo;s amendment. I urge the Members on the Benches opposite to me to do the  same.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: That intervention generated a lot of energy.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">5.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr W Clarke</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. It is foolish to dismiss the  relentless quest for nuclear power that seems to drive current British  Government policy. It is presented as a panacea that will address future energy  shortages and &mdash; somewhat perversely &mdash; is marketed as a clean, green alternative  to the burning of fossil fuels, and as a way of meeting EU directives on  pollution. Therefore, it is ironic that support for nuclear-generated energy is  gaining momentum in Britain  and the EU on the 50th anniver&shy;sary of the serious fire that occurred at  Windscale nuclear power plant, now better  known as Sellafield.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A recent report into that incident found that at least  twice as much radioactive material was released into our atmosphere than was initially  thought. People living in south Down and on the east coast of Ireland have  had to live with the consequences ever since. Nuclear power can never be a  viable option. The devastation caused 21 years ago at Chernobyl, and its after-effects which will  be felt for many more years, should be enough to make us all stop in our tracks  and think again. Sinn F&eacute;in is favour of a nuclear-free Ireland. We  should seek to decommission existing nuclear facilities, not build more of  them.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  Is the Member aware that the local government district area of Newry and Mourne  is a nuclear-free zone?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr W Clarke</strong>:  Thank you for that contribution. Sinn F&eacute;in favours a shift towards efficient  and cost-effective renewable energy, with particular emphasis on solar and wind  power. Major investment should be directed towards hydrogen technology. There  are growing concerns that there is, currently, an attempt to repackage nuclear  energy and to present it as a safe, green alternative. It is anything but that.  Anyone who has examined the safety record of the Cumbria-based Sellafield  nuclear processing plant will be horrified by what  the British Government proposes. Communities up and down the eastern  Irish seaboard will be concerned about the re-opening of that debate, considering  that the majority of Britain&rsquo;s  current nuclear facilities are sited a few short miles from the Irish coastline  &mdash; a few short miles from my home in south Down.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Sellafield remains the most unsafe nuclear site in western  Europe. Its history has been characterised by a catalogue of errors, safety  lapses and failure to comply with EU inspections. Sinn F&eacute;in will continue to  build alliances to force the closure of the Sellafield facility and to promote  a clean, green alternative to nuclear power. Public opinion is the key to  closing Sellafield and ensuring the entire shutdown of the British nuclear  industry. By adopting the motion we will send a clear message to the British  Government that there are viable and safe alternatives to nuclear energy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, British public opinion must be brought to a point  at which it demands such measures from its Government. The time for ignoring  the dangers of Sellafield and other installations must be brought to an end. In  whatever we do, it is important that we are mindful of the fact that  influencing British public opinion is essential to undermining the efforts of  British Nuclear Fuels plc to present nuclear energy as an acceptable  alternative to renewable energy. Nuclear power stations are expensive,  difficult to build and maintain and are a threat to public health, as well as  being considered key legitimate targets for extremists.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Nuclear energy has been used in England,  Scotland and Wales for more  than 50 years, and there is still no agreed  plan for the disposal of highly dangerous nuclear waste that poses a  massive health risk.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Energy policy, North and South, must focus on developing  efficient and renewable energy sources. Shifting policy from the inefficient  use of fossil and nuclear fuels towards energy efficiency and renewable energy sources is imperative if runaway climate  change is to be addressed. The nuclear industry spin machine has put a  lot of effort into promoting nuclear energy. However, regardless of how  effective their lobbying has been, the fact  remains that nuclear energy production is not safe, secure, financially  viable or reliable. We must get that message to the public loud and clear.  People are rightly fearful of the dangers posed by nuclear power; I urge Members from every political party to  support the motion. Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Robinson</strong>:  Once again, the Assembly is debating a  topic in which it may have a genuine interest but over which it has no  jurisdiction &mdash; it is a reserved matter.  Therefore, while the topic is extremely important, I wonder whether our  time would not have been better spent debating an area of policy for which we  do have direct responsibility. Having read the motion and considered its  implications, I suspect that it is nothing more than an attempt to provide a  big stick with which to beat the British Government.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is much disagreement about whether, 50 years ago, Northern Ireland  and the South were touched by the cloud from the fire in pile 1. As recently as  this month, reports in the South&rsquo;s press mentioned that disagreement. Indeed,  they went further and stated that a cloud of pollutants may just have touched  the east coast, and that if it had been affected, it would have been affected  very slightly. A 2005 study went further by  stating that no radioactive materials reached the east or the north-east  coast. Most Members will take from those  statements that the accident 50 years ago is unlikely to have had the  health effects implied in the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There has been mention of raised levels of cancer in isolated  pockets, but if the levels are as high as has been implied, the statistical  evidence would be much greater. However, that is not to take away from the  distress that has been experienced by the families who have suffered.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The press have also quoted John Garland, formerly of the UK  Atomic Energy Authority, as saying that any radiation has now decayed and poses  no ongoing risk. That is a welcome assurance.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is a further concern, no doubt regarding water  pollution, especially the effect of pollution on the Irish   Sea. A UK Marine SACs (special area of conservation) Project  report on radioactive substances stated that seaborne pollutant levels around  Sellafield were below the level that would be expected, and that there was no conclusive proof that any pollutants had  damaged the environment. However, that does not mean that there should be any relaxation in the monit&shy;oring  and testing of seawater to ensure continued safety. Only by requesting  constant independent monitoring and research can we be sure that pollution  levels are kept to an absolute minimum. It is worth noting that in June a  significant milestone in the decommissioning progress of the Windscale site was  reached, with the removal of the 42 isotope cartridges from pile 2. That, along with other moves, will help reduce  the levels of pollutants in the sea, which are already at a lower level than expected. That is very welcome progress. I  support the amendment.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Hanna</strong>: I  will briefly outline some of the comments  that were made in the debate. Simon Hamilton moved the amendment and  made a good argument for nuclear power. That is fine, but I did not come to the  Chamber today to debate nuclear power &mdash; I came to debate Sellafield and  Windscale. I would be quite happy to discuss nuclear power on another occasion,  if Mr George Robinson would not consider it too much of a waste of our time.  The issue should be discussed. However, I came to discuss Windscale and  Sellafield because of the new report, and because of the scientific data that  has continuously been coming on stream for the last 50 years.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Sam Gardiner questioned the facts that I presented. I  cannot remember the exact words that he used, but anything that I said is based  on scientific fact. I know that it happened  50 years ago, but Members should talk to experts about contamination in  the Irish Sea from radioactivity because that  is still happening. I hope that I did not go on too much about hurt and pain &mdash;  I was talking about the fallout from cancer and leukaemia.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Unsurprisingly, Brian Wilson of the Green Party said that  he supports the closure of Sellafield and is against nuclear power. David  Simpson made a good argument for nuclear power, and there may be a debate on  that in the future. My colleague from South Down P J Bradley obviously feels strongly that there is evidence that  Sellafield should close. Jim Shannon always makes interesting comments, hedging  his bets both ways. He said that the production of fuel and energy is a risky  business, which impacts on wildlife &mdash; before comparing it to my microwave oven.  If it is so risky, perhaps it should be  taken really seriously. It is a serious issue, which I take very  seriously.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Willie Clarke, one of the proposers of the motion, was  obviously strong in his support of the closure of Sellafield. George Robinson  suggested that we should not waste our time on debates such as this. I hope  that the Assembly continues to debate serious health-and-safety issues,  otherwise there is no point in our being here.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Even if Members cannot support the motion or amendment No  2, they should at least think about Sellafield and what happened there. Go and  visit the site and ask about the contamination of the Irish   Sea. It is important to keep an open mind on this matter. I am  happy to have a debate on nuclear power, but today&rsquo;s debate was on the closure  of Sellafield, which I want to happen in the near future. There must be an  agreed timescale between the British Government and Irish Government for the  closure of Sellafield, as well as a serious  investigation of the health implications that still exist for those who  live within a radius of 100 miles.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Newton</strong>:  The comments of my colleague David Simpson in the early part of the debate were  very telling: who in this Chamber actually understands nuclear physics? I  regret the implications of Carmel Hanna&rsquo;s comments because the motion  represents an old and backward-looking  argument. If we are debating Sellafield and Windscale, why are we not  looking forward to the future of energy production? David Simpson pointed out  that, in his constituency &mdash; never mind the whole of the United Kingdom  &mdash;an energy crisis is approaching, which must be addressed.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Hanna</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Newton</strong>:  No; I have only five minutes. The Sinn F&eacute;in proposer of the motion used glib  phrases about the concerns that exist throughout continental Europe about  nuclear power, when roughly 70% of energy in France is derived from nuclear  fuel. There is no reason why we cannot all express our concerns about nuclear  fuel, and we should do. However, concerns should also be expressed about the  risks involved in all forms of energy generation. Whether those are risks to  the individual or to the environment, there  are always risks.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is also telling that Carmel thought that Simon Hamilton and David  Simpson made a good argument. However, that is not an argument that she is  willing to take on board, because she did not want to discuss nuclear fuel.  Simon Hamilton highlighted the fact that nuclear fuel is inexpensive; that the  energy is derived from the most concentrated source; that the waste is more  compact; that it is easy to transport; and that it has no greenhouse or  acid-rain effects.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">5.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Sam Gardiner, in his contribution, quite rightly pointed  out the environmental advantages of nuclear fuel and called for a rational  debate on the subject. That would be extremely welcome.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have sympathy for the point that Carmel Hanna raised  about health concerns, as there are concerns from various sources. She referred  to her own family, and I am sure that there are no Members whose families have  not suffered. Carmel Hanna was willing to admit that other sources may have  caused those health problems.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Hanna</strong>: I  acknowledged that in my speech.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Newton</strong>: I  agree with the Member, and I pay tribute to her on that point.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am not sure what Brian Wilson was saying. He said that an  alternative to nuclear power should be considered, but he did not say what that  alternative should be.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Barry McElduff said that he went to the Sellafield plant to  have a look around. He saw a poster saying that it had been 21 days since there  had been a minor accident. I am not sure what point he was making, but it is  common in industry to post the health and safety record so that people can see  it &mdash; the greater the number of days without an accident, the better.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Danny Kennedy said that Newry and Mourne was a nuclear-free  zone; I did not realise that, so at least I have learned something from the  debate. It is good to know that the councillors in that area have voted to keep  the area nuclear free.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Willie Clarke&rsquo;s contribution was all about bashing the  Brits. He had no argument at all, and his comments were quite spurious. A  report in &lsquo;The Economist&rsquo; says that more  Britons support nuclear power than oppose it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Nuclear energy is here to stay and must continue to be  monitored as professionally as possible. Although it is not a devolved matter,  the House should consider ways of ensuring that it continues on everyone&rsquo;s  behalf. To call for power station closures is to be like the fantasy character  of old Spanish literature, Don Quixote, who attacks windmills because he  believes them to be ferocious giants. Such a call is just as much of a waste of  time.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>:  Clearly, we have a lot of bright sparks.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. The subject that has been discussed  is an emotive one. As someone who represents  a constituency on the east coast, it has a personal resonance. George  Robinson said that, possibly, the accident in 1957 at Windscale touched the  east coast slightly. If Mr Robinson had taken the time to read the statistics  he might have thought differently. For instance, within two years of that  accident, 28 babies in the Dundalk   Bay area were born with  Down&rsquo;s syndrome. That was way above the national average.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the Newry and Mourne area, a study done by the Mayo  clinic around 20 years ago indicates that the incidents of multiple sclerosis  in our area is one of the highest in the world. As someone whose brother died  from MS, I can empathise with that. Congenital health defects, such as  Friedreich&rsquo;s ataxia, Prader-Willi syndrome and Pierre Robin syndrome, which is  an extremely rare congenital condition, are all found in our area.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, although the incidence of such illnesses may be  dismissed as insignificant, the people who are directly affected do not  consider that to be the case.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The high rates of cancer, which continue to grow, have been  mentioned. Twenty years ago breast cancer affected about one in nine woman in  my area; it now affects one in four. There seems to be a cavalier attitude  towards nuclear power, as was most recently illustrated in America when live nuclear warheads were flown  across the USA  at the behest of the United States Air Force.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Simon Hamilton said that safety is built in to the nuclear power system. However, that does not  necessarily mean that it is safe. On the contrary; there is no proof  that it is particularly safe. The health-and-safety rules at Sellafield have  been mentioned, and Barry McElduff referred to the poster there that told of  the last accident being 21 days before his visit &mdash; I wonder whether the poster  in Chernobyl  stated that disaster was imminent.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The political fallout since 1957, which Mrs Hanna  mentioned, has continued. Investigative journalism has targeted the industry. A  recurrent theme of Members&rsquo; contributions was the shroud of secrecy that  surrounds the nuclear industry. If Windscale or Sellafield &mdash; or whatever they want to call it &mdash; is so safe, why  was it not built in the south of  England instead of on the Cumbrian coast? I have represented at  tribunals people who have particular  medical problems. All but one of the approx&shy;imately 40 people suffering from ME who I represented comes from  Kilkeel, Rostrevor or Warrenpoint, which are all located along the same stretch  of coast. As the crow flies, Sellafield is  about 67 miles from Warrenpoint and Carlingford Lough. That is another  example of the impact of the Sellafield accident.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Gardiner talked about being a committed  environmentalist, and he referred to the &ldquo;dubious evidence&rdquo; concerning the 1957  incident. He spoke about the improving standards in nuclear plants. I wonder  what &ldquo;dubious evidence&rdquo; he has to show that that is the case. He talked about  economic, rather than nuclear, meltdown. He referred to the First World War,  the Holocaust, and the Vietnam War: those are all man-made disasters, as is  nuclear power.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">One of my relatives was  a prisoner of war in Nagasaki when the second American bomb was dropped. Mr  Simpson said that nuclear power is &ldquo;of benefit to mankind.&rdquo; If Mr Simpson had  spoken to my relative, he would have found that he disagreed. He lived into his  eighties and suffered mental-health problems as a direct result of the bomb.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Simpson also talked about nuclear physics. However, one  does not need to be a mechanic to know how a car works. Everyone can attest to  the dangers of nuclear power and the results of nuclear accidents. It has been  portrayed today as a safe form of energy. I totally disagree, and I support the  motion. Go raibh maith agaibh.</p>
