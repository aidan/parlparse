        <p class="H4StageHeading">Culmore    Road Bomb</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Mr Pat Ramsey has sought leave to make a statement on the bomb at Culmore Road, which  fulfils the criteria set out in Standing Order 24. I shall call Mr Pat Ramsey  to speak for up to three minutes on the subject. I will then call  representatives from each of the other political parties, as agreed with the  Whips. Those Members will each have up to three minutes in which to speak on  the matter. The convention is that there will be no opportunity for  interventions, questions or a vote on the matter. I will not take any points of  order until the item of business is concluded. If that is clear, we will  proceed.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Ramsey</strong>:  Thank you for agreeing to the business being heard in the House this morning.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">There has been much comment about the timing of last  night&rsquo;s cowardly bomb attack on the Culmore    Road in the city of Derry. Thankfully, no one was hurt, but it  brought misery, heartache and distress to many thousands of people in the city.  Some will see it as a response to President Clinton&rsquo;s visit to Derry last week,  and others will remark that it may be something to do with the Tory conference  currently under way in Birmingham, but perhaps the most apt for the people of  the city will be today&rsquo;s date: 5 October. That was the day, in 1968, when  thousands of people in Derry gathered on the  streets to protest about civil rights.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Just as the people united then to speak out against  injustice, we stand united today, as political parties in Derry and in this  House, to condemn the born-again Provos  responsible for this outrageous attack. Their actions have caused great  inconvenience and distress to the wider community in Derry.  That includes vulnerable elderly people, some of whom were sleeping, who had to  be evacuated from their homes late last night. Hard-pressed businesses have had  their properties damaged, innocent children are unable to get to school and  hundreds of workers and commuters have not been able to get to work.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">As, I am sure, you know from listening to people, Mr  Speaker, there is a great sense of anger today, which will be shared by many of  my colleagues in the House. More importantly, there is a strong determination  that those who are responsible will not be allowed to set back the growth and  development of our wonderful city. Nor will they curb the plans and desire for  a better future for everyone in the historic city of Derry.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I pay tribute to the staff of Da Vinci&rsquo;s hotel for their  vigilance and swift action in reporting the bomb and evacuating people out of  the hotel. I also acknowledge the tremendous work of the PSNI in protecting  people&rsquo;s lives and putting at risk their own lives. Even now, there is a  suspicion of another vehicle in the wider area.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, I evoke the civil rights anthem of 5 October 1968.  The message in the city then was &ldquo;We Shall Overcome&rdquo;. The message today is that  those who are responsible will not succeed, and the people of Derry  will overcome.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Campbell</strong>:  Speaking on behalf of the Democratic Unionist Party, I join Mr Ramsey and,  hopefully, Members from right across the House in supporting the widespread  condemnation that has rightly been expressed regarding the latest attempt to  disrupt life in Londonderry and across Northern Ireland.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">It appears that the information &mdash; as much as is available &mdash;  points the finger at dissident republican elements of one description or  another. It is, of course, only two months since they attempted to bomb the Strand Road police  station, which is less than a mile away from last night&rsquo;s attempted murder  attack. There have been other attacks in Newry and elsewhere. The message is  very clear: the dissident republican elements intend to continue to carry out  the type of attacks and atrocities that their predecessors carried out before  them. Just as their predecessors failed, so must they fail.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We know that the condemnation is there, and it is good,  right and proper that it should be. However, condemnation does not ensure that  the propagandists and propagators of last night&rsquo;s violence end up in jail. The  only way that we will stop attacks such as that is with convictions in a court  of law. That is what is required. The local community is required to go to the  police with information to bring about convictions in a court of law. We  understand that those people have been called conflict junkies, traitors and  Neanderthals. We know all of what they have been called, but we also know that  they are still carrying out those attacks. The only way to stop them is  convictions in a court of law. To prevent a recurrence, anyone who has any  information, be they in this House or outside it, should give that to the  police to ensure that those who are guilty of such attacks are brought before  the courts.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms M Anderson</strong>: Go raibh  m&iacute;le maith agat. I stand here, as Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s representative, to unreservedly  condemn the planting of the bomb in Derry last  night and to call on anyone with any information to assist the PSNI with its  enquiries.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Some politicians, perhaps inadvertently, give a degree of  credibility to the actions of those who were involved in the planting of the bomb  in Derry by attempting to connect those groups  with the terrible conflict that we have emerged from. Of course, those who  planted the bomb take a degree of comfort from those misguided comments.  Republicans have only ever involved themselves in armed action when there was  no other means to pursue their political objectives. The Good Friday Agreement  changed all of that. It is quite clear that the conditions that we endured in  the past no longer exist. We lived in a state whose institutions were designed and  sustained in the interest of one dominant ruling class. It is unfortunate but  true that it was a Protestant Parliament for a Protestant people. It was an Orange state, it was 50 years of oppression, but all of  that has now gone, as have the vast bulk of the 35,000 British troops who were  on our streets.&mdash;<span class="Italic"> [Interruption.]</span></p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms M Anderson</strong>:  The actions of those involved in planting the bomb last night are designed to  bring British troops back onto our streets and remilitarise the North. They are  also designed to close the democratic space that is now open to republicans.  Those people want to end the power-sharing arrangements; however, they will  fail.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Such attacks on the people of Derry and on the people of Ireland only  make us more determined to build on our present opportunities in the  all-Ireland and power-sharing political institutions that were achieved through  long and arduous negotiations. Some of those involved in such attacks might  genuinely but absolutely mistakenly believe that they are furthering some kind  of republican cause. However, they do not have popular support for their  actions, and they have a responsibility to put the needs of the people first.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  On a point of order.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. I said that there are no points of order during speeches on the very  sensitive issue of a matter of the day. I am happy to take a point of order  after the issue is dealt with.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms M Anderson</strong>: My final comment is to say that the vast  majority of the people of Derry and of Ireland overwhelmingly support the  peace process and the political way forward. I ask people, in this Chamber and  beyond &mdash;</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms M Anderson</strong>: &mdash; to be  very careful about comments that they make &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption]</span></p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms M Anderson</strong>: &mdash; so that  we try to resolve this situation in a way that will benefit all. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McClarty</strong>:  Thank you, Mr Speaker. On behalf of the Ulster Unionist Party, I thank Ms  Anderson for that very jaundiced and misplaced lesson on the history of this  Province. There is no excuse for violence in this Province: there never has  been any excuse, and there never will be.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Speaker, what a difference a day makes. Yesterday, here  in Northern Ireland,  we were in a state of euphoria after the magnificent victory of the European  team in the Ryder Cup. Much of that success, of course, was owed to two of our  finest golfers, Graeme McDowell and Rory McIlroy. Today, unfortunately, the  headlines are about Neanderthals who have not yet woken up to the fact that Northern Ireland  has moved on. Such individuals can never be allowed to succeed. Thankfully, no  one was injured, but there is huge disruption in Londonderry  this morning, and it is the community which has been inconvenienced.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The perpetrators of this senseless, pointless act must be  apprehended and convicted. That can only happen if there is a flow of  information from the community. Therefore, I appeal to those who have even the  smallest snippet of information to pass that on to the PSNI. I pay tribute to  members of the PSNI who put their own life at risk last night to protect  others. If the perpetrators are listening, indeed, if they are even out of  their bed at this time of the morning, I say to them, &ldquo;You cannot succeed, you  will not succeed&rdquo;.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  This was a disgraceful attack on the people of Derry.  There has never been any justification for violence in this or any society, and  that statement remains as true today as ever. What was most striking about the  attack last night in Derry was the  anti-economy message that lay behind it. In that respect, it is such a betrayal  of the people of Derry and of Northern    Ireland. When people are battling hard to  protect jobs, to bring new jobs, to bring in new investment and wealth, to try  to improve people&rsquo;s living standards, the dissidents&rsquo; message is the absolute  opposite. It is nihilistic. They have no interest in the well-being of society.  Their emptiness and lack of a message stand exposed to the rest of the world.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that the House remains united in standing  up to dissidents; that we provide a positive alternative of a shared future  that includes everyone; that we retain our focus on the economy and on trying  to improve people&rsquo;s standard of living; and that we give our full support to the  Police Service of Northern Ireland for the extremely difficult job that it does  every day and night in trying to protect the people of Northern Ireland from  such threats. It is incumbent on anyone who has information relating to the  attack to bring it to the attention of the authorities. I am certain that the  people who carried out the attack have extremely low levels of support. They  are rejected by the overwhelming majority of the people in Derry  and elsewhere, and it is important that we eliminate this cancer from society  sooner rather than later.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">10.45 am</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I will now take Mr McCann&rsquo;s point of order.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker, there was order throughout the Chamber as  Members made their submissions. However, every time my colleague got up, she  was heckled continuously by Members on the other side of the House. When people  get up to deliver such a submission, they should receive the order that Members  from other parties are given.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  At times, Members from all parties try to speak from a sedentary position. I  think that the Member will realise that I did bring Members to order. Members  need to appreciate that I have a difficult enough job up here trying to  maintain order. As I said, from time to time, Members from all parties are to  blame for trying to speak from a sedentary position, and I hope that the Member  understands that.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  On another point of order, Mr Speaker, it is my understanding that the Minister  for Social Development was to appear in the House today to explain the actions  that he will be taking to restore morale in the Housing Executive, especially  in light of current inquiries. Is there any reason why he will not be appearing  before us today?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  There is nothing in the Order Paper to suggest that the Minister for Social  Development will appear in the House today. Yesterday, there were rumours that  he might come in today to make a ministerial statement. That has obviously not  happened, and my understanding is that he will not appear in the House today to  make a statement or on any other business.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  I had tabled a question for urgent oral answer and was informed at the time  that the Minister would appear before the House today to tell us about the  actions that he will be taking to restore confidence in the Housing Executive.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I know that the Member submitted a question for urgent oral answer. However, I  decided not to accept it because it did not meet the criteria in Standing  Orders. Yes, there were rumours that the Minister would make a statement;  however, that is obviously not the case now.</p>
        <p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="b"></a>Assembly Business</p>
        <p class="H4StageHeading">Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I advise Members that I received Mr Tom Elliott&rsquo;s resignation as Deputy  Chairperson of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development, which took  effect from 20 September 2010. The nominating officer of the Ulster Unionist  Party, Mr Tom Elliott, notified me that he wishes to nominate Mr Roy Beggs to  fill the vacancy. Mr Beggs accepted the appointment.</p>
        <p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="c"></a>Executive Committee Business</p>
        <p class="H4StageHeading">Debt Relief Bill: Consideration Stage</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I call the Minister of Enterprise,  Trade and Investment, Mrs Arlene Foster, to move the Consideration Stage of the  Debt Relief Bill.</p>
        <p class="BillAmend-Moved">Moved. &mdash; [The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment (Mrs  Foster).]</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  One amendment has been tabled. Members will have received a copy of the  Marshalled List, which provides details of the amendment. The amendment allows  for payments to cover intermediaries and authorities&rsquo; costs. I remind Members  who intend to speak that they should address their comments only to the  amendment. The Questions on stand part will be taken at the appropriate points  in the Bill. If that is clear, we shall proceed.</p>
        <p class="BillAmend-ClauseHeading">Clause 1 (Debt relief orders)</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment (Mrs Foster)</strong>: I beg to move the following amendment: In page 16,  line 29, insert</p>
        <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;(10) The Department may, out of the proceeds of fees charged  under Article 361(1)(za), make payments to competent authorities or approved  intermediaries in connection with the exercise of the functions of approved  intermediaries under this Part.&rdquo;</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Before I speak to the amendment, I thank the members of the  Enterprise,  Trade and Investment Committee for their helpful scrutiny of the Bill. As the  Committee&rsquo;s scrutiny was drawing to a close, officials brought it to my  attention that it would be desirable if a minor amendment were to be made to  the Bill. I agreed that the amendment would be beneficial, and I wrote to the  Committee and my Executive colleagues to tell them about it. The amendment is  to clause 1 and is to enable moneys raised through charging a fee to applicants  to the debt relief scheme in respect of intermediaries&rsquo; costs to be paid over  either to the intermediaries or to their competent authorities.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The debt relief scheme is to enable the Official Receiver,  who is an official in my Department and an officer of the court, to make what  are termed &ldquo;debt relief orders&rdquo; on the application of eligible individuals. A  debt relief order will be similar to a bankruptcy order made by the High Court,  but it will cost substantially less. It will afford protection against legal  action in respect of debts covered by the order for a one-year period, at the  end of which liability to pay those debts will be cancelled.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Applications to the debt relief scheme will be made through  trained and experienced debt advisers acting as intermediaries. The  intermediaries&rsquo; function will be to assess whether debtors are eligible for the  scheme and, if they are, to complete an online application form on their  behalf. The intermediaries will then submit the completed form to the Official  Receiver. Intermediaries will be appointed by the competent authorities  designated by my Department, and those competent authorities will be  organisations engaged in the provision of debt management or debt counselling  services.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Paragraph 10 of the schedule to the Bill amends article 361  of the Insolvency (Northern    Ireland) Order 1989 to enable those applying  to the debt relief scheme to be charged a fee in respect of the intermediary&rsquo;s  costs. The fee amount will be set in subordinate legislation. Amending the Bill  to allow the moneys raised through charging that fee to be paid over to either  the intermediaries or their competent authorities recognises the reality that  the intermediaries work closely with the competent authorities and that  expenditure associated with operating the debt relief scheme will fall on both  the competent authorities and the intermediaries.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The amendment will mean that, in the case of training, fee  income can be paid over to the competent authority to pay for the training of  intermediaries, instead of being paid to the individual intermediaries and  passed on by them to the competent authority. By providing for payment to the  intermediaries and/or the competent authority, the amendment allows the payment  regime to have the appropriate flexibility.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Investment (Mr A Maginness)</strong>: The  Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Investment welcomes the Debt Relief Bill,  which is intended to provide a remedy for those who can neither fund an  individual voluntary arrangement nor afford the cost of petitioning for  bankruptcy and are therefore unable to free themselves from a lifetime burdened  by debt that they have no reasonable prospect of being able to pay.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Minister and her officials for co-operating so  fully with the Committee in its consideration during Committee Stage. The  Committee had concerns about the provision of clear guidance and timelines on  investigations, provisions to cover unforeseen changes in an individual&rsquo;s  circumstances and upper time limits on debt relief restriction orders. The  Department responded to the Committee&rsquo;s concerns by clarifying details on those  provisions and, in the case of provisions to cover unforeseen changes in an  individual&rsquo;s circumstances, by obtaining detail on the impact of equivalent  legislation in England and Wales.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee sought clarification from the Department on  plans that it may have to charge a fee, as provided for in the Bill, to  organisations seeking to act as approved intermediaries. The Department  responded that it currently has no plans to charge a fee in connection with the  granting or maintenance of designation as a competent authority, and the  Committee was content that the Department&rsquo;s responses addressed adequately its  concerns on those issues.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Towards the end of Committee Stage, the Minister wrote to  advise the Committee that she had decided to table an amendment to the Bill at  Consideration Stage. That amendment would allow a fee to be charged to  applicants for the costs of persons acting as approved intermediaries. She  advised the Committee that the amendment was brought following advice from the  Insolvency Service in England and Wales that said that, because most  intermediaries are likely to be salaried employees, it is better to be in a  position where the proceeds of that fee can be paid to the competent  authorities as an alternative to being paid to the intermediaries themselves.  The Committee considered the proposed amendment to be appropriate and was  content to note it.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Irwin</strong>: I  am sure that Members will agree that the legislation is very timely, given that  Northern Ireland  is experiencing a difficult economic outlook. Times are tough, and the Bill is  a recognition of the fact that, in tough economic times, although the vast  majority of people are able to tighten their belts and budget their income to  meet a variety of challenges, there are those who are financially very  vulnerable and have got into a vicious circle of debt from which they cannot  get out. The Bill is a reaction to those specific circumstances, and it brings Northern Ireland into line with England and Wales, where similar schemes are  operated. I welcome the fact that the Bill is a remedy to debt for those who  need it most without the prohibitive costs associated with filing for  bankruptcy. Those people include those who have little income after necessary  living costs have been paid and who have no assets.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Although the heavy lifting of discussion and debate on the  Bill was done prior to my membership of the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Investment, I am  conscious that a lot of thought and deliberation went into the process. That is  fairly represented by the fact that only one amendment, on a technical aspect,  has been tabled. That is a credit to the Minister and, of course, to the  Committee.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The legislation should not be seen by anyone as a green  light to accumulate debt and then walk away. The six-year re-entry rule is a  clear marker that the Bill is a specific response to specific circumstances. It  is designed to provide a lifeline to people who are in severe financial difficulties.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The amendment is a sensible approach to the obvious costs  that will be associated with intermediaries getting to grips with the new  legislation when it becomes active. I feel that it is a responsible amendment  that will help to facilitate the training that is necessary to accurately  provide advice on those who will be deemed eligible for a debt relief order.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Having looked at the Committee&rsquo;s report, I am keen to see  greater emphasis placed on a system whereby, following a person&rsquo;s use of a debt  relief order, an intermediary would be in a position to give more focused  advice on that person&rsquo;s financial situation to stop them ending up in a similar  position all over again. When a debt relief order is served, that should  trigger a mechanism whereby advice services and intermediaries pay particular  attention to that individual, who will need assistance in handling their  financial affairs. In that mechanism, specific advice would be tailored to that  individual to help avoid future debt building up.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the  Consideration Stage. I support the Bill and the amendment.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>: We  have discussed the matter at some length in Committee and in the House. The  Ulster Unionist Party is fully behind the amendment and has no difficulty  supporting the Bill.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Neeson</strong>:  As a member of the Committee for Enterprise,  Trade and Investment, I support the amendment and the Bill. I thank the  Minister and her officials for listening to the Committee&rsquo;s concerns. The  process has shown the importance of scrutiny by the Assembly&rsquo;s Statutory  Committees. It is very welcome to know that we are having an impact on  legislation in the House.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Frew</strong>: I  commend Mr Neeson&rsquo;s words in what he said about the Committees. In my short  time in the House, I have found that the Committees seem to be working very  well.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I find it enjoyable and educational being on  Committees. I am on the same Committee as the Member. I find real benefit in  sitting on Committees and in the work that they do.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">11.00 am</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The amendment is common sense and is needed in the Bill.  For anybody who finds themselves in this position, it is a traumatic time, and  it is only right and proper that they have someone to speak to and to work  through their problems with. However, the individuals and organisations that  undertake that work also need support and training. Citizens advice bureaux  were mentioned. If people in this position do not go to their local  politicians, they will certainly go to their local citizens advice bureaux. It  is good and proper that these people will undertake that work on behalf of  people in trouble.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">It is also proper that the money be raised by charging the  applicants a fee, because it would be unfair to place that charge and burden on  the taxpayer. Given what applicants will go through and the support and  guidance that they will receive, I do not think that it is too much to ask that  they pay a small fee to obtain that service. Why should the taxpayer be  burdened with that? It would be simply unfair. Given that the fee charged under  the debt relief scheme in England and Wales is less than one third of the cost  for a petition for bankruptcy debt relief, it represents a bargain for the  person who finds themselves in that situation. The moneys will, of course, be  used not only for time and labour but for training and the provision of  computers to enable the people involved to do their work. It is, therefore,  right that payments can be made to the competent authorities. It would not be  good, right or proper if intermediaries were paid and then had to pay, if you  like, their masters. I believe that the amendment also covers that situation.  The amendment is common sense, and it is good that we have it.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Givan</strong>:  The amendment is sensible. The Insolvency Service in England  and Wales  has suggested that this would be a better way for us to take forward the  administration of the fee, because it has had to secure the agreement of  intermediaries in order to pass that fee on to the competent authority. An  unanticipated situation in which the moneys for an employee&rsquo;s work go to the  employer as the competent authority rather than the employee may lead to a  degree of tension and must be avoided. The amendment, therefore, makes sense.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The intermediaries carry out an important role. They will  be designated as a professional in the field and will carry out the important  task of assisting the applicant, who will often come to them in distress and in  need of help because of the circumstances in which they find themselves. Now  that the economy is suffering, more and more people are coming to our  constituency offices and presenting their financial difficulties to us. As my  colleague said earlier, we do not have the kind of professional skill required  to advise them on debt management. We often refer them to the likes of the  citizens advice bureaux, which play an excellent role. I know that four other  organisations have expressed an interest in also carrying out that work.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>: I  declare an interest as a member of the management board of a citizens advice  bureau. I concur with my colleague: it is remarkable that three years into a  serious recession, CAB has already carried out sterling work in handling  individuals&rsquo; debt problems in particular. Locally, it deals with debt amounting  to some &pound;10 million per annum. It is right to pay tribute to that organisation  for the help and assistance that it has given to individuals, and, through the  amendment, it will no doubt continue to do so.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Givan</strong>: I  thank the Member for his contribution. The employees of competent authorities  are salaried individuals, and the amendment addresses the fact that the fee  should not be going to people on salaries but to their employer. The amendment  will go some way to addressing that.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">However, the amendment also builds in flexibility. If an  intermediary is not employed through a competent authority, the Department will  still be able to pass on the fee to those intermediaries. The amendment makes  common sense, and I support it.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr McDonnell</strong>:  On behalf of the SDLP, and without delaying the House, I endorse the Bill. It  makes perfect sense, is workable and improves our financial sector&rsquo;s efficiency  and effectiveness. The amendment is worthy of support, and I support it in  every way possible.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  have been considering this issue lately. As with yesterday&rsquo;s debate on property  fraud in Europe, it is not a matter on which I  anticipated speaking. Nevertheless, it is of high significance to constituents  and it will be an increasing issue for people, whether they come from North  Down, Londonderry, Belfast,  a rural area or wherever. Consequently, as with any discussion on debt relief,  it is important to get the legislation right.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I appreciate that legislation has come into force across  the water. Although it is important for us to learn from the experiences in England and to try to draw from them, and, where  right, we should learn from good practice and replicate experiences, we must  realise that Northern    Ireland is a special case. The Prime  Minister acknowledged that Northern    Ireland is a special case. However, whether  he preaches it as a special case, and whether the actions of the Chancellor of  the Exchequer match those fine words, remains to be seen. Nevertheless, the  issue of debt impinges very heavily on people in Northern Ireland.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I hope to bring a slightly different perspective to the  debate. The Chairperson of the Committee, Alban Maginness, dealt eloquently  with the range of issues in the Bill, and it is clear that a great deal of hard  work on the amendment has gone on in Committee and beyond. In looking at the  intricacies of the Bill, I will not try to second-guess what happened in  Committee, as it has done sterling work. Unlike any of the Members who spoke  previously, all of whom have been members of the Committee and have dealt directly  with the Bill, I hope to bring a fresh perspective to the legislation; a fresh  perspective that is unencumbered by Committee Stage or any in-depth knowledge  and is based on genuine ignorance. Nevertheless, I hope to bring a fresh  perspective. I see that my words are having the desired effect on the Public  Gallery.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I suspect that there will be coverage in the media tomorrow  of many of the comments made about the dreadful events up in Londonderry,  but I suspect that the bread-and-butter issues of the Assembly, such as a Debt  Relief Bill and an amendment to it, will not get the same amount of credit.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The amendment goes to the heart of protecting people from  debt. We have a greater problem with debt in Northern Ireland, and, therefore,  it is important that we get the arrangements in the amendment right and that  procedures be put in place. There are a number of aspects to the amendment.  First, there is the option of charging fees. It is clear that, although it is  an additional service, it is meant to meet the issues that arise from the debt  relief scheme in order to ensure that we are properly covered in Northern Ireland.  In these stringent times, it is recognised that there is a need for a fee to be  charged.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Any action that is taken should not be a burden on the  taxpayer. It is right that the service should be provided, but the weight of  responsibility on the taxpayer should be kept to a minimum. It is right that  there should be a fee, but it must be dealt with in a proper fashion. I am  interested to hear whether the Minister has any thoughts on the level of fee.  The system must be balanced so that it is cost neutral and does not become a  drain on the taxpayer. The fee must also be realistic; it must not be cost  prohibitive to someone who is already in debt. The need for the scheme to be  effective and the requirement for a reasonable fee to be charged lie at the  heart of the amendment.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The amendment takes a sensible approach to the role of  intermediaries and the competent authorities by whom they are approved. As the  House heard yesterday during the debate on property fraud, it is important that  people receive appropriate advice and are dealt with in a professional manner.  Consequently, intermediaries must be authorised and have expertise in debt  management.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">All Members have been visited by constituents seeking  advice on a range of matters. Often, those people have already been advised on  debt relief and other issues. On some occasions, the advice is good and helps  people greatly, although they still require the assistance of an MLA. I  suspect, however, that nine times out of 10, the advice is given by someone who  is well meaning but does not have the necessary expertise.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">That level of advice on debt relief possibilities has not  been helpful, and the smiles that I see around the Chamber indicate that many  Members have found themselves in similar positions. It is important that the  intermediaries, particularly if there is the flexibility for them to be paid  directly, do a professional job and are professionally competent to carry out  that task. If intermediaries are to be paid directly, assurances must be given.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The amendment refers to &ldquo;competent authorities&rdquo;, and  Members mentioned that there is a range of those. The one that most people will  think of is Citizens Advice, which is well placed to help to provide and manage  the scheme. Unlike Mr Craig, I do not have an interest to declare, but it would  be remiss of me not to praise the work of Citizens Advice in my constituency of  North Down. Its portfolio of activities would allow it to marry effectively  with the debt relief scheme.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that there is flexibility, because there  will be slightly different circumstances in different areas. It is also  important that we are not too rule-bound when a case goes to an intermediary or  to a competent body. The amendment gives the Department the flexibility to  choose and to work out a scheme. I am unsure whether any subordinate  legislation will be required. The key to the amendment is ensuring that the  debt relief scheme works in practice, and I suspect that similar amendments and  legislation exist in England.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">As I said at the beginning of my contribution, we must  ensure that the amendment and the Bill achieve something that is fit for  purpose in Northern Ireland  and can deal with the problems on the ground. A reasonable fee, an opportunity  for work to be carried out through professional intermediaries on behalf of  applicants and the flexibility for payments to be made through intermediaries  or competent bodies will give us that fit-for-purpose system. It will also  allow us to deal with the problems that are likely to escalate during a  recession. I commend the amendment to the House, wish the Bill well and look  forward to the Minister&rsquo;s response.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">11.15 am</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: I am grateful to the Members from across the House who  contributed to the debate on the amendment and, indeed, on the wider reason for  bringing forward the Bill. The amendment will allow us a more flexible and  efficient way of managing the payment of moneys to meet the intermediary costs  that are associated with the administration of the debt relief scheme.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Some Members commented on the timeliness of the  legislation. We are operating about one year behind England  and Wales  in respect of the legislation. However, we have been able to learn from their  experiences, and it is for that reason that we are making the amendment. I also  want to join Mr Craig, Mr Weir and others in their comments about debt  advisers, particularly in Citizens Advice, Advice NI and other bodies, who do  sterling work to help those who are in debt across Northern Ireland.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Weir asked about the level of fee that is to be charged  to applicants in respect of the costs. The basic point is that the policy aim  is that the debt relief scheme will not be a burden on the taxpayer. That means  that the cost of operating the scheme, including the payment to meet  intermediary costs, must be met through fees that are charged to applicants.  However, under the debt relief scheme in England  and Wales,  the amount is &pound;10. Therefore, the fee is considerably less than that which is  levied in relation to bankruptcy and one that is appropriate in all  circumstances.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question, That the amendment be made, put and agreed  to.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Clause 1, as amended, ordered to stand part of the  Bill.</p>
        <p class="BillAmend-ClauseHeading">Clause 2 (Conditions for making a debt relief  order)</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  No amendments have been tabled to clause 2, but a Member has indicated a wish  to speak on the clause stand part.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the  Bill.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, Mr Speaker. I also welcome the Bill. Obviously, it will  help those who experience difficulty with debt problems, particularly  vulnerable people. I want to make some comments and seek assurances from the  Minister.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">When we look at debt, we have to make a distinction between  people who habitually avoid paying their bills and those who, through no fault  of their own, cannot afford to pay. I ask that all organisations to which  people owe money, from the large utility companies right down, do that when  they look at the way in which they try to recover moneys that they are owed. We  need to make that distinction, which is why I bring these points to the  Minister&rsquo;s attention today.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The first point relates to the six-year rule and  exceptional circumstances. The Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Investment discussed  the matter at length, and we heard evidence from Advice NI. Provision for  exceptional circumstances should be added to take account of unforeseen  changes. I understand the practicalities and the logic that we cannot keep  getting debt relief orders through. However, circumstances, such as the death  of a partner or an illness, can make a person unable to cope with their  financial situation. Therefore, provision for exceptional circumstances should  be included.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I also want to make a point about the criteria under which  people are eligible. We have been given the criterion of &pound;50 a month surplus  income. I seek the Minister&rsquo;s assurance that that could be flexible. For  instance, a single parent with four children and a surplus income of &pound;51 is  different from a single person who has a surplus income of &pound;49. However, the  single person will be eligible and the single parent will not. There should be  some flexibility about that.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Debt liability should be increased to &pound;20,000 instead of  &pound;15,000. When debt relief orders came into practice in England,  pension pots were considered as assets. There is a &pound;300 limit on the pension  pot. Pensions give people some financial comfort in their old age. Therefore,  it is something that we should look at again. I do not think that pensions  should be seen as an asset, especially given that some people have small pots  of money that they depend on in their old age.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I ask for the Minister&rsquo;s assurances on those particular  points. As I said, my main issue is to differentiate between people who  habitually avoid paying their bills and those who, through no fault of their  own, genuinely cannot pay.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: Ms McCann raised those issues during Committee Stage. The  reason why there is a six-year limit on reapplication for a debt relief order  is, essentially, to strike a balance between the needs of debtors, which we  have clearly heard over the past couple of years, and the rights of creditors.  Some people think that six years is too long and others think that it is too short.  However, in my view, a six-year interval is the minimum that should apply in  all cases.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In relation to an applicant&rsquo;s surplus income, the question  asked was how that could be measured. A person&rsquo;s income from all sources will  be compared with their expenditure to determine what surplus, if any, exists.  It is intended that a common financial statement will be used to provide an  objective assessment of whether an applicant&rsquo;s expenditure is reasonable, and  applicants will have to explain and justify any higher levels of expenditure.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Ms McCann talked about a &pound;20,000 cap, but the eligibility  cap will be set in subordinate legislation, and it will be subject to Committee  scrutiny. Therefore, those points can be raised at the appropriate time. Some  people think that &pound;15,000 is too high, but that is a matter that will come  before the Committee in subordinate legislation.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The final point relates to pensions being treated as income  or assets. In line with what happened in England  and Wales,  it is the intention that most benefits and pensions will be counted as income.  The aim is to have a scheme that will result in intermediaries being able to  make a simple and straightforward comparison between income from all sources  and expenditure. However, there are certain benefits, such as disability living  allowance, which are provided for a specific purpose, and receipt of those  benefits should not be seen as an obstacle to accessing the debt relief scheme.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that I have gone some way to answering some of the  points raised by Ms McCann. However, some of the issues that she raised will  come back to the Committee in subordinate legislation.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Clause 2 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Clauses 3 to 9 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</p>

        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment (Mrs Foster)</strong>: Thank you, Mr Speaker, for allowing me to speak at  this point. Unfortunately, as I have indicated to you, I must leave the House  to attend a funeral. I have informed the proposers of the motion and the  amendment that I will be absent for part of the debate. I hope to return to the  House after 2.00 pm. I apologise to the House. No discourtesy is meant by my  absence, the reason for which is that I must attend to a particular matter.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Neeson</strong>: I  beg to move</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That this Assembly notes the benefits that can be  achieved through implementing the green new deal in Northern Ireland; supports  the need for improved energy efficiency to reduce fuel use and meet European  Union and United Kingdom carbon emissions targets; and calls on the Executive  to implement a cross-departmental strategy to ensure that the potential  benefits of the green economy are realised for Northern Ireland.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The adoption of a green new deal offers the Government an  opportunity to tackle the environmental, economic and social issues that face  our society. Northern    Ireland is almost completely dependent on  imported fossil fuels to meet its energy needs. It relies heavily on oil, which  is an unregulated and rapidly depleting finite resource. That presents a number  of risks for the future of Northern    Ireland&rsquo;s economy. We are heavy polluters,  lead unsustainable lifestyles and contribute disproportionately to climate  change.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The impact of rising carbon emissions on the planet has  been well documented. The island   of Ireland will not be  immune to those changes. Research has shown that the likely effects of climate  change include rising annual temperatures, wetter winters and drier summers.  Those changes will have consequences for agricultural production. As a result  of rising sea levels, Belfast and Dublin could become more  susceptible to flooding.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Energy costs are high and will continue to grow. The impact  of rising fuel costs has been higher bills for consumers. Northern Ireland has the highest level of fuel  poverty in the United    Kingdom, with approximately 45% of  households living in fuel poverty. Households here spend twice as much of their  disposable income on energy as households in London,  and around 60% more than the UK  average.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Fuel poverty is not a phenomenon that is restricted to  people who are dependent on benefits, although they are at greatest risk. Of  fuel-poor households, around 27% earn between &pound;10,000 and &pound;15,000 a year. The  vast majority of homes that are in fuel poverty are owner-occupied. As we are  all aware, energy costs are often cited by businesses as their greatest  competitive disadvantage. That issue has been discussed in the House on many  occasions in the past.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Current sources of energy supply and levels of energy demand  are simply unsustainable. The adoption of a green new deal can address those  issues. However, the green new deal is not purely about improving Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  green credentials and creating a more sustainable supply-and-demand network. It  also offers the Executive a viable job- and wealth-creation opportunity. That  is particularly relevant in the current climate of austerity and rising  unemployment. Potential employment opportunities range from high-tech  manufacturing jobs to maintenance jobs at wind-power plants. Employment in the  agricultural sector could also be sustained and grown through biomass  production.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">President Obama has adopted the green new deal in  the United States,  and that has already had a major impact on the economy there.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">11.30 am</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In the short term, the retrofitting of our existing housing  stock through the implementation of cost-effective energy-efficient measures  would create and sustain jobs in the construction sector. Opportunities for job  creation have already been realised by local businesses, including Harland and  Wolff. I commend to the House a supplement on energy in Northern Ireland  that was produced by the &lsquo;Belfast Telegraph&rsquo; last week. It outlined the major  impact that the green new deal has had on production at Harland and Wolff. The  jobs created represent only a fraction of what could be achieved if a  co-ordinated and ambitious approach were adopted by the Executive. We are  already behind our neighbours and European and international competitors, and  we urge the Executive to urgently prioritise this agenda.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">On a positive note, we believe that there are several  factors that can make the growth of the green economy a reality. They include  our large pool of highly qualified young people; our strong manufacturing base;  our low cost base for labour and physical resources; the slack within the  labour market, particularly in the construction sector; our potential to  generate renewable energy &mdash; Northern Ireland has the second best potential for  wind energy in Europe and is second only to Scotland; and the strong research  and innovation that is based in our universities.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">At the core of a green new deal is improved energy  efficiency. It is estimated that the implementation of cost-efficient measures  could reduce final energy demand by up to one third. Improved energy efficiency  is the quickest and most cost-effective means of reducing demand for energy,  emissions and household bills, and it has a short lead-in time in respect of  jobs creation. Reducing demand also reduces the investment required in  renewable energy provision. When Members were talking about the social economy  in the House yesterday, the benefits of the warm homes scheme were highlighted.  That is another example of how the green new deal can be improved in Northern Ireland.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">With the domestic sector accounting for around 40% of our  energy use, tackling energy efficiency in our homes should be a key priority.  The Government spend some &pound;70 million per annum on energy-efficient measures.  We welcome the fact that that funding is available and that consideration of a  supplier obligation is noted in the strategic energy framework. However, we  call on the Executive to ensure that available resources are leveraged, as much  as possible, to ensure maximum impact and reach. Additional sources of finance  include the European Investment Bank and commercial and social finance  institutions. Such mechanisms as pay-as-you-save schemes have the potential to  offer an alternative to a grant-driven approach.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We call on the public sector to show leadership as well.  Not only would improved energy efficiency reduce the proportion of public money  spent on energy, but it might help to drive down the costs of technologies for  homes and businesses. The creation of a zero carbon public sector estate by  2015 was stated in the 2006 sustainable development strategy. That target will  not be met, and the absence of a target for the public sector from the current  sustainable development strategy is disappointing.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">With the transport sector accounting for 28% of our energy  consumption, tackling energy use in that sector should be a priority. A current  lack of emphasis on transport is disappointing and indicates a failure by  government to grasp the step change that is required to ensure sustainability.  In tandem with expanding renewable energy provision, we must ensure that we  have an infrastructure that encourages, supports and facilitates its growth. We  support investment in the electricity grid, the ongoing development of the  single energy market on the island   of Ireland and the  development of the North/South interconnector. We also support the proposed  EU-wide renewable energy supergrid. An efficient planning system is also  required.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Enshrining targets in legislation can drive action and  encourage investment. We have targets in place to reduce greenhouse gas  emissions and to increase the proportion of electricity that is generated from  renewable sources. We are underperforming against our emission targets. Not  only that but they fall significantly short of the targets set at  international, EU and UK  levels. I am pleased to say that the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Investment is about to  embark on a major investigation into energy from renewables.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">EU targets for 2020 include a 20% cut in greenhouse gas  emissions and energy consumption and a 20% contribution to energy generation  from renewable sources. Renewable energy has been broadened to include heat and  transport fuels. To meet its obligations, the UK has set a target of 15% of  energy from renewable sources by 2020. It has also set a legally binding target  of at least an 80% cut in greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I realise that the SDLP has tabled an amendment to the  motion. The Alliance Party will support it.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr McDonnell</strong>:  I beg to move the following amendment: Insert after &ldquo;targets;&rdquo; and before the  third &ldquo;and&rdquo;</p>
        <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;believes there is a real opportunity to create 30,000  sustainable green collar jobs;&rdquo;</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I fully support the motion and our brief amendment,  which we feel adds to the equation and makes more sense of it.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Turning to the broad thrust of the motion, we talk a lot  about energy and about what we should do. However, we cannot go on squandering  our resources. Although we have limited resources, we have some considerable,  potentially usable, renewable resources here at home. However, we continue to  import fossil fuels, such as oil and a little bit of coal. Those meet some 93%,  94% or 95% of our energy needs. That is crazy, economically as well as  environmentally. Economically, in effect, there is an energy tax on everything  that we do because 10% of our money has to go on energy before we even start  looking at making a profit on any of the things that we make, sell or export.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The green new deal is about getting a joined-up approach,  and God knows we need it. It is about cutting the consumption of expensive  fossil fuels, which eat up 10% of our money. We are told that 90% of homes are  still not energy-efficient. In many cases, that leads to severe fuel poverty,  which then spills over into welfare needs. We are told through the green new  deal that there is a need to improve the energy performance of public and  commercial buildings. I think that that is self-evident to most of us. The  objective is also to promote renewables in microgeneration and to redirect  thousands of people into working the alternative energy. It is about creating a  rational, sensible and efficient public transport option. It is also about  creating jobs, not just in running the energy service but in making the green  goods and services that we can use ourselves and export. Perhaps most of all it  is about creating the funding levers that are necessary to unlock the changes.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I will briefly return to domestic energy efficiency. An  awful lot of energy is wasted because our houses were built when energy was  cheap and we were flush. There was no issue then. We now have homes being built  even today that are not fully energy-efficient. We have to do what is necessary  to upgrade building standards to ensure that all new homes are much more  efficient and use much less energy. In that way, we must reduce, slowly but  steadily, the high levels of fuel poverty, because it is all-pervasive out  there.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">It makes perfect sense to improve energy efficiency and  performance in public buildings, but we have a big job there. We all know that  many public buildings are underheated or overheated &mdash; more often than not, they  are overheated. Even in this Building, how often do we have to open a window to  reduce the temperature when the Building is overheated? That is unforgivable.  If nothing else, we have to do something in this Building to ensure that we  reduce energy consumption and set an example.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Promoting renewables and microgeneration is essential. That  is where we most need to get our act together. It requires a cross-departmental  approach, as it runs across a number of Departments and interests. If the  Assembly does anything, it should create a cross-cutting project on renewable  energy.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I appeal to the Minister to take whatever action is  appropriate. She will find total support from me and my colleagues. She should  act quickly because we are very far behind and very ineffective when it comes  to doing something about getting the team working together. I appeal to the  Minister to urgently establish the resources in whatever shape or form  necessary to drive a meaningful renewables programme, whether in biomass,  biogas, wind, wave or even a little bit of hydro. All those items of renewables  are here to a greater or lesser extent. They all have potential, yet we do not  have a joined-up approach to them. We need more people working together in a  more proactive energy division in the Department.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I could go on, Mr Speaker. I could talk about public  transport, and we all know the implications of that. I will not delay you  today. However, I want to make two other points and make them heavily. We  believe that up to 30,000 jobs could be created in Northern Ireland if we attacked  renewable energy and its potential in the way that the Danes and other  Europeans have done. Those jobs are badly needed and would be accessible to  many made redundant from the construction industry &mdash; jobs not only to keep the  renewables industry on its feet through projects but jobs in goods and services  for the renewables industry, which we, in turn, could export. In this pitch I  cannot commend Queen&rsquo;s University highly enough, because it has devoted a lot  of its engineering department to energy and renewable energy. Those jobs would  be vital to us. I emphasise again, however, that we need a joined-up approach  between the energy division in DETI, DARD and Departments such as DRD with  regard to public transport.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I am not keen at this difficult time to promote quangos or  further quangos, but we need a driver on energy. Further, we need to create the  levers to make the green new deal a reality. By that I mean that, despite the  difficult times, we need to set aside some small amount of money to stimulate,  incentivise and encourage those who are prepared to be entrepreneurial and take  risks. That is the echo that I hear every time I meet anybody. I was at a  meeting recently with 18 people from the renewables industry who between them  had a &pound;1 billion turnover and employed 2,000 people. That is not to be sneezed  at in these difficult times, and our renewables industry is in the very early  stages. We have to back those who are prepared to take risks and spend their  own money. We have got to help those who can and will, if they are allowed to,  make the green new deal work. We have got to create the allowance for them and  make sure that they are allowed to make it work. I mentioned Europe, and most  European countries are far ahead of us on this issue, including Denmark and Germany. Nearly half of energy in Denmark comes  from renewables.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The motion and the amendment are self-evident and are easy  to support. I endorse them, as do my colleagues, and I urge the whole House to  fully back them.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">11.45 am</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I wholeheartedly endorse the vision behind the green new deal, although not necessarily  for some of the reasons that have been put forward by Members so far, including  the continued selling of the idea that the consequences of not addressing the  problem will be catastrophic. I accept entirely the points that were made by  the proposer of the motion about the effects of carbon and the negative effects  that it could have on our country and, indeed, globally. The huge incentive for  grasping the potential of a green new deal is not just to help to make Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  contribution to fighting those problems; it is the transformative effect that  it could have on our economy.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The green new deal is backed by the CBI, ICTU, the  community and voluntary sector, the Ulster Farmers&rsquo; Union  and Friends of the Earth &mdash; an eclectic bunch, if ever there was one.  Ordinarily, those organisations would not be able to agree on what day of the  week it is. There is probably less agreement among those organisations than  there is in the House on occasions. If all those organisations wholeheartedly  endorse the green new deal, that should alert us to the positivity that is  inherent within it.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Anything that is particularly aimed at gearing our economy  and our workforce towards tapping into that huge potential through developing  skills is positive. We keep talking about the potential of Northern Ireland  in respect of renewable energies. How many times have we heard phrases like,  &ldquo;We could be the Saudi    Arabia of renewable energies&rdquo;? There is a  lot of truth in that, but, instead of talking about the potential, we need to  start to make it a reality.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">There are many positive examples. Harland and Wolff, which  operated in a sector that was heavy and hugely industrial, has transformed  itself and is now tapping into the renewable energy market. Although it is  doing that on a small scale, there is huge potential for the future, which  points us in the right direction.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We may have missed the boat in respect of some renewable  technologies. I am continually exasperated at how, despite the huge potential  here, we have missed the opportunity or are getting in late on the curve with  wind power. However, Northern    Ireland has huge potential to use tidal  power. The SeaGen project in Strangford Lough is the first commercially viable  tidal project in the world, so Northern    Ireland is at the forefront. Again, Harland  and Wolff is involved in that. We have huge potential to get ahead of the  market in respect of tidal energy.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I will now focus on my responsibilities in the House as  regards social development. I am particularly keen on elements of the green new  deal that focus on fuel poverty. We have all heard how the last house condition  survey in 2006 found that one third of homes in Northern Ireland were in fuel  poverty. All the indications are that the latest house condition survey will show  an increase in that number. So, despite all the actions that have been taken  and despite all the effort, it looks like we are going to suffer an increase in  the number of homes in fuel poverty, with the figure heading towards 50%. If  that happens, we will all have to say that, in spite of the good efforts and  the concentration of resources, something else must be done.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The age-old cry &ldquo;Something must be done&rdquo;, which is  regularly heard on phone-in shows across Northern Ireland, is certainly apt,  but this report highlights what could be done, particularly in respect of a  retrofitting programme. There is some talk already about getting a pilot  project to do that. That is inspired by the Kirklees model in Yorkshire  where, instead of participation being on the basis of qualifying benefits, the  worst hit areas are targeted. We all know that the people who suffer most from  fuel poverty tend to be owner-occupiers and tend not to qualify for the likes  of the warm homes scheme because they are not on qualifying benefits. If we can  find smart information about which areas are in fuel poverty, target them  without regard to incomes in the area or the individual&rsquo;s income, retrofit them  with insulation and, where appropriate, put in renewable technologies, we can  start to get to grips with this problem in a much more concerted and beneficial  way than by taking the sporadic, here-and-there approach that we have taken to  date.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The other attractive thing is that it is not entirely  dependent on public finance but on leveraging in money from the private sector.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Will the Member please bring his remarks to a close?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  There is huge potential. We need to act quickly. The changes recommended in the  document will take a long time to achieve, and we need to start now.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I remind Members to please check that their mobile phones are switched off.  Mobile phones or a mobile phone are affecting the recording system in the  Chamber.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Boylan</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I welcome the opportunity to speak on  the motion. My party supports both the motion and the amendment.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We are all concerned about the impact that climate change  can and will have on the global environment. It is imperative that all  stakeholders take every opportunity to reverse the trends that suggest that we  are in danger of causing irreparable damage to our planet. The green new deal  initiative will help in the fight for environmental sustainability. The  original New Deal of Roosevelt and the US Government of the 1930s was an attempt  to drag that country out of the Great Depression. It is ironic that, although  the green new deal was initially formulated to help with the climate change  problem, we now find that it can help us to fight our way out of the current  financial and economic crisis.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">It is clear that the best way to tackle our economic  problems is to invest in and support small and medium-sized enterprises. That  is the battleground on which we may reverse our fortunes. It is to those  businesses that we look for innovation and ideas on the green economy that will  translate into jobs and sustainability. That will only be successful if we  ensure that we do not merely pay lip service to the initiative. Support and  funding need to be accessible to those who require them. The application  process for funding needs to be simplified to ensure that support can be  enjoyed by businesses other than those already in the upper echelons of  success.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Some 90% of our housing falls short of being  energy-efficient, much of it publicly funded social housing. The burden of  trying to address that issue can be spread out to the private sector, allowing  businesses that have a record of success in that area to expand and employ more  people to get the work done and greatly reduce the number of homes that fall  below the efficiency benchmark.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">This is not a dig at any Minister, but, a couple of years  ago, we bought off-the-shelf housing and, unfortunately, those houses were not  up to the decent homes standard. We must look at building regulations and  ensure that they apply across the board in private and social housing  standards.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Department for Employment and Learning has a role to  play in ensuring that we have people in research and development who are  trained on the viability of the green economy. We must specify training and  courses for those required to implement any new employment unique to the  sector.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">An issue that can be addressed in a relatively short time  frame is the part planning policy has to play if we pursue an agenda of green  economics. At present, the system is not green-friendly as regards the time it  takes to deal with applications or the success of such applications. There are  also questions to be asked about the cost of applications dealing with  renewable energy. All those must be addressed if we are to implement a policy  that will benefit our environment and help to address the economic problems  that we face.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Not so long ago, we released PPS 18, which is a policy on  renewable energy with supplementary planning guidelines. Even so, in my  constituency, people still find it hard to get approval for small wind energy  projects, and those are projects that the House should support. Unfortunately  the Minister is absent, but I want to draw to her attention the issue of the  Small Wind Energy Group, which, unfortunately, as a result of EU regulations,  misses out on the benefits of the renewables obligation certificate system. I  put that on record and ask that it be addressed.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  The Member raises an interesting issue in respect of wind energy. Many  applications go through the system, and, unfortunately, people who do not know  a lot tend to object to them. Will the Member encourage all elected  representatives to take what is sometimes the less popular position and support  what can be a very effective way of producing energy?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member will have an extra minute to speak.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Boylan</strong>:  Thank you Mr Speaker, and I thank the Member for his intervention. As long as  the proper process is followed, I certainly would support that approach.  However, on the SWEG issue, if we are to follow EU regulations, we need the  resources and funding that comes with that.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Trillions of pounds have been spent worldwide to prop up  the financial sector following the reckless behaviour of some lending  institutions. The banks must support the small and medium-sized enterprises at  this time, given that 70% to 80% of business in the private sector is made up  of them. It is time that the Assembly stood up to the banks and the malpractice  that has happened. We have only to look at what is happening in the Twenty-six  Counties. I urge the Assembly to look at measures to ensure that banks support  the small and medium-sized enterprises that are finding it very difficult at  this time. That applies right across the board and goes for innovation as well.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Supporting green fiscal stimulus measures will go some way  towards averting an impending environmental crisis, meeting European targets,  reducing our dependence on fossil fuels and kick-starting our economy. Maybe it  will even go some way towards ensuring that we do not find ourselves in such a  situation. I support the motion and the amendment.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Before I call Mr Gardiner, I remind Members once again of one of the  conventions of the House. On two occasions this morning, I watched Members walk  in front of the Member who was speaking in the Chamber. This issue has been  discussed by the Business Committee, and it has been agreed that it is totally  discourteous for a Member to walk in front of the Member who has the Floor.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gardiner</strong>:  I support the motion and the amendment. Green energy not only provides a  sustainable way forward that will help us to guard against the running-down of  our carbon resources but has the potential to create jobs, which, given  mounting unemployment, has to be an absolute priority for the Assembly and the  Executive. Unemployment has grown from 20,000 to almost 60,000 since the  recession began. Most disturbing is the growth of youth unemployment, which is  higher here than in any part of the country and stands at well over 20%. Like  many Members, I am outraged at the squandering of the talent and hopes of our  young people, and I want something to be done about it. I have hopes that the  creation of jobs in the green economy, which the Carbon Trust believes is  capable of producing 33,000 jobs, will help us to address the great social evil  of youth unemployment.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">At present, there are around 200 companies in the energy  sector in Northern Ireland,  and they employ about 4,500 people and generate an annual turnover of &pound;300  million. We have a long way to go. According to the Green New Deal Group in  Northern Ireland, energy users in the domestic, commercial, industrial,  transport and public sectors spend a total of &pound;2&middot;3 billion a year on energy. To  put that in context, that represents between 9% and 11% of our gross value  added, which is the main measure of economic output. Ninety-nine per cent of  that energy is derived from imported fossil fuels. That is alarmingly and  dangerously high.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Northern    Ireland has already taken some important  steps in the field of green energy. The SeaGen tidal energy converter in  Strangford Lough is one indicator of the future.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">It was installed two years ago and is based on  technology that has been used successfully in Devon.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">12.00 noon</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Other facilities could follow, with studies reporting significant  opportunities for tidal energy capacity off the Antrim coast at Rathlin Island. Harland and Wolff is one of the  long-established companies adapting to new circumstances and is firmly  established as a provider of equipment for renewable energy supplies. The  company uses its experience of the offshore oil and gas equipment market and  recently assembled 60 wind turbines for use offshore in the Irish Sea near Scotland. It  has won another contract to manufacture a prototype tidal turbine for use in  the Orkney Islands.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The use of biomass is also progressing here. The plant at  Enniskillen is recognised as a world leader in the conversion of wooden pellets  to energy, and I am delighted that one of the first eco-villages at Brokerstown  near Lisburn is powered by willow pellets produced near Lurgan, which is in my  constituency.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">There is also the good news of increased competition in the  supply market for commercial residential customers. Scottish and Southern  Energy has just entered the residential market through its Airtricity division,  promising its customers cost savings of up to 14% on their electricity bills.  It already supplies 10,000 business customers in Northern   Ireland and 200,000 in the Republic of Ireland.  Airtricity operates six wind farms in Northern Ireland.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The new green policy is much more acceptable to unionists  than the old green policy. Green energy means sustainability.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Frew</strong>: I  support the motion and the amendment in principle. In an economic depression,  when a country is on its knees and is unable even to crawl forward, that is the  time to plan and prepare for the next sprint. The priority for the Assembly  must be, and is, the economy and everything that springs from it. We have to  ensure that we have set the conditions to lessen the burdens on the most  vulnerable people, to soften the blows to business and, most importantly, to  plan for the future and for recovery.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">US President Franklin Roosevelt knew that only too well  when he galvanised the American people at the time of the national banking  system collapse in the 1930s. Roosevelt told  his people that it was:</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;time to speak the truth, the whole truth, frankly and  boldly. Nor need we shrink from honestly facing conditions in our country  today. This great Nation will endure as it has endured, will revive and will  prosper.&rdquo;</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">He said:</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;the only thing we have to fear is fear itself &mdash;  nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert  retreat into advance &hellip; a host of unemployed citizens face the grim problem of  existence, and an equally great number toil with little return.&rdquo;</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Roosevelt said:</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Only a foolish optimist can deny the dark realities  of the moment.&rdquo;</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">He also said:</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;when there is no vision the people perish.&rdquo;</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">What is our vision? Knowing what we want to achieve is not  enough. We must know how to achieve it. Words can be spoken in the House, but  it is the actions that we take outside that count. What will be the factors  that will keep our country in recession? When this country recovers, what will  be the next big crisis? Those are the issues that we must concern ourselves  with.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The next problem could well be the cost of energy. Around  10% of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  income is spent on importing fossil fuels, on which we are 99% dependent for  energy. We spend &pound;2&middot;3 billion a year on energy. As a country, we could be held  to ransom by rising energy prices. Unless we act quickly to reduce that  dependence, it could cause serious economic failure and push many more people  into fuel poverty. The best time to do that is now, as we plan our recovery. We  need to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and create a stimulant for  employment.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">There are some 705,000 dwellings in Northern Ireland,  over 90% of which still fall short of the best energy performance standards.  Surely, it is the same in our factories, commercial buildings, schools and  hospitals. Around 25% of our unemployed have come from the construction  industry. There are people waiting to be re-employed who know and can do the  work. There are people from the electrical and mechanical engineering sector  who have knowledge of energy sources, the ability to integrate energy systems  and experience of project management. They know and understand the built form.  If those buildings were targeted, it could reduce unemployment and help the  needy who are caught up in fuel poverty.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We could retrofit most of the building stock with  energy-efficiency measures, which would provide work and a market for products  from the environmental goods and services sector. I believe that that is the  way forward. It will help our people and create employment at the same time,  but it will not be enough on its own. We need to keep up our capital spending  and to maintain our infrastructure. However, practices will have to change. The  equipment and its installation will have to be affordable. That is where the  problem has lain to date. People cannot afford to put such equipment into their  houses.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Who will pay for this, and what incentives can the  Government give? How many years will it take to pay for itself? Those are the  questions that the people have been asking and will continue to ask if we move  forward in this vein. I am not sure whether the House has the answers to those  questions.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I also mention lignite mining. It would be a very  retrograde step if that were to raise its head again in north Antrim or  elsewhere in this country.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr W Clarke</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I support the motion and the  amendment. I thank the Members for tabling it.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I pay tribute to the green new deal group, which drew inspiration  from the tone of Roosevelt&rsquo;s comprehensive response to the Great Depression and  proposed a modernised version &mdash; a green new deal &mdash; that is designed to power a  renewables revolution and to create thousands of green-collar jobs in Europe  and the world.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The green new deal, as many other Members touched on,  provides us with a good opportunity to tackle the recession, rising energy  prices and climate change. We are an island; we need to waken up to that  reality. Fossil fuels are running out. Oil prices continue to rise, and, when  we get into recovery, they will go through the roof. We will not be able to  afford to run our cars or heat our homes, so we need to plan now. That is what  the green new deal is about.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The energy efficiency of our homes is just not up to spec.  Too many homes are letting too much energy escape. People may as well just open  their windows and let the heat out of their homes. That is the scenario for the  vast majority of homes. The Member across the way who spoke before me touched  on the fact that too many people cannot afford to make their homes energy  efficient. People in the middle income brackets cannot afford to do so, and  people in old social housing do not have the efficiency that they require.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Members will probably talk about funding and ask how the  green new deal will be resourced. An innovative scheme has just been launched  in Birmingham.  The Birmingham  new deal plans to fit power-generating solar panels to council-owned  properties. It is being pushed through this week, and around 10,000 homes will  have that new technology put in place.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Birmingham  energy savers programme will be funded jointly by the city council, energy  suppliers and, above all, commercial banks. It follows the success of two pilot  schemes in Birmingham.  Banks and financial institutions largely got us into this mess, so they have to  step up to the mark by backing schemes now by providing borrowing on long-term  agreements. Residents and businesses in Birmingham  have the opportunity to cut carbon pollution and to save thousands of pounds by  reducing their bills, and what is happening there could be replicated in the  North. Under the scheme, commercial banks will provide half the up-front  investment, supplemented by &pound;25 million from energy companies and &pound;25 million  borrowed by the council. Consumers will pay a levy on their energy bills over  the repayment period of the loans &mdash; around 25 years.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I will touch on some of the difficulties that I find in my  constituency. Simon Hamilton mentioned one of the good projects: the tidal  project in Strangford Lough is a success and is leading the way in new  technologies. However, we in South Down are working on a district heating  scheme in Newcastle  that has the potential to create jobs. The project would benefit people through  the use of a central, biomass heating system that would provide power for  sheltered accommodation, schools and a new leisure centre, yet to be built.  However, trying to get Departments around a table to even look at such a  proposal is like banging my head off a wall. The public want it to be done and  people are willing to do it, but there are always obstacles. Civil servants  will always find obstacles. Even if four or five Departments are brought around  a table, they will blame somebody else.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Will the Member bring his remarks to a close?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr W Clarke</strong>:  I will indeed, Mr Speaker.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">To finish, the banks have a duty to provide money and to be  at the forefront. We need to look at our social housing stock.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr W Clarke</strong>:  And use that as collateral to obtain the necessary funding to introduce the  green new deal.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I must insist that the Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I  support the motion. The green new deal contains a lot of ideas, some of them  radical, that will bring environmental issues to the fore, and I commend that.  More needs to be done to create a green economy. More sustainable methods of  producing electricity, in particular, and of heating our homes need to be  created. We are over-dependent on fossil fuels that must be imported &mdash; more  than 90% of our energy comes from them. Oil and gas prices have fluctuated  hugely in the past years. In 2009, oil prices reached $150 a barrel. With peak  oil production thought to have already occurred, we can expect only high prices  and continuing rises in the future. That will endanger local companies and  cause additional problems with fuel poverty, and so on.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The utilisation of onshore and offshore wind farms, bioenergy,  tidal energy and geothermal energy will mean less dependence on other energy  sources and will create sustainable sources of power. Fortunately, Northern Ireland  has excellent companies at the forefront of the field. I think of B9 Energy in  my constituency, which has led the way in Northern Ireland on wind power and  is investigating the tidal energy prospects at Torr Head.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We need also to rethink energy use in our power stations to  ensure that they do not waste energy. At the moment, waste energy is simply  pumped out to sea. That is a waste and does not happen in many plants on  mainland Europe, where secondary use is made  of waste heat from power stations.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We need to encourage combined heat and power schemes. Ideas  such as refurbishing thousands of homes with full insulation and renewable  energy are not new. We have seen that happen elsewhere. We have the warm homes  scheme, which could be extended so that more could benefit from better homes  with more insulation.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">As others have said, the Calderdale and Kirklees energy  savers scheme and Kirklees Council&rsquo;s warm zone project, which began in 2007,  show that, with incentives, it is possible to encourage significant  improvements and to leverage significant additional amounts of money to enable  that to happen.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">12.15 pm</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Our dependence on imported fossil fuels will have to be  replaced increasingly by an emphasis on sustainable energy and energy  efficiency. The green new deal mentions creating 24,000 green-collar jobs,  which would be commendable if it were possible without unduly affecting other  forms of employment. It is essential that we create additional jobs, and there  is potential for that. However, we must take care that we do not drive up the  cost of electricity here unduly and simply endanger other jobs, such as those  in manufacturing. We must keep energy prices competitive.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The amendment mentions 30,000 new jobs. I must admit that I  was surprised that that amendment was selected. That point could have been made  in debate, and it would be helpful in the summing up to hear evidence of a  business case to back up that number.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Another area that should be worked on is Building Control&rsquo;s  insulation standards, which have increased in the past number of years.  Nevertheless, surely they should be further increased now, not many years in  the future. The most efficient time to insulate a house is when it is built.  There is no point coming back to existing homes in 10 or 20 years to upgrade  them. It is uneconomical to do that, so it is much better to do it now. However,  we must appreciate that doing even that involves cost. Not only is there a cost  involved in retrofitting; there is a cost to increasing standards.  Nevertheless, we should face those costs and ensure that it happens.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">There are some flaws in the ideology of the green new deal,  most worryingly the figure of &pound;2&middot;3 billion that will be required to fund such a  venture. I understand that some &pound;750 million will be required locally.  Therefore, we need a clear business case for how it will happen. I would like  it to happen, but where exactly will the money come from? I understand that  European regulations will restrict DETI&rsquo;s flexibility to support companies in  the area of the environment.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member should draw his remarks to a close.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  Energy efficiency will be an important way to assist the economy.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  The Government in Northern    Ireland spend about &pound;2&middot;4 billion a year on  goods and services. In some ways, the question that we are debating is whether  we are using that amazing purchasing power to promote local jobs and  sustainability in its widest sense. On so many fronts, the sad answer is no.  Our new roads are being built by multinationals; the social clauses are hardly  worth the paper that they are written on; employment opportunities are  temporary and the profits leave; our oil comes from Russia; our training needs  are sometimes being met by companies with little more than a mobile telephone  number in the region; and, as many of us feel, the Executive spend more time  investing in other people&rsquo;s economies, than doing so sustainably in our own.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">It is an obvious example, but many Members mentioned the  fact that &pound;9 out of every &pound;10 that we spend on energy leaves the region. One  wonders why oligarchs are able to own Premier League football teams. The answer  is in any NIE bill; we are paying for them, and if we do not change our  behaviour, we will continue to pay for them. It is for that reason that we are  long past the point at which we need a big idea. We need a strategy with the  short-, medium- and long-term potential to transform our regional economy,  which understands its great strengths and can build on its industrial, engineering  and agriculture heritages, and which must be capable of coalescing those of us  in the Chamber and, apparently with much more difficulty, those who work in our  silo Departments.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">As Mr Hamilton said, a green new deal is not just a  programme to address the sustainability challenges that the region will face.  It could become the key platform on which we build jobs for future generations.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">It is not the case that green-collar jobs do not exist  today. Mr Beggs asked where we got the figure of 30,000 from. We got it from  the report, which estimated that, if the proper investments were made in the  right way, the potential out-turn would be 30,000 jobs. The truth is that jobs  that are being done by people in all sorts of sectors are not sustainable, but  they could be if we were to change the focus of the economy.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Green-collar jobs are bus builder and bus drivers&rsquo; jobs,  but those will exist only if DRD invests seriously in sustainable transport,  which it does not do today. Over the past decade, we have missed all our  targets, choosing instead to invest in unsustainable transport. There are fitter  and electricians&rsquo; jobs, but only if DETI unlocks the opportunity for renewable  energy, something that it does not do today. We simply talk about renewable  energy, but we do not invest in it meaningfully or seriously. There are jobs  for builders, brickies, carpenters and plumbers, but only if we go beyond  talking about the retrofitting opportunity and start to look at the business  models that would deliver it.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Government in this region has an obsession with delivering  services, but, sometimes, it should just commission them. Many in the community  and voluntary sector and in the social enterprise sector can and would create  local jobs in the sort of projects about which Mr Frew spoke so eloquently.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Green-collar jobs can be science jobs and academic jobs,  but only if we align our innovation policies with our economic strategy. That  is what the independent review of economic policy told us to do. If truth be  told, we paid no attention. Green-collar jobs can be entrepreneurial, but only  if we unlock the funding opportunities by investing in bonding and other  imaginative new ways of raising revenue for the region. We must also understand  that venture capital has a place but that it must align itself with the rest of  the economy.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP was happy to table the amendment outlining the  jobs potential, because it makes the motion real. It makes this a tangible  debate about something that could transform the economy, but only if  Departments fundamentally change their behaviour. They must stop regarding  sustainability as something to put at the end of reports. They must start to  see it as something that they put right at the beginning of reports and at the  centre of policy.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McKay</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I support the motion. In the current  economic climate, there is a danger that green issues and climate change will  be forgotten. I welcome the motion, and we should all realise that, by tackling  the issues innovatively, we can create key economic drivers that will aid  economic recovery.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">A more sustainable economy is one that is less reliant on  finite fuels, and, fortunately, we have wind resource in abundance, as well as  many wave and tidal energy opportunities. The ongoing work in Strangford Lough,  which has been highlighted, is a good example of that. To reduce the total  energy costs, we must prioritise simple insulation measures, the introduction  of renewable energy into domestic homes and the improvement of public  transport. As my colleague Cathal Boylan said, 90% of housing is not energy  efficient, and that simply is not good enough.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Planning applications for renewable measures such as wind  turbines must be processed more efficiently. I agree with Mr McCrea&rsquo;s point  about the objections to a number of such applications. He is correct to say  that non-genuine objections that are reactionary, based on Nimbyism and  designed to scaremonger should be countered. Political leaders from the  Assembly should do so.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  concur fully with the Member. In light of his remarks, will he consider the  opposition to the North/South interconnector, which is part of a smart grid  that is important for renewables?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member will have an extra minute added to his time.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McKay</strong>:  Reactionary objections and those that are based on Nimbyism should be opposed,  but any genuine concerns about health effects should be taken into account.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In my area of North Antrim,  I am very supportive, and always have been, of wind energy applications. We are  opposed to Nimbyism. However, if a planning application has an impact &mdash; for  example, if it is too close to an area that relies on tourism &mdash; that should be  taken into account. However, a carte blanche approach should not be taken to  planning applications, because that would result in a free-for-all. Certain key  issues need to be taken into consideration.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Even if there is wide public opposition to some planning  applications, political leadership needs to be shown. Politicians should put  their foot forward and ensure that those planning applications go ahead. We  have renewable energy targets to meet, and, as the Member for South Belfast Mr  McDevitt said, we need to be less reliant on oil from Russia and  finite fuels. There is a need for politicians from all parties to unite around  applications in certain constituencies. If there were joint political  leadership on applications from the renewable energy industry, we would see our  targets met more rapidly.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Wind turbines are much more pleasing to the eye than  incinerators, nuclear power plants and, as the Member for North Antrim Mr Frew  said, lignite mines. Therefore, there are many benefits to developing the wind  turbine industry.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Social impacts could be offset by proposals in the green  new deal. Many older people live in homes that are energy inefficient, and we  are well aware of the campaigns run by non-governmental organisations on older  people having to choose between heating and eating. According to statistics,  older people&rsquo;s poverty has increased in recent years, and that is something on  which we need to take action. Ensuring energy efficiency in the homes of those  who need it most must continue to be an Executive priority, particularly given  the economic challenges that lie ahead.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">To summarise, the green new deal has a great deal of  potential. It has the potential to create new jobs; to assist the construction  industry in a meaningful way; and to develop the island, and this part of the  island, to make it a world leader in renewables. We need to grasp that  potential and ensure that the issue becomes a priority for the Assembly and the  Executive. We need to be mindful that the issue does not get left behind  because of the current economic climate. The green new deal needs to be a  priority and must form part of the Executive&rsquo;s strategy for economic recovery.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B Wilson</strong>:  I support the motion and the amendment. I am delighted to see such unanimity in  the Chamber today.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Green Party has been a long-standing supporter of the  green new deal. Indeed, it was a supporter long before the green new deal group  was set up, and our party manifesto for the 2009 European election was titled  &lsquo;A Green New Deal for Europe&rsquo;. That was a common manifesto with 27 other Green  parties throughout the European Union, and it highlighted how the green economy  had created thousands of jobs in many European countries, particularly in Germany, Denmark  and Spain.  In Germany  alone, 250,000 jobs have been created. We argued that, on the basis of the  experiences of those countries, we could create five million green-collar jobs  throughout the European Union. It is clear that many voters recognised the  potential of green jobs, with the Green Party achieving its greatest success,  returning 53 MEPs and, locally, our candidate, Steven Agnew, tripling the green  vote.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I launched that manifesto at Harland and Wolff to highlight  how that company was reaping the benefits of new green technology. The company,  which was at the forefront of the industrial revolution, is now at the  forefront of a new green revolution and is adapting traditional local skills in  construction and engineering to promote the new green economy. Since then,  Harland and Wolff has expanded its involvement in the green economy, and I  congratulate it on its recent announcement of a &pound;10 million contract to  construct 30 huge wind turbines and a multimillion pound contract to design and  build two platforms for an offshore wind development. Those will provide more  much-needed jobs.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">12.30 pm</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Harland and Wolff has been one of the few good news stories  during the recession, and that is clearly due to its foresight in entering the  ever-expanding green economy as well as its expertise and facilities, which are  unique. It is an example of the green new deal in action. It is not enough to  say that we are focusing on the economy. We must focus our energy and  investment on the new technologies that are required to help us to move to a  low-carbon economy that is not reliant on imported fossil fuels but is based  instead on sustainable forms of energy, transport and food production. A  success story such as Harland and Wolff should not be an isolated incident: it  must become a common occurrence. Fossil fuels are running out, but Northern Ireland,  with its natural resources of wind and wave, can become a world leader in green  energy.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Another green success is the 150 new jobs that solar energy  firm Kingspan Renewables created. It bought Thermomax, which was based in Bangor and which we were  very supportive of. That is where we should be targeting investment, and that  example demonstrates the potential of new jobs in the green economy. We have  been pointing that out for many years with perhaps somewhat limited success.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Our targets for renewable energy should be more ambitious. Scotland&rsquo;s First Minister, Alex Salmond, has  increased Scotland&rsquo;s  targets for renewables to 80% by 2020, and the Welsh Assembly recently  announced that its share from renewables will increase by 200% by 2020. There  is potential for growth, and we should expand our renewables targets and  exports. Those are ambitious targets, but with our natural resources and the  support of the Executive, we can achieve similar targets.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Unfortunately, the record to date shows that the Assembly  has not fully grasped the green new deal. For example, we had a situation some  years ago where DETI stopped funding the Reconnect grants for the development  of renewable energy and small microgeneration systems as well as the Renewable Energy Installer   Academy that trained  people to work the installers. That was very short-sighted.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I also refer to the Programme for Government. We are  talking about sustainability &mdash;</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member should bring his remarks to a close.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B Wilson</strong>:  There is a proposal from Westminster  to scrap the Sustainable Develop&shy;ment Commission. I appeal to the Executive to  fund that commission even though it may not be funded by Westminster.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Business Committee has arranged to meet immediately upon the lunchtime suspension.  I, therefore, propose, by leave of the Assembly, to suspend the sitting until  2.00 pm, when the Minister will respond to the debate.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The sitting was suspended at 12.33 pm.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">On resuming (Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr McClarty] in the  Chair) &mdash;</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">2.00 pm</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment (Mrs Foster)</strong>: I apologise for my absence during the debate.  However, my copious note-takers will, I hope, enable me to reflect the debate  in my comments.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The debate is timely, in so far as Members are aware that  the Department&rsquo;s strategic energy framework was formally launched on 27  September, and I understand that Members referred to that. A key priority in  that document is ensuring that energy savings are gained from improving energy  efficiency and that such savings are recognised, prioritised and put into  action. The green economy is another key area that is highlighted in the SEF,  and it was acknowledged by several Members, as is the need to strengthen cross-departmental  working. I am pleased that DETI already leads the way on those issues, and I am  glad that many of the same issues are to the fore in the green new deal  proposals.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We all recognise the current lack of investment in energy  efficiency measures in homes and non-domestic buildings. That has resulted in  many properties across Northern    Ireland having poor energy ratings, and  virtually all Members who contributed to the debate raised that issue. That is  despite the fact that investment in such measures can produce tangible savings  on future energy bills. It is clear that, alongside investment in new energy  infrastructure, we need to reduce our energy demand. Therefore, energy  efficiency must increasingly become part of energy policy. The green economy is  not only about the ability to produce clean energy; it is about growing the  market for products that consume less energy.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">By improving Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  energy efficiency, we will, undoubtedly, help to deliver our climate change  targets and those of the UK,  which will help with the security of supply. Mr Neeson raised the important  point that we are underperforming by not meeting our targets to reduce  emissions. However, we must be aware that emissions in Northern Ireland  tend to be higher because of its more dispersed population and the resultant  heavy reliance on road transport. Undoubtedly, that presents us with more of a  challenge.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Wilson felt that our renewable targets were, perhaps,  not as ambitious as they should be, and he made a comparison with Scotland.  However, our 40% target is evidence-based and approaches the maximum that even  a strengthened Northern    Ireland grid could accommodate without  jeopardising its stability. Therefore, the 40% target in the SEF is correct,  and that is without taking into account the obvious geographical differences  between Northern Ireland and  Scotland, the most notable being  how much of Scotland  is covered in forestry and the fact that it has a much longer coastline, both  of which have an impact on its targets.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Energy efficiency will also help us to save money for  business. It is increasingly clear that energy efficiency will become a key  benchmark of globally competitive companies in this century. Increased energy  efficiency is necessary for many of our international companies. Although we  know that energy saving is the cheapest way of closing the gap between demand  and supply, it remains the Cinderella at the energy ball.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">On the near horizon, energy saving will mean smart meters  and smart grids that will give the consumer control over appliances. Although  those will take a long time to develop, there is much that we can do now. A  great deal is already being done across government, some of which I will  outline.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Paul Frew, Simon Hamilton, Roy Beggs and Willie Clarke all  mentioned the first of those issues, which is a reduction in carbon emissions.  There is no doubt that the approach of the green new deal offers substantial  opportunities to retrofit energy efficiency in a significant number of domestic  and non-domestic buildings. It will also help to create new jobs while reducing  energy bills and carbon emissions.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The business sector is driven to reduce carbon emissions  through a variety of mechanisms such as the EU emissions trading scheme,  climate change agreements and the carbon reduction commitment. The latter, in  particular, covers large public and private sector organisations and will  capture around 10% of our emissions in Northern Ireland. Organisations  that qualify for participation must monitor emissions from energy use, report  those emissions annually and purchase and surrender a corresponding number of  allowances. A number of Members made the point that government should lead by  example in this area. I am pleased to say that we are doing so in Northern Ireland,  and a number of Departments participate in the scheme, even though they do not  meet the qualification threshold. By 2020, the carbon reduction commitment is  expected to have delivered emission savings of at least 132,000 tons of carbon  dioxide in Northern Ireland  and to have saved those participating in the scheme between &pound;20 million and &pound;30  million a year through cost-effective energy efficiency measures that have not  yet been taken up.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The green new deal approach, working alongside existing  government initiatives, could unlock significant expenditure in the coming  years. By creating a new market opportunity, we could provide another major  opportunity for economic growth and employment. Indeed, that is the main thrust  of the amendment. That would also undoubtedly help to drive economic recovery.  The market is big, and Northern    Ireland needs to strive to improve its  energy efficiency in all properties and make them affordable to all. However,  we must be mindful to put the correct financial framework in place at the  outset. A model with a pay-as-you-save concept at its heart offers the best  opportunity for everyone. In that model, the private sector would pay for the  work up front through networks of green deal providers, and it would allow  house owners or tenants of non-domestic buildings to pay their energy bills  back over time from the energy savings that they make.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Roy Beggs and Sean Neeson mentioned the implications of  being able to build a business case on a sustainable way forward. Mr Clarke  gave Birmingham  as an example. Banks and energy suppliers have been working together to find  ways to make energy efficiency work for them in that city. I absolutely believe  in that method. Realistically, substantial recurring government funding will  not continue to be available in the current economic climate. Therefore, rather  than have a system that relies on that funding, the best model is one in which  savings pay for the efficiencies in the future. However, such a system will  need some form of legal underpinning to give it the necessary longevity to  bring confidence to investors and those involved in the supply chain. Such a  longer-term view will deliver a green growth sector that can offer a big boost  to our economic recovery. All in all, I believe that a private sector-financed  green new deal concept could transform the energy efficiency of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  building stock while sending the right signal to the energy efficiency industry  and providing investment confidence and job opportunities.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The debate also focused heavily on fuel poverty. An  approach that ties energy savings to the people who pay the energy bills will  be a breakthrough for house owners and tenants. Some people, such as the fuel  poor, will need extra help. Energy savings alone will not be enough, and I  recognise that. However, a competitive market will provide the best value and  confidence in products for the customer.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In Northern    Ireland, 70% of the houses that we will live  in by 2050 have been built already. Added to that, we have some of the oldest  housing stock in Europe, much of which was  built in the era of cheap coal. However, that is no excuse. Much work is under  way to improve the housing stock, and I know that Sammy Wilson and his  Department are moving quickly to strengthen those building standards.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, the implementation of the EU directive on the  energy performance of buildings has resulted in the production of almost 94,000  certificates. That is a visible sign of the energy efficiency of buildings  within which services are provided to the public. The Executive have already  agreed to use domestic rates relief to drive the energy efficiency measures.  Both the energy efficiency homes scheme and the low carbon homes scheme have  been introduced recently to improve the energy efficiency of the housing stock  here by encouraging the development of low- and zero-carbon homes. The  Department will continue to work with the Department for Social Development in  relation to fuel poverty matters.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In line with the aspirations of the green new deal, there  is huge potential for green jobs in the region, both in energy efficiency and  renewable energy. Members mentioned specific examples including Harland and  Wolff, B9 Energy, the Marine Current Turbines installation at Strangford and  the Kingspan works in Portadown. The renewable energy sector is one of the  fastest growing sectors in the economy. The opportunities to create employment,  generate wealth and develop a local skills base in the sector are substantial,  as colleagues acknowledged today.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The growing demand for renewable energy and renewable  energy technologies is one that Northern Ireland is very well placed to meet,  not only because of our geographical location but because of the capabilities  and skills of our local businesses, universities and colleges; I say that very  strongly. Dr McDonnell mentioned Queen&rsquo;s University specifically in that  regard, but there are other colleges of further education that do a tremendous  job in the renewable arena.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Developing the sector is a strategic priority for Invest  Northern Ireland.  Significant activity has been undertaken, not only to provide support for the  small and medium-sized enterprises in the renewable energy sector but to  develop new technologies and provide companies that have a desire to look at  the new export markets with a framework of support to develop and grow their  business. Since April 2009, Invest NI clients in the renewable energy sector  have received financial assistance amounting to &pound;5&middot;2 million, against total  investment costs of &pound;25&middot;6 million, for a range of activities including research  and development, training, job creation and the development of collaborative  networks.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Cross-departmental working has been mentioned throughout  the debate. For some time now, DETI has, through the sustainable energy  interdepartmental working group, co-ordinated cross-departmental working on  sustainable energy to give a clear message to stakeholders, whether from  industry, energy companies or environmental groups, that we in the Executive  recognise the opportunities and the challenges that the sustainable energy  agenda presents. Indeed, we were instrumental in ensuring that many of the  green new deal priorities were included in the Executive&rsquo;s options package for  addressing the economic downturn.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Shortly, I will bring forward proposals from the work of  that interdepartmental group with recommendations on how to maximise  sustainable energy policy initiatives in Northern Ireland. In addition, the  Department for Employment and Learning is already working with stakeholders to  address identified skill needs and develop new fit-for-purpose courses and  qualifications to support and advance the sector. We will continue to work  cross-departmentally on energy efficiency and renewable energy. We will seek to  work with others to develop the green new deal concept with a sufficient legal  underpinning that offers opportunities to all.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the green new deal proposals. However, we must be  mindful of the current financial climate and, therefore, work together to  develop an innovative green deal financing option that will stand the test of  time and, thereby, embed energy efficiency and renewable energy across all  aspects of our society.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">2.15 pm</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I thank Mr Neeson and his colleagues for tabling today&rsquo;s important motion. They  have done us a service by highlighting the issue of the green new deal. I feel  a bit sorry for Mr Wilson, not because he is not a passionate supporter of the  green new deal but because the Green Party pioneered the original concept of  the green agenda and, in a way, his political clothes have been stolen by all  of us. We owe it to the people who pioneered the green agenda politically to  recognise what they did and to highlight the fact that they brought about a  radical change in thinking not only on the environment but on the economy and  many other aspects of our society.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that we continue to develop the green  agenda in the Assembly and in the Executive. The Minister rightly pointed out  that she regards it as a priority. The Minister and the Executive accept the  concept of the green new deal. However, it seems to me and to colleagues that  the issue of the green agenda, renewable energy and so forth is relatively  confined to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment, and there does  not seem to be collective acceptance of the entire Executive&rsquo;s responsibility.  We should try to persuade the Executive to embrace the issue in a much more  wholehearted fashion.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Many Members spoke today. Simon Hamilton, who is not in the  Chamber at the moment, spoke in a slightly sceptical mode, not quite &agrave; la Mr  Wilson &mdash; Mr Sammy Wilson, I hasten to add &mdash; but in that political school of  thought. Nonetheless, he recognised the need for the green new deal. Whether  for reasons of climate change or not, the fact is that it is good for our  society and our economy. Generally speaking, he was supportive, which is  important.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Other Members who spoke included Mr Boylan, Mr Gardiner, Mr  Frew, Mr Clarke, Mr Beggs, Mr McDevitt and Mr McKay. They all emphasised the  need for the Executive and the Government to embrace the new ideas arising from  the green agenda. It is important for us to remind ourselves that, geographically,  the island of Ireland is probably uniquely placed to  develop, in a great sense, renewable energy. We have wind, sea and grass here,  and those three elements are important in the development of renewable energy.  We know about wind, and we know that we can harness the potential of wind here  more than any other part of Europe. We should  increase and deepen our efforts to do that and build that potential, not just  onshore but offshore.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Gardiner, Mr Frew and others mentioned SeaGen.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Will the Member draw his remarks to a close?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  In conclusion, I support the motion and the amendment, and I hope that  colleagues will pass the motion today.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: We  have had a healthy and positive debate. However, it will only be meaningful if  it used as a platform from which the Assembly can move forward. I certainly  recognise the work that has been done and is being done, not only by DETI but  by other Departments, but we need to take it to a new level.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The motion is not an endorsement of any particular set of  proposals from one organisation; rather, it is about the Assembly embracing the  concept of a green new deal and, indeed, the opportunities that it presents for  Northern Ireland.  That said, it is appropriate to pay tribute to the Green New Deal Group and the  work that it has done, as well as to recognise, as Simon Hamilton mentioned,  the almost unique coalescence of the business community, trade unions, the  community and voluntary sector, farmers and the environmental lobby behind a common  agenda. There is certainly a powerful lesson in that.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">There are three important rationales for why the Assembly  should address the green new deal. Obviously, there is the environmental agenda  with regard to the need to combat climate change and to adapt to the reality of  it, partly to avoid the negative economic consequences that will flow if we do  not do that. The Stern report set out those consequences and the economic cost  in graphic detail. There is also the economic rationale. I want to talk about  opportunities for new types of economic activity and increased employment.  Indeed, the amendment brings more detail to that. Now we talk about  green-collar jobs as well as white-collar jobs and blue-collar jobs. There is  also the important issue of the energy costs faced by businesses, households  and, indeed, us in the public sector and how to move to a greater sense of  energy security. The problem is not so much that energy comes from overseas but  our overdependence on fossil fuels that may not be available for ever. Finally,  we have the social benefits. Most clearly, there is a need to address fuel  poverty, which my colleague Sean Neeson explained ably at the beginning of the  debate.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">There are probably four key areas for action. One is energy  efficiency, which is, perhaps, the key area in which most work can be done in  the shortest period. It is also the area where there is potential for quite a  labour-intensive set of activities to be taken forward. In view of the  unemployment problem, particularly in the construction sector, that is very  relevant. Another area is renewable energy, where there is a platform on which  we can build. It is important to stress, as Alban Maginness mentioned, that  that covers more than just onshore or offshore wind. A further area is the grid  infrastructure and the need for a smart grid and smart meters, as the Minister  said. I want to emphasise the importance of the North/South interconnector in  that framework. Another important issue is transport. The transport system is  inefficient and a strong contributor to Northern   Ireland&rsquo;s carbon footprint, which is the highest of any UK region.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister set out what is being done in Northern Ireland  not only by her Department but through the actions of other Departments. I  certainly recognise what is happening. I welcome the publication of the  strategic energy framework. Indeed, I acknowledge that we have our own local  renewables targets and are on track to meet them.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The issue for us today is to focus on what more can be  done, not just by DETI and other Departments but by the Executive as a whole.  First and foremost, it is important that government embraces the language of  the green new deal and the green economy. Indeed, I hope that it becomes a  clear theme in the next Programme for Government, which, hopefully, we will  address later on this autumn. Other societies have embraced that language and  concept more actively than Northern    Ireland. Scotland,  Denmark and Germany were  mentioned in the debate. Certainly, there is a perception that the UK as a whole  is behind the curve when compared with the wider European Union and other  international examples.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In the UK  context, Northern Ireland  is behind other regions. Therefore, there is a lot of room for improvement. We  have targets for renewable energy but not for energy efficiency or the  transport sector, both of which are major problems in Northern Ireland.  There are no local targets for climate change. Northern   Ireland would benefit from its own dedicated climate  change Act, such as those that other UK regions have taken forward. The  cross-sectoral advisory group addressed the use of renewables as a short-term  action. That was welcomed, but, bizarrely, energy efficiency was seen as a  long-term action to be taken forward in areas such as the wider market. Access  to resourcing for the green new deal was seen as something that could not be  done in Northern Ireland.  Those are warning signs that I think we should be worried about.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">There is a clear need for leadership when considering the  energy efficiency of the public sector estate. We used to have targets on how  quickly we would have a zero-carbon estate. However, those targets are now not  going to be met. Again, we would still have the opportunity to make that  happen. We need to reconsider the issue of grant aid for energy efficiency in  homes. That has also been taken off the table, but it needs to come back on to  the table. We need to look at feed-in tariffs as an evolutionary step away from  merely talking about renewables obligation certificates, the so-called ROCs. We  must address our transport system and look at the balance that we have between  the use of the private car and public transport. The ratio in the investment  strategy is 80:20 in favour of private transport. That is well out of line with  most other regions in Europe, even those that  have a similar rural population profile to ours.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We also have to look at our planning system and ask  ourselves whether it is fit for purpose. Are PPS 18 and, in particular, the  supplementary planning guidance sufficiently robust to ensure that we are able  to make speedy decisions with investments? Feedback is still coming through  that the process is taking too long and there is still too much uncertainty.  People do not mind being turned down; they object to being left hanging around  and being made unsure about whether their plans will be taken forward.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">There is a critical issue with how we fund what needs to  happen. Like everyone else, I am conscious of our difficult public expenditure  context. However, we are talking about leveraging the private sector and about  creating the necessary levers and incentives to ensure that the work that needs  to happen in our society is encouraged. In that context, we are also talking  about the need to stimulate a strong private sector and market-focused approach  to addressing the problems.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">It is important to recognise that a host of Departments can  bring something to the table. A theme that has emerged from the debate is that,  although good work is being done and Departments are co-operating with each  other, the Executive are not embracing the issue properly as an overarching  theme. There is no sense of how all the available programmes, policies, levers  and incentives fit together into a single model that will demonstrate how the  green economy can be taken forward and how we in Northern Ireland can meet our share  of the wider climate change objectives that we have to face up to.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We need to see how all that can work together. Under DETI,  we have the strategic energy framework and the good work that Invest Northern  Ireland takes forward in encouraging the sector. The Department for Employment  and Learning has an important role to play in providing the skills for the  green economy. Indeed, the Minister referred to the work of the universities  and colleges in that area. The Department of Finance and Personnel has a role  to play with building regulations and the speed with which we can move ahead  with the code for sustainable homes. There are still issues to deal with on the  level of uptake in the rate rebates under low- and zero-carbon homes, on energy  efficiency for homes and on the responsibility for energy efficiency in the  public sector estate. OFMDFM has a role to play in the sustainable development  strategy, which has been recognised as not being sufficiently robust. That  Department also has a role to play in ascertaining how we integrate the green  economy into the current investment strategy and any future investment  strategy. DSD has responsibilities with fuel poverty and social housing. The  Department of Agriculture and Rural Development has a role to play in biomass  and energy efficiency in the rural sector, and the Department for Regional  Development has a role to play in transport and energy efficiency. Finally, DOE  has a role to play in planning and climate change responsibilities. Indeed, I  am glad that the Minister of the Environment has joined us for the grand  finale. Therefore, a collective effort is required from the Government. It is  important that an overarching strategy emerges and, in particular, that that is  reflected in a future Programme for Government.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The debate has been encouraging. We welcome the proposals  from the Green New Deal Group. This is a platform on which we can build, and I  look forward to that happening. I am happy to support the motion and the  amendment.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question, That the amendment be made, put and agreed  to.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Main Question, as amended, put and agreed to.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly notes the benefits that can be achieved  through implementing the green new deal in Northern Ireland; supports the need  for improved energy efficiency to reduce fuel use and meet European Union and  United Kingdom carbon emissions targets; believes there is a real opportunity  to create 30,000 sustainable green-collar jobs; and calls on the Executive to  implement a cross-departmental strategy to ensure that the potential benefits  of the green economy are realised for Northern Ireland.</p>

        <p class="OralAnswers-H2DepartmentHeading">Environment</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Question 4 has been withdrawn.</p>
        <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Environmental Crime</p>
        <p class="OralAnswers-Question">1. <strong>Mr  McGlone </strong>asked the Minister of the Environment what resources he plans to  give to address environmental crime in the next year, particularly in relation  to the illegal disposal of tyres, which is a major source of pollution when  dumped in the countryside or burnt on bonfires. (AQO 209/11)</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  Ceist uimhir a haon, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Question 1, Mr Deputy Speaker.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment (Mr Poots)</strong>: I am committed to maintaining and enhancing my  Department&rsquo;s capability to address and combat the full range of environmental  crime that it enforces. Over the next few months, the proposed recruitment of  additional staff to the environmental crime unit is expected to take place,  further strengthening our ability to tackle the scourge of waste crime,  including illegal tyre disposal. Clearly, the economic climate means that all  departmental resources are under review, and until the details of the next  comprehensive spending review are known, I remain cautious. However, I will  ensure that tackling environmental crime will remain a top priority for the  Department over the next year and beyond.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA) is  developing a range of policy and legislative tools to make its work more  efficient and effective, from PSNI-level training and additional Proceeds of  Crime Act 2002 powers to undertake financial investigation of criminal assets  to the forthcoming Waste and Contaminated   Land (Amendment) Bill and  fly-tipping protocol. I am confident that the message that we have been  striving to publicise over the past few years about the risk posed by burning  tyres is being heard and acted on. There have been some high-profile examples  of large-scale tyre fires in recent months, but my officials have been working  hard behind the scenes to encourage the legitimate disposal of tyres through  licensed dealers and to prevent further fires.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">When education and encouragement fail, officers in the NIEA  environmental crime unit can, and do, take enforcement action. The  environmental crime unit has investigated and prosecuted a number of cases,  including the illegal disposal and burning of tyres. The most recent conviction  was secured in Newry on 20 September.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his answer. Does he agree that it is wrong to allow  tyre depots to collect money for the safe disposal of tyres without any  procedures, guidance or enforcement measures in place to ensure that tyres are  disposed of safely and in an environmentally friendly way? At a recent meeting of  the Committee for the Environment, it seemed that some of the Minister&rsquo;s  officials were not necessarily aware of methods for evidence gathering and how  best to liaise with the PSNI to gather evidence so that people involved in  disposing of and burning tyres illicitly can be prosecuted for the  environmental crime that they have committed.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I understand that it is an ongoing issue. We are  constantly looking at how we can improve work on that front. Large scale fires,  particularly the one that took place just outside Londonderry,  have drawn the public&rsquo;s attention to the weaknesses that exist. We are  certainly aware of those weaknesses; we are seeking to ensure that we can deal  with them and have a more affirmative, robust means of dealing with them.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Boylan</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his  answer. He is well aware that the Committee is considering the Waste and Contaminated Land (Amendment) Bill. Does he intend to  introduce a clause to address the issue, or does he believe that the new  protocols will address it?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: We are looking at the protocols in conjunction with  everything else in relation to how we tackle the issue. We think that there are  methods that can help. However, that is what legislation is about, and if the  Committee, or Members, think that areas can be strengthened, we will be happy  to consider amendments. If something will improve the Bill, we will be happy to  support it.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kinahan</strong>:  Is the Minister aware that approximately one third of all used tyres disappear,  often making a profit for somebody, and not necessarily the people who are  dealing with them legally?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: Yes, we are aware that many tyres for which people pay  money to be disposed of correctly are not disposed of correctly. That is an  issue of concern, and one that we wish to pursue.</p>
        <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Local Government: Legal Costs</p>
        <p class="OralAnswers-Question">2. <strong>Dr  McDonnell </strong>asked the Minister of the Environment what discussions he has had  with the local government auditor in relation to the possible misuse of  ratepayers&rsquo; money by local councils in the settlement of legal cases brought  against them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 210/11)</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I have not had any discussions with the Chief Local  Government Auditor on that matter, and it would have been inappropriate for me  to have done so in connection with any specific case. Local government auditors  are designated staff at the Northern Ireland Audit Office, and they act  independently of my Department in carrying out their audit functions on  district councils. The role of the Chief Local Government Auditor is to audit  the accounts of councils and take appropriate action when any irregularity is  found. I am confident that he has been, and will continue to be, meticulous in  fulfilling that role.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr McDonnell</strong>:  Does the Minister agree that there have been scandals involving some local  councils, which put bad behaviour and bigoted practice before good practice and  left the ratepayers to pick up the legal costs? Does he also agree that  spending money in that way must end? Does he have any ideas about how to bring  some control to local councils?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: Yes, I am aware of such practice. Newry and Mourne  District Council, for example, was reprimanded for demonstrating bigoted  behaviour in not allowing the public to use its facilities. I appreciate the  Member&rsquo;s bringing to the attention of the House the misdemeanours of that  council on that occasion. However, I am sure that it has learned from that.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>: I  declare an interest as Chairperson of the Audit Committee. I thank the Minister  for his initial answer. Had he given any other response, I would have rapped  his knuckles. Does the Minister agree that the use of public funds by any  council to take legal cases against another council cannot be justified and  should be the subject of an audit report?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: That is a matter for the Chief Local Government Auditor.  If the Member has concerns, he should draw them to his attention. In all such  matters, councils should seek to resolve their differences through the normal  channels without proceeding to legal mechanisms.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gardiner</strong>:  I declare an interest as a member of Craigavon Borough Council. Does the  Minister agree that the failure to finalise the reorganisation of local  councils under RPA meant that some councils appointed temporary members of  their staff to the senior management team, which might result in legal disputes  and a cost to ratepayers?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I do not want to get into the internal affairs of any  particular council. That is neither my role nor my responsibility. However, the  Member should be aware &mdash; if he is not, I will make him so &mdash; that councils can  legitimately employ people now. There is no ban on the recruitment of senior  officers. It may not suit some councils to do that, as they may achieve better  value for money through how they do things now. I do not know, and I have not  investigated any of those cases because that is not my role.</p>
        <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">George Best   Belfast City   Airport: Flight Times</p>
        <p class="OralAnswers-Question">3. <strong>Ms  Purvis </strong>asked the Minister of the Environment to provide a definition of a  &ldquo;special circumstance&rdquo; which would allow a flight to take place at the George Best   Belfast City   Airport outside the 21.30  time limit set out in the planning agreement; and what measures he is taking to  enforce the terms of the planning agreement.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO  211/11)</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: The 2008 planning agreement makes provision for delayed  scheduled flights during extended hours &mdash; between 9.31 pm and 11.59 pm &mdash; in  exceptional circumstances. However, that phrase has not been further defined.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The report of the examination, which was held in public in  2006 to review the planning agreement, noted that a definition of the phrase &ldquo;exceptional  circumstances&rdquo; that was acceptable to all interested parties was unlikely to be  attainable. However, although the phrase is difficult to define, we take the  view that its inclusion highlights the need to keep delayed air traffic  movements (ATMs) after 9.30 pm to an absolute minimum. That said, my Department  recently wrote to the airport seeking information about the reason for the  delayed flights and how the airport considers that those meet the terms of  &ldquo;exceptional circumstances&rdquo;.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Purvis</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his answer. Will he answer the second part of the  question and tell the House what measures he is taking to enforce the terms of  the planning agreement to protect the public interest, given that his  Department, which has powers of enforcement for legislation, has not enforced  the agreement on the seats-for-sale limit?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: With regard to the exceptional circumstances, everything  is up for consideration because there was no agreement on what that term meant.  Last year, of 39,328 flights, 360 &mdash; 0&middot;92% &mdash; came in between 9.31 pm and 11.59  pm. One per cent may be regarded as exceptional by some but not by others. It  is a relatively small proportion of the number of flights, and, given the  nature of airlines, flights out of London and all other factors, there has to  be some latitude. Less than 1% is not a significant enough figure for us to  become involved.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  Does the Minister acknowledge the fact that Belfast City   Airport is one of only  four airports in the EU that is designated a &ldquo;city airport&rdquo;? Does he also  acknowledge the fact that a European directive enables higher environmental  standards to be applied to such airports? What higher environmental standards  have been applied to Belfast   City Airport?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: The airport has to operate within certain zones. The  standards applied to it are that it operates only between 6.30 am and 9.30 pm,  and there is a limit on the number of flights at 48,000 per annum. Those are  fairly significant limitations on the airport.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">A flight regularly goes over my home after 12.00 midnight  on its way to Belfast   International Airport,  which I can hear clearly. Therefore, I understand where many people are coming  from on such issues. I am particularly sympathetic to the views of the people  in east Belfast who live closest to Belfast City Airport.  However, as with all things, there must be a balance. If Mr Beggs is suggesting  that we be punitive with Belfast City Airport,  seek to ensure that it is not a good business model and, as a consequence,  ensure that business is driven out of Northern Ireland at a time of  recession, that is not somewhere that I intend to go, and I will not take that  route with him.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  Does the Minister accept that 326 flights a year equates to a late flight every  day &mdash; with the exception of weekends &mdash; at the airport? Does he also accept that  that should amount to an exceptional breach of the licence? What steps will he  take to enforce the terms of the licence?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: If there are 100 flights a day and one flight is late,  that may not be deemed wildly significant. I encourage the Member and the whole  House to keep their rationale. There is an issue, particularly for the people  in east Belfast,  whom Ms Purvis represents.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  It is also an issue for people in south Belfast.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I have considerably less sympathy for the people of south Belfast, because I happen to live under a flight route for  Belfast City  Airport and Belfast International   Airport. I know what it  is like to have a lot of air traffic over my home, whether that is in the  morning or at night, and it does not particularly perturb me.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In east Belfast,  the planes are flying really low for landing, so I can fully understand where  Ms Purvis&rsquo;s constituents are coming from. Therefore, we will try to achieve a  balance. The restrictions to limit flights at 48,000 and operating hours to  between 6.30 am and 9.30 pm will remain in place. We have no intention of  removing them. I can give that assurance to the local community of east Belfast.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Question 4 has been withdrawn.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">14.45 pm</p>
        <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Single Waste Authority</p>
        <p class="OralAnswers-Question">5. <strong>Mr  McLaughlin </strong>asked the Minister of the Environment how many of the 26 local  councils objected to or supported his Department&rsquo;s proposal for a single waste  authority. &nbsp;(AQO 213/11)</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: In April 2009, my Department consulted on the need for,  and timing of, a single waste disposal authority for Northern Ireland. Some 14 councils  responded directly to the Department. Of those, two opposed the Department&rsquo;s  proposal and one supported it. The remaining 11 councils suggested amendments  to the Department&rsquo;s legislative proposal.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The three waste management groups that carry out waste management  functions on behalf of their constituent councils also responded to the  consultation. The North West Region Waste Management Group, which comprises  seven councils, commented that its constituent councils did not believe that  there was any need for a single waste authority in Northern Ireland once current  procurement exercises had been completed. The Southern Waste Management  Partnership, SWaMP 2008, which comprises eight councils, suggested that the  Department&rsquo;s proposals should be developed for one or more waste disposal  authorities. It also stated that its members were adamant that there should be  no single waste disposal authority, although one of SWaMP 2008&rsquo;s constituent  councils had previously expressed support for the Department&rsquo;s proposal. The  response from arc21, which comprises 11 councils, suggested that the Department  should legislate for discretionary powers that would enable groups of councils  to voluntarily establish a waste disposal authority on a subregional basis.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his full and detailed reply. Will he give us a similar  analysis of the responses of the 26 councils to the proposal for a single  business organisation?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: That is a wholly different and separate question, and I  will give the Member an answer in writing. There seem to be Members of the  House and members of local government who are afraid of change that will bring  about real savings. The Members opposite would do well to see how they can  devise real savings, because, at a time when there will be greater austerity,  their actions will lead to job losses in the community. They are not prepared  to make difficult decisions that will bring real savings that can then be  passed on to the public through lower rates and taxes or better services. I  would prefer to deliver better services and lower rates, unlike the Members  opposite.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Givan</strong>:  The Minister has alluded to my point already. Given that the councils that make  up SWaMP 2008 were opposed to a single waste authority and that, at the  Strategic Leadership Board, Sinn F&eacute;in stated explicitly that it was opposed to  a single waste authority, how were we to derive the financial benefits to  justify moving ahead with the review of public administration?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: The problem with the review of public administration was  that we needed to spend &pound;118 million to achieve it. The additional savings were  to come from doing things like developing a single services organisation for  waste and corporate services for councils. That was clearly rejected. Sinn F&eacute;in  was opposed to those difficult decisions, so when the savings were taken away,  we were left with the option of amalgamating councils, which was going to cost  the taxpayer money. That made no logical sense to anyone. I suspect it does not  even make sense to Sinn F&eacute;in, but nonetheless, that is the line that it took.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Armstrong</strong>:  What savings have been shown to be possible through the establishment of a  single waste authority?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: Work is being done to identify the savings that can be  made. I have received a note from SWaMP 2008 asking if it can delay its  response on that matter until 18 October. Work is coming to a conclusion on  that front, and I hope that we can identify the tangible savings that could be  made and should be made and which are of benefit to the wider public but which  some people do not want to make.</p>
        <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Local Government: Waste Management and  Recycling</p>
        <p class="OralAnswers-Question">6. <strong>Mr W  Clarke </strong>asked the Minister of the Environment which local councils are  currently not meeting their targets in relation to waste management and  recycling.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 214/11)</p>
        <p class="OralAnswers-Question">13. <strong>Lord  Browne </strong>asked the Minister of the Environment what steps his Department is  taking to ensure that local councils meet their Northern Ireland Landfill  Allowance Scheme targets for the recycling of household waste.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 221/11)</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: With your permission, Mr Speaker, I propose to answer  questions 6 and 13 together.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">According to the latest available published data, all district  councils met their Northern    Ireland landfill allowance scheme (NILAS)  targets in 2008-09. Recycling targets apply to Northern Ireland as a whole but do  not apply at local council level. With the household recycling rate in 2008-09  standing at 34&middot;4%, Northern    Ireland is also on track to meet the waste  management strategy recycling target of 35% by 2010.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Department has implemented a range of interventions to  meet the targets. Those include the &pound;200 million of funding that has been  allocated to the strategic waste infrastructure programme; &pound;5 million for the  Rethink Waste capital fund; &pound;1 million annual funding for the waste and  resources action programme; and &pound;200,000 for the Rethink Waste revenue fund and  the revision of guidance and advice to local councils on their responsibilities  under NILAS.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr W Clarke</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his  response. What I am trying to get is an assurance that councils that do not  reach or exceed their targets will not be penalised through regional fines.  That is a worry for councils. Moreover, what incentives will the Minister give  to councils to exceed their targets?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: We recently introduced the Rethink Waste capital fund, for  which we identified &pound;5 million of funding, and that programme has seen  significant uptake by local authorities. The first element of the programme was  announced a few weeks ago, and we will be in a position to announce the next  portions of grants in the very near future. That money will be spent before  this financial year is out. Local government has the funding. It recognises  that it needs to recycle, and, by and large, local councils are stepping up to  the plate.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Given that we reached a household recycling rate of 34&middot;4%  in 2008-09, I am confident that we will well exceed the 35% target by 2010, so  the imposition of fines on any council will not be an issue. Albeit, the Member  makes a fair point: some councils need to do more, and we will continue to  encourage those councils to do more. The fact that many of the figures are in  the public domain creates a league of shame for councils at the bottom of the  table. I would not want to be a member of the Strabane or Belfast councils at the bottom of the table.  I would much prefer to be a member of the Antrim or Banbridge councils at the  top of the table.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>: I  was interested to hear the Minister&rsquo;s comments. He is quite right. What  conclusions can be drawn from the variation in recycling figures among the  different local authorities in Northern    Ireland? Is there any method of waste  collection that produces higher recycling results?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: Some councils have simply taken the bull by the horns, so  to speak, and decided that recycling is the way to go. They are to be  commended.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">As for means of recycling, some councils use kerbie boxes,  and the quality of the recycling material is generally better and has a higher  end value. However, it is easier for the general public to use mixed recycling  schemes, which are still quite successful. The North West Region Waste  Management Group suggests mixing five different materials in its bins, and that  is for that group to determine. I do not know which is the best way or the  perfect way to recycle. All that I can do is encourage councils to continue to  work on it.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I said before that I believe that not only can we meet the  50% recycling target by 2020, we can exceed it. If that is the case, perhaps we  can drive down the costs of the infrastructure fund that is required for energy  recovery, and instead of having to spend &pound;200 million of capital from central  government and &pound;400 million from local government, we can drive down those  costs by recycling more.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  Will the Minister outline any discussions that he has had with the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment about businesses that could be established in the recycling market?  Obviously, one incentive is that there has to be an endgame for recycled materials.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I think that one of the key companies is actually in the  Member&rsquo;s constituency. Cherry Polymers is in Annaghmore, which is, I think,  just about in her constituency. Huhtamaki is in the Member&rsquo;s constituency; it  supplies 50% of the egg boxes used in the United Kingdom and recycles a huge  amount of paper. There is also Quinn Glass, which recycles glass. A lot of  materials that are selected for recycling in Northern   Ireland are recycled in Northern Ireland. Let me dispel the  myth that there are no organisations recycling materials in Northern Ireland and that it is all being  shipped off to China.  Much of it is being dealt with here.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I have recently visited companies involved in recycling  building waste: McKinstry Skip Hire and Wright Recycling. They are moving  towards 95% recycling of building materials. Much good work is being done at a  local level, not just in the public sector but in the private sector.</p>
        <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Planning Applications: Charges</p>
        <p class="OralAnswers-Question">7. <strong>Ms S  Ramsey </strong>asked the Minister of the Environment if there is a cap on the  amount that Planning Service charges for commercial planning applications.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 215/11)</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: The Planning (Fees) (Amendment) Regulations (Northern Ireland)  2010 came into force on 4 October 2010. The general effect of the regulations  will be to increase fees by approximately 2&middot;9%. The fee payable for an  application for industrial, commercial, community and other buildings, other  than dwelling houses or buildings covered by category 3 in the schedule to the  regulations, is &pound;237 where no floor space is created, or &pound;237 for every 75 sq m  subject to a maximum of &pound;11,834.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat. We have been talking about social economy and  kick-starting the economy. Does the Minister&rsquo;s Department have any plans to  reduce those fees for community-based projects?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: We are looking at fees. Members regularly complain to me  about the loss of planning officers as a result of the downturn. It is believed  that we could raise an additional &pound;2 million to &pound;4 million by amending the  planning fees.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Before any Member gets into a blind panic, what we are  looking at are things like the North/South interconnector; a few thousand  pounds was paid for that planning fee. The planning fee for the bridge over the  River Foyle was some &pound;237, yet I recently spoke to a farmer who paid almost  &pound;10,000 to lodge a planning application for a farmyard. If someone wanted to  build 1,000 houses, the maximum fee would be just over &pound;11,000. All in all, the  planning fees that we have are not fit for purpose. They need to be amended;  that is in the public interest. Those proposals will be coming before the House  in the not too distant future.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  Is the Minister&rsquo;s Department considering linking genuine job creation potential  to an appropriate reduction in the planning fees for commercial applications?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: When we look at those regulations, the Floor will be open  to Members&rsquo; suggestions. One suggestion to help economic development is  charging for the pre-application discussion scheme. That may be something that  we make available to smaller applicants as well, so that people get good advice  from the Planning Service prior to lodging an application, the result being  that they get a quicker decision and spend less money identifying the right  solution for their particular need.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Campbell</strong>:  The Minister has just mentioned a review of charges for planning applications.  Will his Department bear in mind a sense of proportionality so that small  applications will entail a smaller price and larger applications will have a  price that is, not horrendous, but at least relative to the commercial  propriety of the application?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: The direction we intend to take would be to remove  planning applications from some of those smaller projects. We are looking at  removing the need for planning approval for porches and single-story extensions  and things like that, and simply using the building control exercise to ensure  that everything is done to a proper quality. A lot of planning applications are  not necessary, and we want to weed a lot of them out.</p>

        <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Electricity Interconnector</p>
        <p class="OralAnswers-Question">1. <strong>Ms Lo </strong>asked  the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment what progress has been made on  the extension of the North/South electricity interconnector.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 224/11)</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment (Mrs Foster)</strong>: As highlighted in the recently published strategic  energy framework, investment in and the strengthening of the electricity  network is absolutely essential. The new North/South interconnector is a key  element of that. NIE applied for planning approval in December 2009 for the Northern Ireland  section of the new interconnector. To ensure that public concerns are  considered fully, my colleague Minister Poots wrote to the Planning Appeals  Commission to request a public local inquiry. Further progress on that very  important strategic project is dependent on the outcome of that inquiry.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: I  thank the Minister for her reply. It is a very good project that will probably  benefit all consumers, north and south of the border. We very much support the  project. Why did the planning application for the interconnector have to be  resubmitted?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment</strong>: The planning  application in respect of the Northern Ireland  section was not resubmitted, but the planning application in the Republic of Ireland had to be withdrawn. It may not  yet have been resubmitted, but there were certainly some technical  difficulties. However, the planning application for the Northern Ireland  section of the interconnector is still live.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>: I  know that there has been a bit of controversy about underground and overground  cabling. As an engineer, I know that risks are associated with both. There are  huge risks with putting it underground. That would have immense cost  implications. Will the Minister outline what those may be?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: There has certainly been a very big debate about whether to  have overground or underground cabling. As energy Minister, my duty is to  ensure that the consumers have access to a reliable electricity supply and that  the line will burden electricity customers in Northern Ireland only with costs  that are strictly necessary. I am sure that the whole House wants me to ensure  that consumers do not receive increased bills because of unnecessary burdens.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">NIE published a report by PB Power that compared the cost  of the cable options. It indicated that, on 2009 prices, building the line  overhead could cost some &pound;760,000 a mile, compared with an estimated cost of  &pound;5&middot;6 million a mile for an underground line. I know that those who are  campaigning for an underground line for the interconnector dispute those  figures and say that there is too much of a differential. However, there always  will be a differential between an underground and overground line. We have to  consider that very carefully because, as I said, I will burden consumers here  only with what is strictly necessary.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kinahan</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her answer. We all know that the grid in Northern Ireland  needs to be reinforced to take additional loads from renewable energy sources,  but has that demand been factored into the costs of the interconnector? Who  will pay the costs involved?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: That is part of the work that we are doing at the moment in the  strategic energy framework. We are setting out very clearly the costs going forward,  part of which will be the capital expenditure in respect of the interconnector.  Of course, we cannot settle that until we know the situation regarding  underground or overground cabling. I will resist making the Wombles remark  again, Mr Deputy Speaker.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. The Minister will be aware from a  previous Adjournment debate of the very real concerns that people who live  along the route of the interconnector from Moy to Meath have in relation to  health, visual and environmental impacts and the tourism industry.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the Environment Minister&rsquo;s decision to hold a  public inquiry into the application. The Minister has said that, on figures  from NIE &mdash;</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: A question, Mr Bradley; ask a question.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  If you give me the opportunity, I will ask the question.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I have given you the opportunity to ask the question, Mr Bradley.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Bhuel, seo &iacute; an cheist mar sin.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister said that the figures she received from NIE  show overheading to be the cheaper option. Will she take into consideration the  other studies that she mentioned, which show that, over a longer period,  undergrounding works out cheaper.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: We await the translation of that bit in the middle of the  question, Mr Deputy Speaker. We are not clear what was said. However, as I have  clearly said, significant technical issues and costs are associated with  placing high-voltage electricity cables underground. I hear what the Member has  to say in relation to public concerns about environmental and health issues. I  hear those messages very clearly, and he knows that I have met people along the  route. The line must and will meet current safety standards. I hope that all  those concerns will be addressed in the public inquiry.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  What is the Minister&rsquo;s view on the proposed sale of parts of NIE to ESB and of  any potential investment that would come from that sale?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: My concerns about the proposed acquisition of NIE by ESB are  well documented. In early summer, I had discussions with ESB and the Republic&rsquo;s  Energy Minister at that time, principally to talk about the importance of  maintaining existing NIE jobs, of NIE continuing to operate as a separate  entity in Northern Ireland  and to seek assurances that there would be local representation on any ESB  board.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The transaction between NIE and ESB is entirely a  commercial matter between two private companies. I have received assurances  from both a commercial and a departmental perspective. However, I have to say  that I remained uncomfortable at a political level in respect of the matter,  and I spoke to the First Minister about it. After that, as the Member will be  aware, a joint letter was issued by the First Minister and the then leader of  the Ulster Unionist Party. It is a commercial decision that lies outside of  government. However, the UK Office of Fair Trading is still scrutinising the  proposed transaction, and, as I said on 7 July, I continue to keep a close  watch on the situation.</p>
        <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Gas (Applications for Licences and  Extensions) Regulations (Northern    Ireland) 1996</p>
        <p class="OralAnswers-Question">2. <strong>Mr Cree </strong>asked the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment to outline the result of the recent consultation on the amendment to  the Gas (Application for Licences and Extensions) Regulations (Northern Ireland)  1996.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 225/11)</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: The public consultation ended on 7 September 2010 and seven  submissions were received. No objections were raised. All respondents were  broadly content and agreed that the proposed amendments were necessary to  ensure compliance with the EU services directive. A decision note on the  outcome of the consultation is available on the DETI website. The regulations  came into effect on 30 September 2010.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>: I  thank the Minister for her reply. Will she explain why there was such a delay  in promoting the legislation that it breached the 21-day rule, despite the EU  services directive being dated 2006?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: The Department breached the 21-day rule to avoid infraction  procedures. The Member will ask why it was not brought in before that. I will  explain. The possible need for an amendment to the Gas (Applications for  Licences and Extensions) Regulations (Northern   Ireland) 1996 to remove the requirement for a company  applying for a gas licence to provide a point of contact in Northern Ireland  for the duration of the application process was initially raised by the Utility  Regulator in autumn last year. The Department sought legal advice on the issue  from the Departmental Solicitor&rsquo;s Office, which indicated that the gas  regulations were, arguably, already compliant and did not require a company to  be established in Northern    Ireland for that purpose. Based on that  advice, work on the amendment was not taken forward.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">However, at a later stage, the UK Department for  Business, Innovation and Skills insisted that the change be made, and we moved  quickly to do so. I recognise the Member&rsquo;s frustration, but the decision was  based on the fact that we believed that we were already covered in that  respect. The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills is the ultimate  arbiter on European matters, and it insisted that we make the change. I thank  members of the Committee for working with me in that regard.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms M Anderson</strong>: Go raibh  m&iacute;le maith agat. Is the Minister aware of the widespread concern that gas may  not become an available energy option in the north-west due to the failure to  extend the licence to build a network there?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment</strong>: The Member will know  that, in general, I am in favour of rolling out the natural gas network not  just to the north-west but across Northern Ireland. Recently, I  received the results of a study commissioned by the Department and the Utility  Regulator into the technical and economic feasibility of extending the natural  gas network to not only the north-west but to the generic west of Northern Ireland.  The results are extremely interesting, and they will be used by DETI and the  Utility Regulator to consider how best to take forward new gas infrastructure  to areas with sufficient gas loads and to where large infrastructure  investments of that nature are deemed to be economically viable. It is also  hugely important to consider the views of the gas industry on any gas network  extension and on the whole area of mutualisation, which needs to be taken  forward as well.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Anderson</strong>:  What is being done to create more competition in areas that are currently held  and operated by Firmus Energy?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: We are looking at opening up the areas operated by Firmus  Energy to competition, but we need to look at the pricing implications of that  on companies that are currently with Firmus Energy. Furthermore, as I said in  relation to electricity prices, I must ensure at all times that both domestic  and business consumers get the best value for money.</p>
        <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">EU State Aid</p>
        <p class="OralAnswers-Question">3. <strong>Dr  Farry </strong>asked the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment for her  assessment of the impact of the anticipated changes in EU state aid rules.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 226/11)</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: The European Commission has still to indicate how it wants to  change the state aid rules after 2013, so it is not possible to assess the  impact of any changes now. We expect the European Commission to start  consulting with member states later this year or early in 2011. Of course, I  will make the case for the best deal for the Northern Ireland economy.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  thank the Minister for her answer. In light of the inevitability of some  changes, what contingency plans have the Minister&rsquo;s Department and Invest  Northern Ireland put in place to ensure that resources can be redeployed to  other areas in order to support the local economy?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: As the Member will be aware, the matter was raised in the  independent review of economic policy, which stated that the impending state  aid rule closure post-2013 means that we should be moving towards innovation  and research and development. That is still the view. However, following the  review, I took the view that I need selective financial assistance (SFA) as a  tool in my box when I am trying to get investors to come to Northern Ireland.  I still hold that view. SFA is a useful tool; indeed, some of the investments  that we have been able to secure recently have been based on the fact that we  can give quite generous amounts of SFA. I know that next year the percentage of  SFA available will drop considerably, but I will be arguing that, given the  recessionary period in which we have been, we will need to continue to have SFA  post-2013.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her reply. I ask the Minister to make strenuous  efforts to retain financial assistance for businesses in Northern Ireland,  because, hopefully, we are moving out of recession.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">When we move out of recession, we will need every  assistance that we can get. If we do not make the strongest possible case to  the European Commission, we will be bereft of that tool to which the Minister  referred. I hope that she will do that.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment</strong>: I agree with the  Member, and we will make the strongest possible case to Europe  in respect of SFA. As was stated in a recent independent review by Ernst and Young, Northern Ireland  has become second only to London  as an attractive place for foreign direct investment. I want to be able to continue  with that, and Members will know that part of that is about rebuilding, which  we are currently doing, and another part is about rebalancing the Northern Ireland  economy. The Finance Minister and I are currently working with the Treasury on  a paper that Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government will bring forward on rebalancing the  economy. We will wait to see what comes forward in that on corporation tax,  research and development grants or tax credits, and training credits or tax  relief. If SFA is to slowly go away, we will need to look to other mechanisms  to get standout for this region to ensure that we continue to get the sort of  FDI that came to Northern    Ireland on Friday and Monday of this week.</p>
        <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">West Belfast  and Greater Shankill Task Forces</p>
        <p class="OralAnswers-Question">4. <strong>Mr  Adams </strong>asked the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment to outline her  commitment to the full implementation of the West Belfast  and Greater Shankill Task Force, in light of the deprivation index published in  May 2010.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 227/11)</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: Considerable progress has made against the issues that were  identified in the task force&rsquo;s 2002 report. Some &pound;20 million was allocated for  projects that are specific to west Belfast  and the greater Shankill, and 16 out of the 17 of those projects have been or  are in the process of being implemented. Those include a &pound;7 million education  initiative to address educational under-attainment in the area and a pilot  social economy fund, which aims to provide an opportunity of work experience  and personal development in a social enterprise environment. I have also issued  a draft Executive paper outlining options on the way forward for the task force  initiative, and I await a response from colleagues, which will allow the issue  to be discussed by the Executive.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Adams</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat. T&aacute; m&eacute; bu&iacute;och den Aire. I thank the Minister for her answer.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister will recall that, before the summer, she and I  had a positive discussion about the realignment of the task force under OFMDFM.  In May 2010, the deprivation index located six out of the 10 areas of most  social deprivation in the Shankill and west Belfast.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Ask a question, Mr Adams, please.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Adams</strong>:  Does the Minister agree that there is now an urgent need for a renewed commitment  by the Executive to refresh and implement fully the task force report?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: As I indicated to Mr Adams at that meeting, I had put forward a  draft Executive paper in 2009. That paper details a number of options for  taking the initiative forward, one of which is to transfer responsibility for  the initiative to OFMDFM. When the paper comes to the Executive, it will be a  matter for the Executive to decide.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Campbell</strong>:  Does the Minister agree that that project, worthwhile as it is, is probably  symptomatic of many problems in working class areas across Northern Ireland?  Does she agree that the Executive and the Assembly probably need to examine  more closely areas of high deprivation and unemployment where there are people  without hope for the future and to try to identify mechanisms whereby we can  bring hope for the future to them, not only for the present generation but for  future generations in areas where unemployment has been endemic for many years?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: I am hopeful that, when the paper comes to the Executive,  looking at the wider issues surrounding generational unemployment will be the  exactly the sort of conversation that we will have. Although we continue to  bring high-value jobs to Northern Ireland,  I am not blind to the fact that the unemployment statistics for Northern Ireland  keep rising. Therefore, there is a fundamental difficulty, and it is a  difficulty about which I have been having discussions with the Minister for  Employment and Learning and at which Invest Northern Ireland has been looking  carefully to try to think of imaginative ideas, including the involvement of  social economy partners, to deal with generational problems of unemployment and  with people who are finding it more and more difficult to find work in these  difficult times.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I welcome the fact that the Minister will look at that on a much wider basis  than just west Belfast,  although I understand its particular need, given the number of wards of  deprivation in the area.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Did I hear the Minister correctly when she said that the  paper has been with the Executive since 2009? Does she have any idea whether it  has been discussed in the Executive? What is the hold-up in bringing it  forward?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: I am simply waiting for the matter to come on the agenda. I am  also waiting for outstanding comments from a number of Departments: the  Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety; OFMDFM; and one other  Department, the name of which I cannot think of at the moment. However, I am  keen to have a discussion around the Executive table to try to take matters  forward, not only in west Belfast but, as the Member for East Londonderry Mr  Campbell indicated, in other areas where there is great deprivation.</p>
        <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Banking: Businesses</p>
        <p class="OralAnswers-Question">5. <strong>Mr  McElduff </strong>asked the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment to outline  any discussions her Department has had with local banks in relation to the  problems faced by the business sector in the current economic downturn.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 228/11)</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment</strong>: Last year, I initiated a series of  meetings with the main local banks to discuss their contribution to helping  Northern Ireland companies weather the recession and, in particular, how  greater use could be made of the UK Government&rsquo;s enterprise finance guarantee  scheme. Since then, my officials and I, in liaison with the Minister of Finance  and Personnel and his officials, have maintained regular contact with the banks  and ensured that specific problems raised by businesses and, indeed, their  political representatives have been brought to the banks&rsquo; attention. I intend  to hold further meetings with the banks this autumn.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her answer and for her ongoing efforts. Has she read  the damning critique of local banks by our Church leaders, who have spoken  collectively of the despair faced by small-business owners at this time of  economic downturn? How can we bring maximum pressure to bear on local banks so  that they adopt a more flexible and caring approach to the business sector at  this time?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: I am certainly aware of the very real issues that were raised.  I welcome the fact that Church leaders were given an opportunity to raise those  issues before a Committee and make known the sorts of pressures that they are  dealing with among their parishioners and flocks.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Having spoken to me about individual businesses, the Member  knows that we have very few tools with which to make the banks deal with  businesses in a certain way. I have said in the House many times that, when we  go to them, the banks tell us that they are lending, open for business and want  to do business. However, people come to our constituency offices, across Northern Ireland,  to tell us that they are coming under pressure because of overdraft limits and  renewal fees, and because the banks will not support them with their bills for  HMRC and other agencies. Therefore, there is a disconnect, and that is  something that we will continue to try to deal with. I have already indicated  to officials that, following my recent discussions with people from the social  economy sector, I want to speak to the banks again. There is a need to renew  those contacts.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s commitment to keeping the pressure on the banks as  much as she can during this difficult time. Another major part of the problem  is how jobs are dealt with. Will the Minister detail the work that Invest NI  has been doing to try to safeguard and create jobs?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: It is important that businesses have knowledge of what is  available to them. At the beginning of the recession, I asked Invest NI to be  more forward-facing with clients, as well as with non-clients. We produced on  the website nibusinessinfo.co.uk a table of the support that is available to  SMEs, and we have worked with councils and local chambers of commerce. We also  had the short-term aid scheme, which we launched to allow companies to retain  specific skills so that, when the upturn comes, those skills will be ready and  available.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We also provided the accelerated support fund, which  allowed businesses to avail themselves of free diagnostics of their  difficulties, and we established that fund to try to work with those  businesses. Therefore, I hope that Members acknowledge that Invest Northern  Ireland has been working alongside businesses during the recession and has been  trying to assist them in whatever way it can.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Savage</strong>:  Does the Minister support the Treasury document &lsquo;Financing a private sector  recovery&rsquo;? Is she satisfied that the Irish banks operating in Northern Ireland  can compete with other banks that are under separate control?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment</strong>: I have often said  that part of our difficulty in Northern    Ireland is that we do not have our own  banks. Two of the banks are Irish owned. The Ulster Bank is really a subsidiary  of the Royal Bank of Scotland,  and the Northern Bank has Danish headquarters. Part of the difficulty,  therefore, is that we are not the masters of our destiny when it comes to our  local banks. The Republic of Ireland&rsquo;s economy is facing huge difficulties at this  point in time, and I said recently that we do not live in a vacuum and that we  in Northern Ireland  will feel the cold wind of those difficulties. Part of that will probably be  connected to the two Irish banks.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle; thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. The  Minister mentioned what seems to be the two planes of reality that exist:  first, what we are being told in our constituency offices about overdraft and  renewal fees, and secondly, what the banks seem to be saying about those fees.  I think that it is a misnomer to call them local banks, because that is the  last thing that they are. They may be situated locally, but they mainly have  overseas owners. Therefore, at the Minister&rsquo;s next meeting with the banks, will  she add one other item to that list and ask them to ease up a wee bit on  lending to first-time buyers? That is a major issue and obstacle, and it must  be addressed to help to regenerate and support the construction industry at  this time.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: Part of the difficulty is that, five years ago, people were  able to access mortgages for somewhere in the region of 120% of the value of  their house. That is because the pendulum had swung so far in one direction.  That was a hugely dangerous way to go. When I was a conveyancing solicitor, I  remember wondering why people would not buy a house if they were getting a 120%  mortgage. We are now in a situation where young people and, indeed, first-time  buyers of every age, are finding it hugely difficult to get any sort of a  mortgage. I absolutely sympathise with them. However, that is a consequence of  and a direct reaction to what happened before. Nevertheless, I am certainly  happy to raise that issue with the banks.</p>
        <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Northern Ireland Tourist Board</p>
        <p class="OralAnswers-Question">6. <strong>Mr  Givan </strong>asked the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment for her assessment  of whether the Northern Ireland Tourist Board is the most efficient body to  promote tourism.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 229/11)</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: The draft tourism strategy, which I will be taking to the  Executive shortly, sets out my vision for the tourism sector up to 2020. It  includes some ambitious targets for visitor numbers and spend. The strategy  sets outs clear roles and responsibilities for the organisations and bodies  that are involved in delivering for tourism so that fragmentation across the  sector can be addressed and efficiency, therefore, increased.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Northern Ireland Tourist Board will have a critical  role to play in the delivery of the strategy. It will build on the recent  success of its award-winning marketing campaign to attract visitors from the Republic of Ireland, and it will build on the work  that it is doing to deliver the five signature projects.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Givan</strong>: At  a time when we are facing austere measures, does the Minister agree that the  Executive should be looking fundamentally at all quangos and non-departmental  public bodies, including the Northern Ireland Tourist Board, that could be  amalgamated or brought back into the Department if that were a step that could  deliver efficiency while still driving forward delivery? Does she agree that  that measure should be given serious consideration?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: Every Minister should be looking seriously at all the matters  that the Member raised. Some of the boards in question are quite heavily  populated and have 12 to 15 members. Therefore, we need to ask ourselves  whether those boards are fit for purpose and whether we need such big boards. I  know that the coalition Government have indicated that they are looking at a  long list of quangos.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName">Indeed, there has been press speculation about  VisitBritain, which is the equivalent of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.  The issue is being looked at nationally, and it would be remiss of us not to do  the same here in Northern    Ireland.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">3.30 pm</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Motion made:</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">That the Assembly do now adjourn. &mdash; [Mr Deputy  Speaker.]</p>
        <p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="g"></a>Adjournment</p>
        <p class="H4StageHeading">Promotion of the Bront&euml; Homeland Interpretive Centre</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The proposer of the topic for debate will have 15 minutes in which  to speak. All other Members who wish to speak will have approximately six  minutes.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I hope that that is not a sign that everybody is leaving the Chamber. It is  good to see colleagues from the South Down constituency here. Margaret Ritchie  and P J Bradley are at a function in Dublin  and apologise for their absence. I declare an interest as I live in the Bront&euml;  homeland area. Various sites around the original Bront&euml; homestead are on the  tourist trail and close to where I live. Those include Glascar Church,  where Patrick Bront&euml; taught school and Alice McClory&rsquo;s cottage, where Patrick  Bront&euml;&rsquo;s mother lived. It is a beautiful part of the south Down countryside.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Bront&euml; homeland is an undervalued part of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  rich cultural heritage. Sometimes, we are defined here by our cultural and  historical divisions. In fact, our part of south Down and the history of the  Bront&euml; homelands have made a huge contribution to English literature, and the  whole family background has had a massive cultural impact throughout these  islands and across the English-speaking world.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">There are several things that we need to do to promote the  area. We need to find out whether we can attract more visitors to the area to  make businesses there more viable. We must also ensure that we promote the  Bront&euml; homeland area, so that when tourists come to Northern   Ireland they do not stay in Belfast. Tours  should be organised to bring people to the area, not only to the Bront&euml;  homeland but to the other attractions in South Down and beyond, whether that is  retail at the OUTLET in Banbridge, the history of the linen trail at the Irish  Linen Centre and Lisburn Museum or the Mourne  Mountains and Newcastle. The Tourist Board must think along  those lines and ensure that we build on the numbers who travel beyond Belfast to visit the area  and enjoy that type of heritage.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The facilities are in place, and, with modest investment,  we could build on what we have and ensure that people know about the connection  with the Bront&euml; heritage. We must also look at how we link in with Bront&euml;  country in Yorkshire. I am interested to hear  what the Minister has to say about whether we can do anything on an east-west  basis to promote those links and ensure that people know where the Bront&euml; story  began. Most Members will agree that we have not always been brilliant at  promotion. We were not always great at ensuring that people knew, for example,  that the Titanic was built in Northern    Ireland. We must do better with Bront&euml;  country, and the best way to promote that is on an east-west basis.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Given the east-west links, I am somewhat sceptical as to  whether Tourism Ireland  provides the best mechanism for robustly promoting the Bront&euml; trail. However, I  would like much more to be done to promote the two areas and to ensure that  people know about the links with Northern Ireland. We need the  Northern Ireland Tourist Board and Tourism Ireland to campaign to bring  visitors to the area and to tell them that it is here that the Bront&euml; story  began. We need them to point out the sites of interest and the places that  people would like to visit. Think of the impact that the Bront&euml; sisters&rsquo;  writing has had across the world; there is huge interest in them. We must tap  into that if we are serious about promoting our tourism sector.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">On numerous occasions in the House, the Minister spoke  about the importance of tourism and how it is a key growth area for our  economy. We have signature tourism projects here, among which are the Mournes  and St Patrick projects. Bront&euml; country is very close to the areas covered by  those projects, and I want to see how they can work together to increase the  number of visitors.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">With modest investment, we could make a real difference.  For example, we could promote tours from Belfast  to Bront&euml; country to let people experience the culture, heritage and background  of this extraordinary family story and see where it began. That is something  that we must do to promote the area. It is such an undervalued asset. One of  the biggest criticisms of us, as a society, is that we are not good at blowing  our own trumpets about the marvellous tourist facilities, history and scenery  that we have. We must do that much better if we are to promote tourism here. We  have only to look at the numbers of people who visit Northern Ireland to see that.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We need to sell Bront&euml; country in the various parts of our  domestic market throughout the United Kingdom  and across English-speaking areas of the world, such as the USA and Canada. We need to promote the area  as a must-see for visitors who want to enjoy the rich cultural background and  literary genius of the three Bront&euml; sisters. That is why I was so keen to  secure the debate today. I am passionate about the Bront&euml; homeland not just  because I live there, get to see it every day and know the beauty of the countryside  and the richness of the heritage, but because I want to ensure that the Bront&euml;  homeland is promoted and shouted about so that others hear about it, visit it  and enjoy what we have to offer in that part of South Down.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I am grateful to other colleagues from the South Down  constituency for attending the debate. I also thank Mrs Kelly, who is a Member  for Upper Bann, for filling in for her party  colleagues. Some of Bront&euml; country is close to the Upper   Bann constituency and some Bront&euml; stuff is in the FE McWilliam  Centre on the edge of Banbridge. There are connections between the two  constituencies, and the history of linen in the area could also be tied in.  Those are the things that we need to build on.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I look forward to the Minister&lsquo;s response to see how we can  improve the number of visitors to the site and how we can make it more viable.  The more visitors we can attract to the Bront&euml; country, the more viable we make  it for small rural businesses in the area, whether craft shops or cafes, to tap  into that market. Those small businesses cannot survive without people visiting  the area, enjoying their experience and spending some of their hard-earned  money when they are there. We need to encourage that.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We have an excellent resource, so let us build on it and  promote it. We need to steadily build up the numbers of visitors to help the  economy of that part of South Down and help everyone enjoy the rich experience  of our heritage and our beautiful landscape.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>: I  support the Member for South Down Mr McCallister in his comments about the  Bront&euml; homeland drive. I am glad that he has managed to attract no fewer than  eight MLAs to the debate, including you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I have the  unenviable record of having attracted the smallest number to any debate at  Stormont ever. Present in the Chamber on the late evening of my last  Adjournment debate on the Ballynahinch bypass were the Speaker, the Minister,  who was Mr Robinson &mdash;</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I hope that this debate is rather more successful than the one on the  Ballynahinch bypass. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>:  Yes, indeed.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Present were the Minister, the Speaker, P J Bradley and me.  I had to write a press release for the &lsquo;Down Recorder&rsquo; and the &lsquo;Mourne  Observer&rsquo; but, as only four people had been present, I did not know what I was  going to write. I then thought up what I thought was a very good headline: Mr  Wells speaking to a hushed Assembly. That reflected the tiny numbers that were  present.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McCallister is absolutely right: the world does not end  at Carryduff. We in South Down and parts further away from the centre of  Northern Ireland&rsquo;s population face the problem mentality that, once you get  past Carryduff and head towards Ballynahinch, things change and all  civilisation ends. That is not the case. The Bront&euml; homeland drive is one of  the hidden gems of Northern    Ireland&rsquo;s tourist potential. We are  fortunate that a parish church became vacant. It has been sympathetically  converted into the Bront&euml; interpretive centre, where people can go to enjoy and  read about the great contribution that the three sisters made to the literary  heritage of Britain and the United Kingdom.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">There is an interesting parallel here. If you asked most  people on the streets of London where the  Titanic was built, they would say Southampton,  and they would be totally wrong. If you asked most people where the Bront&euml;  sisters&rsquo; literary inspiration came from, they would say Yorkshire,  and they would be wrong. In fact, the sisters grew up and learnt so much of  their writing skills in the middle of County Down.  We need to sell that asset. Literally millions of people throughout the world  are connoisseurs of Bront&euml; literature, but we seem to do so little to market  that wonderful potential.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">There is also a clear and direct link between the Bront&euml;  homeland drive and the Mourne signature project. More could be done to market  Bront&euml; through the Mourne signature project. Members who know the geography of  south Down will know that the two are linked. Some of the large amount of  resources that are quite rightly poured into the Mournes should spill over into  Bront&euml;. We could have a wonderful combination of the rugged scenery of the  Mournes and the gentler, undulating drumlin country of the Bront&euml; homeland  drive and try to encourage people to go to both.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">There is still so much to be done to propagate the  east-west link. Far too much of the talk about tourism on the island of Ireland  is &ldquo;North/Southery&rdquo;. I note, for instance, that several SDLP Members are abroad  in Dublin today  and cannot be here to contribute to the debate. We need to reinforce the  east-west links, because there is far more that links us, as a community, with  our compatriots in Scotland,  Wales and, particularly,  northern England than with  the more remote parts of the Irish   Republic. I would like to  see money put into some form of joint project. Why can the Minister not get  together with our colleagues in Yorkshire and have some joint thing and  encourage the thousands, if not millions, of people who regularly visit Bront&euml;  country in Yorkshire to move the few miles across the Channel to County Down,  where they will be made extremely welcome?</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">People do not get the complete picture of what stimulated  the Bront&euml; family to become the leading authors that they were until they  understand both the Yorkshire link and the  Rathfriland link. Those folk are missing out, so the potential is absolutely  enormous. Tourism is the world&rsquo;s largest industry. It is heavily dependent on  manpower and requires a large number of employees. Tourism offers us a chance  to get out of the recession through the increased employment opportunities that  it brings. Therefore, why not take the Bront&euml; country, which is one of our  hidden gems, and market it to the hilt? We could be very pleasantly surprised  by the way in which we could tap into the huge interest in the wonderful works  of three incredible sisters who did so much to promote English literature.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">3.45 pm</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane</strong>:  Bhuel, go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Mar Chomhalta Tion&oacute;il do  thoghcheantar Dh&uacute;n Theas, cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an deis seo le pl&eacute; a dh&eacute;anamh ar  chur chun cinn Ionad L&eacute;irithe Cheantar Bronte. As an Assembly Member for South  Down, I welcome the opportunity to discuss the promotion of the Bront&euml; Homeland  Interpretive Centre, and I thank the Member for bringing the issue to the Floor  today.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">County Down is a beautiful part of Ireland. It is  steeped in culture and history. The towns and villages of the Mournes are  exciting destinations in their own right and are good bases for discovering the  beautiful mountains of Mourne and our spectacular coastline. County Down  is synonymous with music, poetry, dance and literature. Patrick Bront&euml;, the  father of Charlotte, Emily and Anne, was born into a County Down  farming family on St Patrick&rsquo;s Day, 1777. Ireland  is renowned all over the world for our literary talent and literary figures,  such as Joyce, Beckett, Seamus Heaney, John McGahern and Maire McEntee, and the  island of Ireland is also known for the Bront&euml;  sisters. I agree with the Members who said that we need to celebrate our literary  giants.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">It is fitting that we celebrate those amazing, strong  women. It is good to see that there were so many women writers during that  time. I would hazard a guess that they were quite feminist women, and very  creative. I also agree with the Members in relation to the development of  tourism, and I agree with Jim Wells that things do not stop at Carryduff. They  do not, and, unfortunately, in the past, there was insufficient investment in  south Down and in other areas outside Belfast.  However, thankfully, we are starting to redress that imbalance.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Where I disagree with Jim Wells is that it is not just men  who are involved in the tourist industry. There are many women in it as well.  Tourism is very important for men and women. The tourist industry can be a key  driver of job creation throughout south Down, in the Mournes, and along our  beautiful coastline. We need to maximise those outstanding assets, particularly  in areas that have traditionally been neglected and ignored. We need to develop  our accommodation sector. Anyone who works in the tourism sector understands  the importance of spend, and the biggest part of spend is overnight spend.  There is no point in just bussing tourists into south Down for the day to have  a bite of lunch and then leave. That is no good. We need to ensure that they  have overnight stays. For that to happen, we need to develop the proper tourism  infrastructure, including B&amp;Bs, hostels and hotel accommodation. When Newry  and other parts of the North of Ireland got new hotels, it was the making of  them.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Bront&euml; homeland is one of a number of unique assets  that we have, and, if properly promoted, it can attract new visitors to the  area. That requires a more coherent marketing strategy, integrated with other  local attractions and events, which is properly resourced and funded by the  Tourist Board and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment. Iarraim  ar an Aire Fiontar, Tr&aacute;d&aacute;la agus Infheist&iacute;ochta strait&eacute;is aonair marga&iacute;ochta  turas&oacute;ireachta a fhorbairt le ceantar dheisceart an D&uacute;in agus na contaetha at&aacute;  in aice leis ar an d&aacute; thaobh den teorainn a chur chun cinn. Ba choir go mbeadh  ceantar Bronte, chomh maith leis na h&aacute;iteanna eile m&oacute;rsp&eacute;ise, ina ngn&eacute;ithe  t&aacute;bhachtacha den strait&eacute;is seo.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I urge the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment to  develop a single tourism marketing strategy for the promotion of south Down and  neighbouring counties North and South of the border. It is very important that  we develop our natural hinterlands, which are south of the border. There is a  huge market for us south of the border, and it is a bit worrying when  representatives from my constituency say that they do not want to develop the  North/South aspect. We need to develop the North/South aspect and the  British-Irish aspect. We want visitors from all parts of this island and from England, Scotland,  Wales  and further afield.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">What we need to do is to develop trails. Every year,  thousands of people from all over the world come to Newgrange, and we need to  ensure that their buses do not turn around at Newgrange and go back to hotels  in Dublin.  Trails must be developed.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Every year, thousands of people from all over the world  visit Newgrange. We need to ensure that their buses do not turn around at  Newgrange and take them back to their hotels in Dublin. The Assembly must ensure that the  Mournes area is opened up from Newgrange onwards by developing the cultural  tourism potential of Newcastle,  Ballynahinch and all of the coastal towns such as Ardglass, Killough and  Ballyhornan, in a way that befits the area&rsquo;s beautiful coastline. I urge the  Minister to support that very good initiative. I thank the Member who brought  the topic to Assembly.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I am sure that the Minister, who is a Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone,  will be concerned to learn that the world ends at Carryduff. If South Down is  in difficulties, God knows what will happen to Fermanagh and South Tyrone.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I am grateful to the Member for bringing the topic to the  Chamber. Upper Bann has an interest in the  establishment and promotion of the tourism trade that is connected to the  Bront&euml; homeland. I want to place on record our gratitude to Banbridge District  Council and, indeed, to Newry and Mourne District Council. They have taken the  initiative and invested heavily over the years to establish the interpretive  trail and to promote the Bront&euml; homeland when there was absence of investment  from elsewhere.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Few young girls and, I am sure, few young men who are  school students of English literature do not know the stories of &lsquo;Jane Eyre&rsquo; and  &lsquo;Wuthering Heights&rsquo;, among others. Those stories have had considerable impact  on many of us who have gone on to enjoy reading. There is merit in making the  story of the Bront&euml;s and, indeed, their novels more alive through linking up  with the Minister of Education to promote visits to the interpretive centre and  other locations through the curriculum.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Member for South Down Ms Ruane is quite correct to say  that the Bront&euml;s were ahead of their time. In fact, I am beginning to think  that she stole some of my lines about feminism. They were leaders in that  regard. We are aware of other female authors who had to write under men&rsquo;s names  because it was not the done thing for women to write, just as it is more  difficult for women in many aspects of life today, such as politics. It is  refreshing that the Minister is present for the debate, representing women in  as a difficult a field as writing was many years ago.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Many Members have made a number of valid points about  tourism potential. That has been well articulated. I am quite sure that the  Minister is au fait with all of that. There are examples of good practice  elsewhere. Ms Ruane referred to James  Joyce in particular. We are all aware of people who follow in the footsteps of  Joyce&rsquo;s characters, hold celebratory dinners and even an American club that  celebrates Joyce on a particular night of the year. Of course, if one looks  east-west, one sees how Rabbie Burns&rsquo;s legacy is promoted in Scotland.  Therefore, Northern Ireland  could adopt lessons from elsewhere. Of course, love of literature could be  promoted as a career option in creative industries, as well as for its tourism  potential. That could be done through the school curriculum.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Other Members have referred to how well poets, authors,  writers and artists in general have lit up difficult times and enriched  ordinary people&rsquo;s lives. They include the poets of the Irish literary revival,  such as AE Russell, who was born in Lurgan; the Bront&euml;s; the many Great War  poets, who wrote eloquently about the non-glamorous side of war and conflict;  and our Nobel laureate Seamus Heaney. Therefore, there is much to be commended  about seeking a career that will enable someone to fulfil their life&rsquo;s  ambitions and to make some money while enriching other people&rsquo;s lives, which, at  times, are difficult.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We hear much about doom and gloom and about many families&rsquo;  concerns about how they will pay their bills at the end of each week. They  wonder what 20 October will bring with regard to cuts. It is right and proper  that we not only invest in our literary talent, but use it as a model for  fulfilment across a wide range of industries and education. I join other  Members in urging the Minister and the Tourist Board to step up a gear in  relation to the promotion of the Bront&euml; interpretative trail.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  I am grateful for the opportunity to say a few words on this important subject.  Much has already been said, so I will not repeat it. I thank John McCallister  for securing the debate and bringing it to the Floor. Anything that advances  the good things that come from any part of County Down, whether it is South  Down, North Down or Strangford, will have my 100% support.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I must confess that I have not had the pleasure of visiting  the Bront&euml; interpretative centre, but I have no doubt that it is a first-class  facility with the potential to contribute significantly to the economic  development of that area in County Down. Northern Ireland has an abundance  of interesting people and places, and today we acknowledge the contribution to  society of the Bront&euml; family. I am grateful to Library staff for presenting me  with two or three pages of history on the family. I did not have that knowledge  before, but I am equipped with it now.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">It is only right and proper that our generation should  promote the Bront&euml; sisters and their family from the fair county of Down.  I pay tribute to the local authorities. I understand that Banbridge District  Council had the foresight to put the talents of the Bront&euml; family on public  display. As I understand it, the Bront&euml; sisters were born in Yorkshire,  but I could be wrong. They may have spent some time in County Down;  I am not sure whether they did, but that can be clarified. I understand that  their parents came from the tiny village   of Drumballyroney. Let me  get my head around that one, because, as Members will know, I am an ardent  supporter of the promotion and preservation of townland names. Drumballyroney  is a new one to me. It is a beautiful name, and I am sure that there is, in  fact, history connected to it, its meaning and its origin. The name of the  homeland is interesting in itself.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Patrick Bront&euml; was born in the townland of Drumballyroney,  as was his mother before him. Their ancient homes and haunts are part of the  homeland tour, which nestles in the foot of the Mournes. The Bront&euml; homeland  trust has done a wonderful job on the upkeep of the sites. I commend everyone  involved in the Bront&euml; promotion and wish them every success.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister is not a County Down woman; she is a Fermanagh  woman. I will promote County   Down from one end to the  other. There are excellent facilities from Bangor, through Ards to south Down and, I  must say, Mr Wells, beyond Carryduff. County Down  is a wonderful county with many attractions. One that springs to mind is the  Betsy Gray story, which should be told. It starts halfway between Bangor and Newtownards.  It is a wonderful story that is connected to the rebellion of 1978, I think,  and all that went on there. Some people say that it is only a story, but it is  worth pursuing. In my role as an Ards borough councillor, I have tried on  numerous occasions to join with the North Down Borough Council to get that  story on to the map, but it is not there yet. I plug that to the Minister in  her role as Minister for tourism. Perhaps, somewhere along the line, it will  come across her desk. It must be a joint initiative by the councils. Mr deputy  mayor, I look forward, I hope, to visiting the Bront&euml; homeland in the not too  distant future.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: This deputy mayor is not aware of any rebellion in 1978.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment (Mrs Foster)</strong>: I congratulate the Member who secured the  Adjournment debate. It is good that the Ulster Unionist Party is promoting  strong feminist women, and they have done that today with the Bront&euml; sisters.  Of course, the tragedy of the Bront&euml; sisters is that none of them lived past  their mid-40s, all dying relatively young, but they left a huge mark on the  literary scene in the British Isles. It is  right that we mark the fact that their father came from this area.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I will briefly set the context for my comments. The new  draft tourism strategy sets out our new targets for the tourism industry. At  present, the average daily spend per visitor in Northern   Ireland is just &pound;37, compared with an average of &pound;62<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; ">&#8729;</span>50 in the Republic  of Ireland and &pound;65 in England.  Therefore, we need more product for people to spend their money on, which means  giving more product of a different nature. Culturally, our products are  sometimes lacking, and I welcome additional cultural products being brought  forward.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">However, the tourism industry is not immune from the  economic challenges that we face, and we must clearly identify our priorities  for tourism. We have done that through the signature projects, which many  Members already mentioned. People become worried when their area of Northern Ireland  is not neatly fitted into those signature projects, but South Down is  fortunate, because it benefits from the St Patrick signature project and the  Mournes signature project. We want to tie the Bront&euml; homeland into those  signature projects and the wider scene to maximise it for visitors.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I recognise Mr McCallister&rsquo;s point about the east-west  connection. Patrick Bront&euml; left south Down and went to Yorkshire,  where he set up home with his family. I want to endorse that east-west link for  cultural tourism, because there is potential for a strong arts and cultural  link. I want to explore that; indeed, we have been exploring such links with  other literary names.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Northern    Ireland has produced, or has connections  with, some of the world&rsquo;s greatest authors, playwrights and poets, and those  connections give us a real opportunity to create and deliver unique tourism  experiences for visitors who are interested in immersing themselves in  landscapes and places that influenced those artists. One of my favourite  authors is C.S. Lewis, and the Mournes provided the inspiration for Narnia. We  should certainly try to make more of that C.S. Lewis link. It is not simply an  east Belfast  link; it is also linked to the Mournes.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">It was the farmland of County Down that Patrick Bront&euml; &mdash;  the father of Charlotte, Emily and Anne &mdash; left. He was born into a farming  family there on 17 March &mdash; that is why he was called Patrick &mdash; in 1777. When  people visit the Bront&euml; homeland, they can follow the story of Patrick Bront&euml;  and his family through the buildings that survive, including the little church  and school where he taught and preached. Patrick&rsquo;s birthplace at Alice  McClory&rsquo;s &mdash; his mother&rsquo;s &mdash; cottage at Emdale is still there at Bront&euml; Road, as is Glascar School, where Patrick taught in the  1790s.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The interpretive centre is operated by Banbridge District  Council, which promotes the centre through its website and promotional  leaflets. The centre is also promoted through the Bront&euml; homeland bus tour.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Northern Ireland Tourist Board promotes the Bront&euml;  Homeland Interpretive Centre as part of its &lsquo;Great Days Out for Groups&rsquo; guide,  an initiative designed to showcase a variety of days-out experiences available  in Northern Ireland  for group visits and the group market. That publication contains over 100  themed day-visit itineraries tailored for such groups.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">There are two such themed days in the brochure. The first  is named &ldquo;Saints and Scholars&rdquo;, which is the stronger of the two, if members do  not mind me saying so. I know that Mr McCallister mentioned the Bront&euml; homeland  and the home of discounted designer shopping. There is something not quite  right about placing the literary giants of the Bront&euml; sisters with the home of  discounted shopping. However, each to its own, as they say.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I was trying to facilitate all ladies, not just literary ones but those who  like always to look their best.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: Thank you very much, Mr McCallister. However, the stronger  proposition is the saints and scholars day, which gives an opportunity to  discover connections to famous artists and authors, and to learn about St  Patrick.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Disappointingly, the Bront&euml; Homeland Interpretive Centre  has had only 15 group visits so far this year, resulting in approximately 328  visitors. I would certainly like the Tourist Board to work closely with  Banbridge Tourist Information Centre and Banbridge District Council to see  whether we can do more to attract visitors. The centre is, of course, listed on  websites and in other guides.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I want to mention a forthcoming event, and not just because  it is in my constituency. As part of a programme in support of our literary  heritage, the Tourist Board is in discussions on the development of the  Enniskillen international Beckett festival. Samuel Beckett attended school in  Enniskillen, and that will be the world&rsquo;s first annual festival devoted to the  work of Samuel Beckett, and a celebration of his life as a young man. The  literary programme at Enniskillen, which starts in July 2012, will extend into  the whole of Northern    Ireland. We are thinking of a literary trail  starting in Fermanagh with Wilde and Beckett, moving into Down and Bront&euml;, and  probably up to Londonderry and Seamus Heaney.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">New and innovative thought is being given to how we can tie  all those links together. That is the way to do it, rather than discount  designer shopping, although I may be proved wrong. However, we should explore  the importance of our literary heritage in delivering a unique tourism  experience in Northern    Ireland, and the east-west link should be  part of that.</p>
