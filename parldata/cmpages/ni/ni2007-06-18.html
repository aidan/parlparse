		    <p class="H2DocumentDate">Monday 18 June 2007</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The Assembly met at 12.00 noon (Mr Speaker in the  Chair).</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Members observed two minutes&rsquo; silence.</p>
		    <p class="H3SectionHeading">Ministerial Statement</p>
		    <p class="H4StageHeading">Recent Flooding Incidents</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I have received notice from the Minister for Regional Development that he  wishes to make a statement on the recent flooding incidents. I remind Members  that points of order are not taken during ministerial statements or during any  questions that follow.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development (Mr Murphy)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle.  With your permission, I wish to make a statement on the flooding caused by a  period of severe weather between 12 June and 15 June 2007.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I propose to provide a brief overview of the situation,  including the prevailing weather conditions and warnings, the impacts of flooding  across the North, and the roles and responses of the many Departments and  agencies involved. I also want to comment on some of the big issues that  emerged and to set out how we plan to learn from the experience.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">At 11.19 am on Tuesday 12 June 2007, the Met Office issued  a flash warning of heavy rain for the whole of the North, valid from 1.20 pm  until 9.00 pm. The forecast was for scattered, slow-moving, heavy and prolonged  showers, some of them thundery, leading to localised torrential downpours during  the afternoon and evening, with 15 mm to 20 mm of rain possible in just a few  hours.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Further flash warnings were issued on Wednesday 13 June and  Thursday 14 June. Those warned of heavy and thundery outbreaks of rain with  some torrential <span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt; ">downpours, with up to 30 mm  to 40 mm of rain expected</span> in areas where the ground was already  saturated.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">All Departments and agencies have contingency plans to help  them prepare for, and respond to, emergencies. Once the first severe weather  warning was received, those plans were activated immediately.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Early in the afternoon of 12 June, parts of the North,  particularly east Belfast  and Omagh, <strong>experienced extremely heavy  rainfall</strong>: some 50 mm in two to four <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt; ">hours.  In those places, the quantity of rain overwhelmed</span> the drainage systems  and waterways, leading to the flooding of roads and properties. In the Derry  City Council, Cookstown District Council and Magherafelt District Council  areas, a small number of domestic properties were flooded. Overall, it is  estimated that hundreds of properties were affected.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText"><span style="letter-spacing:-.05pt; ">The volume of rain on  12 June represented a storm-return</span> period of between 94 and 240 years.  That means that we do not expect to suffer from such a downpour more than once  in every 100 to 200 years. Current drainage design criteria are sufficient for  a once-in-30-years storm.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">A large number of emergency calls were received that day.  The Fire and Rescue Service received over 400 calls in a three-hour period,  representing the busiest period in the service&rsquo;s history. Northern Ireland  Water received 1,800 calls, and Roads Service received over 300 calls. Staff  from a wide range of Departments and agencies were quickly on the ground,  working together to secure the safety of those at risk and minimising damage to  property and disruption to the community. I will highlight some of their work  and pay tribute to the front-line staff who worked so hard.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Roads Service and Northern Ireland Water were in the front  line. A major incident response regime had been initiated within Northern  Ireland Water by 3.00 pm. Teams were established in Belfast, Derry and Omagh,  and, in line with the inter-agency flood liaison protocol, contacts were  established with Roads Service and the Rivers Agency.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">At the peak of the flooding, over 100 Northern Ireland  Water staff and contractors were at the various flooded locations across the  North, checking pumping stations, placing sandbags, replacing manhole covers  and assisting in clean-up operations.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">At least 15 roads in Belfast  and Omagh were closed, with many others affected but passable with care.  Approximately 350 calls were received as a result of the Belfast incident, with 100 calls received in  the Omagh area. In total, 50 Roads Service workers and private contractor staff  were on the ground minimising damage to  property and assisting in the recovery process. Over 1,700 sandbags were supplied during the operation.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Rivers Agency also made a major contribution, deploying  staff within 45 minutes of the incident. Over 60 industrial, engineering and  administrative staff were involved, using mini-diggers and diesel pumps to  assist in operations. Over 1,000 sandbags were put to use. Rivers Agency staff  have been involved in the removal of debris obstructing watercourses and  grills. Contaminated sandbags are being collected and disposed of. Prompt  action has prevented the flooding of school property in Ballygawley and  dwellings in the Bogside.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Belfast City Council activated its emergency plan at <span style="letter-spacing:-.2pt; ">3.30 pm. It set up a major incident room and  co-ordinate</span>d a rescue and clean-up operation in conjunction with the  Fire and Rescue Service, the Police Service, Northern Ireland Water, the Rivers  Agency, Roads Service, the Social Services Agency, the Department for Regional Development&rsquo;s central claims unit,  Northern Ireland Electricity, British Telecom, the Housing Executive,  the Met Office, the Salvation Army and the Red Cross. Some five conference  calls, involving many of those organisations, took place on 12 June to ensure  that all were aware of the developing situation and to co-ordinate the response  across Belfast.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Emergency reception and advice centres were opened at Avoniel leisure centre by Belfast City  Council and on the Cregagh    Road by the Salvation Army. On Tuesday 12 June, an  initial social fund of &pound;100,000 was made available to assist those in immediate  need. That was followed by a further &pound;5 million that the Executive made  available on Thursday 14 June.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Castlereagh Borough Council and Omagh District Council were  similarly active in deploying staff to aid recovery and co-ordination,  including assistance with the evacuation of people whose homes had been  flooded. In these and the other areas that suffered flooding, meetings were  arranged to bring together those organisations involved in dealing with the flooding  incidents.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">By late afternoon on 12 June, the Housing Executive  emergency plan was fully operational and remained in operation due to the  continued heavy rain. Approximately 150 Housing Executive homes were affected.  In total, six people needed temporary accommodation.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Social Security Agency responded to flooding in east Belfast by making staff  available at the emergency unit in Avoniel leisure centre. Staff have remained  at Avoniel leisure centre and have also distributed social fund claim forms to  residents of Clara Way  and the Clarawood estate.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">On Tuesday 12 June, the Fire and Rescue Service received  over 400 calls in a three-hour period. Fire&shy;fighters attended 200 of those  calls, rescuing 32 people in Belfast and 15 in Omagh.  Appliances were dispatched from  stations outside the affected area, and high-volume pumps were used to  clear the affected buildings.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Representatives from the Belfast Health and Social Care  Trust attended the multi-agency advice centre at Avoniel leisure centre. Social  services responded in order to ensure that services to children, families and  elderly people, such as home helps, continued to be provided.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In addition to the problems caused by flooding, a number of  lightning strikes caused customers to lose their electricity supplies. Northern  Ireland Electricity mobilised nine of its 12 incident centres, and by 4.30 pm  had dispatched a senior manager to the community assistance centre at Avoniel  leisure centre to co-ordinate its activities in east Belfast. Around 7,000 customers were affected  during the day, with all but two customers being reconnected within 12 hours.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Those high levels of resources were maintained by the  agencies throughout Tuesday and Wednesday as the focus of activity moved to the  clean-up operation. At the same time, all the agencies remained on the alert  and made preparations for the further heavy rain that had been forecast,  clearing obstructions and delivering and restocking sandbags. All roads were  reported as being clear the following morning.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Northern Ireland Water is dealing with 142 requests to  assist householders with clean-up operations and the distribution of sandbags.  The Housing Executive has been engaged in repairs and clean-ups in the affected  areas. Environmental health officers from Belfast City Council have provided  advice and assistance at more than 26 streets affected by flooding. The council  has also offered support for the internal disinfection of owner-occupied homes,  and a private company is on standby for that purpose.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In Belfast,  21 crisis loan applications have been received by the Social Security Agency,  and 17 have been paid. Ten applications for community grants have been received  and paid. All claims in connection with the flooding have been processed, and  any subsequent claims will be given the highest priority. By 5.00 pm on Friday  15 June, only one claim had been received and cleared in Omagh; any further  claims received will be given the highest priority. My Department&rsquo;s central  claims unit has registered 66 compensation claims for investigation.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The multi-agency advice centre at Avoniel leisure centre  remained open, but by Thursday 14 June, there were few callers. The Belfast  Health and Social Care Trust continued to ensure that vulnerable people were  supported, including at Towell House, an old persons&rsquo; home that had been  flooded.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">On Tuesday evening, when the full scale of the flooding  became clear, the Executive decided to hold an emergency meeting to review the  response of the various agencies and identify what more needed to be done. The  Executive met at 9.00 am on Wednesday &mdash; a visible demonstration of the  difference that devolution can make when a crisis of this nature arises.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It will take some time to assess fully the effectiveness of  the overall response. What I can say now is that vehicles, materials and staff  were deployed to the worst-hit locations within a short time of the initial  severe weather warnings being received. Communications systems were able to  deal with the exceptionally high number of calls.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In Belfast,  inter-agency communication on the ground was excellent. The early assumption of  a lead role by Belfast City Council was useful. Regular conference calls were  held to co-ordinate responses, and the  multi-agency advice centre proved an invaluable focus for those affected  and for the responding agencies. The media was briefed in order to keep the  public informed about what was happening on the ground and how to access help  and assistance.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">On Thursday 14 June, the Minister of Finance and Personnel,  Peter Robinson, announced that &pound;5 million had been made available to the  Department of the Environment. That money is being used to support the work of  district councils in responding to the needs of householders who have been  affected by the floods. On Friday 15 June, the Minister of the Environment, Mrs  Arlene Foster, announced that her Department would establish a scheme under  article 26 of the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Northern Ireland)  Order 1992 to address the recent emergency. Minister Foster also announced  that, from Monday 18 June, an immediate payment of &pound;1,000 would be made  available to each seriously affected household. She is monitoring the severe  weather situation and will consider whether any further action may be needed.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive are determined to review the handling of the  emergency thoroughly in order to identify the areas in which we can do better  next time. I have no doubt that exceptional weather events will occur in the  future, and we need to be prepared to deal with them. By way of example,  widespread flooding occurred again on Friday 15 June in many locations,  particularly Belfast, Newtownards, Bangor, Comber, Lurgan,  Crossgar, Ballynahinch and Downpatrick. We are pleased to note that emergency  procedures were swiftly implemented, and front-line staff, customer-service  staff and contractors were mobilised by the Rivers Agency, Roads Service and  Northern Ireland Water. Across the three organisations, around 450 staff  provided assistance on the ground. Thousands of sandbags were distributed, and  pumps and gully-emptiers were deployed. Around 2,000 calls for assistance were  received from the public. Emergency services and district councils also  assisted.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">12.15 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The multi-agency learning and linkages developed in the  past year by the Belfast Resilience Network are proving to be invaluable in  ensuring that each agency knows its role and responsibilities during the  response to, and recovery from, an incident.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I pay tribute to, and thank, the many individuals and voluntary  agencies that came forward during the emergency to help people and to offer  their assistance by, for example, providing furniture. I am thinking  particularly of bodies such as the Salvation Army and others. Many individuals  also came forward, and I place on record our thanks to them.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In the longer term, the Belfast sewer project, which is costing over  &pound;120 million, will reduce the risk of flooding in the city centre. However, no  sewerage system can be guaranteed to prevent all possible flooding.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Before we can be satisfied that our approach to any further  flooding incident will be the best that we can deliver, we have much more work  to do. We must also consider what must be done in the longer term to ensure  that our infrastructure can cope with climate change and foreseeable weather  conditions.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I express the sympathies of the Executive &mdash; and, I am sure,  of everyone in the House &mdash; to everybody who was affected by the flooding. I  hope that people will be reassured that the Executive and all the relevant agencies  will continue to work together to keep their homes and businesses as safe and  secure as possible. Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I remind Members that they are to ask questions relating to the ministerial  statement.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Regional Development (Mr Cobain)</strong>: I also thank all the  statutory agencies and the emergency services for their work last week.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I notice that 32 claims have been made for community care  and crisis loans. I am sure that that number has risen dramatically over the  past few days. Can the Minister assure the House that sufficient funds are  available to meet that need and that making these claims will not affect  genuine claimants who may need to claim other grants later in the financial  year?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>:  May I first ask for the indulgence of Members? I will be answering questions on  behalf of several Departments and on a range of subjects that are not  necessarily under the remit of the Department for Regional Development. This  morning, I spoke to officials from all the Departments involved and asked them  to read the Hansard report of my statement and the questions put on it. If  Members feel that questions are not answered fully, or if I do not have the  answers to hand, the relevant Departments will pick up on that and respond to  Members in writing.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The emergency funds will be available to the Department of  the Environment to help councils to alleviate any hardship experienced by  householders across the North as a result of the flooding on 12 June. Payments  of &pound;1,000 will be made to householders to prevent suffering or severe  inconvenience. In addition, councils may incur expenditure on the following  activities to help people to make their homes habitable: completion of the  clean-up exercise; external clean up of streets and other public areas;  collection, retention and disposal of household contents damaged by the  flooding; assistance to private householders to clean up their homes and  gardens; advice on health and safety issues; provision of dehumidifiers to dry  out homes; and advice to householders about what help might be available from  other agencies.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The councils are compiling a database of households where  there is evidence of significant flooding, including underfloor damage in  living areas, garages or utility areas where household utilities are installed,  but excluding motor vehicles. For apartments, the database will record evidence  of flooding in basements that contain storage rooms. Only those households in  which councils can confirm suffering and severe inconvenience will qualify for  the payment. This is not compensation: it is a one-off payment.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I will ask officials from the Department for Social  Development to respond to the Member&rsquo;s question about those people who may need  to claim other grants. This one-off payment is not designed to cut across other  payments that may be available. It is intended to give assistance quickly to  those households that need it most. I am referring, for example, to those  people whose cookers, fridges and kitchen units were damaged, and to people  who, even after the clean-up exercise, cannot live in, or use the facilities  in, their homes. Helping those people is the purpose of the payment that was  agreed by the Department of Finance and Personnel and will be administered by  the Department of the Environment and the councils.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I say to people who wish to submit claims, or raise <span style="letter-spacing:-.25pt; ">concerns, through the Department for Social  Development</span> or another claims process, that the agencies involved are  committed to ensuring that all claims will be treated as matters of high  priority. I am sure that those claims and  concerns will be acted on. If the Chairperson has a specific question on how making those claims will affect  other claims made through the Department for Social Development, someone from  that Department will give him an answer.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Newton</strong>: I  join the Minister in paying tribute to all the emergency services and the  manner of their response. I pay particular tribute to the PSNI for the  effective action that it took in rescuing an 85-year-old housebound lady in my  constituency. Had the PSNI not taken such action, she would have remained in a  flooded house, unable to move.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Is the Minister satisfied that the maintenance and cleaning  of drains and gratings is being satisfactorily carried out? What action will he  take to alleviate flooding in areas where it is occurring regularly?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>: I  agree with the Member&rsquo;s comments about all the emergency services and agencies.  I also paid tribute to those ordinary citizens who offered their help and to  voluntary agencies. Everyone involved played a valuable role in helping to  alleviate people&rsquo;s hardship and suffering.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The extreme flooding that occurred on the afternoon of 12  June was not caused by a failure to maintain the operational effectiveness of  the storm gullies or road drains. The deluge that fell in two hours overwhelmed  the gullies, road drains and watercourses. The Met Office has reported that the  rainfall frequency represented a storm-return period of between 90 and 240  years. That means that we do not expect a reoccurrence more than once every 100  to 200 years.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Department for Transport design standards typically require  new road-drain systems to be designed to cope with a one-in-six-years storm.  Those design standards include an allowance for climate change. Any system that  was designed to meet current standards could not have coped with the severity  of last Tuesday&rsquo;s storm.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department for Regional Development&rsquo;s Roads Service  aims to inspect and clean, where necessary, all gullies in urban areas twice a  year. Gullies in rural areas are inspected and cleaned, where necessary, once a year. That policy, taking into account the  Department&rsquo;s finite funding and staffing levels, ensures that a  reasonable level of drain maintenance is carried out.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In Belfast,  there are some 136,000 storm-water road gullies, so a considerable resource is  needed if there is to be ongoing inspection and cleaning of the entire network of gullies and road drains. Local Roads  Service officials keep records of each  inspection. Those records note the time and date of inspection and  whether the gullies and drains are running or not running. Those not running  are identified for further jetting and investigation.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Details of recent inspections in those areas affected by  flooding in east and south Belfast are as <strong>follows</strong>:  on the Ormeau Road, gullies were inspected and cleaned as necessary in January  2007; on the Stranmillis Road, the Newtownards Road and Ladas Drive, they were  inspected and cleaned in February 2007; and in Orangefield and Clarawood, they  were cleaned and inspected in December 2006. The Roads Service has also  diverted a considerable resource to cleaning gullies in those areas over the  past few days and to removing an accumulation of debris that had been swept  into the drainage systems by the storm water. Moreover, sandbags were provided  to those affected areas after the heavy-rain-forecast alert for Friday 15 June  2007.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Preventative measures were discussed at the Ministers&rsquo;  meeting last Wednesday, and I have further discussed the matter with officials.  The heavy rain that was forecast for Tuesday 12 June was for the entire Belfast area. It was not  forecast that it would be localised or that  it would affect east Belfast  specifically. As I have said, there are 136,000 storm gullies in Belfast. Nonetheless, Roads Service and other agencies,  in the light of what happened, will look at whether a greater degree of  co-ordination can be achieved after a Met Office severe-weather warning has  been issued and examine their ability to get people on the ground in the areas  affected. I reiterate that the severe-weather warning was for Belfast  in its entirety, not only for those areas of east and south Belfast that were affected.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Resources must be applied to those areas that experience  continual flooding, and all agencies that have a responsibility for occurrences  of flooding have a duty to make the necessary improvements.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Some &pound;120 million is invested in the Belfast sewer project. It will take some time  to complete work on that project, but it will improve the system&rsquo;s capacity.  However, no system that has been designed or built could have coped with the  amount of rain that fell in such a short period in Belfast last Tuesday.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs McGill</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his  statement. Have the most vulnerable people been identified, and are the  statutory and voluntary sectors helping them? Go raibh maith agat.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>:  Councils&rsquo; involvement was important, because local government provides people  with their closest contact to elected representatives. Councils are often the  first port of call for people facing difficulties. For the purposes of deciding  who should receive share of the funding that the Executive have made available,  councils have been tasked with identifying the properties and families that are  most at risk.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Various other agencies took a range of calls &mdash; some of  which I detailed in my statement &mdash; from people who required assistance, and  they provided that assistance where possible. For example, the elderly people  who were affected by the flooding in the basement of Towell House have been  reinstated. There was, therefore, a clear priority to address the needs of  society&rsquo;s most vulnerable. That is why the Executive acted promptly to make  funding available through the bodies that were at the forefront in dealing with  a particular incident &mdash; local councils, such as Belfast City Council and Omagh District Council. The councils will  identify those people who require most assistance, and that assistance will be  provided through the Executive and the other agencies involved.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr McDonnell</strong>:  I congratulate those workers who turned out and gave sterling service during  the floods. I was impressed with what I saw. I also compliment the Housing  Executive in South Belfast, and, in  particular, its district manager Liam Kinney.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Does the Minister share my concerns that Northern Ireland  Water&rsquo;s decision to award a contract worth &pound;70 million to Crystal Alliance to  handle customer relations has not been a good idea? Is he aware that many  victims feel that they have been kicked around in a public-relations exercise?  I can only comment on experiences of my constituents. The home of one young  family &mdash; Ciaran McCreanor, his wife and infant, who live in Florenceville Drive on the Ormeau Road &mdash; was  flooded, and not from the water on the street, but from reflux from the toilet.  He was told, however, that that was an act of God. It did not strike him as so,  and he feels that those comments added insult to injury.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, people from Sunwich Street off Ravenhill Avenue called call centres in England only to  find that the operators did not have any idea what was going on here. They had  not read about it, and they were not aware of the events that were taking place  here. Perhaps the Minister will consider that. Will the Minister also tell the  House whether our rainwater drainage system could be separated from the  sewerage system? Such a separation would mean that the rainwater would flow  into, for instance, a river in the event of there being similar flooding, or  even flooding that was less heavy.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>:  Dr McDonnell and other Members will know from last Monday&rsquo;s statement that  matters relating to Northern Ireland Water&rsquo;s contract are being reviewed. The  members of the review panel have been appointed, and the review process will  start almost immediately. Following that review, Members will be able to have a  fuller discussion on the viability of the contracts awarded by Northern Ireland  Water.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Northern Ireland Water received more calls during the  crisis than any other organisation. It received 2,000 calls last week, and it  has reported that all but a small minority of those calls have been well  handled. Last Wednesday, I visited some of the households that were affected by the floods, and I appreciate their  frustration. No matter how many resources are deployed, people often  feel as if they are not being deployed directly to them, or quickly enough.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">12.30 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">That is understandable. Everyone will agree that the people  on the ground did their best to cope with very difficult circumstances. As part  of their overall review, it is the job of  the Executive to investigate why resources that could, perhaps, have  been deployed were not.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">With regard to the infrastructure, the Department will  struggle to provide the type of infrastructure that has already been earmarked for investment. In response to the Member&rsquo;s question, separating the  storm-drainage from the  sewerage would entail a much greater project, and I wish that we had the money  to do all such things, but otherwise they are not feasible. We are investing  substantially in the water and sewerage services and that will alleviate some  of the problems. However, in the case of such an intense downpour, in a  localised area, over a very short time, it is difficult for any infrastructure  to cope.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his statement, and I  support his comments on the work of the emergency services and other  voluntary sector agencies, who have been busy in the constituency over recent  days, and who continue to provide valuable support to those affected.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In his statement, the Minister commented on the wide range  of Departments and agencies that were involved in the response. During last week&rsquo;s  flooding, there was extensive damage to schools in the South Eastern and the  Belfast Education and Library Board areas. Both boards &mdash; and indeed the schools  &mdash; have responded admirably to the challenges that the damage has caused them to  face. Can the Minister assure us that his Executive colleague the Minister for  Education is now fully involved in the response to the flooding, to ensure that  the already-stretched budgets of schools and education and library boards are  not placed under further pressure, because of the actions necessary to re-open  schools as quickly as possible? I understand that the Minister was not invited  to the original emergency Executive meeting; however, I hope that, by this stage, she is involved in the ongoing  discussions on how to take this forward and on the financial  implications.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>: I  thank the Member for her question; however, we should resist the temptation to  swipe at people in the middle of a general crisis. The Minister for Education  has been involved; she was not invited to attend the special meeting of the  Executive because only those Ministers directly involved in the clean-up were  needed. </p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">With regard to the schools in Belfast, the Minister was in contact with the  chief executive of the Belfast Education and Library Board, who assured her  that the emergency plan had kicked in inside one hour. Board officials and  officials from the Department of Education were in regular contact throughout  the day to assess the damage and to organise repairs. The Department will  consider any bids for exceptional funding to cover the damage caused by the  flood. The Minister wishes me to pay tribute to school principals and to all  those involved in the clean-up at schools across the North. Their hard work  ensured minimum disruption to pupils, particularly at the start of their  examinations. All schools are now open and fully functioning, and the Education  Minister has spoken to principals at some schools that were affected, and they  are content with the boards&rsquo; emergency response.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Browne</strong>:  I appreciate that last week&rsquo;s weather conditions  which led to extensive flooding &mdash; particularly in my constituency of East Belfast &mdash; were rather unusual. I welcome the  Minister&rsquo;s statement that all of the agencies are to work together in a co-ordinated  fashion.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Has the Minister considered that flooding also took place  in the United Kingdom and  that it may be useful to engage with those authorities in the UK that had  emergency plans? To prevent such an unfortunate situation arising again in Northern Ireland,  we could learn from the plans that other organisations put into operation.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>:  The Member is correct. If there are lessons to be learned from other areas,  then I am sure that the agencies and the Executive will be happy to learn those  lessons, from wherever they come. There was severe flooding in England as that same storm system moved over  from here to Britain,  and the Department for Environment, Farming and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), which is  responsible for the co-ordination over there, was severely criticised for not  doing enough &mdash; just as some of the agencies over here were criticised.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The agencies here do liaise with agencies in Britain and  elsewhere, and where lessons can be learned, they will be learned. It is worth  bearing in mind that similar occurrences have happened in England. People  will remember the flooding incidents last year, in such places as Cornwall, and how the  agencies there were criticised.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">All the answers do not lie in one place, but liaison is  ongoing, and where experiences can be shared and lessons can be learned, we are  happy to take those on board.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Buchanan</strong>:  I join in congratulating the emergency services, the agencies, the voluntary  organisations and others who did an excellent job during the difficult days of the  flooding. For several years, the sewerage  and rainwater network infrastructure in Omagh has caused difficulties  because of extra pressure from large new housing developments that have  rendered the network inadequate.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Omagh District Council has lobbied the Department for  Regional Development on that issue on several occasions. When does the Minister  for Regional Development propose to have  plans in place to upgrade the network to help avoid a reoccurrence of  flooding in that area?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>:  The Member is correct: the infrastructure struggles to cope. It is no secret to  any MLA that the necessary investment in water and sewerage services has not  been made by direct rule Administrations over the past 20 years. Therefore, the  current Administration is faced with a serious financial consequence. A  substantial investment plan has been rolled out in Belfast for the sewerage works, and there are  also plans for substantial investment in the sewerage and water infrastructure  across the North. Finance will be required,  and that will cause difficulties for all of us.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The infrastructure is not up to the required standard &mdash;  that should not come as any surprise. There are plans to make the necessary  investment that has not been made in the past, and that will present a challenge.  Nevertheless, it is generally accepted by Members that building a system that  could cope with the rainfall experienced in Omagh and Belfast last week would probably be beyond  our capacity. It can only be expected that systems are built to cope with storm  levels that may come along once every six, seven &mdash; or even 30 &mdash; years. Last  week&rsquo;s rainfall levels were far above those that normally occur within those  expectations.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I concur with the remarks made about the emergency services, which, along with  volunteers, have done tremendous work.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Three of the eight towns that the Minister for Regional  Development mentioned in his statement are in the South Down constituency, and  he accepted that this was the second time that they had been flooded. Does the  Minister have a longer-term strategy? He may  not be able to give me the strategy or the timescale today, but can he  write to me about the Crossgar, Ballynahinch and Downpatrick areas?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>:  The Member is correct: those areas were seriously affected. I do not have a  specific plan for those areas with me today. Northern Ireland Water is  progressing a programme of over 100 drainage area studies for the larger  population areas across the North, and those will determine the improvements  required to sewerage networks in order to reduce the risk of flooding and meet  environmental objectives. It is estimated that a capital injection of over &pound;300  million will be required for improvements and schemes. The capital-works  programme is currently focused on waste-water treatment compliance, water  quality improvements and reductions in  interruptions to supply.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The majority of the work required for the implementation of  the drainage area study programme is scheduled for 2010 and beyond. If there  are specific plans for the areas that Mr McCallister mentioned, I will ask  Northern Ireland Water to respond to the Department for Regional Development.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Omagh town was particularly affected  by last week&rsquo;s rain. There was substantial damage to property, and people were  hugely inconvenienced. The people of Omagh welcome the establishment of the emergency fund but would also like affected  businesses, and people whose vehicles were submerged in public car  parks, to be compensated appropriately.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I also wish to wish to  commend the General Consumer Council,  which, together with Omagh Independent Advice Services, intervened to  offer advice and guidance to those local people who had suffered the most.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister give an assessment of how effective the  inter-agency co-operation and communication was on the ground in Omagh and in  the other towns and cities affected? Will the Minister agree to come to Omagh  to meet representatives of the local council and the divisional roads manager  to discuss lessons learned and preventative measures that might be put in  place? I know that his visit to Omagh would be a very welcome development. Go  raibh maith agat.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I thank the Member for his question  and his invitation to Omagh &mdash; I would probably be the first Armagh  man to be welcomed in Tyrone. Nonethe&shy;less, he makes a serious point. The  immediate need, as far as the Executive were concerned, was to help those whose  homes were uninhabitable, and especially those who lost essential household  utilities and who had no electricity supply or facilities for cooking.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I agree with the Member&rsquo;s point, and it is a serious one,  that businesses were damaged, and property, such as vehicles and belongings.  Consideration is being given to the additional action required. Some of the  assessments that he asks for are for the longer term. The Executive&rsquo;s priority  was to ensure that our response was as good as possible. Our assessment at the  time was that inter-agency communication was good. Certainly, however, there is  no scheme that cannot be improved, and the Executive will want to consider, in  the longer term, the lessons to be learned from the event, and how the  emergency plans could be tweaked and improved.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I have no doubt, and I am sure that Members will agree,  that we will face further incidences of severe weather similar to that  experienced last week. The Executive want to reassure the public that this is a  new Administration, more responsive to the needs of the public &mdash; the people who  elected Members and put us here &mdash; and that we want to improve the  responsiveness of all agencies and take preventative measures whenever  possible.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  First, on behalf of the people who phoned me on Friday in relation to the  flooding, I put on record their thanks to the staff of the Department of the  Environment, the Department for Regional Development, the councils and the  other bodies who were there to help.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister&rsquo;s statement has been made, obviously, in  respect of the Belfast  and Omagh council areas. However, it is important that it be clarified for the people of Newtownards and Comber, whom the  Minister mentioned in his statement. I would add Saintfield and  Killyleagh, where houses were also damaged. It is important that the scheme be  open to them.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, the Minister may have seen the picture in today&rsquo;s  newspaper of Killyleagh football ground, which is beneath four feet of water. A  ladies&rsquo; match is supposed to be taking place on Thursday, but that will be  impossible. There will be no football on that ground for about six weeks. At a  meeting two years ago, the Rivers Agency said that it could not put a larger  pipe under the road to alleviate the water problem in what is a water catchment  area. I encourage the Minister to respond positively to Killyleagh FC and  ensure that a larger drain is inserted to ensure that flooding will be  alleviated. The current situation is unacceptable.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>: I  thank the Member for his question. The  particular problem in Killyleagh is the responsibility of the Department of Agriculture and Rural  Development, and I am sure that officials from the Rivers Agency will  respond in due course.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As regards the other council areas affected, there was  further flooding, as the Member quite rightly said, and I mentioned parts of County   Down in my statement.  It is a matter for the councils; all councils were written to and emailed on Friday afternoon about the  availability of the new scheme. Councils should get in touch with the  Department of the Environment where there is need in their areas and submit an  application to be involved in the scheme.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As the flooding only occurred on Friday, I expect that that  is something that councils &mdash; whether Ards Borough Council or Down District  Council &mdash; will communicate with the Department of the Environment about to  ensure that residents in those council areas receive assistance if they require  it. The scheme is open to councils, but it is up to them to apply. All the  councils have been informed &mdash; by email or letter &mdash; about the scheme, how it  works and how they can get involved if they deem that people in their areas  require assistance.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">12.45 pm</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his  statement. I warmly endorse his comments about the response of the emergency  services, the community and voluntary sectors  and, indeed, the community itself. I also recognise, as the Minister  stated, the exceptional nature of the downpour last week.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Does the Minister agree that in the context of climate  change the data that the Met Office and the Department rely on may already be  out of date and that it therefore it may not be another 90 years before we  experience a similar event? Can the Minister indicate what short-term measures  have been taken and lessons learnt from the events last week?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>:  That is a valid point. The Department needs to see if the statistics and the  analysis for the gully-cleaning exercise &mdash; one aspect of what Roads Service is  involved in &mdash; are up to date with weather predications. There are also resource  implications for that &mdash; as I mentioned, there are 136,000 gullies in Belfast alone, and if a  more regular service is required, there will be resource implications.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There was a departmental discussion this morning, which I  expect to continue, about the ability of the Met Office to predict the location  of severe weather earlier and more accurately. The Chamber will be aware that  the weather warning last Tuesday was for the Belfast  region as a whole; it was not specific to east or south Belfast.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There is scope to look again, for instance, at how  regularly services are provided and whether a greater degree of co-ordination  is possible with the Met Office to ensure an earlier weather warning &mdash; that  would help the agencies to respond more rapidly. All of those are lessons in a  changing climate. We must look at the implications of the events of last week  and at how the Executive and the agencies can respond better in such  circumstances.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his assurance that all council areas that were affected  by the flooding are able to apply for the scheme &mdash; including North Down, which  at least got a passing reference in the statement. There were, I am reliably  informed, parts of the Province, particularly around Cookstown, where flooding  began on the evening of 11 June. Will the Minister assure the Chamber that  those areas will also be included in the scheme?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister  clarify the position on compensation where there has been damage to  property outside a house &mdash; for example, where cars were parked outside and had  to be written off? Will there be compensation to households for damage to  property outside their houses?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>: I  apologise for not referring to North Down Borough Council, but perhaps that is  an argument for reform of local government as there are so many councils in County Down.  Fewer councils would make my geographical job a bit easier.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Regarding compensation for property, the answer is the same  as the one I gave Barry McElduff; the priority was to get a payment to people  in households who had lost utilities, electricity, cooking and refrigeration  facilities, so that they could return to a normal standard of living immediately.  That does not close the door on any consideration of other properties that were  damaged as a result of the flooding, but it is not to open the door unduly  either.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We had this discussion with officials from the Department  of Environment and the Department of Finance and Personnel. That was where the  priority was, and if people want to make an argument for further consideration  to be given to that, the Executive will give it due consideration.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Armstrong</strong>:  I must congratulate the emergency services and voluntary services for their  actions. Could the Minister for Regional Development and his Department be more  proactive in looking at the impact which new development is likely to have on  existing areas where the infrastructure is already struggling to cope with the  results of the flooding and at those at risk? Will the Minister pay particular  attention to the impact of Planning Policy Statement 14 (PPS 14) and global  warming?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">PPS 14 seems to concentrate on developments in towns,  villages and rural areas, but little thought is given to the surface water in  those areas and parts that are prone to flooding. The Minister for Regional  Development said at the end of his statement that he would take a look at what  needs to be done on a long-term basis, and it is important that he is very  proactive.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>:  It is a valid point that we need to look at housing development planning and at  how replacing green fields with a housing development creates a hard surface  that may contribute to flooding. We also need to look at whether the existing  services &mdash; and I know that that has been a difficulty for planning &mdash; can cope  with what may have come from additional housing. That is the reason for the  substantial investment in water and sewerage services and the reason that over  a 100 drainage schemes are being looked at across the whole region.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Those are the long-term implications that we have to  grapple with, because it is not simply a matter of building houses; we must  also look at the long-term implications of those houses. Mr Armstrong will know  that the court case in relation to PPS 14 begins this morning, and that  constrains what we can say about it. Certainly,  the impact of PPS 14 is one that the Assembly and myself as the Minister responsible for that planning policy will  want to look at again. We will see what the implications are from the outcome  of the court case, but we certainly want to look not only at rural planning and people&rsquo;s ability to live in the countryside  but also at the strain that a build  up of development puts on the se<span style="letter-spacing:-.5pt; ">werage</span> system and the water and drainage infrastructure.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>:  The House will support the praise that has been heaped on the shoulders of all  the statutory services that carried out such excellent work last week. I also  think that the House accepts that the events of 12 June were exceptional &mdash; I  witnessed the rainfall, and it was something that I had never seen in my,  unfortunately, 50 years on this planet. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am more concerned that the devastating impact of global  climate change may be starting, even in this part of the world. That is  worrying. I am also concerned that although 15 June was a more normal day for  rainfall, in my constituency of South Down areas such as Crossgar, Ballynahinch  and Saintfield were very badly affected. Is the Minister absolutely convinced  that the drainage system in those towns and villages is capable of meeting  normal rainfall patterns, because my impression on Friday was that it certainly  is not?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>: I  share the Member&rsquo;s concerns about the general change in climate that we seem to  be experiencing and the implications that that has for all of us. The rainfall  of 15 June was not of the severity, for instance, that we had in east and south  Belfast, Omagh  and other places on 12 June. Nonetheless, there was substantially severe  rainfall over a more protracted period. We will be asking questions about  whether the systems that were in place were able to cope with that rainfall. We  have not had a report on whether the rainfall was measured against the storm  expectations, which were above and beyond what a fully functioning water and  sewerage system and drainage system would be able to cope with. Of course the  Member is aware that our system is not up to the standard that we want it to  be. There is investment planning to try to improve that standard, but whether  that would have coped with Friday&rsquo;s rainfall is another question that we want  further analysis on. I cannot give the Member that assurance at the moment. </p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We had to deal with many issues that arose from the events  of Tuesday and Wednesday. Less analysis has come forth on the events of Friday,  including the level of rainfall and whether systems were fully up to scratch.  We shall be asking those questions, and if there are lessons to be learned, we  will learn them. If any further information can be made available, we will  provide it to the Member.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. The Minister has largely covered the  issue that I wished to raise. I was seeking answers about future sewerage  infrastructure improvements. That matter has been addressed. Go raibh maith  agat.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: In  his statement, the Minister mentioned longer-term planning to improve the  sewerage system in Belfast.  Will the Department for Regional Development examine mandatory sustainable  urban drainage systems for all new developments? That could reduce peak flows  in sewers and road drainage by attenuation.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>:  Investment in sewerage in Belfast is well under  way, particularly in areas of south Belfast,  in which the Member obviously has an interest. In the longer term, flood risk  mitigation will be provided for in the central city area through the Belfast sewer project,  which has been included in Northern Ireland Water&rsquo;s capital-works programme for  completion in 2009. That is a &pound;120 million capital-works scheme, which includes  the proposed Belfast  sewer tunnel.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The tunnel is designed to divert storm water to a terminal  pumping station near the Belfast  waste water treatment works at Duncrue    Street. When completed, the existing pumping  stations that currently pump storm water  into the River Lagan &mdash; including the River Terrace pumping station &mdash;  will be decommissioned.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The proposed Belfast  sewer project is designed to reduce the risk of flooding significantly,  although no sewerage system can be guaranteed to prevent all further flooding.  Further investment is required in the Belfast  area &mdash; in addition to the Belfast sewer project  &mdash; associated with the implementation of drainage area studies, particularly in  the east Belfast  area.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As I said in response to another question, those studies do  not have the same priority as the waste water treatment works or the  interruption-of-supply works. The drainage area studies are scheduled to be  implemented after 2010. However, the substantial investment in Belfast&rsquo;s main sewer project is due for  completion in 2009. That will result in a significant improvement in the  situation in the city centre area.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. First, I thank the Minister for his  reassurance that the compensation is payable across various council areas. That  was not clear on Friday.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I repeat Peter Weir&rsquo;s question about compensation in  respect of the events of Monday night, when Cookstown was badly flooded. Will  the compensation cover the events of Monday night, when the first of the storms  occurred?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that commercial buildings are covered in  the same way as domestic ones. The situation for some domestic properties is  OK, but commercial properties sustained much damage, and facilities inside some  of them had to be closed down.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>: I  repeat my previous answer: all councils were contacted in writing on Friday.  Any council that considers itself eligible for the scheme is entitled to apply  for compensation. That includes Cookstown District Council, if it has a  particular case to make.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Priority was given to domestic households and to getting  people back to some acceptable degree of living standard. That does not  necessarily close the door on any other request for assistance in respect of  damage to property. People who have such cases to make should pursue them. We  will see where that brings us in relation to the resources that are available  from the Executive.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Of course, &pound;5 million, as a headline figure, seems like  quite a substantial amount of money, but that will be spread across the areas  of damage, and the Member will know that quite a number of areas and properties  were damaged by the storms. The door is not closed to further consideration for  other properties and other people who were affected by the flooding.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  I sympathise with all those who have lost their homes and who have been  traumatised over the last week due to the severe flooding.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText" style="text-indent:0cm;">I congratulate the Minister on his  efforts to learn lessons from what has happened to ensure that such severe  flooding does not reoccur.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">1.00 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister will remember that, a couple of weeks ago, I  stood in the Chamber and appealed to him for sufficient funding to properly  maintain the roads in my constituency. Last Friday, the A20 &mdash; the main road  between Portaferry and Newtownards &mdash; was blocked by flooding. Many of my  constituents were affected by that flooding. Will the Minister ensure that his officials  are given whatever means are necessary to keep this main road open at all  times? As most of the road runs alongside Strangford Lough, there was no excuse  for not being able to get rid of the water quickly.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister advise what compensation will be made  available to motorists whose cars were written-off as a result of getting  caught in the flood waters?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, despite the over-abundance of water throughout the  country over the past week, Kiltonga industrial estate in Newtownards had its water  cut off last Friday and is getting a temporary supply back only this morning.  Will the Minister comment on that situation?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>: I  thank the Member for his questions. The priority for Roads Service is, of  course, to try to keep roads open. Roads were reopened fairly quickly after the  events had taken place. If investment is required, a case can be made for that  and it will be given consideration. The Member will know that there are  competing requirements for investment &mdash; across all areas of the Executive&rsquo;s  responsibility, not just for Roads Service. Therefore, priorities must be  agreed and investment must be made on the basis of those priorities. If a lack  of resources is identified in any area, a strong case for investment could be  made.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Compensation has been mentioned for damaged properties. Members should be clear that these  payments are not compensation: they are one-off payments to enable  people to get their properties back to an acceptable living standard, allowing  them to cook and use the facilities in their own homes. However, as I have said, consideration can be given to further  requests for support. Any requests should be made through the process  that has been agreed with the councils.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">A note will be taken of the specific case that the Member  mentioned in his constituency, and I will ask Northern Ireland Water to respond  to him.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement and the work of the emergency services over  the past week. The Minister has indicated that the events of last week were  exceptional circumstances. However, in the past eight years, it is about the  eighth time that I have heard &mdash; from various Ministers, not just from the  current Minister &mdash; that those are one in every 100 or 150 years events. It  seems that we have had 1,000 years of disaster all wrapped up in the past eight  years.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As such events are not now considered to be exceptional  circumstances, will the Minister give an assurance  that emergency planning is being strengthened so that the Department is  aware of where floods are likely to occur? They seem to happen in the same  places time and time again. Will the Minister also give an assurance that data  on the locations of floods will be collected and that the Department will  liaise closely with the weather forecasters so that early intervention, such as  the distribution of sandbags, can occur before the flooding even starts?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Despite the ongoing investment programme and the strategic  investment programme, will the Minister confirm that where areas that flood  regularly are identified and where individual actions could be taken to  alleviate that problem, some money will be spent and some research will be  carried out to ascertain how that issue could be resolved?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, will the  Minister assure Members that, given the record of the councils &mdash; and  especially Belfast City Council &mdash; in distributing money within two days of it  having been received, that there will be a role for councils if there are  emergencies in the future?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>: I  thank the Member for his questions. I am happy to provide him with reassurance  on all the issues that he raised.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">My response to the  first point raised is similar to that given to Mitchel McLaughlin  earlier. The descriptions of how often in  100 years such events might happen are provided  by people in the Met Office &mdash; that is their job. They are profess&shy;ionals; they measure those occurrences, and they  provide the frequency of such events.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There is a perception among some Members of the House, and  also among some members of the public, that there is a greater frequency in  such occurrences. If that is the case, there needs to be a more accurate description and a greater degree of co-ordination  before an event happens. That is  something that could usefully be investigated.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It must be borne in mind, however, that the warning for  Tuesday 12 June covered the greater Belfast  area, not east Belfast or south Belfast in particular. It is difficult to be that specific. If factors such as  the amount of resources available,  the number of gullies and rivers, the area of sewerage and water  infrastructure that must be checked and the distribution of sandbags is taken  into account, there is some restriction on what can be done in advance. It is  the Executive&rsquo;s job to examine the emergency response and to consider what else  could be done in advance and where procedures could be tightened up. The issue  of advanced warnings and the ability to get rapid response out before an event  is something that could usefully be examined.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The councils played an important role, and the Executive  commended them and continue to commend them. It is clear that, in such circumstances, the  councils are the first port of call  for many members of the public, regardless of where responsibility lies.  Over those days, the councils, particularly Belfast City Council, Omagh  District Council and some others, proved that they could initiate a very quick  and localised response to the people on the ground by means of projects such as  the Belfast Resilience Forum and by use of their own staff and resources. I  assure the Member that the role played by the councils has not been lost and  that it will be factored into any review of procedures or the emergency  response.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>:  Will the Minister reassure the House that the Belfast  to Bangor  railway line, which was closed because of last week&rsquo;s flooding, has been  checked for health and safety? Will he also give an assurance, after the  flooding in the Gransha Road  and Bloomfield Road  areas of Bangor,  which appears to have been caused by blockages in the drainage system, that all  gullies and drains will be checked?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>:  The Belfast to Bangor railway line was closed for one and a  half hours on Friday 15 June 2007. At 8.30 am, a signaller reported flooding in  the vicinity of Craigavad. The line was subsequently  closed between Cultra and Seahill. A landslip further along the line was  also reported. Infrastructure personnel were duly alerted and, having assessed  both problems, they were able to reopen the line. Train services were resumed,  albeit with an operating speed restriction in place as a precautionary measure.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I do not have specific details about the roads that the Member mentioned. However, I will ask Roads  Service officials to respond to him in writing.</p>

		    <p class="H4StageHeading">Welfare Reform Bill</p>
		    <p class="H4StageHeading">Consideration Stage</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Members will have a copy of the Marshalled  List, which details the order for consideration of amendments. The  amendments have been grouped for debate in the provisional grouping of  amendments selected list. There are three groups of amendments, and we will  debate the amendments in each group in turn. The first debate will be on  amendments No 1, No 2 and No 5, which deal with the manner in which a person  with a mental-health condition is dealt with by the Department for Social  Development. The second debate will be on Mr Brady and other Members&rsquo;  opposition to clause 16, which deals with the question of whether the  Department should have the power to contract  out some of its functions. The third debate will be on amendments No 3  and No 4, which deal with the payment of housing benefit and debt counselling.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I remind Members  intending to speak that, during the debates  on each of the three groups of amendments, they should address all the  amendments in that group on which they wish  to comment. Once the initial debate on each group is completed, any  subsequent amendments in the group will be moved formally as we go through the  Bill, and the Question on each will be put without further debate.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Questions on clause stand part will be taken at the  appropriate points in the Bill.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">If that is clear to Members &mdash; and I am sure that it is &mdash; we  shall proceed. No amendments have been tabled for clauses 1 to 10.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Clauses 1 to 10 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic"><strong>Clause 11  (Work-focused health related assessments)</strong></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  We now come to the first group of amendments for debate. Along with amendment  No 1, it will be convenient to debate amendments No 2 and No 5. These amendments deal with the manner in  which the Department deals with persons with mental-health conditions.  As amendment No 5 is consequential to amendment No 1, I will call amendment No  5 only if amendment No 1 is made.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>: I  beg to move amendment No 1: In page 10, line 6, at end insert</p>
		    <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;, or</p>
		    <p class="Q3Motion">(e) a psychiatrist, a psychologist, a psychiatric nurse or a  psychiatric social worker where the assessment is in relation to a person in  connection with a mental health condition.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic"><strong>The following  amendments stood on the Marshalled List</strong>:</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">No 2: In clause 12, page 10, line 23, at end insert</p>
		    <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;(e) for securing that in the case of a person who has a  mental health condition, the interview is conducted in a manner that takes into  account the specific needs of the person being interviewed;&rdquo; &mdash; <em>[Mr Brady.]</em></p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">No 5: In clause 55, page 41, line 27, at end insert</p>
		    <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;(e) a psychiatrist, a psychologist, a psychiatric nurse or a  psychiatric social worker where the medical examination is in relation to a  person in connection with a mental health condition.&rdquo; &mdash; <em>[Mr Brady.]</em><span style="color:red; "> </span></p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Go raibh maith agat. All of these amendments are designed  to alleviate the impact of the Welfare Reform Bill on those vulnerable groups  whom it will affect the most. Historically,  benefit legislation has been formulated by people who have no specific knowledge or experience of those  in receipt of benefit. These changes are being introduced without consultation  and are designed to save money, not necessarily to enhance people&rsquo;s lives.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Those people who have particular types and degrees of  mental illness, and who find it very difficult to articulate how they are  affected, will be one of the groups most affected by the changes proposed in  the Welfare Reform Bill. The purpose of amendment No 1 is to ensure that people  with mental-health problems are examined by medically qualified practitioners  who have particular insight into those problems. The legislation, as it stands,  mentions:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;(a) a registered medical practitioner,</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented" style="text-indent:15.0pt;">(b) a registered nurse,</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented" style="text-indent:15.0pt;">(c) an occupational  therapist &hellip; or</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented" style="text-indent:15.0pt;">(d) a member of such other  profession&rdquo;.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There is no mention of people with specific qualifications  in mental health.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As someone who has represented people on incapacity benefit  with mental-health problems over the past 26 years, and who has dealt with  people on benefits for over 30 years, I feel that I am in a position to comment  on these issues. Inevitably, a person with mental-health problems, appearing  before an appeal tribunal, will be asked if they have seen a psychiatrist,  psychologist, psychiatric nurse or psychiatric social worker. Often, the  tribunal will adjourn to request a report from one of those practitioners.  Obviously, this means a further delay; something that adds to the stress on the client and the cost to the public purse.  Therefore, it does not seem unreasonable that practitioners in the  particular professions mentioned in the amendment are the most appropriate  people to examine those with mental-health problems and to comment on their  competence or otherwise. The amendment can only be of benefit to those people  with mental-health issues. I ask the Assembly to support the amendment.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In relation to amendment No 2, client interviews for the  purpose of social security are carried out in the jobs and benefits office &mdash;  usually in the public office. By definition, people who are being interviewed  feel some degree of intimidation and enter  into the interviews with a degree of  trepidation. The public offices are noisy, busy and usually full of  people waiting to be seen.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">When an interviewee has a mental-health problem, it is  important that the Social Security Agency should be aware of their condition.  The interview should be carried out in a  manner and location that is conducive to dealing with their particular problem. It is of paramount  importance that such people should be interviewed in a sensitive and humane manner and allowed to dictate the course of  the interview at their own pace. If necessary, the interview should be carried out in the person&rsquo;s home, because  that is where they feel most comfortable.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is also incumbent on  the Social Security Agency to ensure  that interviews are carried out by people who have received extensive  training in dealing with clients who have  mental-health problems, and that the interviewee is comfortable with the location and pace of the  interview. The client must also be reassured that the interview is being  carried out in the strictest confidence and that confidentiality is being  strictly adhered to.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I ask that the Assembly support the amendment.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">1.15 pm</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Miss McIlveen</strong>:  The amendments may be tabled with best of intentions for people with  mental-health conditions, but their  acceptance would not benefit those people or anyone else who is in  receipt of benefits in Northern    Ireland. Members from all sides of the House  share the concerns that surround the  treatment of people who suffer from  mental-health conditions. The Minister made specific mention of that in her  comments to the House last week, and I  welcome the specific commitment she  gave that people with mental-health problems would be treated with  particular sensitivity and sympathy.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I will speak against the proposed amendments to clauses 11,  12 and 55 of the Bill. The Members who tabled the amendments appear intent on  introducing change for change&rsquo;s sake. Clause 55(2) will insert a definition of  &ldquo;health care professional&rdquo; into The Social Security  (Northern Ireland)  Order 1998, and that definition will reflect &ldquo;health care professional&rdquo;  as defined in clause 11(8) of the Bill. After listing three categories of  healthcare professionals, the Bill states a fourth at subsection (8)(d):</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;a member of such  other profession regulated by a body mentioned in section 25(3) of the  National Health Service Reform and Health Care Professions Act 2002 (c. 17) as  may be prescribed.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Members who tabled the amendments do not intend to  change that paragraph, so I presume that they are happy with it. I wonder  whether they have read section 25 of the National Health Service Reform and Health Care Professions Act 2002. It is readily  apparent, for those who have chosen  to read it, that all recognised and regulated health care workers are  catered for in section 25. It naturally follows that the Bill in its unamended  form caters for the appropriate healthcare professional to assess each  individual depending on his or her particular circumstances. Aside from the  ineffectuality and superfluousness of the attempt to insert the proposed paragraph  (e) into the legislation after such a catch-all paragraph (d), it is poor and  clumsy drafting.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I will now deal with the proposed insertion of new  paragraph (e) into clause 12. Clause 12 governs regulations that the Department  can introduce under the Welfare Reform Bill, and matters that may be taken into  account when issuing those regulations. The guidelines set out in clause 12 &mdash;  they are merely guidelines &mdash; are to assist in general terms the matters that  the regulations may address. Although several matters are particularised, the  list in clause 12 is not exhaustive. The specifics of providing the appropriate  environment for the interview of people suffering from a mental-health  condition are more suited to the detail of the regulations. As the Members who  have proposed the amendments are members of the Committee for Social  Development, they will have an opportunity  to discuss the issue when the regulations are being drafted. The  Minister was clear and unequivocal when she met with the Committee on 24 May  2007 and said:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;I want to make it quite clear that I will be coming  back to the Committee before anything happens as regards the regulations. I  want to get the views, advice and guidance of Committee members before  proceeding. I am quite clear about that.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Sinn F&eacute;in members of the Committee for Social  Development are dressing the amendments up as additional protection for those  who suffer from mental-health problems. The amendments do nothing of the kind.  They contribute nothing constructive.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">One of the primary reasons for accelerated passage of the  Bill was to maintain parity with the rest of the United Kingdom. It is recorded in  Hansard that, on 24 May 2007, the Committee for Social Development:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;agreed unanimously  to the accelerated passage of the Welfare Reform Bill&rdquo;.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Miss McIlveen</strong>:  Sorry, no. Thank you.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Not only that, but during that meeting the Sinn F&eacute;in  Committee members did not raise one single dissatis&shy;faction as to how people who suffer from mental-health disorders  may be treated under the Bill. Perhaps at that stage they had not been told  what to think.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Nevertheless, no matter how well intentioned the amendments  are for the treatment of people with mental-health conditions, they will not be  in anyone&rsquo;s interest if the principle of parity is broken because of their  being accepted.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The DUP will not support the amendments; it is important  that the Bill passes through the House.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I oppose the amendments in this group. I agree with the comprehensive analysis  that Miss McIlveen has put forward. She has critically examined each individual amendment and has succinctly presented  the arguments collectively and individually.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Brady raised a general point about mental illness and  people who suffer from mental ill health. It is clear that all Members are  sympathetic to the notion of assisting people who suffer from mental ill  health. Indeed, it is clear that the Minister, in addressing the House and the  Committee for Social Development, is exceptionally sympathetic.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, the proposals in amendments No 1, No 2 and No 5 in  no way augment the process of assisting those people. The Bill, as it stands,  is clearly intended to give people who suffer from mental ill health the greatest possible assistance with work-related  interviews, and so on. In fact, it could be said that the proposed  amendments are superfluous.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to raise one specific issue in amendment No 1, which  is the introduction of psychologists into the definition of a &ldquo;health care  professional&rdquo;. To permit a psychologist to make assessments would introduce  into the legislation someone who is not necessarily &mdash; I emphasise &ldquo;necessarily&rdquo;  &mdash; medically trained to deal with a patient.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Some psychologists may have some medical experience or  qualification. However, in most circum&shy;stances, psychologists are not medically  trained. It would therefore be  inappropriate for a psychologist to be involved in assessments. For that  reason &mdash; although not for that reason alone  &mdash; amendment No 1 is flawed, because people who are medically trained are  required to deal with people who suffer  from a medical condition.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  Even the wording of the amendment is flawed. The amendment proposes that  psychiatrists, psychologists, psychiatric nurses or psychiatric social workers  be involved in the assessment of people with a mental-health condition. The  terms are so wide that almost anyone could fall within the remit of clause 11  were amendment No 1 accepted.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  Exactly. I agree with what the Member has said.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In many situations, people do not have a specific mental  condition, problem or form of mental ill health alone; often, there is a  mixture of physical and mental conditions. In such cases, it is difficult to  extract the predominant element that affects a person and to identify the  specific issue that must be addressed. A person could have a mental-health  condition &mdash; for example, periodic depression &mdash; yet also suffer from some  physical problem, illness or disability. In those circumstances, it is an  entirely different situation that needs to be addressed. Amendment No 1 does  not really consider the complexity of situations in which, in many cases, the mental-health condition may be  very minor compared to the person&rsquo;s physical incapacity.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill is broad enough to catch all needs and to capture  a mixture of physical and mental needs, where they exist together or  separately. Therefore, in dealing with the circumstances that have been mentioned,  the clauses as they stand should be acceptable.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">My remarks apply equally to amendment No 1 and amendment No  2. It is important that the Assembly is mindful  of the Minister&rsquo;s commitment to deal sympath&shy;etically and  understandingly with the problems that Mr Brady raised. I am not saying that Mr  Brady should not have raised those issues:  if he simply wanted to highlight them, that is fine and one respects  that. However, if he wanted to move an amendment that would efficiently and  correctly deal with those problems, I am afraid that he has not done so. The  amendments are flawed and do not deal with the situation properly. Therefore  the Member has done a disservice.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: The  amendments recognise concerns &mdash; which have existed across the UK since the  implem&shy;entation of the Welfare Reform Act 2007 &mdash; about the effects that some of the requirements may have on  people who suffer from psychiatric  illness or who have a learning disability. However, it is not clear that  the amendments deal with those problems. Certain issues are beyond what can  reasonably be included in primary legislation.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 2 refers to job-related interviews and has  considerable merit in its specification that such interviews should be carried out in a reasonable manner and in  accordance with the needs of the individual. However, there is already a host  of provisions for regulations. Some Members referred to the Minister&rsquo;s comments  in last week&rsquo;s debate on the Second Stage of the Bill. The question must be  asked whether the amendment, which would require the provision of further  regulations, is appropriate. The Assembly must ensure that people who face  work-focused interviews are treated in a way that will encourage them into work  and not in a way that increases anxiety or creates difficulty for people who suffer from depression or who have a  learning disability. That is a key issue on which there is no disagreement. The  question is whether the relevant clauses should be amended. My colleagues and I  will listen carefully to the Minister&rsquo;s response.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As a social worker by profession &mdash; indeed, an approved  social worker under the Mental Health (Northern Ireland) Order 1986 until my  registration lapsed because of the time that I spent in this place, where a  qualification in mental health social work is, apparently, not relevant &mdash; I  must declare an interest. All the appropriate professionals are covered in the  Bill. To suggest that a particular group of professionals is required to deal  with a particular case &mdash; such as that of someone who has had orthopaedic  surgery, for example &mdash; implies that there should be a list of those who are  suitable to deal with each case. As one who made his living as a social worker,  I certainly would not have felt qualified to submit a professional report on  the ability to work of someone who had had orthopaedic surgery.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Professionals are sought to provide professional reports, and part of their professionalism is to  determine whether they are capable of providing a report. To suggest that certain professionals would deal  with certain conditions is to  suggest that a raft of amendments should go through in order to  encompass all kinds of other people who would be suitable. That goes against  the spirit in which professional regulations were laid down and those that are  referred to in the Bill. Registered social  workers, occupational therapists, physiotherapists, nurses or doctors  are capable of dealing with their area of expertise. We should not divide them  into further subsections.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Like Mr Maginness, I agree with Ms McIlveen, who spoke against the necessity of such divisions.  However, I want to put on record my disagreement with her reference to the principle of parity. The  Assembly has yet to tackle the issue of where parity is essential in  social security matters and where variation may be an option.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The basic  structures, financial benefits and key conditions of the legislation  must be treated on the basis of parity. However, It is wrong to suggest that  the Assembly cannot amend minor details in  a Bill such as this because of parity considerations. Had I received the  necessary assurances from the Minister about the concerns that I raised, I  would not be supporting what I regard as a flawed amendment.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">1.30 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, that is not saying that Members should accept  automatically that no amendment is possible in such cases. There may be  circumstances in which the Assembly could  make marginal variations to conditions, which would have no effect on  their role within the UK  national framework for social security but would make conditions easier for  some people here. Let us be careful not to get too hung up on parity even in  relation to social security legislation.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The key issue is to ensure that the Bill goes through as  fast as possible and in the best possible form. If the Minister repeats the  assurances that she made about the way in which people with psychiatric  illnesses or learning disabilities will be  treated, and addresses concerns that appropriate professionals will be  involved, there will be no need for any of the amendments to be made.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I support the Bill. The subject was debated at length in the Chamber on 23  January, and concerns were expressed about some of the Bill&rsquo;s implications,  specifically the prospect of negative repercussions for those with neurological  and mental-health problems.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I pointed out the problems associated with topping up  benefits for people who attended interviews and the impact that could have on  people who were genuinely unable to work due to mental-health problems. The  Bill begins to address the issue, and that  is welcome. However, to what extent are the mental-health professionals  satisfied with the clause, in particular the Northern Ireland Neurological Charities Alliance &mdash; the umbrella organisation for charities dealing with multiple sclerosis,  Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, Parkinson&rsquo;s disease, epilepsy, muscular dystrophy and  other conditions &mdash; which expressed concern to me and, I suspect, others about  the Bill?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I reiterate that I agree with the concept of getting people  back into work placements, but not to the detriment  of their mental health or that of their families. Will the Minister assure the House that  above-mentioned concerned parties can be satisfied as to the power and remit of the Bill and the effect that it will  have on those it is aimed at? In other words, will help be getting to  the people who need it?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">If the answer is that  there has been wide consultation and that the various bodies are  satisfied, then Members must support the Bill and encourage those on the periphery of society back into satisfactory  working lives.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  a Cheann Comhairle. I would like to clarify two points, especially given the  point made by Miss McIlveen. First, the Committee for Social Development  supported accelerated passage for the Bill only after being informed by the  Minister that benefits would be stopped in mid-June &mdash; that was the only reason  why accelerated passage was agreed to. If the Committee had had an opportunity  to debate the Bill further, many more amendments might have been proposed today.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, Alban Maginness raised the point that a  psychologist is better placed to speak for claimants than a physiotherapist.  Physiotherapists are mentioned in the Bill  while psychologists and psychiatrists are not.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I support the amendment of my friend from Newry and Armagh  Mickey Brady because it makes sense. It sets out in black and white what is  required of the Department when it embarks on interviewing a person who suffers  from a mental illness. It would mean that those  who would adjudicate and assess people who have been informed that they  must attend a job-focused interview would have the medical experience to judge  the ability of that person to take part in  such an interview.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The amendment states:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;a psychiatrist, a  psychologist, a psychiatric nurse or a psychiatric social worker where  the assessment is in relation to a person in connection with a mental health  condition.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That is clear, whereas the Bill, as it stands, is  not.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There is no mention in  the Bill of the professions listed in the amendment; nor does the Bill  state that a person must be qualified in psychiatry to examine, or judge,  people with mental illnesses who are to be interviewed.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Nowhere in the Bill does it say that those being asked to  adjudicate in cases where the person suffers from a mental-health disorder must  be qualified to do so. In fact, clause 55(2) states that:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;&rsquo;health care professional&rdquo; means &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented" style="margin-left:1.0cm;text-indent:-14.15pt;">(a)&nbsp; a registered medical  practitioner;</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented" style="margin-left:1.0cm;text-indent:-14.15pt;">(b) a registered nurse;</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented" style="margin-left:1.0cm;text-indent:-14.15pt;">(c)&nbsp; an occupational  therapist or physiotherapist registered with a regulatory body established by  an Order in Council under section 60 of the Health Act 1999 (c. 8); or</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented" style="margin-left:1.0cm;text-indent:-14.15pt;">(d)&nbsp; a member of such  other profession regulated by a body mentioned in section 25(3) of the National  Health Service Reform and Health Care Professions Act 2002 (c. 17) as the  Department may prescribe;.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">It continues, but the meaning is the same: it  mentions every possible practitioner to cover other illnesses, but it does not state who should examine or assess  those who suffer from mental illnesses. I find that rather strange.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  I appreciate the Member&rsquo;s giving way. Although I can appreciate the Member&rsquo;s  point, I am not so sure that those professionals are not covered by clause 55(2)(d). Is the Member saying, as a  Member for South Antrim Mr Ford did earlier, that if someone has a heart condition, he or she would be best  examined by a heart specialist, or that if someone has a limb condition,  he or she would be best examined by an orthopaedic surgeon? If that is the  case, why does Mr McCann not suggest that  there be specified professionals for all kinds of ailments?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  The point is well made. However, when it came down to it, Sinn F&eacute;in and some  other Committee members believed that those  people suffering from mental  illnesses would lose out and be the hardest hit by the proposed  interviews. If other people suffer from other ailments, they too should be  catered for. The Bill names a wide spectrum of professionals to cover a range  of conditions, but it makes no specific mention of mental health.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">My point is that many people who claim incapacity or  related benefits suffer from mental illnesses. People may argue that GPs are  qualified to examine anyone who is ill. That  is not the case. Very few GPs are trained to deal with mental illnesses; they are even less capable of  assessing or advising a person with a mental illness.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  Will the Member not also accept that, in many instances, people attend their  GPs to receive counselling for mental illnesses?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  For some considerable time now, I have attended meetings with the families of  people who have taken their own lives. They say that GPs are so overworked and  overloaded that it is impossible for them to identify some of the problems  suffered by their patients, some of which are mental-health conditions.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">That is why Sinn F&eacute;in specifically argued that the Bill  must include references to professionals with psychiatric  training. Such professionals could deal with sufferers of mental  illnesses and give the necessary professional advice on when people with  mental-health difficulties could be interviewed; how the interviews should be  conducted; the degree or severity of the illnesses;  and whether the people should be accompanied during the interview  process.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 2 deals with the circumstances and  surroundings in which the interviews should be conducted. Those very simple  precautions should be supported by everyone  in the House. These issues should already be provided for in the Bill.  Let us ensure that we afford those with mental illnesses the expertise that  they need to cope with the changes in the Bill.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am pleased to support amendment No 5 from my friend from Newry and Armagh.  Mickey Brady has over 30 years&rsquo; experience working for the then  Department of Health and Social Services (DHSS) and later in an advice centre,  dealing with appeals and many other problems. He knows what he is talking  about.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">He has conducted incapacity-benefit interviews in DHSS  offices. Professionally, he has seen the results of dealing with people with  mental-health problems and has tried to adjudicate on decisions &mdash; an activity  that is not easy on the people who work in those offices. They are not equipped  to deal with, or adjudicate on, those types of cases, and many would attest to  that.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The surroundings in which interviews take place are as  important as the interviews. I am still not convinced that the interviews, as  they are laid out, are the right step forward. They could prove to be a major  setback for people who suffer from mental illnesses. Members must get this  right &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  Sammy, you will end up saying more than me during my contribution.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>: I appreciate that the Member has given way on a second point.  Clause 12(2), which Members will have more opportunity to debate in detail,  makes it clear that: </p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;(2) Regulations under this section may, in  particular, make provision &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented" style="margin-left:1.0cm;text-indent:-14.15pt;">(a)&nbsp; prescribing  circumstances in which such a person is subject to a requirement to take part  in one or more work-focused interviews;</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented" style="margin-left:1.0cm;text-indent:-14.15pt;">(b) for  notifying such a person of any such requirement;&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The application of those regulations will allow far  more flexibility than would the inclusion of a paragraph, which simply says  that:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;&hellip;the interview &hellip;  takes into account the specific needs of the person being interviewed;&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Does the  proposed legislation not offer a better safeguard?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  The intention was to include an amendment to deal with that issue. The problem  is that the longer the process goes on, the less likelihood there is that anything will be included to deal with the  specific needs of claimants.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In 1995, when the last  major changes to the incapacity-b<span style="letter-spacing:-.3pt; ">enefi</span>t system took place, I took part in several  meetings with senior DHSS officials and visited local offices. The  people in those offices who conducted interviews with claimants found the  interviews difficult to deal with because, through no fault of their own, they  were not trained to the necessary standards. The level of training that is  required to deal with the interviews is far more advanced than that that is  currently provided. In practice, regardless of what is contained in the  legislation, the theory may not be applied in practice in social security  offices. Therein lies the difficulty.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Members must get this right &mdash; and if I could read this  speech properly, we might get it right. <em>[Laughter.] </em>We must consider  best practice in various countries, and take advice from professionals who deal  with mental illness.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In some situations, I  have observed that surroundings and a friendly atmosphere can be half  the battle in making a person feel at ease. That is what amendment No 1 is  about. Although the Bill stipulates where an interview can take place, it  misses one vital point, which is taking advice and opinions from those who know  &mdash; professionals in the field of psychiatry and mental health.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I have serious difficulties with certain aspects of the  Bill. If I were dealing with it at Committee Stage now, I would not be in a  rush to recommend accelerated passage. Too much depends on getting it right.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Not least among my concerns is that life should be made as  comfortable as possible for those whose illnesses warrant a completely  different approach than is normally taken during interviews of that nature. How  many Members have experience of people who, for an apparently trivial matter,  have been called for an interview at a social security office and have fallen  apart because they think that they have done something wrong? How many Members  are aware of people who have become  physically ill and refused to go to interviews because they could not  handle the stress of walking into local offices?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Members should consider that a consequence of the Bill  would be that when people are asked why they have not attended an interview and  they explain that they could not mentally handle walking into the office, more  than likely, those people would receive reduced benefits. A genuine fear of  authority has always been prevalent among older people, but it also exists among  younger people &mdash; and Members can only guess  how the Bill will impact on those with mental-health problems.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Given that, I hope that Members can put political  considerations aside and recognise amendment No 1 as taking precautions to  deliver those interviews in places that are conducive to those with such  illnesses.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I support  amendment No 1.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I had not planned to speak on the Bill  because my colleagues have adequately covered my concerns. However, in January,  I proposed a motion in the Transitional  Assembly, and listening to the comments today, I feel that many of the Members who are opposing the Sinn  F&eacute;in amendments appear to have forgotten what that debate was about.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">1.45 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The DUP has made much about holding Ministers to account:  it now has an opportunity to do so. There is nothing to stop the Minister for  Social Development progressing the Bill in its entirety without going near the  Committee again. I do not suggest that she will do so: however, if departmental  officials are prepared to walk into a Committee room and tell the members of  the Committee for Social Development that benefits will be stopped if they do  not agree to accelerated passage, then what  is to stop them from doing anything? It now appears, with the benefit of  hindsight, that that may not be the case, and that the Assembly has the power  to ensure that benefits can continue to be paid. If departmental officials are  capable of telling such a whopper to the members of the Committee for Social  Department, what else are they prepared to do to ensure the progress of the  Bill?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I wonder, as did Mr Ford, whether Ms McIlveen is more  worried about parity of esteem between here and Britain than she is about the  rights of people suffering mental illness. There may be an argument regarding  the financial implications of paying benefits but the Assembly has the power to  ensure that any legislation made in this Chamber will provide basic rights for  the people under its jurisdiction.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am concerned, but not surprised, about the SDLP&rsquo;s stance on the matter. On 23 January 2007 I  proposed the motion in the debate on  the Welfare Reform Bill, which specifically  mentioned neurological patients. The SDLP was, apparently, so concerned about people with mental-health difficulties that its amendment excluded neuro&shy;logical  patients and included a reference to people with mental ill-health. It is worth  quoting again &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  Will the Member define the word &ldquo;neurological&rdquo;?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  The word was specifically chosen to include people with multiple sclerosis. I  will supply the Member with a more detailed definition if he so wishes. The motion as amended stated: </p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;That this Assembly expresses deep concern about the implications of the Welfare  Reform Bill, particularly the introduction of a new coercive regime into  benefit administration, and its impact on a number of vulnerable groups,  especially those people with mental ill health.&rdquo; <span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; ">&mdash; [Official Report, Vol  21, No 14, p 405, col 1</span></span><span class="Italic"><span style="font-size:8.0pt; font-style:normal; ">].</span></span></p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Nothing in this Bill has changed since it came from Westminster. It has been  posted here and is sitting in front of us  awaiting adoption by the Assembly. Margaret Ritchie voted in favour of the motion that was tabled on 23 January. Does that mean, therefore, that the coercive  regime mentioned in that motion has been done away with? Welfare rights groups  in England  do not think so. Those groups are very concerned about the nature of the Bill &mdash;  they have had experience of its impact.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Alban Maginness won our argument for us when he said that  psychologists were not properly trained to deal  with people suffering from mental-health problems. Does Mr Maginness honestly believe that client  advisors working in social security offices are properly trained to deal  with people with those same difficulties? I seriously  doubt that. Those staff members would readily admit that they are not  properly trained to carry out those functions.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Lobby organisations and advocate groups share deep concerns  about the Welfare Reform Bill and the effect that it will have on vulnerable  people in society. Briefing papers supplied by Assembly researchers, the Law  Centre and groups representing the field of neurology for the debate on 23  January, highlighted several cases. One case, which stuck in my mind, was of a  young mother with severe alcohol and mental-health  problems who attended a work-focused interview accompanied by her  children. She failed the interview; failed to find employment; left the family  home and lived on the streets, and ended up taking her own life.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">On a day when newspapers and radio stations are reporting that three young people in a small geographical  area have taken their own lives, and when the subject of suicide once again  comes to the fore, are Members saying through this Bill that they are not going  to take the opportunity to protect the rights of people with mental-health  difficulties?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Some Members say that the Bill does not have to be so  restrictive; but if we are serious about protecting the rights of people with  mental-health problems, this Bill is our  opportunity to do so &mdash; it will send a clear message that a line has been  drawn in the sand.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">All the fine words about the Bamford Review and the need  for investment in mental-health services are not worth diddly-squat, unless  they are in legislation. The Assembly has the chance to act on that today.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">With the deepest respect to general practitioners, who do a  fantastic job in very difficult circumstances, they are not qualified to deal  with mental-health issues at that level. Indeed, the suicide-prevention  strategy launched by the direct rule Health Minister, Sean Woodward, identified  &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr McDonnell</strong>: What qualification does the Member have to dictate to the Chamber that GPs are not qualified to deal with mental-health issues? I worked for  28 years in the Health Service, and 50% of what I dealt with in those  years was mental health; now Mr O&rsquo;Dowd tells me that I am not qualified and  that, retrospectively, I have been a failure.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  The Member is being somewhat dramatic in his representation of what I said. I  did say that GPs were not qualified to deal with that matter.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>:  Address the Chair.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Sorry Mr Speaker. I am being told off here. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">If my colleague refers to the suicide-prevention strategy  and the consultation around it, he will find that it was GPs who lobbied the  hardest for more assistance, more training and more resources to deal with  mental-health issues, because mental health is a specialist issue.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am not degrading GPs. I opened my speech by saying that  they do an excellent job in very difficult circumstances, but a 10-minute,  sometimes five-minute, appointment does not make a GP a specialist in mental  health.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mental health incorporates two separate subjects. One is  counselling, and sometimes someone to talk to is as good a counselling as any,  and often that will be done by the local GP. However, the Assembly is being  asked to agree that people with mental-health issues present themselves at a  tribunal, a hearing and an adjudication, which may result in the loss of  benefits and their being forced into unsuitable employment, which may have a  detrimental effect on their health. A doctor, who is not a specialist in this subject,  is asked to decide in half an hour if a patient is mentally competent. I do not  believe that any GP should be put in that position. Mental-health professionals  should carry out that assessment. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I support the amendments set before the House at this stage  of the Bill.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I remind Members to address their remarks through the Chair.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  I will address my remarks through the Chair, and I will not require a reminder  from the Deputy Speaker on the opposite Bench.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in is making a belated attempt to wash its hands of  a decision that it, collectively, supported in this House. <em>[Interruption]</em></p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The hon Member says &mdash; from a sedentary position &mdash; that he  was blackmailed. If Sinn F&eacute;in is so easily blackmailed by a Minister&rsquo;s saying  that, if one thing is not done, the other will be done, perhaps it should not  represent people here. If it felt strongly and sorely about that, it should  have opposed accelerated passage. However, collectively, it supported the  accelerated passage of the Bill through the House, after the reasons for that  were given, both to the Committee and to the Assembly, by the Minister.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  Will the member give way?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  I am obliged to give way. <span class="Italic">[Laughter]</span></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  I have you now.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Accelerate passage has been mentioned from the outset of the debate, and certainly during Miss  McIlveen&rsquo;s speech, she talked about getting accelerated passage through  the Committee. In the Committee, I tried to explain that, if accelerated  passage were not granted, people&rsquo;s benefits would cease in mid-June. Under  those circumstances &mdash; and under no others &mdash; there was an obligation to allow  accelerated passage. If Sinn F&eacute;in had its way, there would be several other  amendments before the House today.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>: As I am not a Member of the Committee for Social Development,  I do not know what was said at the Committee meeting. However, having been  present in the Assembly when the Minister for Social Development asked for  accelerated passage for the Bill, I am sure that her request was not made on  those terms. We are now in mid-June and  still debating the Bill.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Had it been the case  that, without accelerated passage, people&rsquo;s benefits would have ceased  in mid-June, I would have at least expected the Members opposite to have said  that they agreed to accelerated passage for the  Bill only under duress or under protest. However, we did not hear even  that; there was general assent in the House  that the Bill should be given accelerated passage.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Perhaps Sinn F&eacute;in Members, like all of us, have been  lobbied by the various groups that are concerned about the issue, but it is not  good enough &mdash; and it is not responsible politics either &mdash; that, after having  agreed to accelerated passage, they now find that they should have thought more  deeply about the matter, give in to the lobby groups and try to blame everyone  else, including the Minister.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Does the Member agree that the granting of accelerated passage does not mean  that we must agree with the Bill throughout its entire process but, rather,  that we forgo the Committee Stage of the Bill? The amendments that we are  discussing today are perfectly within the rules of the Assembly.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  I appreciate that intervention, as it brings me to my second point. Part of the  argument today has been about accelerated passage. Why do the Members opposite  complain about accelerated passage when, as the Member has quite rightly  pointed out, Members have every chance to make amendments now on the floor of  the House? The Members opposite cannot have it both ways. They cannot complain  about accelerated passage and then tell us that the fact that the Bill has been  given accelerated passage does not really matter because amendments can  legitimately be made on the floor of the House, although we have not had the  same opportunity to consider amendments in detail in the Committee.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in Members have argued that holding the Minister to  account is what the Assembly is all about. Of course we want to hold the  Minister to account. That is the job of every one of us here. As she is a  member of another party and I enjoy having a go at members of other parties &mdash;  indeed, as people know, I occasionally enjoy having a go at my own party&rsquo;s  Ministers &mdash; I would have been more than happy to join Sinn F&eacute;in in having a go  at the Minister for Social Development if I thought that she was trying to pull  a fly one on the Assembly, but I do not believe that that is the case. Indeed,  the proposed amendments would hardly hold the Minister to account. If anything,  the amendments would arguably do a disservice to the very people whom Sinn F&eacute;in  claims to want to protect, as I will explain in a moment or two.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I listened to the reasons that the Member gave for  disagreeing with the Bill. He pilloried my colleague from Strangford Miss  McIlveen for being happy simply to adopt parity legislation and to follow  blindly whatever legislation comes through Westminster, as if that was the job of unionists. It is not the job of unionists to  blindly follow bad legislation that comes through Westminster and is introduced into the  Assembly. If such legislation can be amended so that its provisions are tailored to local situations, we will of  course do that. However, given that  the Member stated that not one line of  the Bill had changed since it came from West<span style="letter-spacing:0pt; ">minster</span>, it seems that Sinn  F&eacute;in Members are interested in ensuring only that we do not mimic  legislation that comes from Westminster.  Sinn F&eacute;in Members should not, on the one hand, blame the DUP for blindly  following parity legislation while criticising such legislation simply because  it originated at Westminster.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The basis on which I say that is that I am not so sure that  the proposed amendments show that the Members opposite even have an  understanding of what the Bill is all about. For example, the Member argued  that client advisers are not qualified to make some of these complex  judgements; that is quite true. However,  the assumption behind that view is that client advisers will be making such judgements by themselves, but they will not. They will have a plethora of  available information, whether it be written or oral. People will also  have the right to make representations. It is wrong to say that some client  adviser in a Department of Health, Social Services  and Public Safety office will have  to adjudicate on those matters. The  basis on which the amendments have been tabled is wrong.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">2.00 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr O&rsquo;Dowd used emotional rhetoric in his second argument.  He quoted the sad example of a mother who had  been turned down for benefits and who killed herself. I do not know about those circumstances, and the  Member did not outline the details of the case, but there is no  guarantee that a professional might not have come to exactly the same  conclusion. There is no guarantee that, had a professional made that judgement,  that mother would not have behaved in the same way. It is wrong to suppose that  professionals hold the key to ensuring that such instances do not occur. The  use of such emotional rhetoric shows that the Member knew that the amendments  were weak. He had, therefore, to make such an appeal.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Would the amendments help individuals? Great play has been  made of specifying that:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;a psychiatrist, a  psychologist, a psychiatric nurse or a psychiatric social worker&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">&mdash; and we are not told which would be the most appropriate &mdash;  should be involved in assessing cases:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;in relation to a person in connection with a mental  health condition.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I pointed out in an  earlier intervention that there is no definition  for &ldquo;a mental health condition&rdquo;, or the degree of severity of &ldquo;a mental health condition&rdquo;. In some cases, it  might well be that, when someone has a complex mental-health condition, one of  those professionals would be the best person  to become involved. However, the Bill does not rule that out. The Bill  allows for all such professionals. I would imagine that if people who assess cases feel that there is a need for a  psychiatrist, a neurologist, a heart surgeon, or whatever, they would  seek that help, and the Bill allows for that to happen.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The proposers of amendment No 2 believe that inserting:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;the interview is conducted in a manner that takes  into account the specific needs of the person being interviewed;&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText" style="text-indent:0cm;">is  a safeguard for someone who needs to be interviewed in his or her own  home, or needs to be accompanied to interview. Anything so vague could not be  regarded as a safeguard. The Minister is offering that regulations be made  about notifying people of the place and the manner of the interview, and that  those regulations will be presented to the Committee, which will have an  opportunity to amend them. The Minister can correct me if I am wrong.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  Regardless of the Westminster  legislation, there is ample flexibility to allow the Minister to issue  good-practice guidelines, and each manager  would then be held accountable for the delivery of those guidelines.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  My mind must be easily read &mdash; I hope that it is not. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span><strong></strong>I was about to come to that point.  The regulations allow the Minister to be far more specific than the  amendment would enable her to be. The amendment could offer only general  guidance to some poor caseworker who is left to exercise discretion in regard  to a vague statement. That could be as  dangerous &mdash; or more so &mdash; than a good set of regulations that are well  thought out, tailored to the specific situation, and that take on board all of  the representations that are made. As safeguards, the proposed amendments are  less effective than those offered by the Minister.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I was provoked to speak  because the Member indicated that the DUP had no interest in holding the  Minister to account and that my party blindly follows Westminster  legislation to maintain parity with Great Britain. I hope that I have  made it clear that that is not the case.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: From what the Member said, I assume that he would be happy to  break parity if doing so ensured that the regulations would provide better  services to our people than those regulations that are likely to be introduced  in GB.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  I do not know whether the Member was in the Chamber when I discussed the issue  of parity. I would not be happy to break parity if it would result in  consequences that were detrimental either to the benefits that people receive  or to the size of the Northern Ireland  block grant allocation. On occasions, it might be desirable to break  parity, but, because of the consequences, it may be decided not to. Issues of  parity with Great Britain  should be judged along those lines, not  from a doctrinaire approach that because legislation originates in Westminster it must be sound. Bad legislation sometimes goes  through Westminster.  I oppose the amendments for the reasons that I have given. I support the terms  of the Bill.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>:  Like Mr Wilson, I have been provoked into speaking in this debate. It does not  matter whether it was right or wrong to give  the Bill accelerated passage or how the Committee granted accelerated  passage. The Committee Stage of a Bill&rsquo;s passage is important, and accelerated  passage should never be granted easily.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Belatedly or otherwise,  Members want to discuss the issues at stake in the Bill, rather than the  principle of accelerated passage or how the  Committee operated. Miss McIlveen&rsquo;s  suggestion, that my colleagues had been told what to do after the Committee had assented to accelerated  passage, is most derogatory. Committee members responded as the Minister asked.  However, Members have to ask questions during this stage of the Bill.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is no suggestion that my colleagues have been <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt; ">told how to speak or instructed to ask specific  questions</span>. <span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt; ">It is important that  Members should consider all requests</span> for accelerated passage carefully  and that they should question whether any Minister, from any party, should have  a free run.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Wilson raised the issue about holding the Minister to  account. If the amendments are so minor and unimportant that they will not  result in major change, why does not the Minister accept them? Most Members  have represented people who have had an unfair hearing at a tribunal or a  medical examination. In particular, Members will have received complaints from  individuals that, although they had a thorough physical examination, their  mental illness has not been sufficiently taken into account.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText"><span style="letter-spacing:-.05pt; ">I refer Members to Dr  McDonnell&rsquo;s comments abo</span>ut GPs. In  every other aspect of healthcare, medical experts state that  professional knowledge is needed to deal with certain illnesses and that  consultants are required. We are told that  a small local hospital is inadequate; only a big hospital will have all  the required professional staff to cope with a wide spectrum of illnesses.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, in the Bill, it seems anyone coming off the street  with experience of any aspect of life can examine a person and give a verdict  that can affect that person&rsquo;s entire future. Indeed, some people have taken  their own lives as a result of these decisions.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>: The debate is not about whether specialist knowledge or facilities are needed. It is about  whether it is necessary to specify a particular group of specialists in the Bill in order to allow them to conduct  assessments in cases involving mental  health, or whether the sub&shy;sequent regulations are the appropriate  vehicle for that.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>: I  thank the Member for her remark. However, it serves to emphasise further the fact  that the Bill deals with some issues and qualifications but not others. The purpose of the amendments is to  include in the Bill provisions to deal with particular mental-health  issues. All Members, including the Minister, wants to get the legislation right,  regardless of which party they belong to, so that patients will be protected in  future. It is not a matter of parties debating among themselves but about  getting the legislation right.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText"><span style="letter-spacing:-.2pt; ">I remember hearing a  comment made by a predecessor</span> of the Minister, John Hume, when he was  elected to the old Stormont. He told some colleagues that his argument was no  longer about fighting tribunals but about changing and correcting legislation  to ensure that patients could be protected in future. We must take example from  that. We want to get the legislation right so  that patients will be dealt with fairly in examinations, and can feel that they have been dealt with  fairly. People can find medical  examinations daunting enough, without the added stress of feeling that they  did not get a proper hearing.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>:  Does the Member agree that to decry the opportunity to introduce amendments at  Consideration Stage, or to vote against amendments, is, in effect, to vote for  the legislation on the basis that it is  fault-free and cannot be improved by the Assembly?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>:  That is an important point. There is no legislation that has not been amended  at a different time. We may find that, as this legislation progresses, further  amendments to it will be tabled. Had the Bill received a Committee Stage, more  amendments to it would probably have been tabled.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Patients at medical tribunals are mostly examined by  retired or overworked GPs who spend a short time examining them. However, their  verdict may have long-term repercussions  for those patients. It is important to consider that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am sure that the Minister would be sympathetic to  patients and be concerned about how the legislation affects them. She would  want to ensure that tribunal boards deal fairly, openly and sympathetically  with people with mental illness. However,  that is the Minister. Unfortunately, the person who carries the message  in the ministerial guidelines down through the system is often not as  sympathetic, and, time and again, we have found that examination boards are not  always as sympathetic as the legislation or the Minister.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have attended many tribunals, as I am sure other Members  have. In many cases, the GP has told the patient that if the medical tribunal  wants any further information, it can contact the GP. However, no tribunal  board will ring the GP to obtain additional information or to find out what he  or she thinks of the patient. In practice, that does not happen. We must  therefore ensure that the legislation is correct. Medical examiners must be aware  of all the issues involved, particularly mental-illness issues, so that  patients can be protected and given a sympathetic hearing.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">This is a matter of getting the content of the Bill right.  If we can do that today, we will have done a good day&rsquo;s work. I ask Members not  to oppose the amendments simply because their party has decided to oppose them,  or because the Minister has said that she will be sympathetic in future. If a  provision is not needed in the Bill, do not insert it. However, if changes to the  Bill are necessary, include them in order to ensure that patients are dealt  with properly in future. It is to be hoped that the end product will be  legislation that protects the patients&rsquo; interests, particularly those who  suffer from mental illness. Given that every political party has said that more  resources should be directed at tackling mental illness, we must ensure that  the legislation covers all those issues.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Before the Minister responds, I remind Members that Question Time will begin at  2.30 pm. I may therefore have to interrupt the Minister; however, I will  certainly allow her to continue after Question Time.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for Social Development (Ms Ritchie)</strong>:  At the outset, I wish to extend my sincere condolences  to the Chairman of the Social Development Committee on the recent death  of his mother. My thoughts and prayers are with him at this sad time.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">First, I want to make it perfectly clear that this Bill was  cleared by the Executive. There seems to some amnesia  about that. Secondly, I am a person of integrity and dedication, so I will not be blackmailed by anybody. I want  to put that on record.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The amendments seek to make special provision for persons  suffering from mental-health conditions. I care passionately about, and am  sympathetic to, people who suffer from  mental illness, but the amendments are flawed and unnecessary, and I hope to convince Members of that.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">2.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Amendments No 1 and No 5 are closely linked. Amendment No 1  allows health-related assessments to be carried out by non-medically-qualified  persons where there is a mental-health condition. The purpose of the  health-related assessment is to identify the help and support a person might  need to manage their condition and to overcome barriers that might prevent a  return to the workplace. In many cases, a person&rsquo;s mental-health condition  might be minor compared to their physical-health problems &mdash; we do not know.  Amendment No 1 allows for the assessment to be carried out by a person who has  experience of mental-health conditions, but who does not necessarily have a  medical qualification, even though serious physical-health conditions may be  involved.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 5 seeks to amend clause 55, which deals with  medical examinations and reports that are used to assist the Department, or an  appeal tribunal, in relation to decisions on benefit entitlement. The effect of  amendment No 5 will be, for example, to allow a medical examination to be  carried out by a psychiatric social worker. Considering the types of  examinations and qualifications involved, that is unsuitable. We also need to  consider most carefully how the diverting of psychiatrists  and psychiatric nurses from treating people who have serious  mental-health conditions to assessing people with what might be relatively  minor mental-health problems will impact on the Health Service.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As well as being flawed, the amendments are unnecessary. Clauses 11 and 55 already provide  safe&shy;guards to ensure that those carrying out the assessments and  medical examinations are suitably qualified and appropriately trained. The  definition of healthcare professional is, as it stands, sufficiently wide to  allow flexibility in the future if evidence identifies a skills gap. The provision contains a regulation-making power  that can be used to include other types of healthcare professionals, as  and when appropriate. Sammy Wilson and Dolores Kelly mentioned that. All  healthcare professionals will receive training in assessing people with  mental-health conditions, and the Department for Social Development will ensure  that that remains up to date and effective.  Members will agree that only properly trained healthcare professionals  with appropriate skills should be used to carry out medical examinations and  assessments. The Welfare Reform Bill has the added security and safeguard that  all healthcare professionals must be  approved by the Department for Social Develop&shy;ment before they can  undertake medical examinations and  assessments. Furthermore, access to specialist advice will be available  when necessary.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 2 provides that a work-focused interview  involving a person who has a mental-health condition must take account of the  claimant&rsquo;s needs. I heard what the proposers of the amendment said about that.  I want to ensure that my officials and I are particularly sensitive about such  matters. However, I must remind Members that if amendment No 2 were made, the  legislation could be interpreted as imposing a duty to consider the specific  needs of those with a mental-health condition. Therefore, by implication, consideration of the needs of those who have a  physical-health condition would not be required.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  No, I wish to continue. A person with a relatively minor mental-health  condition will receive special provision under the legislation, but someone  with severe physical disability will not, and that cannot be right.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I hope to deal with the  various issues that Mr McCann raised in his submission.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 2 is unnecessary. All work-focused interviews  will take account of an individual&rsquo;s  specific needs; I can assure the Chamber of that. There will be a system  of safeguards particularly geared to claimants with mental-health problems &mdash; personal advisers will receive specialist  training to give them the skills, knowledge, techniques and confidence <span style="letter-spacing:-.25pt; ">to deal with people with a range of disabilities  or illnesses</span>, including people with mental-health conditions.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I appreciate that many people are suicidal or have taken  their lives; there are also many people with mental-health conditions ranging  from depression to schizophrenia, and there are those who suffer from periodic  mental-health conditions. All people with those conditions must be taken into  account, and we must deal with them in a very sensitive, sympathetic manner.  Those with the most severe mental-health conditions will already be in the  support group, and advisers have the ability to defer interviews where a  claimant is clearly not able to attend or effectively take part. Sensitivity is  the prime issue here. We want to be sensitive to everybody.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">This will be particularly useful for people with conditions  where mental health fluctuates, as so often happens with such illnesses. Such  cases will be approached with sensitivity, applying a range of safeguards, such  as home visits, which were mentioned earlier in the debate. We will be  encouraging a support worker to be present and ensure that there is  pre-interview contact with the claimant when personal advisers can explain their  purpose.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Members for the support from across the Chamber  in opposing these amendments and showing that they are unnecessary.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Brady referred to the changes introduced without  consultation. I want to assure the House that the proposals for employment and  support allowance were the subject of consultation in January 2006. Three  hundred and twenty copies were issued in Northern Ireland to a wide range of  interest groups and potential partners.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Ford referred to general concerns. I am happy to assure  Mr Ford that the existing provisions in the Bill are sufficiently broad to  ensure that people with mental health  conditions will have their needs taken into account and addressed &mdash; as  will people with physical health conditions &mdash; without the need for such  amendments. Mr Ford also referred to parity. I, as a Minister, and Members in  general want very much to bring our own social security legislation forward,  but as various Members have already said,  we are restricted because all of  these issues are predicated on financial considerations. I do not want  to place anybody&rsquo;s entitlement to benefit in jeopardy &mdash; and I am sure nobody in  the House wants that to happen &mdash; but the social security system, is, as most  Members know, extremely complex.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We need to approach any divergence from parity with extreme  caution, as what appears a minor issue can have considerable knock-on effects  given the common systems and computer infrastructure needed in Great Britain and in Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Ford also mentioned the support that personal advisers  receive from healthcare professionals among others, and personal advisers will  continue to ensure that they are sensitive to all the health-related problems  that people face. Personal advisers will be supported in their assessments and  will offer advice and support based on reports from healthcare professionals.  These reports will set out what work-related activity a person may or may not  be able to undertake, given his condition or disability at that time.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McCann referred to benefits that would stop in mid-June.  That is not the case. Employment Support Allowance (ESA) does not come into  effect until 2008. For example, asbestos-related conditions &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. The  impression is being given here that I was misleading the House.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee for  Social Development was told that, unless the Welfare Reform Bill was  given accelerated passage, benefits would  cease. I would like the Minister for Social Development to clarify that  position.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member has made his point clear.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  I am not sure of the point of order, but I will continue.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Employment Support Allowance does not come into effect  until 2008. One group that will be affected if the legislation does not go  through according to the accelerated passage timetable will be those who suffer  from asbestos-related conditions, and their relatives. Proposals later in the  year will help people to claim. We do not want to stop benefits in any way.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">On another issue that Mr McCann raised, the legislation  does not cover specific illnesses but deals with broad categories. Mr Wilson  has already referred to that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McCann said that the  environment for interviews was not  friendly to people with mental-health conditions. I reiterate that all  those who suffer from mental-health conditions  will be treated sympathetically and sensitively. In relation to  work-focused interviews, the Department for Employment and Learning will send  workers to visit people with mental-health conditions in their homes, if that  helps them with the process. We are all aware that some of the disabilities  from which people suffer may mean that they do not wish to leave their homes,  as they have an attachment to their homes and feel frightened.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My officials and I are sensitive to those issues, as are  the Minister for Employment and Learning and his officials. We want to ensure  that everything is done in the proper and correct order, with the greatest  level of sensitivity and sympathy. We are determined to have a conducive, friendly  and supportive environment in order to help and support those with  mental-health conditions. That is our aim and our objective. Mr O&rsquo;Dowd referred  to benefit payment &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: I apologise for interrupting the Minister, but I am conscious that we are moving towards  Question Time. Members may take their ease for a few minutes. The  Minister will be allowed to speak again after Question Time.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The debate stood suspended.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">2.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Deputy  Speaker [Mr Molloy] in the Chair)</p>
	      <p class="H3SectionHeading">Oral Answers To Questions</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Enterprise,  Trade and Investment</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Construction Industry</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">1. <strong>Mr  Brolly </strong>asked the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment what steps  have been taken to reduce accidents,  injuries and fatalities in the construction industry.&nbsp; <a name=AQO81/07>(AQO 81/07)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment (Mr  Dodds)</strong>: Although considerable steps have been taken to reduce incidents, the prospect for further action is  kept under constant review. For example, the Health and Safety Executive for Northern Ireland (HSENI) has placed a quarter of its professional staff in a  compliance team, resulting in more enforcement. More than 70,000  construction workers have been trained under the Buildsafe-NI initiative, and  incidents in public-sector contracts are falling.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The HSENI is also working in partnership with the Construction Employers Federation to ensure that  those in the boardroom accept their prime responsibility for managing  health and safety.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brolly</strong>:  In the case of criminal negligence by a construction company, should the  individual, or individuals, immediately responsible be allowed to escape  sanctions under the cover of corporate guilt?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dodds</strong>: This is an important area of public policy. With regard to  accidents and fatalities, employment in the construction industry in Northern Ireland  is one of the most dangerous activities  that can be engaged in, and it is important that the matter is addressed  urgently.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The particular issue raised by the Member falls outside the  remit of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment, but it is an  important issue, and I will ensure that it is relayed to those with authority  in that area.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gardiner</strong>:  Does the Minister agree that the introduction of a corporate manslaughter Bill  for Northern Ireland, with the added offence of secondary liability for corporate manslaughter, when  justice matters are devolved to the Assembly would contribute to a major  improvement in attitudes to what constitutes adequate safety standards on  construction sites?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dodds</strong>:  The Member raises an issue that is outside the remit of my Department. He  referred to the devolution of justice powers, although I note that other  members of his party and those on this side of the House have made it clear  that they do not foresee any early devolution of justice powers to the  Assembly. If the Member is depending on that for the way forward, he may be  looking in vain.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, his point about corporate manslaughter and  criminal liability is important, and it has been the subject of debate in the  House and elsewhere. As I said in my  previous reply, I will make sure that the Member&rsquo;s comments are relayed  to the appropriate authority.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I am sure that the Minister is aware of the useful training that is carried out  under the Buildsafe-NI initiative. However, I understand that the initiative  applies only to public-sector contracts. Does the Minister feel that it should  be applied to the private sector to improve safety there also?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dodds</strong>: The Member is correct in saying that the initiative applies to public-sector contracts, and  it shows the power that clients can  wield in contract negotiations in the public sector. The Government can  ensure that health and safety considerations are built into the tendering  process and the contractual arrangements.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Many leading companies in Northern Ireland have adopted the  Buildsafe-NI methodology. Also, there are underlying legislative provisions,  which will be improved shortly with new regulations that clarify the role of a  client by making existing health and safety duties more explicit.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Since coming into this post, I have had a meeting with  HSENI officials about the matter and about what more can be done. My colleague  Mr S Wilson from East   Antrim joined me at a  recent meeting with a member of the construction industry. More needs to  be done, and more should be done, in this area in legislation and on a  voluntary basis. The construction industry needs to be encouraged to take the  issues seriously.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">At the end of the day, it cannot be legislated for  entirely. Compliance cannot be inspected; we must educate and enforce at the  same time.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Question 2, in the name of Dr Kieran Deeny, has been withdrawn. Mr  McFarland is not in his place for question 3, so we will move on to question 4.</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Newry: Economic Development</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">4. <strong>Mr Brady </strong>asked the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment to meet business and  community leaders in Newry to develop further the strategy for economic  development for the city. <a name=AQO98/07>(AQO 98/07)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dodds</strong>: We  are getting through the questions at a fair rate.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I recently accepted an  invitation from Newry Chamber of Commerce and Trade to speak at one of  its events later this year. That will give  me an opportunity to engage with local community and business leaders  and to discuss how my Department can work with people in Newry to drive forward an economic agenda in the  area.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Irwin</strong>:  Does the Minister think that Invest Northern  Ireland is doing all it can to attract investment to the Newry area?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dodds</strong>:  Every Member has a view about what additional things could be done for their  local area, not only by Invest Northern Ireland but by many other agencies.  I have considered the issue in advance of my meeting in Newry. Examples of  current partnership activities include: an active involvement in the Newry  greater vision group; a close working relationship with Newry Chamber of  Commerce and Trade; board membership of the local strategy partnership; board  membership of the Newry and Mourne local action group; and support for the implementation of initiatives by  south-eastern economic development (SEED), which is a grouping of a number of  councils in that part of Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Invest Northern Ireland&rsquo;s contribution towards the economic  prosperity and future of Newry and the surrounding area is well known, and the  initiatives that the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment is engaged in for that area are testament to its  commitment and dedication to driving forward economic prosperity.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Does the Minister agree that Newry  city would be a suitable location for financial services work? Will the  Minister actively pursue the possibility of firms from the International  Financial Services Centre in Dublin  locating employment north of the border in places such as Newry while  continuing to pay corporation tax in the Republic?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dodds</strong>: The Department of Finance and Personnel takes the lead on various tax incentives to attract  foreign direct investment, but it is  an issue in which the Depart&shy;ment of Enterprise, Trade and Investment is keenly  interested. I hope that all Members will do everything that they can to support  the Executive&rsquo;s initiative to put the  fiscal regime on a proper standing in order to attract the type of  foreign direct investment that Northern    Ireland needs. I hope that nobody will  undermine that effort and give Sir David Varney or anyone else an excuse to say  that if people are not committed, why should  anyone be committed to them. Politicians should not take a defeatist  attitude.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Invest Northern Ireland  is in the global marketplace, trying to attract as much investment and  employment as possible to Northern    Ireland, including Newry. Northern Ireland is a relatively small place in the global  economy, and it is not a matter for Invest Northern Ireland as to where companies  locate. That is a matter for the potential investor, and it depends on the type  of investment, the clients and the work being undertaken.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I can assure the hon Member that I see my role, and that of  colleagues, as gaining the maximum amount of possible  investment for Northern Ireland in high-quality and high-value-added  sectors. Everybody should share in that prosperity throughout Northern Ireland  &mdash; rural and urban, east and west, North and South.</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Bureaucracy faced by Businesses</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">5. <strong>Mr  Hamilton </strong>asked the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment what plans  he has for addressing the bureaucracy faced  by businesses in Northern    Ireland.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO92/07>(AQO 92/07)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dodds</strong>: My Department co-ordinates the Northern<span style="letter-spacing:0pt; "> Ireland</span> Better Regulation Strategy introduced by the  Executive in 2001. After a recent review, an action plan was agreed by all  Departments. Under the action plan, Departments will, among other things,  commit to better regulation in their corporate and operating plans and review  and simplify regulations and forms where appropriate.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  The Minister will be aware of initiatives to cut bureaucracy operating in the  rest of the UK. What steps will he take to  ensure that Northern Ireland businesses also benefit from those initiatives?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dodds</strong>:  The Member has referred to initiatives that are taking place elsewhere in the  country. Several plans have been drawn up by Whitehall to deal with bureaucracy and to  streamline best practice. The plans cover some 500 actions, including the  removal, consolidation and rationalisation of regulations, measures to simplify  forms and so on. The Northern    Ireland action plan, which flows from the  review of the Better Regulation Strategy,  includes involving Northern Ireland Departments and ensuring that they  adopt and consider, where relevant, what happens in Whitehall Departments.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I assure the Member that I will do everything in my power  to advance the agenda of deregulation, stream&shy;lining bureaucracy, simplifying  form filling, reducing information requests to businesses and removing similar  burdens.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr Robert Coulter</strong>: Will the Minister undertake to review the  business strategies of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment  (DETI), Invest Northern Ireland (INI), the Strategic Investment Board (SIB) and all the various manifestations of  Government intervention with a view to their being led by private enterprise rather than being driven by former quangoists  and civil servants?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dodds</strong>: I  have a great deal of sympathy with the Member&rsquo;s point. I wish to make clear  that, in each of the last three years for which figures are available, DETI&rsquo;s  efficiencies in administration and streamlining of red tape have exceeded  targets. I am determined that everything possible should be done to ensure that  that trend continues because we want, not only in this Department but across  all levels of Government, to ensure that as  much money and resources go to front-line services and delivery for all our people. I  understand where the hon Member is coming from, and, as far as I am  concerned, he will find a receptive ear.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Joint Trade Missions</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">6. <strong>Mr K  Robinson</strong><strong><span style="font-size:11.5pt; "> </span></strong>asked the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment what have  been the outcomes for Northern Ireland  from joint trade missions with the Republic   of Ireland to date.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO64/07>(AQO 64/07)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dodds</strong>:  Three trade missions involving 40 Northern   Ireland companies have been undertaken in collaboration  with Enterprise Ireland. The missions visited India in 2006, Canada in October 2006 and the Gulf  region in January 2007. Companies reported that the visits were of significant  benefit in furthering their interests, generating new business of up to &pound;6  million.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is important to note that the visits are not joint trade  missions. They are organised either by Invest Northern Ireland or Enterprise  Ireland, and companies  throughout the island   of Ireland can join them  as they see fit. I also advise the House that Invest Northern Ireland has  planned 42 trade missions for 2007, while Enterprise Ireland  has planned 103 for the same period.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  Does the Minister accept that any joint trade mission can only result in the  Irish Republic gaining the majority of  business from such missions as its corporation tax sits at 12&middot;5% while  the rate in Northern Ireland is approaching 28%? What exactly will the Minister do to ensure that that joint scheme can  ultimately benefit Northern    Ireland business to the maximum?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dodds</strong>: I  am grateful for the Member&rsquo;s question because it allows me to clarify that he  is labouring under a misunderstanding. As I  indicated in my previous answer, those are not joint missions. If one  removes that premise, the rest of the Member&rsquo;s concerns are stripped away. I  note that the Member has accepted that point by nodding his head.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The trade missions are organised by Invest Northern Ireland or by Enterprise  Ireland.  People are free to join those missions as they see fit. That is a matter for  companies, depending on whether they see any benefit. However, those are not  joint trade missions. That is the type of sensible co-operation with which  people are content. That type of co-operation is useful if it leads to any  benefit. If that is done for any other reason than mutual benefit, it is likely  that people will have questions to ask.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that I have reassured the hon Member with my  response.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>: I  welcome the Minister to his first Question Time. Can the Minister assure the  House that he is satisfied that continued  collaboration with Enterprise Ireland  will result in real and tangible benefits for Northern Ireland companies?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dodds</strong>: I  thank my hon Friend for his kind remarks. Companies and private business are  best placed to make such decisions. They will make the decision to participate  or otherwise, depending on whether they believe that doing so represents good  value for money and is in their interests. That is the way that it should be.  Co-operation must be driven by private companies and private business deciding  what is in their best interests.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As I said earlier, the feedback that we have received from  those companies that participated in a limited number of missions was that there were potential orders to the  tune of some &pound;6 million. Moreover, networking initiatives  were established to help to gain new contacts, develop existing  relationships and explore strategic alliances. In that context, the companies  that have participated in those trade missions obviously found some benefit.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr McDonnell</strong>: I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s comments on the trade missions. Does the Minister fully acknowledge the goodwill that is afforded to us and to our  companies by our Southern colleagues on those missions, whether they be  joint, parallel, or semi-detached? &ldquo;Conjoined&rdquo; is perhaps a better word to  describe those missions. There is a fair amount of goodwill and exchange.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Does the Minister share my view that, as two small regions &mdash; one of four million people and one of  less than two million people &mdash; on the borders of the European Union, it is much better for us to compete  together &mdash; by that, I mean work  together &mdash; on the world stage, rather than competing with, and  neutralising, each other?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dodds</strong>: I  know from our years of collaboration in another place that the Member has a  keen interest in this matter. He asked whether I acknowledge the goodwill: yes,  of course I do. When such goodwill has been  evident &mdash; and it has been &mdash; I readily acknowledge that. In the same way,  companies in the Irish Republic would also recognise the goodwill of Invest  Northern Ireland in the reciprocal arrangement whereby Southern  companies can take part in trade missions that are organised by INI. It is a  two-way process.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As to competition, and the size of the two respective  economies, there may be some instances where there is benefit in collaboration.  Let us consider one such instance &mdash; the single electricity market &mdash; where there  are clear economies to be made through benefits to industry, to consumers and  to security of supply. That is sensible co-operation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, there will be many other instances when, in  certain sectors and in certain areas, it will not necessarily be to our  advantage to collaborate not only with the Irish Republic but with other areas,  regions and countries, because they will be  in direct competition with us. Our job is to ensure that we position Northern Ireland,  whether in collaboration in certain instances or not, as best we can to attract the type of investment that we need to boost economic prosperity for all our  people.</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Corporation Tax</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">7. <strong>Mr Cree </strong>asked  the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment  what discussions his Department has had with officials from regional  Governments in Wales and Scotland in relation to proposals for lowering  corporation tax in Northern    Ireland.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO69/07>(AQO  69/07)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dodds</strong>: My  Department has had no formal contact with officials from the regional  Governments in Wales or Scotland on  proposals for lowering the rate of corporation tax. Any such engagement is a  matter for the Department of Finance and Personnel, which would be acting on  behalf of the Executive.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>: I  thank the Minister for that. Does a platform exist for similar discussions with  the English regions, whether conducted by  himself or his colleagues, with a view to having lower corporation tax  for the UK  as a whole?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dodds</strong>: I  again thank the Member for raising that important issue. My Department will  always try to work with colleagues in any other part of the United Kingdom &mdash; whether it is England, Scotland  or Wales &mdash; to try to advance something that we believe  would be in the best interests of  the economy of Northern    Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As the Member is aware, the Scottish First Minister is visiting the Assembly today, something that  has rightly been recognised in most  sensible quarters as an oppor&shy;tunity to build relationships to advance  the economic cause of Northern    Ireland and other regions. Therefore, I welcome the hon Member&rsquo;s indication that it is  actually beneficial to be in collaboration with other regions of the United Kingdom.  To insult representatives of Governments of other parts of the United Kingdom  is not a sensible or productive way  forward. As the &lsquo;News Letter&rsquo;  editorial rightly pointed out, the devolved Admin&shy;i<span style="letter-spacing:-.3pt; ">stration</span>s should work together on those important issues and gain the best for Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and  Investment (Mr Durkan)</strong>: As Chairperson of the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and  Investment, I welcome the Minister to his first Assembly Question Time.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister emphasised earlier the need for people to  concentrate on the Varney review of corporation tax. Does the Minister agree  that, in that context, if parties and Committees in the Assembly are going to  marshal their efforts in the direction of that review, which has been given specifically to the Northern Ireland  Assembly, it might be a bit premature to engage too heavily in  canvassing other options &mdash; which we might have to consider in the medium term &mdash;  with other parts of the United Kingdom?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dodds</strong>: I  thank the hon Member for his words of welcome, and I look forward to working  with him in his capacity as Chairperson of the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Investment. I welcome  his contribution thus far, and that of his Committee, on many of the serious issues that we have to  grapple with.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member made a good point. All of our efforts should be  concentrated on trying to win the main argument, which is for a reduction in  corporation tax to a level that would make a significant difference within a  relatively short period of time.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There are other areas  that need investment &mdash; whether or not we get a corporation tax reduction  &mdash; including stimulating enterprise, stimulating innovation, building up our  infrastructure and improving our skills and education. All of that has to  happen. People should not say that it is not going to happen as that is  obviously an open invitation for Sir David Varney to report that not even the  Northern Ireland Assembly, or certain parties in the Northern Ireland Assembly,  are seriously in support of that happening. Alternatively, the view could be  taken that we are now going to concentrate on a range of other measures,  falling short of the main target. It may be that that will be the case, but at  this juncture, we need to be pressing strongly for what all of us have  recognised, or certainly what most of us recognise &mdash; there may be other parties  present or other spokesmen who do not recognise that &mdash; would be a major boost  for the Northern Ireland economy.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Miss Mcllveen</strong>:  Does the Minister have any plans to meet with his Scottish and Welsh  counterparts to discuss matters of mutual interest?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dodds</strong>:  Yes, I certainly do intend to meet with my  Scottish and Welsh counterparts, and I have already been in touch with  them to seek early meetings. I have done so despite the advice given to me by  members of the Ulster Unionist Party, who seem to take the view that we should  no longer meet with the Scottish Executive, that somehow we should insult our  friends, that we should go down the road of insulting the Scottish people, and  all the rest of it &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I hear sedentary comments being made to my right. The  approach suggested by the Ulster Unionist Party is not the approach that should be taken &mdash; that is not the way to win friends, and it is not the way to promote Northern    Ireland. It is strange that a unionist party is saying that Members should not  meet their Scottish colleagues. I would have thought that we would want to  promote an Ulster-Scots connection. There was a time when that party heavily  promoted North/South Ministerial Council meetings at the expense of east-west  relations.</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Invest Northern    Ireland</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">8. <strong>Mrs Long </strong>asked the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment to outline three key  &lsquo;unique selling points&rsquo; that Invest Northern Ireland should use to promote Northern Ireland  as an investment location.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO121/07>(AQO  121/07)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dodds</strong>: Generally, Invest Northern Ireland&rsquo;s sales message is  based on skills, quality and availability, competitive  costs and excellent infrastructure, including property, transport and telecoms. Specifically, Northern    Ireland&rsquo;s unique selling points will depend on the potential investor and on the  other locations competing for investment. Since 2002, Invest Northern Ireland has  secured 169 international investment projects, levering over &pound;1 billion of  investment and, in that time, it has promoted 23,720 new and safeguarded jobs.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his response, particularly  the emphasis on skills and their availability in Northern Ireland.  Does the Minister recognise that there are disincentives to inward investment,  not only from the fiscal initiatives that  were mentioned earlier but through the visible signs of division and  segregation in our community? Has he considered any impetus or contribution  that his Department could provide to start addressing some of those  disincentives in order to benefit the entire community?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dodds</strong>:  The cost of segregation is a recurring theme  for the Alliance Party. No doubt, during virtually every Question Time  and every ministerial statement, the contributions from its Members will  mention the need to do more with resources and will be along the lines that the  Member has outlined. Of course, we all know that that does not provide  straightforward or immediate answers to any of those matters. Instead, we must  ensure that, within current resources and within resources emanating from the forthcoming comprehensive spending  review, Northern Ireland is best positioned to attract the required investment  and to build up our indigenous companies and firms to make them more export-led  and driven.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that the Alliance Party will join those of us who are seeking to create more efficiencies and  stream&shy;lining within the Assembly. The Member speaks of the waste of  resources due to segregation. However, I am conscious that her party was one of  the main drivers behind the Belfast Agreement arrangements, which resulted in a plethora of quangos and  institutional bodies that drain millions of pounds from front-line  services. When my party raised that issue  in the previous Assembly and tried to amend it, her party voted against  it on every occasion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  What is Invest Northern Ireland  doing to improve the quality and  availability of a skilled workforce in Northern Ireland? Will the Minister  assure the House that he and Invest Northern Ireland are doing everything  possible to attract some of that investment to the west of the Province? I am  thinking, unsurprisingly, of Fermanagh and South Tyrone.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dodds</strong>: I  am not in the least surprised that the hon Member should highlight the needs of  Fermanagh and South Tyrone. He works assiduously, along with his colleague Mrs  Foster, on behalf of his constituents.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department for  Employment and Learning (DEL) has the lead role in skills development &mdash;  indeed, the Member will have an opportunity shortly to quiz the Minister for that Department &mdash; although my Department  and Invest Northern Ireland work closely with DEL to ensure that skills are built up and that they are in place to  meet the business needs and challenges of the future.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I give a commitment to the Member, as I have to other  Members, that in raising the economic prosperity of Northern Ireland,  I want all areas to benefit. I am glad that  some of my first visits as Minister to see companies at first hand were to businesses in the west of  the Province. Indeed, Fujitsu&rsquo;s recent announcement of the creation of  328 new jobs in the north-west and an investment of &pound;18 million in very  high-value, high-tech jobs, along with another 80 jobs in Belfast, is excellent news.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.00 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McHugh</strong>:  Will the Minister work with Invest Northern  Ireland  and others to resolve planning difficulties for new businesses along the border areas? In those areas, two  out of three local businesses have been lost to the Twenty-six Counties because  of planning difficulties and the difficult matter of red tape.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dodds</strong>: I  will do what I can. I have already held meetings with the Minister of the  Environment on some of those matters, and I will continue to do so.</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Employment and Learning</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Undergraduate Places</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">1. <strong>Mr Elliott </strong>asked the Minister for  Employment and Learning what has been the number of undergraduate  student places available in Northern    Ireland higher education institutions over  the last five years.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO87/07>(AQO 87/07)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning (Sir Reg Empey)</strong>: The number of available full-time  undergraduate student places in Northern Ireland universities during the past  five academic years are as follows: in 2002-03, there were 22,802 places; in  2003-04, there were 22,928 places; in 2004-05, there were 23,284 places; in  2005-06, there were 23,530 places; and in 2006-07, there were 23,755 places.  There are also an additional 3,658 places that have been made available in  further education colleges, and approximately 1,510 initial teacher education  places. Please note that those figures represent full-time, funded  undergraduate places only. There are also significant part-time enrolments at  our institutions.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his reply. It is good to see him on the Floor of the  House at his first Question Time. I wish him well in his post. Given those  increasing numbers, does the Minister have any plans to increase the number of  undergraduate student places at Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  higher education institutions in the near future?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Sir Reg Empey</strong>:  That is a question that I am asked frequently. My predecessor, the  Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Northern Ireland Office Maria  Eagle, reviewed the situation earlier this year and decided not to increase the  maximum student number (MaSN), which places  a limit on the number of students in  each university. However, I am looking closely at the possibility of some limited &mdash; but targeted &mdash; increases.  Therefore, while we will not necessarily have a general increase, there could be circumstances in which we  would decide to increase student  places for certain disciplines.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I point out to the  Member that it costs approximately &pound;10 million a year for every 1,000  students, plus whatever estate costs would be associated with that in the  institution. It is the case &mdash; and perhaps this is what the Member is getting at  &mdash; that a significant number of our student-age applicants have to avail of  places in universities elsewhere in the British Isles.  That is a matter of regret, and that is the position at this stage.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>: I  join Mr Elliott in welcoming the Minister to his first Question Time in this  Assembly. As the Minister examines options for relaxing the MaSN cap in various  ways, and in various specialisms, will he pay particular attention to the University of Ulster&rsquo;s Magee campus, which has been  particularly restricted, and suffers from  the MaSN cap more harshly than others?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The University   of Ulster has produced  plans that would indicate a capacity of 10,000 students places at the Magee  campus. Land is now available due to Foyle and Londonderry College&rsquo;s  relocation to Clooney. As the Minister looks for targeted adjustments, will he particularly bear in mind the situation at Magee  campus?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Sir Reg Empey</strong>:  I thank the hon Member for his comments. I am immensely surprised that he has  asked me that question. I have already  talked to the University of Ulster&rsquo;s vice chancellor, and I know that the university is  anxious to move forward. I am prepared to consider the Member&rsquo;s request. However, I must tell the Member that  targeted adjustments would be only for specific disciplines.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I do not believe that, at this stage, and with scarce resources, one can allow a generalised increase  in student places across the board. The resources to do that are not  there. Moreover, one must remember the outcomes that one wishes to achieve,  particularly with a view to ensuring that there is a very strong link between  our economy and our institutions of higher education.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I will look at that specific point for the Member.</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Tuition Fees</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">2. <strong>Mr  Attwood </strong>asked the Minister for Employment and Learning if there is evidence  that tuition fees are contributing to a reduction in third-level education  applicant numbers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO89/07>(AQO 89/07)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Sir Reg Empey</strong>: It is too early to gauge the impact of variable tuition fees as  we are still in the first academic year of the new arrangements. A recently  published University and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS) analysis of  accepted applicants indicates a decrease between 2005-06 and 2006-07, but that  is a likely consequence of the increase in applicants experienced in 2005-06,  which was the last academic year before the introduction of variable fees.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  It is difficult to analyse the evidence at this early stage, but does the  Minister agree that the Department should be vigilant with tuition fees, given  that over the last four years there was a decrease in applicant numbers each  year? Although the evidence is yet to emerge fully, there are indications,  unlike the situation in Britain,  of a further decrease in applicants to universities in the North.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Sir Reg Empey</strong>:  I am aware of the hon Member&rsquo;s concern on  that. We had a discussion a couple of weeks ago on it. He is correct to  say that the early indications point to a slight decrease in university  applicants, but the Department does not feel that there is sufficient evidence at its disposal to come to a judgement. However,  the Department&rsquo;s objective is to encourage as many people as possible into further and higher education, and I  do not wish to see unnecessary obstacles placed in the <span style="letter-spacing:.05pt; ">way. It must be remembered that the decision to </span>introduce  tuition fees was a controversial one at the outset and that virtually every party in the Chamber expressed  reservations. The Department will review the situation, but it must have solid  information, and I hope that the information will become available by September  or October. I undertake to keep the Member informed.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  Does the Minister accept that any fee reduction that may be contemplated by his  Depart&shy;ment should relate to economically-relevant subject areas rather than to higher education courses in  general?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Sir Reg Empey</strong>:  I note the hon Member&rsquo;s use of the phrase &ldquo;fee reduction&rdquo;, which indicates how  he feels about the subject. There is much pressure, because of the growing  economic linkages between further and higher education and business, to have  further and higher education more targeted. The hon Member will hear more from  me later in the year, as we must cut our coat according to our cloth. A general  education for our students is something to be welcomed, but the economic  consequences must be remembered in the face  of global competition. It is important that Northern Ireland has the maximum skill base in the subject matters  that are likely to be of economic relevance. I hope to return later this year with further elaboration on that point.</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">PhD Courses</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">3. <strong>Mr  Kennedy </strong>asked the Minister for Employment and Learning what plans he has to  increase the number of places available on PhD courses.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=AQO77/07> (AQO 77/07)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Sir Reg Empey</strong>: The Department received a proposal from the two Northern Ireland  universities, via the Economic Development Forum, for an increase in PhD places  and has bid for additional places from the Chancellor&rsquo;s Fund for Innovation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The bid also may be  considered as part of the compre&shy;hensive spending review. In addition,  my Department is preparing for a review of  the wider policy and funding of postgraduate places.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his reply. I also join other Members in welcoming him  to his first Question Time in this Assembly. I wish him well.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">What are the implications of the Chancellor&rsquo;s innovation  fund, proposed in November 2006, for the numbers of postgraduate students?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Sir Reg Empey</strong>:  At the Chancellor&rsquo;s conference in Downing Street  in November 2006, and again in March this year, it was known that the  Chancellor himself suggested the idea of an  innovation fund. The Chancellor has a  particular interest in funding research and science-based subjects.  Indeed, he has provided significant tax relief to businesses that operate in  those areas.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Along with other Departments, the Department for Employment  and Learning has bids ready to avail of the benefit of the innovation fund.  However, it is becoming apparent that all that glitters is not gold. The  Department is struggling to ascertain whether the fund can be turned into a  usable instrument, as there are difficulties with its current structure. That  is why, in answer to Mr Kennedy&rsquo;s first question, I mentioned bidding through  the usual comprehensive spending review process.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The message from the Economic  Development Forum &mdash; as the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment  will know &mdash; is that the universities, supported by business, trades unions and  others represented on the forum, are firmly recommending more postgraduate  places. Ultimately, the business world is telling us that particular  disciplines are short of people with PhDs.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the Far East, for example, almost 1&middot;2 million PhDs a  year are awarded in China  and India.  Northern Ireland  is up against huge competition. I can only say to the Member that the  Department will do everything in its power to maximise the number of  postgraduate places in order to pursue the wider objective, which is widely supported throughout the business and  academic communities.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>:  In the light of the high cost of postgraduate education, especially the  often prohibitive fees for postgraduate  courses, what steps does the Minister intend to take to widen access to  postgraduate education, particularly for students from working-class or less  affluent backgrounds?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Sir Reg Empey</strong>:  That is an important point, as the cost of postgraduate education is  considerable. Bidding through the comprehensive spending review and the  innovation fund for extra postgraduate places will help the Department in financing those places. However,  there is a separate issue with the  fees that students would have accumulated before they get to the point  of applying for a PhD. We want to encourage  more students to come forward. I am  specifically considering proposals on how to alleviate risks and how to  deal with the very point that the Member made.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is obvious that  there is a shortage of postgraduates. The Republic&rsquo;s national  development plan is already concentrating  on a strategy for a fourth level of education. Indeed, the Government of  the Republic have put &euro;1&middot;2 billion aside for research and development and to  spend in that academic area. It is absolutely necessary to ensure that we are  able to compete. I am looking closely at the issue.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr McDonnell</strong>:  Like other Members, I welcome the Minister to his first Question Time.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Does the Minister agree that a significant increase in  R&amp;D capacity, through increased numbers of PhD graduates, is desirable for  an expansion of industry? Does he further agree that there is a particular need  to focus on science subjects, especially the commercial&shy;isation of the  considerable biotech, life science and healthcare facilities?</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Sir Reg Empey</strong>: I agree entirely with the Member; he has hit the nail on the  head. At present, the Department funds about 150 new awards each year and about  500 at any one time. It is clear that there is greater demand, which is focused  on the areas of study to which the Member referred. Ultimately, however, it is  for the universities to decide which  applicants to take. However, that appertains to the question that was  asked by the Member for North Down: those two matters must be brought together. The Department is seized of the  urgency of that. It has put forward bids with the Department of Finance  and Personnel for the comprehensive spending review and the higher education  innovation fund. In the past few weeks, I have had meetings with the vice chancellors of both universities. I have met the  Economic Development Forum and, last week, met the Northern Ireland  Business Alliance. Everyone is pushing in the same direction; it is a critical  part of the Department&rsquo;s agenda. I assure the Member that it will do all that  it possibly can to achieve the goal to which he referred.</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Funding</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">4. <strong>Mrs Long </strong>asked the Minister for Employment and Learning what proposals exist to  ensure that the funding changes in further education do not prevent people from  engaging in recreational learning.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO113/07>(AQO 113/07)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Sir Reg Empey</strong>:  Although the Department sets the strategic direction for the further-education  sector in Northern Ireland  and channels its funding accordingly, each college is responsible for its  curriculum. The new funding model that is used to distribute the  further-education recurrent grant to colleges does not prevent people from engaging in recreational learning.  Under the new arrangements, there is only a marginal difference in the  average funding that is available to colleges for students on recreational  courses. In addition, under their own fees policies, colleges can choose to  charge fees for some recreational courses.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his welcome response, which reflects the importance of  recreational learning as well as study for economically relevant  qualifications. The Minister&rsquo;s portfolio encompasses both employment and learning.  Does he agree that in order to create an educational environment where there is  a culture of lifelong learning, it is important that people engage with  education at all levels, not just to provide  them with the skills that are crucial for economic growth but to enhance  their quality of life and their engagement  in society and to engender the discipline for and the enjoyment of learning throughout their lifetime?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Sir Reg Empey</strong>:  I find little, if anything, to disagree with in the Member&rsquo;s comments; in the  past couple of weeks, I have received  questions from several Members on  that issue. I asked to be shown the amount of money that the Department  is putting into those areas of education. During the past few years, the  variation has been marginal. However, I must emphasise that, ultimately, the  colleges choose which courses they offer. They can decide to charge fees to  cover all or part of the costs of a course.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member raised the additional issue of lifelong learning  for recreational purposes. Further to that is learning that, for certain  individuals, has therapeutic benefits, and which provides an opportunity for  those who have suffered trauma to get back to work. They may choose to embark  on a course that is somewhat less challenging as a starting point from which to  return to education. I realise that the issue is not simply about whether  people should enrol on flower-arranging courses, for example, but of the wider  benefits that lifelong learning can bring them. Many Members take that issue  seriously.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Resources have not been removed on a large scale. However &mdash; and this also appertains to previous  questions on higher education &mdash; the allocation of money for further  education has had to become more targeted. Although I accept entirely the  Member&rsquo;s comments on lifelong learning, the Assembly needs to understand that,  inevitably, colleges have to prioritise resources. If the Member has any  concerns, I hope that she will, by all means, let me know what they are, so  that we can deal with them individually.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>: Will the Minister ensure that retired people do not feel excluded and will be able to participate in  recreational learning without concern over excessive fees that they cannot  afford?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Sir Reg Empey</strong>:  I assure the Member that retired people are very active in learning.  Appertaining to Mrs Long&rsquo;s question, I  recently visited the Holywood Arches Library in my constituency to see  the &ldquo;silver surfers&rdquo; in action. I can tell the Member for Foyle that the room was jam-packed with senior citizens who were learning  computer skills with the help of volunteers from Business in the Community.  They were not learning for commercial reasons but in order to keep in touch  with others and to access information. People there can also engage in remote  learning. It was terrific to see those people enjoying what they were doing and  benefiting from it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is obvious that, given the way in which society is  going, the contribution that more senior members of our community are being  required to make to the economy is growing all the time. It would be a foolish  mistake to throw away that resource. Those of us in the Chamber may have to  work until we are in our eighties. I do not know whether that is a good message  to send out or not.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>:  Question 5, standing in the name of Dr Deeny, has been withdrawn.</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Campus Plans</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">6. <strong>Dr Farry </strong>asked the Minister for Employment and Learning what plans exist to link the  new-build North Down and Ards campus in Bangor with the North   Down Business Park at Rathgael.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=AQO116/07> (AQO 116/07)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Sir Reg Empey</strong>:  The new technology innovation centre at the North Down and Ards Institute&rsquo;s Bangor campus will  provide training facilities for industry and a number of pre-incubation units  to support student business start-ups. That will complement the institute&rsquo;s  links with the North Down Development Organisation (NDDO) and North Down  Borough Council, and that, in turn, will help to create new business  opportunities.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: As  a member of North Down Borough Council, I  declare an interest. I welcome the Minister for to his first Question  Time as Minister for Employment and Learning.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Does the Minister recognise that it was a lost opportunity  for part of the campus not to be co-located with the business park? Moreover,  what plans does he have to try to encourage  links between further education colleges and business to ensure the best  match between the skills that people are being taught and the needs of  employers?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Sir Reg Empey</strong>:  I had the pleasure of attending the opening of the new South Eastern   Regional College  a couple of weeks ago, the headquarters of which is in the Member&rsquo;s  constituency. I was encouraged by what I saw and heard there. It has an  extremely active board of governors, and high-quality staff who are clearly  determined to succeed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In recent discussions between Invest Northern Ireland, the Department and local colleges, and  at the college&rsquo;s launch in Bangor  a couple of weeks ago, the message that came across strongly was the need to  link education and business. The chairman of the board of governors of the new  college is leading from the front.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I understand the Member&rsquo;s point about the physical  arrangements, but I am confident that the college is determined to overcome any  difficulties through the student business start-up scheme with incubation units  and working with the business village. The will and expertise to succeed  exists. The Member will know that his local authority has established the  SIGNAL Centre of Business Excellence, which is one of the leading economic development organisations in Northern Ireland. The Member will also know of one of Northern    Ireland&rsquo;s leading entrepreneurs, Mr Ian Pennick, who is also involved with that.  I am confident that the determination  and skills of the staff at the South   Eastern Regional College should alleviate any concerns that he may have.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>: What plans does the Minister have to ensure that students who go down the vocational route can be  assured that they will have an apprenticeship placement in what seems to be a  shrinking base for would-be plumbers and joiners?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Sir Reg Empey</strong>:  The Member touches on something that is  extremely important to our community. We loosely describe such courses  as vocational. Instead, we want to describe  them as professional and technical, because, sadly, there is an  implication that vocational activities are somehow of less value than academic  subjects. That could not be further from the truth. The House may have to  return to that issue.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member has hit the nail on the head with regard to where more effort must be concentrated. I am  satisfied that the colleges are  seized of the issue. As the Member will know, there is an excellent  group of people in her constituency. Indeed, rebuilding is to take place in  Newtownards.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A few years ago, we threw away apprenticeships. Now, we must bring them back. I can assure the  Member that the Department is determined to work, and is increasingly working, with employers and trade  unions. People are now getting  contracts before they commence their training.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members will recall that the parliamentary report on the  Jobskills programme was highly critical of the way things were going. We are  trying a new method; we will just have to see whether it works. However, I  assure the Member that the Department is seized of the importance of her point.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>: I  welcome the Minister to his first Question Time.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As a member of North Down Borough Council, I am interested  in this matter. Initially, it was envisaged <span style="letter-spacing:-.05pt; ">that  an incubation-innovation unit would be establ</span>ished at the North Down   Business Park.  The Minister mentioned the innovation unit. Can he confirm that an <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt; ">incubation unit will be included in the building c</span>urrently  under construction at the extended campus site in Bangor&rsquo;s  Castle Park?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Sir Reg Empey</strong>:  I acknowledge the Member&rsquo;s <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt; ">comments. I know  that he has had personal involvemen</span>t in economic development in north  Down for many years. In April 2006, ministerial approval was given for a &pound;15  million capital project at the North Down and Ards Institute of Further and  Higher Education, which comprises a technology and innovation centre and a  performing arts centre at the Bangor  campus, and a construction centre at the Newtownards campus.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Included in the technology and innovation centre will be a  number of pre-incubation units to support student business start-ups. The  project is at the design stage, with a target completion date of December 2009  for the Bangor  campus. It will address the shortfall in accommodation provision in each of the  faculties and target those areas of accommodation that are no longer fit for  purpose. I hope that that answer will assure the Member that action is being  taken; it should also refer to Dr Farry&rsquo;s point.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am confident that the people of north Down understand  fully the urgency of, and the need for, the project. The set of pre-incubation  units is slightly more innovative than providing accommodation for existing  businesses. Rather it provides accommodation to e<span style="letter-spacing:-.05pt; ">ncourage young people to get a sense of what it means</span> to be in  business. I am confident that the model in that college will be successful.</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Fermanagh   College</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">7. <strong>Mr  McHugh </strong>asked the Minister for Employment and Learning what steps he will  take to address the failure of Fermanagh   College to facilitate the  third year of higher level courses.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=AQO100/07> (AQO  100/07)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Sir Reg Empey</strong>:  My Department&rsquo;s policy is that further education colleges, including Fermanagh College, can offer only the first and  second years of a degree programme. The university that validates the degree  should provide the final year of tuition.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McHugh</strong>:  Is it fair that, at the end of a very expensive course, students &mdash; particularly  young mothers with expenses and childcare difficulties &mdash; do not obtain their  certificates because they have to travel to Ballymena, Magherafelt or elsewhere  from, for example, Fermanagh, to finish the third years of their courses?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Sir Reg Empey</strong>:  I understand the Member&rsquo;s point &mdash; that could be a barrier to employment for  that type of individual. However, the universities can, in certain  circumstances &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong><span style="letter-spacing:-.2pt; ">Mr Deputy Speaker</span></strong>: I have to interrupt you, Minister.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Sir Reg Empey</strong>: I will write to the Member about that.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Education</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Staff Protection</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">1. <strong>Mr  McCarthy </strong>asked the Minister of Education what consideration has been given  to adopting similar protocols in schools as  those now operational in hospitals, to protect staff from assault.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO106/07>(AQO 106/07)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education (Ms Ruane)</strong>: Assaults on school staff are unacceptable, and I  condemn all such attacks. School boards of governors have a duty to encourage  good behaviour and discipline, and my Department will continue to work with  employers to ensure that discipline policies are effective and that staff  receive the support that they need and deserve.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Schools should be a safe haven, not only for pupils but  also for teachers and support staff. My Department is currently reviewing the available guidance on security and personal safety in schools and the support  available to staff. I have asked that that review should include  consideration of protocols in other organisations, such as those used in the  Health Service.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her answer, and I  welcome her to the House on her first opportunity to answer questions as  the Minister of Education.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The purpose of my  question is to highlight the safety of everyone in school compounds.  Does the Minister agree that, although appropriate training and advice is given to everyone involved in education, the  prevention of assaults of any kind is  paramount and children should not be disturbed by any such activity?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane</strong>:  Absolutely: prevention is paramount. That is why it is important that a culture  of democracy be created in schools, where everyone is respected &mdash; pupils and  teachers &mdash; and why the complex and wide-ranging issue of bullying must be  considered. My Department is currently working on an anti-bullying strategy, is  part of the anti-bullying forum, and will soon publish a report on that issue.  Schools must be open and democratic, and prevention is the best cure.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr Robert Coulter</strong>: With the number of teacher assaults  rising at an alarming rate, will the Minister have talks with her colleague the  Minister of Health to ensure that teachers are included in a measure similar to  the emergency workers&rsquo; protection legislation that was voted for in the  Assembly on 22 May?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane</strong>:  Would the Member mind repeating the question? I missed a bit of it.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr Robert  Coulter</strong>: My pleasure. With the <span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt; ">number  of teacher assaults rising at an alarming rate, wil</span>l the Minister have talks with her colleague the  Minister of Health to ensure that  teachers are included in a measure similar  to the emergency workers&rsquo; protection legislation that was voted for by  the Assembly on 22 May?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane</strong>: As  I have said, assaults on school staff are unacceptable and I condemn all such  attacks. If the Minister of Health is open to a meeting &mdash; which I am sure he is  because I have already met him on a range of  issues &mdash; we will discuss this matter. My Department is currently reviewing the available guidance on  security and personal safety in  schools and the support available to  staff, and I have asked that the review should include consideration of  protocols, particularly in the Health Service, but also in other organisations.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Boylan</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I finally have a question to ask.  Schools are quick to suspend teachers. Will  schools be given adequate powers to  suspend pupils in cases of attacks on teachers? Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane</strong>:  Sorry, I was upsetting the protocols. I thank  the Member for his question. Schools already have those powers. School  principals have the authority to suspend pupils for up to five days for any  breach of the school discipline policy, and, with the approval of the board of  governors, can extend that to 45 days. With regard to the suspension of  teachers, only the principal or the  chairperson of the board of governors may suspend a member of school  staff. The employing authority must be consulted before a suspension is  imposed, or as soon as possible thereafter.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Precautionary suspension should not be automatic, and some  preliminary investigation by social services representatives and/or the PSNI  may be necessary before a decision to suspend can be taken properly, even as a  precautionary measure. However, as I said to Kieran McCarthy, we must try to  create a situation in which preventive  measures are preferred to disciplinary interventions in schools &mdash;  although disciplinary measures are sometimes necessary. Early intervention is  the key to the problem.</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Special Needs Children</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">2. <strong>Mrs Long </strong>asked the Minister of Education what provision she is making to ensure that  special needs children displaced by school closures, such as that of Lisnasharragh High School, have access to alternative  places in schools of their choice. <a name=AQO105/07>(AQO  105/07)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat. Statements for children with special educational needs are  maintained by education and library boards  and are subject to annual in-school review. When an education and  library board is aware that a school is  closing, or a change of place&shy;ment is required for other reasons, the  annual review process enables future  placement options to be discussed with the child&rsquo;s parents so that  planning can commence for the next academic year.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If the child&rsquo;s parents  are dissatisfied with the proposed alternatives,  they have a choice of two routes &mdash; informal or formal &mdash; to raise their  concerns. The informal route is a  cross-board dispute avoidance and resolution service, which provides  opportunities to resolve areas of disagreement between parents and schools  and/or boards. Participation in that process is voluntary. The formal route, which is set in special education  legislation, gives parents the right  to appeal to the special educational needs and disability tribunal.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">An agreement has been reached with the parents of six of the eight pupils who currently attend Lisnashar<span style="letter-spacing:0pt; ">ragh</span> High School, and who hold statements of special educational  needs maintained by the South Eastern Education and Library Board, to transfer  to another secondary school in the area. In consultation with the parents of the remaining two pupils, a  decision will be made for suitable placement as a result of their annual  review process. The Belfast Education and Library Board (BELB) currently  maintains a statement of special educational needs for one additional pupil at  Lisnasharragh High School; the BELB will work with that child&rsquo;s parents to  secure a suitable alternative before the school is closed.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>: I  thank the Minister for her detailed response;  in the light of that, I wish to raise an additional related matter.  Recent studies have shown that more than 80% of children with special  educational needs experience bullying in the classroom. Indeed, several pupils  transferred to Lisnasharragh   High School because of  bullying in other schools in the area. Will the Minister reassure the House  that, in the event of school closures in the future, special provision will be  made to ensure that factors such as bullying are taken into account when  children are relocated?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane</strong>: I will reassure the Member. Bullying must be dealt with at  every level of society. The Department of Education is a member of the  anti-bullying forum, which has counterparts  in the South of Ireland, England, Scotland  and Wales,  and comprises the education and library  boards and various children&rsquo;s rights organisations, with which the  Department works closely. The forum has produced a report that will be launched  by the Department of Education in the near future.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We must ensure that the most vulnerable children are protected.  Many changes are required in education and throughout society. We must  determine the causes of bullying; children with special needs are just as  likely to be bullied as other pupils. As Minister of Education, I take those  matters very seriously and will continue to do so.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">On the other hand, I have visited so-called &ldquo;main&shy;stream&rdquo;  schools with units in which children with moderate and severe learning  disabilities, as well as <span style="letter-spacing:-.25pt; ">pupils with some  physical disabilities, are accom</span>modated. Those units have a hugely positive impact on the school and help  to create a culture of respect for children with special educational needs. I  attended a sporting event in Kilkeel at the weekend, at which children with  special needs were integrated into a competitive event in a beautiful way. That  is an example of the way in which we can combat bullying against children with  special needs, children from ethnic minorities or children belonging to any  sector of the community.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Spratt</strong>:  As a member of the board of governors at Lisnasharragh High School, I know that the principal, <span style="letter-spacing:-.3pt; ">Mrs  Thompson, has done an excellent job assisting par</span>ents of special needs  children to place them in other schools.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister ensure that officials of the South  Eastern Education and Library Board fully assist in that task, as promised  during the consultation process on the closure?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane</strong>: The board is working with Lisnasharragh High School, as I said in a previous answer. The South Eastern Education and Library Board works very  closely with the children and the school to find alternative placements.  Change of any kind can be difficult, and it is important that the board and the  Department ensure that the transition is as seamless and easy as possible for  those children, their parents and the school.</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">School Starting Age</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">3. <strong>Mr B  McCrea </strong>asked the Minister of Education if she is in favour for delaying the  age at which children first attend primary school, and if so, what is the  rationale for this.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=AQO95/07> (AQO 95/07)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane</strong>:  The question is a very important one, and I thank the Member for it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have no plans to change the starting age for compulsory  education; however, I recognise that we have the youngest starting age in Europe, and that worries me.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The revised curriculum will start in September, and I welcome  that, because our children start very young. The transition from pre-school to  primary school needs to be as happy and stress-free as possible, because, as I  said earlier, change can be difficult for children.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There are many stress points for children in our education  system, and entering school is one of them. The Department really should  examine how children transfer from pre-school to primary school. One reason  that I like the revised curriculum is that it gives back to our primary,  secondary and post-primary teachers the power that was taken away.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Teachers know our  children. They know when a child feels a bit down or vulnerable, and  they are the first to pick up the phone and say &ldquo;Mary hasn&rsquo;t been her best  today. Is something wrong, or any way we can help?&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That is why the revised curriculum needs to be as open,  child-friendly and stimulating as possible. That is the rationale of the new  foundation state curriculum, which aims to ensure that children are introduced  to education in a way, and at a pace, that takes account of their age, gender  and level of maturity.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>: I thank the Minister for her comments, and I am grateful that  she does not plan to raise the age of admission.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Is the Minister aware that, by the age of four, a child can be more than two years behind in his or her  educ&shy;ational development? Does she accept that research produced by her  Department shows that high-quality pre-schooling, particularly when delivered  in nursery school, is related to better intellectual and behavioural  development in children?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, is the Minister aware that in Finland &mdash; which,  the OECD claims, has the best educational system in the world, and where the  starting age for compulsory education is seven &mdash; over 60% of the population  attends education-orientated day care centres by the age of three, the majority  of those full-time? Would the Minister agree that early, rather than late,  formal intervention is required to tackle the tragedy of poor literacy and  numeracy, which can blight successive generations?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane</strong>:  The Member has made some important points.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Pre-school provision is of key importance, be it through  the medium of English or Irish. I accept the Member&rsquo;s point that all the  studies show that children who go to a pre-school at three and four have a much  better chance in life.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have discussed early intervention in the education and  health of our young children with the Minister of Health, Social Services and  Public Safety, Michael McGimpsey.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We need a nought-to-seven strategy in order to deal with  the triggers of disadvantage at an early age rather than having to deal with  them when children are 14 or 16 years old.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I agree that we should have high-quality day care centres  right across the North of Ireland for all our children, but there is a big  difference between the education that children receive in pre-school centres  and that which they receive in primary schools. What happens &mdash; I saw this when  my own child went from pre-school into primary school &mdash; is that there is a  shock to the system if the primary curriculum is not developed suitably so that  a seamless change is created between the two. I am happy to say that I believe  that the revised curriculum will make a difference. Children can learn in many  different ways, and we need to create ways that stimulate their learning.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Tackling poor literacy and numeracy is a high priority for us. Very early on &mdash; from six or  eight months of age &mdash; children should be introduced to books so that  they have the feel of them and understand what books are. Reading a story, or having a story read to  them, should be part of their bedtime. All the studies show that, where that  happens, children gain better numeracy and  literacy skills. It is important that we tackle all the different  aspects of poor numeracy and literacy.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Will the Minister explain why Northern Ireland continues to have the lowest  school starting age not only in Europe but in the world when countries such as Moldova, where the school starting  age is seven, outperform us in tests such as the third international  mathematics and science study?</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat. The question is relevant. If I were starting from scratch  with our education system, I would say that children should start at a later  age. That said, there would be huge implications  for schools if the compulsory school starting age were to change at this  point. Such a change would affect primary school enrolments and would have an  impact on the size of school budgets, which are largely determined on the basis  of pupil numbers. It would also have a knock-on effect on the number of  staffing posts in primary schools and initial teacher training institutions and  on the number of pre-school places available. It could also further call into  question the viability of an increasing number of primary schools, which would  fail to be addressed in the wider context of  the current policy issues relating to the school estate.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As I said &mdash; I will repeat myself because this is important  &mdash; I believe, and I hope that Members will agree, that the revised curriculum  will go some way towards addressing the concerns about the very young age at  which our children start.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As a teacher, Dominic Bradley will remember that the  original intention behind the Education Reform (Northern Ireland)  Order 1989 was that primary 1 would be equivalent to a nursery year.  However, in many schools, children in primary 1 were quickly introduced to the  formal curriculum. Sometimes, in their desire to see results, adults push  children beyond the point that they should be pushed, and that was a case in  point. However, this is a debate that we  need to have. It is about money and costs, but I welcome further  discussion on the issue in all different fora.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>: Does the Minister accept that, for many people in business,  the fact that Northern    Ireland&rsquo;s secondary schools have the highest  achieving students is a particularly strong selling point for the Province? The  repercussions of fundamentally altering education provision would place that in  jeopardy. Twiddling with the system now could change that for the future.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane</strong>:  The fact that so many children do well academically is a strong selling point,  but there is a band of children who do not do well. We have one of the greatest disparities between the top achieving  children and the children at the bottom end. My worry, which was shared  by the business community in a meeting that I attended along with Reg Empey, is  how to make the curriculum relevant to young people who are not academically inclined and want a broad range of  subjects.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">One reason for having the revised curriculum and the  entitlement framework is to provide our young people  with the widest range of choice. We must ensure that once they reach the 14 to 16 age group and the 16 to 19 age  group, they leave our school system as flexible, confident, articulate and creative adults, and that is what the  revised curriculum intends to do.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We can all see that it is a changing world. Today, we have  heard the tragic circumstances of young people taking their own lives. We must  ensure that we do not put extra stress on our children. All learning should be  relevant and it should stimulate children.</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Teacher Training</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">4. <strong>Dr Farry </strong>asked the Minister of Education what discussions she has had with the  Minister for Employ&shy;ment and Learning concerning teacher training. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=AQO108/07> (AQO 108/07)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane</strong>: I  met with the Minister for Employment and Learning on 5 June to discuss matters  of common interest relating to our Departments.  Teacher training was on our long agenda and we did not get to it in the  time available. I will have a follow-up meeting with Reg Empey to discuss  various aspects of teacher education, which will be part of our future  bilateral meeting.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I welcome the Minister to her first Question Time. Given the  decline in pupil numbers, and that there are over 50,000 empty places in our  schools, how will she ensure that the supply of teachers is consistent with  demand. In that light, and given the broad thrust of the Bain Report, what are  her views on duplicate teacher-training colleges catering for different  sections of the education system? Is that situation sustainable?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane</strong>: My  Department recognises that pupil numbers are on the decline. However, it does  not necessarily follow that a reduction in pupil numbers automatically results  in a reduction in the number of teachers. There are several reasons for that,  such as the introduction of new policies that require additional teaching  posts. My Department and the Department for Employment and Learning must work  together to create opportunities for teachers. Teachers are on the front line,  and they understand how a school works and what children need, as they deal  with such matters every day. The Department needs the skills of those teachers  on every level and our society needs their skills on different levels.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In some cases there is an oversupply of teachers and in  other cases there is a scarcity. For example, there are not enough teachers in  the Irish-medium sector, and I need to discuss that with my counterpart in the  South of Ireland. I will also discuss the matter with officials and the  different teacher-training colleges.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">To take account of the  projected demographic decline and to  avoid oversupply, the number of students admitted to teacher education  courses was reduced by 34 in 2005-06, by 60 in 2006-07, and by a further 87 for  the forthcoming academic year.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Reg Empey and I had a  long discussion about careers. We must direct our children into areas  where they are needed most, such as  educational psychology and speech therapy. We do not have enough speech  therapists and educational psychologists to  enable us to deal with early intervention in the most effective way even  though the number of posts has been increased.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I will be discussing duplication in teacher training and  other issues with my colleagues, particularly Reg Empey. Those issues must be  looked at in the context of the Bain Report and there must be collaboration  between schools and between the different sectors.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burnside</strong>:  The Minister will recognise that most of  our local teaching talent, although not all of it, comes from the two  teacher-training colleges and the two universities.  Is she saying that she will allow the issue of duplication in teacher  training to be put on her agenda? Has she  any plans for a radical review of the duplication that exists, and could  that include looking at the four teacher-training establishments in Northern Ireland  and moving them towards a more unitary-controlled state teacher-training  establishment?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane</strong>:  That is one area that my Department will examine. As I have said, there is  oversupply of teachers in some areas and an under-supply in others. The Bain  Report encourages all educational sectors to work together. However, my  Department will examine that issue only in consultation with all educational  sectors, including the Queen&rsquo;s University  of Belfast, the University  of Ulster, Stranmillis  University College  and St. Mary&rsquo;s University   College.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That is but one of many educational issues. Nothing has  been decided and we will examine all options.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I welcome the Minister to her first Question  Time. I would like to probe the Minister about a matter, which is not  about teacher numbers or the number of teacher-training facilities in the  North. My question is about the Bain Report&rsquo;s recommendation for a common set  of standards for qualified teacher status across all sectors in teaching 14- to  19-year-olds. Does she endorse that recommendation?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, in her forthcoming meeting with the Minister  for Employment and Learning, what will she be saying with respect to a common  set of standards for qualified teacher status for that age group?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane</strong>: I  am currently examining the different pathways for 14- to 19-year-olds, and I  have worked with the Minister for  Employment and Learning to make those pathways more flexible. I met with  a school principal, Mr Uel McCrea, who prefers to use the word &ldquo;lattice&rdquo; rather  than &ldquo;ladder&rdquo; with respect to those pathways.  I also prefer to look at the education system as a lattice because the word &ldquo;ladder&rdquo; implies regimentation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My Department can examine that issue; however, it has not  been discussed to date. Whatever is decided must be as flexible as possible so  that pathways can exist for all young  people in that age group. There should not be only one way.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Achieving greater collaboration between schools must also  be explored. I visited the Limavady area, among others, and it was good to see  that three or four schools there had come together: some offered art and music,  others Irish and history. Students from different schools had come together,  and when I spoke to them, they thought that the arrangement was great. For the  first time in their lives they were not walking past school buildings that they  had never entered. I thought it a sign of great hope. Young people are up for  it, which is good to see.</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Citizenship</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">5. <strong>Mr Ford </strong>asked  the Minister of Education what proposals exist to develop the teaching of  citizenship in schools.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO104/07>(AQO  104/07)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane</strong>: I  welcome the Member&rsquo;s question, which touches on a subject close to my own  heart. Citizenship education aims to develop the capacity of young people: to  participate positively and effectively in society; to influence democratic  processes and make informed and responsible decisions throughout life. It is  part of the revised curriculum from primary school onwards and is covered  through personal development and mutual understanding. It then progresses into  local and global citizenship at post-primary level.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Citizenship education  has already been piloted in the vast majority of post-primary schools  and commenced in 2002-03. It will become a  statutory requirement when the  revised curriculum is implemented on a phased basis from September 2007.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">An evaluation carried out last year by the Education and  Training Inspectorate was positive.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Since training for citizenship education began in 2002-03,  my Department has provided around &pound;1&middot;5 million  to ensure that all necessary training is provided. To date, over 1,100 teachers in 276 post-primary  schools have received in-service training, and training of the remaining  teachers will be completed by the end of this school year.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  thank the Minister for her reply, and I welcome her to her first Question Time.  I remind her that a survey of children&rsquo;s attitudes, reported by the BBC this morning, shows how much remains to be  done.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister ensure that in her work on teacher  training to deal with that issue &mdash; and allowing for the plethora of other  responsibilities that schools have &mdash; she continues to put great emphasis on  citizenship education given the important role that schools could play in  altering cultural attitudes among children?</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">4.00 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane</strong>: The Member can be sure that I will place a big emphasis on citizenship education. We are citizens  of the world, and it is important that our children and young people be  confident, articulate and flexible in their thinking. That is what is needed.  The world is changing, and our children must be able to keep up with the  changes. In some ways, they are leading the change &mdash;they are the ones who know  how to use the mobile phones and the new technology.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In relation to training &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I am sorry to interrupt the Minister, but time is up. As Members  are aware, the Scottish First Minister,  Alex Salmond, is due to address Members in the Senate Chamber at 4.00  pm. I propose therefore, by leave of the Assembly, to suspend the sitting until  5.00 pm.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The sitting was suspended at 4.00 pm.</p>
	      <p class="H3SectionHeading">executive committee business</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Welfare Reform Bill</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Consideration Stage</p>
	      <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Speaker in the Chair)</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">5.00 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Debate resumed:</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for Social Development (Ms Ritchie)</strong>:  At 2.00 pm, I was addressing points raised  by Members during the debate on the Consideration Stage of the Welfare  Reform Bill, and I will now continue to do so. At the point when the debate was  suspended, I was dealing with points raised by Mr O&rsquo;Dowd on benefit payments. I want to point out that the Social Development  Committee was told that benefits would not stop. The provisions in the Bill are needed to ensure that Employ&shy;ment  Support Allowance (ESA) can be introduced in 2008, and I mentioned earlier that  this Bill relates specifically to those who suffer from asbestosis-related  conditions, and their relatives. The provisions in the Bill are needed to help  them make claims, and we are introducing them at the same time as they are  being introduced in GB.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr O&rsquo;Dowd also referred to examinations &mdash; I can assure him  that only healthcare professionals will undertake examinations. He also  mentioned the change of opinion since the Transitional Assembly, and parity. As  I made clear at the Second Stage of the Bill, I have considered the provisions  of the Bill very closely with my officials, and I will ensure that it is  implemented fairly, sensitively and sympathetically. Mr O&rsquo;Dowd will well know  the realities of parity, not least those relating to financial imperatives. I,  as Minister for Social Development, like  all Members of the Assembly, would like to debate legislation that  related solely to Northern Ireland, but, as I said earlier today, we are very  much predicated on financial considerations, and I do not want to place  anybody&rsquo;s entitlement or future entitlement to benefit in jeopardy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Molloy asked why, if amendments are so inconsequential,  Members will not accept them. I, as a Minister, cannot accept flawed and  unnecessary amendments, although I do feel in many instances such amendments  may be probing. He also referred to the issue of tribunals. Those of us who  have experienced the tribunal process in the past know that tribunals can  adjourn to seek further evidence if they wish. They can adjourn for a few  minutes, or they can adjourn for several days or weeks, and we all have  personal experience of representing constituents on tribunals.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McCann raised issues about the operation of the  Committee. I reiterate that the Committee was told that benefits would not  stop; the Committee was told that the easements to assist people claiming  compensation for dust-related diseases should apply in Northern Ireland  and that those easements and that benefit entitlement  will equally apply to many of their relatives who live in close  proximity to them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I firmly believe that  sufferers of dust-related diseases should apply for benefits in Northern Ireland  with a minimum of delay, because I do not  wish to see anybody who is suffering  such a terminal disease suffer any more and be without benefit entitlement. Anyone who believes in the  principles of social justice will think likewise.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have listened very carefully today to the arguments put  forward by Members across the Assembly.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  Before the Minister concludes her remarks on this, I want to say that Sinn F&eacute;in  has tried to give the impression that its members alone are the defenders of  those who suffer from mental-health problems and that that the rest of the  House does not care, because it opposes the Sinn F&eacute;in amendments. Does the  Minister agree that generally Members of the Assembly  want to see the best legislation? The amend&shy;ments that are being  proposed are not necessarily in the  interests of the people whom they are supposed to be serving, and Sinn  F&eacute;in has a cheek to claim to be defending  those who suffer from mental-health problems, when over the last 30  years it has been responsible for giving many people those very problems.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  I thank Mr Wilson for his intervention. Every Member has sympathy with &mdash; and  wants to defend &mdash; those who suffer from mental-health conditions. We are  dealing with the legacy of the past. That legacy placed many people in  conflict, and may have undermined their personal positions, leaving them in a  state of distress and trauma. We can attribute blame, but anyone who engaged in  hatred, violence, or terrorism has made a contribution to the mental ill health  that is suffered by many people. We cannot apportion blame to one section of  the community, because others were responsible too.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We are trying to move on, and I hope that the new political  dispensation will afford us the opportunity to do that. No one alone can act as  the defender of those who suffer from mental ill health. Every Member has  spoken unanimously in wanting to defend the needs, requirements and aspirations  of those who suffer from mental ill health. Members spoke as one when they said  that they wanted to deal with those people sensitively, and with compassion and  dignity. I hope that the Assembly can proceed in that manner with the Welfare  Reform Bill, and the provisions and clauses contained therein.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have listened carefully to Members&rsquo; points, and with  particular care and attention to those points that were raised by Members in  support of the amendments. However, the amendments are flawed and unnecessary,  albeit probing. If the amendments were accepted, they would allow for people  without medical qualifications to carry out  medical examinations. The amendment to clause 55, for example, would  allow a psychiatric social worker to carry out medical examinations, for which  they would be medically unqualified, and that is not appropriate.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The amendments mean that someone who has a severe physical disability, and a relatively  minor mental-health condition,  would be assessed by someone with experience of mental-health conditions, who  may have no medical qualifications, despite the fact that serious  physical-health conditions are involved.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The amendments would mean that a person who has a relatively minor mental-health condition would  receive special provision  under the legislation, but a severely physically  disabled person would not, which is not right. The amendments are unnecessary because the legislation provides  safeguards to ensure that those who carry out the assessments and medical examinations  are suitably trained. The definition of a healthcare professional is sufficiently broad in the legislation to allow us  to include other healthcare  professionals, as and when appropriate. Clause 11 makes provision for  that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Moreover, there will be access to specialist advice, where  necessary. The work-focused interviews will take account of individuals&rsquo; needs,  and there will be a system of safeguards for people with mental-health  problems. We do not wish to force anyone to comply with requirements when they  are not fit to do so due to health conditions. We are aiming to provide help  and support, not to put pressure on people who suffer from mental-health  conditions. At the same time, we do not want to disregard them. We want to  ensure that they get all the help and encouragement that they need to fulfil  their potential. We want to support and endorse those who suffer from mental-health conditions at every possible  opportunity.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In light of my  reassurances, I hope that the proposers will be able to withdraw their  amendments. If that is not the case, I would urge Members to reject the  amendments, which are, no doubt, well intentioned. My reassurances, and the  provisions and clauses in the Bill,  including those in respect of clause 11, demonstrate that the amendments  are flawed and unnecessary.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Michelle McIlveen  referred to the amendments as change for change&rsquo;s sake. That is not the  intention. The purpose of those amendments is to ensure that benefit claimants  get the best deal possible.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Alban Maginness referred to the amendments as superfluous;  I do not think that they are superfluous to those who suffer from mental-health  problems. He talked of psychologists who may not be fully trained and how it  might be inappropriate to have a such people performing examinations. As  someone who has been involved in that area for a long time, I can assure Mr Maginness that appeal tribunals in particular  welcome evidence from psychologists,  who &mdash; and this is accepted &mdash; are trained in the area of mental health.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Much has been made of the difficulties for people with physical and mental-health problems. The  purpose of the personal capability  assessment is to find out which descriptor  is most appropriate for a person. I wish I had the same unwavering faith  in the social security system that Mr Maginness appears to have.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Ford talked about the real concerns that exist and how  the amendments did not necessarily deal with them.  He also talked of a raft of amendments to specify particular health  professionals. If a raft of amendments is essential to promote the Welfare  Reform Bill, then so be it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Shannon supports the Bill and talked about negative  repercussions for people with mental-health issues. Most people welcome the  idea of getting those on benefits back to  work, but they have to be individuals whose health problems will not be  made worse by their doing so.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In one of his interventions, Mr S Wilson talked about  specialists: for instance, if someone has a heart condition, a specialist  should be involved. That is the case in many situations: appeal tribunals have  the wherewithal to request specialist medical evidence, because a doctor, for  example, cannot detect angina unless there is a treadmill in the room. That  sort of thing needs to be resolved.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr O&rsquo;Dowd supported the  motion, and Dr McDonnell referred in his intervention to his 28 years as  a GP and to how as many as 50% of his patients may have presented with  mental-health problems. How many of those patients did he refer to specialists  if specialists were more capable of dealing with them?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr S Wilson has talked about belated attempts by Sinn F&eacute;in to introduce amendments after the accelerated  passage was agreed. The Minister said today that the Sinn F&eacute;in amendments would  interfere with, and possibly hold back, benefits from people who suffer from  asbestos-related conditions. Mr S Wilson said that  although he agreed in general with parity, he would disagree with it if  it had an impact on a person&rsquo;s right to benefit. It is not possible to have it  both ways.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I accept that the Minister is committed to getting the best  possible legislation through. The legislation is flawed. In my experience of dealing with social security legislation over the last 30-odd years, I have  never seen a piece of legislation specifically designed to enhance and  increase the value of the lives of those on benefits.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In relation to the help and support that people need, there  was talk about medical exams and reports. Other health professions are  mentioned in the legislation, so why not psychiatric social workers,  psychiatrists, psychologists and community  psychiatric nurses? Those are the questions that people are asked at  tribunals. Also, there can be an inference that, if a person has not attended  one of these particular experts in relation to their condition, then it  minimises the condition in the eyes of those people who are dealing with them &mdash;  tribunals, in particular.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister said that the employment support allowance would be introduced in 2008. I think  that that is accepted.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">5.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Wilson talked about &ldquo;best legislation&rdquo; in his intervention. I am wondering whether he can give  some examples of best legislation for people on benefit from the past 30  years, because I certainly cannot.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister talked about contributing factors,  particularly the Troubles. She mentioned terrorism and related problems. I think that the Minister would be wise to look  at the impact that changes in social security legislation have had on people,  as well.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I finish by saying that  people talk about minor mental-health problems &mdash; surely the role of a  specialist is to discover whether it is a  minor problem. If so, people can be made aware of that, and that can go  into the system.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I ask the Assembly once again to support these amendments.  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle.</p>

	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic"><strong>Clause 16 (Contracting out)</strong></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  We now debate Mr Brady&rsquo;s and other Members&rsquo; opposition to clause 16, which  deals with the question of whether the Department should have the power to  contract out some of its functions.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText"><em>Question proposed, </em>That the clause stand part of the  Bill.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady:</strong> Go raibh  maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. The heading of clause 16 in the Welfare  Reform Bill is &ldquo;Contracting out&rdquo;. The  reason for the proposed deletion of that clause is to ensure that the  tasks of interviewing and dealing with clients are not contracted out to the  private sector. It is essential that the importance of the role of personal  advisers be recognised. Those people must be trained to a high degree,  particularly in dealing with people with mental-health problems. If the private  sector were to deal with that, issues of confidentiality, sensitivity and  accountability would be brought into question.  Those matters should be kept in-house, where implementation in areas  such as training would be carefully monitored. The farming out of those tasks  would inevitably lead to job losses in the Civil Service and in the public sector in general. Jobs must be  created locally, not cut back so that faceless private companies can  prosper.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Training for people carrying out such interviews must be  genuine, must have clear objectives, and must be of the highest standard to  meet the needs of people with physical and mental-health disabilities. Constant  monitoring must also be put in place. There is no place for private companies in the administration or assessment of  benefits &mdash; that should never arise. The welfare and well-being of claimants  should be paramount. I ask the Assembly&rsquo;s support for the deletion of clause  16. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig:</strong> Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s arguments in opposition to clause 16 turn everything that has come before on  its head.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>A Member:</strong> What is new?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig:</strong> Exactly, what is new?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Concerns have been raised about how people with  mental-health conditions are treated, and the argument has been made that they must receive the best and most suitable  help for their condition. Clause 16 contains provision to allow contracted  providers in the private and voluntary sectors to carry out functions related to  work-focused interviews. That does not mean that the work is contracted out; it  involves bringing in the expertise of the voluntary sector to help individuals  with mental and learning disabilities and disorders. Opposing clause 16 of the Bill will prevent the possibility of  bringing that expertise into the system. I cannot see how its removal would  improve the Bill.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in supported the accelerated passage of the Bill.  The party may not want to be reminded of that fact, but it is true. What has  caused the difference in attitude between the Committee meeting and what has  occurred in the Chamber today? Where has that party&rsquo;s opposition come from?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members are aware that accelerated passage was sought in  order to ensure parity with the rest of the United Kingdom. Any Member who tables an amendment that  might breach that principle would need to provide extremely strong evidence for  doing so. The issue is more about Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s attempts to score points against  other parties, and it is prepared to let the ordinary people of Northern Ireland  suffer to do so.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Since the Bill was introduced, our attitude has been that  it must ensure that people who are in receipt of benefits across Northern Ireland are treated equally to people in the rest of the United Kingdom.  For that reason, I will not support the amendment.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>: I oppose the amendment to clause 16. It is important to  emphasise that clause 16 is a permissive  power; it is not mandatory nor is it intended to be so. The intention is to provide a power that the Minister or  the Department may wish to exercise in the future.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Brady mentioned the fact that the power enables the Department to contract out to private bodies.  That is true. Equally, however,  clause 16 enables the Department to contract out to voluntary  organisations that have the expertise to deal with particular situations, such  as introducing tailor-made interview processes, which would be of great  assistance to claimants. In the earlier debate on the Bill, Members highlighted  many other situations that could be altered to help claimants.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is an element of selectivity from Mr Brady and his  colleagues in their opposition to clause 16. On one hand, they say that they  want special consideration to exist. However, if the Department decides &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness:</strong> Just hear me out.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, clause 16 enables the Department to decide  sometime in the future to contract out particular services to expert voluntary  organisations, if it would be necessary or helpful to do so. Mr Brady seeks to  exclude that power from the Bill. I shall give way to Mr McCann now.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  I understand the Member&rsquo;s point. However, during the earlier debate, I  specifically mentioned the number of people with psychiatric training. Those  people could provide that expertise individually. Contracting out means putting  a contract out to tender among different groups and organisations, any of which  could apply. The group that offers the lowest tender will probably be chosen to  provide the types of services that have been mentioned.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  The Member does not understand my point. It is not simply a tendering exercise,  but one that will bring in the best possible  expertise, particularly from voluntary organisations, in order to assist  the Department. Opposing clause 16 will prevent the Department from being able  to deal with claimants in a more customised  fashion. Therefore, Sinn F&eacute;in has taken a retrograde step by bringing  forward this amendment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, in order to implement clause 16, regulations  would have to be made. Mr Brady&rsquo;s points in relation to problems in  implementing the legislation can all be met by a rigorous series of regulations  that deal with the weaknesses and points of contention that he, rightly, raised. The Assembly, or the Social  Develop&shy;ment Committee, can address that in the future. Therein  lies a series of safeguards in relation to clause 16.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Let me emphasise that this power is permissive; it is not mandatory. The Department does not have to  contract-out services, but it can consider doing so in the future. If it  considers that there is good practice elsewhere, and evidence-based experience  that can inform our decisions, why should it not bring that to the Assembly for  further discussion?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 16 allows not only the Department for Social Development, but also the Department for Employment  and Learning, to deal with this process.  That is important, because there is obvious cross-referencing between  the two Departments when dealing with the social issues that they have in  common. If the Assembly rejects clause 16, it is rejecting potential  flexibility for the Department to deal with this situation. Therefore, I ask  the House to reject this amendment.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Before I call the next Member, I remind Members that this is  not a debate on an amendment to this clause. Rather, Mr Brady and other Members  have declared their intention to vote against the clause remaining part of the  Bill. It is important to state that, and I hope  that it will be clear when the Question is put.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry:</strong> I am in favour of retaining clause 16. We  must be careful not to fall into the trap of saying, &ldquo;public sector good,  private sector bad&rdquo;. Similarly, we must  avoid the trap of saying that all PPP or PFI projects are bad and all  public-sector procurement is good.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There are circumstances in which contracting out to the private sector makes sense. It can be a more  efficient way of providing services,  and so provide a better public service  for the entire community. The same logic applies to other projects where the private sector can be brought in.  There are good and bad examples. We need the flexibility to enter into good  examples of contracting out or other private-sector initiatives and the  discipline to avoid bad ones.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that  Members avoid hanging themselves on ideological hooks. The Assembly has  a wide agenda of questions to answer and challenges to meet in the coming  months and years. It must be flexible in its approach. I too recognise that  this clause describes a permissive power. It does not say that the Department  must go down a certain route; it merely gives the Department the option of  contracting out services to the private or  voluntary sectors if, at some point, it proves wise to do so.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am satisfied that regulations can be put in place to  provide safeguards, if the Department chooses to use this power. The House should recognise that the private sector  in Northern Ireland  needs to grow. The public sector is too large in relation to the private  sector. The strengths in the voluntary and community sector must also be  recognised.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Northern    Ireland has one of the most sophisticated  community and voluntary sectors in the entire world, and Members should not  underestimate the abilities of organisations within that sector to deliver  services. Along these benches, Members are  happy that the clause should stand part of the Bill.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  Privatisation or contracting out will ensure  that those who work for Departments in Govern&shy;ment buildings will be  considered surplus to requirements. Members should consider the Bill as  it is currently worded, so that they are under no illusions as to what I am  talking about: </p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Contracting out</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">16.&mdash; (1) The following functions of the Department may  be exercised by, or by employees of, such person (if any) as it may authorise  for the purpose, namely&mdash;</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented" style="margin-left:1.0cm;text-indent:-14.15pt;">conducting interviews under section 12;</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented" style="margin-left:1.0cm;text-indent:-14.15pt;">providing documents under section 14;</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented" style="margin-left:1.0cm;text-indent:-14.15pt;">giving, varying or revoking directions under  section 15.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That clause continues for another page and a half. Under  the Welfare Reform Bill as introduced, people from the private sector will do a  large proportion of that work.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Consider the vote for one minute. Are Members here to  provide the most up-to-date, professional service possible, and to ensure  through Civil Service employment a high level of expertise that is backed up by  years of experience? Alternatively, are Members in the process of throwing away  all of that by contracting out services to private companies? Those groups and organisations pay minimum wage and offer little  training in most cases. Are we about to give them access to private  documentation and authorise them to conduct interviews  with claimants? Will the directors of a private company put profit  before care for their workforce? Can the loyalty of those companies be bought?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Over the years, I have had many arguments with civil  servants from different levels &mdash; and I intend to have many more. When they  start their careers, civil servants pledge to maintain standards of service and  privacy. Consider the information that the public are encouraged to give to the  Social Security Agency when applying for benefits: personal and medical information; private  financial details; information that gets to the core of who a person is.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">5.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the course of my constituency work, I have built  relationships with those people from the other end of the counter, so to speak,  and I have confidence in the professionalism of their work. Members have all  had moments of disagreement with some of their decisions. However, could the  current standard of professional relationship  be maintained if the Bill were to be passed? That relationship works  both ways. Regardless of organisation or political party, advice centres  working at the coalface rely on professionalism and strong working  relationships to assist and help those in most need in the community.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in believes that this Bill is about getting as many  people as possible off incapacity benefit. Again, consider specific sections.  In the &lsquo;Explanatory and Financial Memorandum&rsquo; of the Bill as introduced, guidance on work-focused  interviews under clause 12 states that:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;If the claimant  fails to participate fully in a work-focused interview and cannot show good  cause for that failure within the permitted time, the amount of employment and  support allowance he is entitled to would be reduced. Regulations under <span style="font-style:normal; ">subsection (4) </span>will  set out the amounts of the reductions.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is obvious that the Bill was not gender-proofed. It continually talks of &ldquo;he&rdquo;, not they. Sinn F&eacute;in is concerned that Members may pass the Bill without a full under&shy;standing of its  consequences: namely that somewhere down the line, outside providers will  carry out all services. Are Members in danger of subcontracting welfare  benefits? What will happen if it all goes wrong and standards collapse? Will  the Assembly be in a position to reverse these decisions? I fear not. By that  stage, in another efficiency drive, the Government will have shed those people  who delivered the welfare state. Do Members want to go down that road and to  hand over those activities to the highest bidder? That is the decision we face.  For everyone&rsquo;s sake, I hope we make the right one. Go raibh maith agat, a  Cheann Comhairle.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  It may be tempting to pursue purely local solutions to local problems in social  security provision, as in other areas of our responsibility. However, as I said  earlier in the debate on the previous amendments, we are constrained by the  realities of parity, not the least of those being the huge financial resources  that are dependent on the maintenance of parity. It might be helpful if I  explain the purpose of clause 16.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 16 will allow the Department for Social Development  and the Department for Employment and Learning to draw upon the skills of  others, such as the voluntary sector, to deliver some of their departmental  functions &mdash; under part 1 of the Bill &mdash; to claimants of employment and support  allowance; it will also have an effect on the conduct of work-focused  interviews, drawing up action plans and issuing directions.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I must stress that there are no plans at this time to use  those powers. As Mr A Maginness and Dr Farry pointed out, clause 16 is  permissive not mandatory. Clause 16(1) states that:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The following  functions of the Department may be exercised&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText" style="text-indent:0cm;">Clause 16(2) states that:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Regulations may  provide for any of the following functions&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText" style="text-indent:0cm;">It is accepted that some private  organisations and voluntary agencies have a wealth of experience in delivering  specialist employment support and advice. My Department and the Department for  Employment and Learning recognise and value that experience. However, in Northern Ireland,  such organisations tend to be small and localised, and they do not have the capacity to manage successfully the full range of  support and advice that is required to deliver the employment and  support allowance to claimants.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Pathways to Work programme will roll out in Northern Ireland  between October 2007 and April 2008 under the current public-sector model,  which is led by the Department for Employment and Learning. Initially, the  current Pathways to Work conditionality regime  and delivery model will apply when employment and support allowance is  introduced. Allowing other bodies to  deliver those functions would only be considered in the light of firm  evidence that alternative approaches are effective, efficient and value for  money. If and when any functions are contracted out, the same rules, review and  appeal processes will be in place for all organisations that carry out  conditionality functions. This will ensure a consistency of applications for  all claimants. In addition, the delivery of contracted-out functions will be  carefully monitored.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I appreciate the  concerns expressed by some Members that external providers might not  possess the ethos of public service that underpins the public sector and may be  motivated by profit rather than the interests of the claimant. However, my Department and the Department for  Employment and Learning will remain responsible for all functions carried out on their behalf. Contractors would be liable for prosecution for any criminal  activity resulting from their actions &mdash; or lack of action. As I have  already made clear, the respective Departments will closely monitor the  delivery of functions by an external provider.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although there are currently no plans to use the powers described in clause 16, it would be wrong  to deny ourselves the use of that  option in the future. For example, those powers could be used to draw on  the specific expertise of mental-health organisations to assist in dealing with  people with mental-health problems. It is important  to note, however, that before either Department could seek to exercise those powers, it would, of course, consult  with its respective Committees. I want to put that on the record.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Brady raised the issue of confidentiality of information. The unlawful disclosure of Social  Security Agency information, by either civil servants or anyone who  provides a service to Departments, is an offence. I assure Members that I would  not tolerate unscrupulous contractors found  to be acting improperly while working on behalf of my Department. I want  to put that on the public record, too.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, Mr McCann asked whether organisations would act  professionally if the Department decided to contract out to providers at a  later stage. I say to him that the delivery of functions by external providers  will be very carefully monitored.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The other issue that Mr McCann raised was that the Bill has  not been gender-proofed. The Bill is drafted in accordance with standard  drafting practice. The Interpretation Act 1954 provides for the word &ldquo;he&rdquo; to  mean &ldquo;she&rdquo; also. By way of information, the Office of the Legislative Counsel  is moving towards gender-neutral drafting.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have said that I intend to return to the Committee and that the Minister for Employment and Learning  will return to the Committee for Employment and Learning before proceeding  down the route of contracting out to providers. Having given those assurances,  I hope that Members who oppose clause 16 will realise that it could be a useful  tool for the future and that they might reconsider their opposition to the  clause.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I understand the sensitive issues involved and that  information must be dealt with sensitively, because confidential, personal and  private information on claimants is being  dealt with, and that information must remain in the private domain.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Given those reassurances, I hope that Members will be able  to reconsider their opposition to the clause. I trust that Members will agree  that it would be wrong to deny ourselves the flexibility for the future that  clause 16 offers.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Craig talked about available help in the system. I  resent his remark that I am attempting to score political points &mdash; or to score  points on political issues &mdash; on the back of vulnerable people, particularly  those who suffer from mental-health problems.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Alban Maginness opposed the deletion of clause 16. He  said that it was a permissive, mandatory power. If that is the case, why  include clause 16 in the Bill?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie:</strong> It is not mandatory.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness:</strong> I am sorry, Mr Speaker, but I beg to differ.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>:  Sorry. The Member said that it was non-mandatory. My mistake.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Why include the clause in the Bill? There has been a great  deal of talk about voluntary organisations having the wherewithal and expertise  to help. As someone who has worked in the voluntary sector for the past 26  years, I wonder from where the funding will come, because it has been my  experience that the voluntary sector is lacking in funding, and, indeed,  support, from the Department.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Dr Farry talked about &ldquo;public sector good, private sector  bad&rdquo;. When that logic is applied to social security legislation, it is obvious  that to have people in the private sector dealing with social security issues  is not the best option. Mr McCann made that point well.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson:</strong> On a point of order, Mr Speaker. Why is  the Member being permitted to speak twice? I am making a point of order, Mr  Speaker, if the Member would like to resume his seat. He is not speaking to an  amendment, so he does not have the right of reply.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker:</strong> I thank the Member for his point of order.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">This is a very sensitive issue. We thought that the Member  should be allowed to wind up.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson:</strong> On a further point of order, Mr Speaker,  does that mean that if there is a substantive issue for debate, any Member can  get up to speak more than once?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker:</strong> On that further point of order, it might be  useful if I come back to the House on that issue.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady:</strong> With respect, in reply to the Member  opposite&rsquo;s point of order, I was simply acceding to the Speaker&rsquo;s request. That  is probably the best way to explain the matter. I am sure that the Member is  much better versed in these matters than I am, but, as a matter of courtesy, I  was acceding to the Speaker&rsquo;s request.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">6.00 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker:</strong> I interrupt the Member for a moment &mdash; I  will allow him to finish afterwards &mdash; to deal with a procedural issue.  Obviously, the business will not be disposed of by 6.00 pm. In accordance with  Standing Order 10(3), I will allow the business to continue until 7.00 pm or until  the business has been completed. I now ask the Member to finish.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady:</strong> In response to the Member opposite&rsquo;s concern,  I will try to be as brief as possible.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister said that there are no plans to use the powers  in clause 16, but she then talked about what would happen if she decided to  contract out. I think that she meant to refer to what may happen if she were to  decide to contract out.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, I seek clarification from the Minister on the consultation. She said that 320 copies of the  consultation document on the Bill were issued. I am interested to find  out &mdash; this may not be the time or the place &mdash; the results of that consultation  and whether there was a consensus on the Bill. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Clause 16 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Clauses 17 to 34 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Clause 35 (Payment of housing benefit)</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  We now debate amendment No 3, with which it will be convenient to debate  amendment No 4. The amendments deal with the payment of housing benefit and with debt counselling. As amendment No 4 is  consequential to amendment No 3, I will call amendment No 4 only if amendment  No 3 is made.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann:</strong> I beg to move amendment No 3: In page 28,  line 22, leave out paragraph (a) and insert</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion" style="margin-left:1.0cm;text-indent:-18.05pt;">&ldquo;(a)&nbsp; a payment or payments by the Housing Executive  or the Department of Finance and Personnel, as the case may be-</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion" style="margin-left:1.0cm;text-indent:-14.15pt;">(i)&nbsp;&nbsp; to a person on E&rsquo;s behalf or in respect of a  liability which E has (where E is the person entitled to the payment); or</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion" style="margin-left:1.0cm;text-indent:-14.15pt;">(ii)&nbsp; directly to E only where E requests it to be  so paid,&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The following amendment stood on the Marshalled List:</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">No 4: In page 28, line 34, at end insert</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;(2C) Regulations may provide that the Housing Executive or  the Department of Finance and Personnel, as the case may be, shall provide debt  counselling to vulnerable persons who in requesting payment of Housing Benefit  in accordance with subsection (2)(a)(ii) may experience financial  difficulties.&rdquo; &mdash; <em>[Mr F McCann.]</em></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It gives me great  pleasure to move amendment No 3, which,  if passed, will save many vulnerable people from falling into difficulties with arrears because they choose to  buy food for their families or essentials for their home before they pay the  rent. All Members of the Social Development  Committee had serious reservations about aspects of the Bill, especially  the provision to allow payment of housing  benefit directly to the applicant, thus bypassing the landlord or owner  of the property.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I do not intend to  speak too long in the debate because the choice is clear. Members can  either support amendment No 3 and thereby build in protection to ensure that  the most vulnerable in our community are protected from possible eviction for  arrears, or they can leave things to chance so that we end up picking up the  pieces for a catalogue of families or individuals in severe debt who choose to  put food on the table rather than pay the rent. I have been told that the  payment is a matter of choice and that it should be left for the individual to  choose whether they want their housing benefit to be paid directly to them or  to the owner of the property. Amendment No 3 takes on board that concern by  providing that those who wish to avail of the opportunity to have their housing  benefit paid directly to them may do so.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister gave a commitment to come back to the  Committee and discuss Part 2 of the Bill, which relates to housing benefit. She  said that she was sympathetic to many points that were raised. However, there  is no guarantee that changes will be made or that protections, which Sinn F&eacute;in  believes are essential to protect people, will be taken on board and inserted  in the Bill.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is not often that I quote from the Residential Landlords  Association, but the association has said that a lot of landlords in Leeds will withdraw from the market. The association also said that a strong immigrant market is replacing the benefit market. There are  similar quotes right across the board. People receiving their benefits directly could find that it has an  adverse affect.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Sinn F&eacute;in group on the Committee believes that the best  way to ensure that the issue is dealt with is through a debate on the Floor of  the House. It would give Members an opportunity to say whether they are in  favour of including the necessary protection to help those who may fall foul of  the legislation as it is currently worded.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In a briefing for the Second Reading of Part 2 of the  Welfare Reform Bill, which relates to housing benefit, Shelter Scotland said:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Shelter believes  that amendments should be made to the Bill, introducing better safeguards for  tenants who might experience difficulty managing the LHA payments,&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">&mdash; the LHA is the local housing allowance, which is the same  as housing benefit &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;and fall into rent  arrears and face eviction and homelessness as a result.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Why leave matters to chance when they can be dealt with  now? In a year&rsquo;s time it may be too late. If amendment No 3 is agreed to, and  we can stop one person from being a victim of rent-arrears eviction, it will  have been worth it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 4  states:</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;(2C) Regulations may  provide that the Housing Executive or the Department of Finance and Personnel,  as the case may be, shall provide debt counselling to vulnerable persons who in  requesting payment of Housing Benefit in accordance with subsection (2)(a)(ii)  may experience financial difficulties.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The House should  support the amendment, as it goes straight to the heart of the Bill. The  lack of thought in the Bill for people who may fall into difficulties, or into  arrears, is obvious. We have talked about the problems that may arise if the  Bill is implemented, and the impact that it may have on those most vulnerable  in our community.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I do not believe that there is one Member in the Chamber  who has not, in the course of his or her constituency work, come across people  who have been depressed to the point of suicide because they have a secret that they felt that they could not share  with others. That secret is debt. How many people have kept that secret  because they were frightened that their partner or husband would find out? How  many people have Members spoken to who were ashamed that anyone would know that  they were deeply in debt and who felt that they had nowhere to turn?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">How many people have broken down because they have been  under so much pressure that they felt that they could not go on with life? How  many people have Members spoken to who, when they eventually approached someone  with experience or were pointed in the right direction to a debt counsellor,  recognised that there was light at the end of the tunnel after all?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is an old saying that a problem shared is a problem  halved. Imagine a partner or spouse trying to work out the weekly or monthly  income and realising that there is not enough money to pay the rent or mortgage,  feed the children, pay for clothing or bus fares for school. It is not a  difficult choice for a parent to make.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Agreeing to amendment No 4 would introduce a procedure to  allow those people who choose to have their  benefit paid directly to avail themselves of first-rate  counselling to assist them when they fall into arrears. To say no to the amendment would be to turn our  backs on those people who are most in need of our help. It would send  out the wrong signal and show that we do not care.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Have any Members in the Chamber seen an eviction or ever  dealt with the aftermath of an eviction? There were a number of evictions in West Belfast  some months ago. The majority of people involved were women and  children; their crime was rent arrears. Sometimes the evictions happened when  people were out of their properties, their  doors were forced and their belongings taken away for storage.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">At the time, Sinn F&eacute;in  met senior Housing Executive officials who had initiated the evictions  through the Enforcement of Judgments Office. Sinn F&eacute;in argued that there had to be a better way of dealing with  evictions and asked that Housing  Executive officials should make arrangements to sit down with those  people who were in arrears and advise them to seek debt counselling. Sinn F&eacute;in  also asked the Housing Executive to produce educational leaflets to explain the  dangers of falling into debt, and to  contact family members or anyone close &mdash;  for example, a doctor, a local councillor, a priest or community worker  &mdash; who might be in a position to help persons in debt and could impress upon  them the necessity of paying their rent arrears.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In many instances the debtors are low earners whose incomes fall just outside the housing benefit  level. They feel that they have only enough money to feed and clothe  their children. Members have an opportunity to put the horse before the cart &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  I thank the Member for giving way, as he always does.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">What the Member describes is what already happens in all  Housing Executive offices. There, people &mdash; sometimes with huge arrears of debt  &mdash; receive advice and sympathetic consideration from housing managers, to the point where minimal payments are often  accepted. The Housing Executive also puts debtors in touch with organisations that can help them to manage their  finances.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>: Some of that help has been introduced only recently. Several  political parties have voiced concerns about the number of evictions. On many  occasions, eviction is the first solution resorted to.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">At a meeting of the  Committee for Social Development on 17 May, several members voiced  concern about the payment of housing benefit to claimants rather than to  property owners or landlords. Where tenants are in receipt of housing benefit,  there is no procedure by which debt  counselling is offered as soon as tenants fall into arrears of rent. People wait until they have &pound;6,000 &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I ask the Member to take his seat for a moment.  Although there is no time limit on contributions to the debate, it would  be useful if Members kept their comments extremely brief. There is a great deal  of business to get through.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann:</strong> I have  allowed Mr Wilson to intervene 11 times today, so he has taken up most  of my time.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My point is that the Housing Executive waits until people  are thousands of pounds in debt before it acts. The amendment is intended to  introduce a process by which tenants falling four, eight or 12 weeks in arrears are identified and appropriate action is  triggered. People in debt should  have explained to them the various ways  of dealing with debt. There should be no automatic recourse to the  Enforcement of Judgements Office and to eviction. No Member likes to see evictions.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Everyone who applies for housing benefit should be advised that debt counselling is available. Those  falling into arrears should be identified at an early stage and dealt  with proactively before they present problems.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Last Thursday, several groups gave evidence to the  Committee for Social Development on the problem of homelessness. Those groups provide excellent advice and, if they were better resourced, they would fulfil  the need.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy  Chairperson of the Committee for Social Development (Mr Hilditch)</strong>: On 24  May, the Minister attended a meeting of the  Committee to explain her reasons for requesting accelerated passage for  the Welfare Reform Bill.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee agreed to support the Minister&rsquo;s request only after she had given an explicit  undertaking that she would not bring forward regulations to change the  current method of paying housing benefit until she had considered the matter  further and fully discussed the matter with the Committee. The Committee did  not discuss the detail of the regulations that could be brought forward by the  Minister under clause 35, and therefore I cannot give the Committee&rsquo;s view on  the proposed amendment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to comment now on the amendments in a personal  capacity, not as Deputy Chairperson of the Committee. My colleague the Chairman  of the Committee, and all the DUP members  of the Committee, were most sceptical of the proposals to pay housing  benefit directly to tenants.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, we have had  assurances from the Minister, during Committee meetings, and in the  House during the Second Stage of the Bill, that there will be no movement on this matter without evidence being  provided and without full consultation with the Committee. Those remarks  are recorded in Hansard, and I again welcome the Minister&rsquo;s assurance on the  matter.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">6.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The amendment is therefore unnecessary, and the proposers  have moved it in the full knowledge that it will be defeated in the House. They  are allowing Members to posture in opposition despite the fact that they  supported accelerated passage in Committee and that their more senior party  colleagues supported the Bill in the Executive.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Last week in the House, the Minister said that certain  Members seemed to refuse assurances given on any matter relating to the Bill  for purely party political reasons. Those words are quite fitting in light of  today&rsquo;s debate.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, Sinn F&eacute;in Members might not be quite so  comfortable if there were a real possibility that their amendments would be passed because that would mean  that parity would be broken, and their constituents could possibly lose out on  benefit payments &mdash; which, of course, would not make for such a nice headline in  the local papers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If the issue returns to the Assembly, we will have a real  chance to look at the matter in detail at that stage, with the benefit of  evidence to back up our view. As a party, we have always supported the Bill,  and we fully support its progress through the House. Therefore, we will not be  supporting the amendments.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I reiterate what Mr Hilditch has said. I do not want to go through the detail  of his remarks, but it is quite clear that the Minister has given a firm public  undertaking to the Social Development Committee and to the Assembly. It  therefore comes as a major surprise that  some Members, including members of the Social Development Committee,  have tabled an amendment that is clearly unnecessary. I am not one to accuse  people of playing politics &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Some Members: Go on.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">[Laughter.]</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  However, the tabling of this amendment verges towards playing politics with  claimants and vulnerable people. The mover of the amendment and his party  purport to be defenders of vulnerable people. That is a risky exercise.  However, he does come to the House with the full confidence that parties, apart  from Sinn F&eacute;in, will oppose his amendment. Therefore, the risk to parity, with  all of the associated implications, is  avoided. Thus, the Member is proposing an amendment in order to have it  rejected, not to have it passed. It is not  very good politics to do that.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  The debate seems to have returned to the subject of parity. If the amendment  were to be passed, parity would not be broken. The Minister has already stated  that she is prepared to look at the matter in another way. Sinn F&eacute;in believes  that the provisions outlined in the amendments should be included in the  legislation. Should any of the amendments proposed by my party be passed,  parity would not be broken.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I hear what the Member has said. However,  the Minister made it quite clear in Committee meetings that if the  Welfare Reform Bill is not passed, or, indeed, if the House rejects any  provision in the Bill, parity will be imperilled. As the amendment involves a  delivery mechanism, it may well be that if it were to be carried, parity would  remain. Nonetheless, the principle of  parity is being threatened. This amend&shy;ment has been tabled to score a  political point rather than strengthen the legislation or protect parity or the  interests of vulnerable people. It is therefore important that the House  rejects the amendment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members are skating on thin ice when they bring spurious  amendments of this type, not for genuine reasons, but for party-political ones;  it does not help the process in the House and does not help anybody outside  either.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My final point is to do with the fourth amendment. Mr S  Wilson has made the point that the Housing Executive has a thorough  debt-counselling procedure for dealing with the problems of people who get into  debt through rent arrears and so forth; to ignore that is to ignore facts on  the ground. The procedures are there and will remain. If in the future, the  Department deems it necessary to extend this to include people outside this  catchment area, in the private sector for example, that can also be done by way  of regulation, and there is no reason for it not to be done.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister has given an assurance that she will come back  to the Social Development Committee and revisit many of the issues that have  been raised in the House today. The Minister is not a person to duck issues, nor a person without compassion; she is  sensitive to the needs of the most vulnerable in our community, and I can assure the House that if necessary the  Minister will come back and deal with this problem. I ask the House to  reject the second amendment.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: I  rise to oppose both amendments. Of course there are concerns about direct  payments for housing benefit, and there is the potential for people to fall  into debt over rent arrears. It is essential that there is appropriate advice  to help claimants to manage their finances, but currently, as other Members  have said, there is a range of such advice on offer from both the statutory and  the voluntary sectors. I totally disagree that debt cancelling should be  enshrined in law as mandatory for all claimants who want to have housing  benefit paid directly.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I understand too that the issue of payment and advice will  be dealt with by secondary legislation that will prescribe the circumstances  for making payments directly to people. The amendments should therefore not be  the concerns of this Bill and are unhelpful at this moment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I would like to secure at this stage the Minister&rsquo;s  reassurance that careful consideration will be given to exercising direct  payments and that claimants will be given proper advice and support when opting  for such a format if they so wish in the future.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat. After all Mr Maginness&rsquo;s years in politics I am interested  that he is surprised by anything. Because of the amendments, I have learnt two  new words from him today: &ldquo;spurious&rdquo; and  &ldquo;superfluous&rdquo;. So it was worth coming here after all.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The proposal in the Welfare Reform Bill is that housing  benefit should be paid directly to the claimant rather than the landlord, and I  accept that the Minister has stated that she will defer any decision on this  until after further discussion with the Committee for Social Development.  However, the amendment is to ensure that  housing benefit is paid directly only to those clients who request it and may be able to manage their  budgets adequately. The obvious problem is that although more money may  go into a weekly budget, it will not necessarily be used to pay rent, and  inevitably that person will get deeper into debt. It therefore makes sense to  pay housing benefit directly to the landlord to avoid these problems and support those people in receipt of benefit. I ask the Assembly to support this amendment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The fourth amendment is designed to ensure that if people  do get into debt as a result of the changes to the payment of housing benefit,  it should be incumbent upon the Housing Executive or the Department of Finance  and Personnel to provide debt counselling to help these people through.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Unfortunately, for people in receipt of benefits, debt is part and parcel of their daily lives, and can  be difficult to resolve. Debt counselling can be effective in giving  people an insight into how to deal with their problems. Therefore, it does not  seem unreasonable that those statutory agencies that administer benefits should  get involved in helping claimants to  resolve their problems. I ask the  Assembly to support the amendment. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie:</strong> I come to the House as someone who defends the  rights of the vulnerable and the less well off, and I want to put on  record that the Executive supported the Welfare Reform Bill.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 35 amends section 126(2) of the Social Security  Administration (Northern    Ireland) Act 1992 to provide a  regulation-making power that would require payment to be made directly to the  tenant, rather than to the landlord, as is normally the case at present. The  Department for Work and Pensions proposes to bring forward regulations in Great Britain  to allow the new local housing allowance to  be paid directly to the tenant in the private rented sector. There are  no plans to use that power for the social housing sector.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Lest anyone is suffering from amnesia, or selective  retention of facts today, I have already made my position clear on several  occasions. I have reservations about the  proposal. I have voiced concerns at a meeting with the Committee for  Social Development on 24 May 2007, and again during the debates on accelerated  passage on 4 June 2007, and at Second Stage on 12 June 2007. I know that the  Chairperson, Mr Gregory Campbell, the Deputy Chairperson, Mr David Hilditch,  and members of the Committee share my concerns. I have given firm assurances  that I will not introduce regulations until I am absolutely satisfied that  direct payments to tenants would work. That remains my position. I will go back  to the Committee if I choose to follow the other path.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  The Housing Executive has already issued instructions to landlords that the new  payment will come into effect on 1 April 2008. Is the Minister for Social Development saying that that will not  happen?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  I have made my position clear. I am aware of the leaflet that was issued by the  Housing Executive in advance of my conveying information to the Committee for  Social Development. I have told the Housing Executive that I will not bring  forward a commencement order or regulations  until I am satisfied that direct  payments to tenants would work. In that case, I will return to the  Committee for Social Development and show  it due courtesy before choosing that direction.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson:</strong> Will the Minister for Social Develop&shy;ment  outline to the Assembly the steps that she intends to take in order to give  herself the assurance that she has talked about?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie:</strong> I thank Mr Wilson for that point of  information. The direction that I choose will be based on evidence, which I  have not got yet. I want to see the impact that direct payments to tenants may  have. I am aware of the impact that evictions can have, and I do not want to  see anyone on the streets, having been evicted from their own properties. A  basic principle of social justice is that all people should have a roof over  their head and their safety assured. I believe that every Member of the House  aspires to that principle and wants to offer that protection.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My concern about the provision is that it could lead to an  increase in debt for tenants. On the other hand, the social inclusion agenda  includes a proposal to encourage people to manage their own finances, just as  people in work have to do.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, I fully accept that it is totally wrong to suggest  that because a person is on benefit they are unable to manage their own  finances or cannot be trusted to do so. I  will return to the Committee with due courtesy before I proceed with  anything. I conveyed that to the chief executive of the Housing Executive as  recently as last week.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">6.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I firmly believe that the way ahead should be  evidence-based and not a knee-jerk reaction. I have therefore agreed with the  Social Development Committee that we shall work together on the issue. The  amendments seek to fetter the Committee and I in our work and impose conditions  without any evidence-based deliberations.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 3 provides that housing benefit would be  payable directly to the tenant only when the tenant requests it. The obvious  danger is that landlords could coerce tenants &mdash; who want to manage their own  affairs and who are perfectly capable of doing so &mdash; into having their housing  benefit paid directly to them. Those are precisely the types of issues that I  wish to consider in detail with the Committee. If, following further discussions with the Committee, I were to  proceed on the basis outlined in amendment No 3, clause 35 as drafted is  sufficiently broad to allow us to do so.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My agreement with the  Committee must be honoured, and we must move forward on an  evidence-based approach. Amendment No 4, which is dependent on Amendment No 3,  has resource implications. I would need more time to consider that amendment in  con&shy;junction with the Minister of Finance and Personnel. However, debt counselling is one issue to be  considered with the Social Development Committee in deciding the way  ahead. Like Mr Wilson and Mr McGuinness, and I am fully aware that the Housing  Executive &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone:</strong> Much emphasis has been rightly placed on  the role of the Northern Ireland Housing Executive,  and particularly its debt-counselling function. Has the Minister  consulted the Housing Executive on its position on amendment No 3?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie:</strong> As I  said to Mr McCarthy, I have sought information from the Housing  Executive on the matter. The Housing Executive stated that it would prefer that  the payment be made directly to the landlord.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As Mr Wilson and Mr  McGuinness said, the Housing Executive already provides debt-counselling  advice. Citizens Advice Bureaux, as well as  other organisations in the voluntary sector, also provide that advice.  For the reasons that I have outlined, and in the light of the assurances I have  provided, I hope that Members withdraw the amendments.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McCann highlighted the issue of people having to choose  between paying rent and feeding their families. I recognise the pressures upon  people on benefits; they sometimes must choose between bread on the table,  paying rent, or buying other commodities for the household. However, people on  benefit must not be categorised as being unable or unfit to manage their own  affairs. We cannot be prescriptive or suggest what people should, or should  not, have. We must be very careful because  we are dealing with very sensitive, personal, private issues.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr O&rsquo;Dowd raised the issue of parity not being broken.  Payment to tenants is a much wider issue as it touches on the social financial  inclusion agenda, which Members must bear in mind.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">On the issue Mr McCarthy raised, that leaflet was prepared  prior to devolution, and I am in the course of responding to him in writing on  the matter.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy:</strong> Will  the Housing Executive withdraw the leaflet in view of what has just been  said?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie:</strong> I have told the Housing Executive that it  is for the Minister, the Assembly and the Executive to deal with legislation.  The Housing Executive will not be proceeding with that course of action.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I would like to thank the Member for drawing that to my  attention; I was able to speak directly to the chief executive about it last  Tuesday night.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, to respond to Mr McCann&rsquo;s claim that landlords  will withdraw from the market, experience in the Pathfinder areas in GB was  that more landlords were in the market and can move in and out of it. It is  simply subject to market conditions.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Speaker and Members, I am grateful for your indulgence.  I hope that, because of the reassurances that I have provided the House, the tablers  will withdraw the amendments. If the y feel unable to do so, I would urge  Members to reject the amendments and to allow the Social Development Committee  and me to proceed as we agreed to in taking forward this important and  sensitive issue that impacts on many people in the North of Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker:</strong> I ask Mr McCann to make a winding-up speech  on the amendment, and to be as brief as possible.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann:</strong> Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann  Comhairle. I will be as brief as I was last time, when I only spoke for an  hour.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have a number of points to make regarding the amendments.  Many people in the House and especially in the Committee said that they had  serious concerns about this amendment. The  reaction tonight is surprising; I  thought that everyone here could have supported these simple, and  simplifying, amendments. I appreciate that the Minister told the Committee that  she would return to it, but there is no guarantee that this will be taken on  board when she does.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In fact, there was some confusion in the Committee when the  Minister was giving the commitment that nothing  would change. One of her advisors contradicted her and said that anyone  new coming onto benefits, or anyone moving house would not be included in the  commitment she gave. Mr McCarthy tells me he has tried to clarify things a  second time. There seems to be some confusion between the DSD, the Minister,  and the Housing Executive. The problem with these contradictions is that  Ministers come and go, but Bills stay. We are trying to insert amendments that  protect the most vulnerable people in society. I propose the amendment, go  raibh maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText"><em>Amendment No 3 negatived.</em></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker:</strong> As amendment No 3 has not been made,  amendment No 4 falls.</p>

	      <p class="H3SectionHeading">Private  Notice Question</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Craigavon   High School: <br>
	        Deaths of Young People</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Speaker: I have  received a private notice question, in accordance with Standing Order  20, for the Minister of Education. The question has been circulated to Members  and is available in their pigeonholes.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong> asked the Minister of Education what  assistance she is providing to the staff and pupils of Craigavon High School,  and to students in Tandragee and Laurelvale areas, following the recent tragic  deaths of young people from that school; and to detail any measures of  co-operation that her Department is undertaking with other Departments and  agencies.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">The Minister of Education (Ms Ruane): I thank Danny Kennedy for his timely question, which  provides me with the opportunity to  publicly express my deepest sympathies  to the families and friends of the young men at the heart of this tragedy. I also extend my sympathies to all of the families, friends and communities,  through&shy;out Ireland,  who have suffered as a result of suicide.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I spoke today with the principal of the school, and with  the school counsellor. I pay tribute to them for the wonderful work that they  are doing. I have also spoken to principals of schools in other parts of the  North about this issue. Two weeks ago, I hosted a private meeting in an area of  my constituency with school principals, counsellors, health professionals,  sporting organisations and local clergy. That meeting was held to try to  understand, from their perspective, why suicides were taking place, what  measures could be put in place to prevent them, and what support is needed,  right across the North. I was struck by the compassion and the commitment of  the school principals and their teams, and also by what a huge responsibility  they presently bear.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">On the issue of the latest suicides, I confirm that the  critical incident response team from the Southern Education and Library Board (SELB) have been working in the  school to provide support for individual pupils, groups of pupils, staff and parents. That includes giving advice to office staff who are answering telephone  calls.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Today, a fresh support strategy has been agreed with the school authorities, which will focus on the  immediate, medium and long-term  support needs of pupils and staff. A helpline has been set up in the school  for parents, and a leaflet with contact information about support is to be  issued to all pupils and parents.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Kennedy asked about the wider measures of co-operation  that I am undertaking &mdash; I feel that that is the more appropriate focus at this  time. People who have been caught up in this tragedy need space, time and  privacy to grieve and to try to come to terms with what has happened.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I urge the media &mdash; in fact, I make a plea to the media &mdash; to  respect that need and to treat all discussion on the issue responsibly and  sensitively.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">6.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I acknowledge that the immediate crisis focuses on  school-age children. However, those who have left education, up to the age of 25, are an equally vulnerable group.  Weekends are a particularly vulnerable time, and I want to look at &mdash; with all  my colleagues &mdash; the totality of the education response.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Youth Service runs initiatives, such as the well-being  programme, which encourage young people to build confidence, improve their self-esteem  and develop coping skills. Samaritans are considering offering text-messaging  support at exam times. We need to engage with other organisations as well.  These include children&rsquo;s rights organisations, such as the Children&rsquo;s  Commissioner.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  Mr Speaker, may I ask for order while the Minister is speaking. It is a very  important speech.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker:</strong> Order. The Minister is speaking.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane:</strong> The children&rsquo;s rights organisations also  include Save the Children. The Children&rsquo;s Commissioner and her team have played  a leading role in suicide-prevention. I pay tribute to them all.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Suicide concerns me greatly. It is an issue that confronts all schools and communities across the  North. No area, no class and no creed has been spared. It is a blight on  our society that affects young and old &mdash; but particularly the young &mdash; and one  that we must begin to discuss in a constructive way and work together to find a  way forward.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Education in schools must be part of the solution. However, the response needs to be much wider than  that of only one Department. The Department of Education has a big part  to play but we cannot do it on our own. From September, all post-primary  schools that wish to will have a minimum amount of counselling time allocated  to them to support pupils. Following public-tender action, Contact Youth will  provide that service. That organisation has operated in the North for over 20  years and has extensive experience of meeting the support needs of young  people. The Department of Education will provide advice and guidance on the  stressors faced by young people and the issues around suicide and its triggers.  Departmental guidance on suicide and self-harm is being updated.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Recently, I met with my colleague the Minister of Health,  Social Services and Public Safety, Mr Michael McGimpsey. We talked about the  issue of suicide and how we might work together more closely and more  effectively to support the work of the suicide strategy implementation body.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">For a number of years, I have worked very closely with the Public Initiative to Prevent Suicide and  self-harm (PIPS) and, last week, in my role as Minister, I formally met with its representatives. PIPS is a  voluntary organisation dedicated to preventing suicide and to supporting  those who have been affected by suicide and self-harm. I learned from them, and  from my visits to schools, about work that is going on in schools across the  North to raise awareness among teachers about stress and action that can be  taken to develop and improve pupil self-esteem.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am aware of other locally based initiatives, all with similar aims. I pay a very special tribute to  those families who have been very  brave in speaking publicly about the issue of suicide. It is important  that we destigmatise the issue of suicide and that we create safe spaces to talk about it. I welcome the new centre in north Belfast, and the pack that PIPS has produced that also  contains a DVD about suicide prevention.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Since I took up office, I have not shied away from talking  about the problem. On my visits to schools, I have learned about the  experiences of school staff and their  concerns about the stresses on young people and the impact that they can  have on their general well-being.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As a society, we need to give our young people a sense of  hope. We need to be more effective in giving our young people the emotional  skills to cope with difficulties. We need to actively encourage them to tell us  what is amiss. We need to listen to them, to value what they have to say and to  respond to them. We need to give them a future that they will believe in and  that they can shape.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Today, I urge directly any young person, whose friend has  confided that he or she plans to take his or her life, to tell a trusted adult.  It is not breaking a friend&rsquo;s confidence if you tell a trusted adult. It is not  your responsibility, as a friend, to deal with that on your own. Young people  could save lives by contacting a trusted adult, Childline, Samaritans or the  suicide prevention helpline.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I repeat to any  young person watching these proceedings: you can save a life.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I assure the Assembly that all the resources available to  my Department to support young people will be used. The Department of Education  will work with all other Departments, agencies and organisations with expertise  and experience in the areas of suicide and self-harm to make our response to  this tragedy the best that it can be. Lessons can be learned from the South of  Ireland and Scotland,  both of which have a high instance of suicide. Earlier this evening, the  Scottish First Minister, Alex Salmond, addressed us. In response to a question  from Gerry Adams, he said that Scotland  was willing to share with us in the North the strategies that it uses. We must  learn how to deal with the problem from other countries across Europe; that is our  challenge in the weeks and months ahead. Immediate support must continue  to be in place for the children who are affected.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In one of the schools that I visited I had what will remain  a private discussion, as such matters must be handled carefully. The principals  said that they had to deal with the  suicide, the aftermath and with the brothers and sisters in the  classroom. All Departments must get together and work on the issue. Go raibh  maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>: Mr Speaker, I thank you for accepting the private notice question. I also thank the Minister for  making herself available to give a detailed statement to the Assembly in answer  to my question.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">This is a critical and distressing situation that is of  concern to all of us, whether as Members or parents. I am sure that the House  will join me in expressing our profound sympathy to all the families and  friends of the pupils involved and also to  the staff at their schools. I pay tribute to the work of the staff of  those schools. I am sure that Members will join me in paying tribute to the valuable work of education and health professionals  such as the critical illness response team and voluntary organisations such as  the Pips Project and, not least, local clergy who are involved in church  groups. The help offered by friends and neighbours to the families that are  affected has been considerable and has been appreciated by the families  involved.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister gave a detailed reply on her respons&shy;ibilities  as Minister of Education. However, can she outline any additional measures that  are being taken by her Department to provide assistance to any individual who  is affected or influenced by those tragic events, particularly in the coming  days and weeks, which is a critical period leading to the school summer  holidays? Can the Minister outline what assistance is available after normal  business hours, especially at weekends or in the early hours of the morning, when  young people are perhaps at their most vulnerable? Are the necessary helplines  available and can the Minister assure the House and the wider community that  every support and assistance will be given to anyone affected or influenced by  thoughts of suicide?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I hope that the Minister will be brief because time is running out.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane</strong>: I  will be brief. In the shorter term, the helplines are available at weekends,  which is one of the key times for vulnerable people. The Samaritans, Childline  and Suicide Helpline work around the clock.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department is also examining the advice and guidance  that is given to young people on how to use the internet safely, which is a  concern. Schools provide advice and guidance to pupils on appropriate use of  the internet. Departmental policies, which are updated regularly, have been  issued to school staff, pupils and parents. In all grant-aided schools,  internet access is provided through the Classroom 2000 system, which is  filtered in order to ban access to sites that have inappropriate content.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, the issue is much bigger than internet access in  schools. School is probably the safest place where children can use the  internet. The debate must be focused on how to support parents at all levels of  society in the responsible use of the  internet in their own homes. As a parent, I understand that that is  difficult.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Prior to my becoming the Minister of Education, my party  leader and I met the previous, direct rule Minister to discuss helplines. I am not aware of whether the matter has  been since been worked out. Many young people have mobile phones. However,  because teenagers are constantly telling  their parents that they have run out of credit, we sought to ensure that  helplines, like the 999 emergency line,  would be free. That must be considered right across the board, and I  will provide details.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Short-term measures can be introduced. However, short-,  medium- and long-term strategies &mdash; especially long-term strategies &mdash; must be  developed if the situation is to be dealt with effectively. Otherwise, the same  issues will simply continue to be discussed in the Assembly. Go raibh maith  agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Time has run out. Unfortunately, there is  none available for further questions on that particular item of business. I apologise to the three Members  who wished to speak in the debate. Time will not allow it.</p>
	      <p class="H3SectionHeading">Committee Business</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Committee Membership</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker:</strong> The next item on the Order Paper is the  motion to change the membership of the Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure.  As with other similar motions, it will be treated as a business motion.  Therefore, there will be no debate.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">That Mr Ken Robinson replace Mr David Burnside as a member of  the Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCausland:</strong> On a point of order, Mr Speaker, there  have been five meetings of the Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure, which  has had to deal with such contentious issues as the Irish language Bill. David  Burnside has not attended a single one of those meetings. Following his replacement on that Committee, he will  not be a member of any Committee at all.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Is it in order for a Member who is not a Minister not to  sit on any Committee? I do not know the answer to that. However, I do know that  it says something about Mr Burnside&rsquo;s commitment to the cause of unionism in  his constituency.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  That is not a point of order. The Member must resume his seat.</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion"><em><span style="font-size:11.0pt; ">Question put and agreed to.</span></em></p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion"><em><span style="font-size:11.0pt; ">Resolved:</span></em></p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">That Mr Ken Robinson replace Mr David Burnside as a member of  the Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  There is no time available for the debate on pay parity for further education  lecturers. I will ask the Business Committee to reschedule that item of business.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Adjourned at 6.58 pm.</p>
