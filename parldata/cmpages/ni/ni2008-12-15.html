          <p class="H4StageHeading">2008-09 December Monitoring Round and Executive  Response to the Economic Downturn</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I have received notice from the Minister of Finance and Personnel that he  wishes to make a statement on the 2008-09 December monitoring round and the  Executive&rsquo;s response to the economic downturn.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel (Mr Dodds)</strong>: With your permission, Mr Speaker, I will  make a statement on the outcome of the December monitoring round and the  Executive&rsquo;s response to the downturn in economic conditions.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Earlier this morning, the Executive unanimously agreed to  my recommendations on the response to the economic downturn and to the more  general pressures that Departments identified in their December monitoring  returns.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">As a result of those decisions, I am pleased to announce to  the Assembly almost &pound;70 million in special funding allocations, focused on  providing support to the local economy at this time of difficulty for business  and households.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Later today, the First Minister and deputy First Minister  will set out further details of the Executive&rsquo;s response in a take-note debate.  Although a number of challenges face the Executive, the main concern continues to  be the impact of the downturn in the economy and, in particular, market  conditions that are adversely affecting key sections of the construction  sector.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">In the early part of the decade, Northern   Ireland, like the rest of the United Kingdom, enjoyed an apparently  benign set of economic conditions with strong employment growth and rising  incomes. However, in recent years, house prices began to rise at an  unsustainable rate, creating pressures on first-time buyers in particular. That  was followed by energy prices rising to record levels with the associated  impact on the overall cost of living. Both bubbles have now burst, but we have  yet to see the full benefits of the fall in oil prices, despite the  announcement regarding gas and electricity prices &mdash; which I am sure that  Members welcome. Aside from the general cost of living, the decline in  house-building has had a major impact on the construction sector. That is compounded  by the crisis of confidence in the credit markets, which has forced economies  across the world into recession.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">As the scale and nature of the problems facing people in Northern Ireland  have changed, the Executive are responding by utilising the limited resources  available to them to maximum effect. However, Members will appreciate that as  ours is a small, open and regional economy, the Executive &mdash; despite their  desire to do everything possible &mdash; controls only a limited set of levers.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The United Kingdom Government has significantly greater  scope through, for example, taxation and social security, to influence economic  conditions in the short term, than have the Executive or the Assembly. In  recent months, the Chancellor of the Exchequer has taken significant steps to  recapitalise the banking sector and has announced in the pre-Budget report a  temporary reduction in the level of VAT in order to provide a stimulus to the  retail sector.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, bringing forward an increase in child benefit  from April to January, which is worth on average an additional &pound;22 to families,  and the payment of &pound;60 to all pensioners in the new year, will provide real  support to hard-pressed households. There is also support for business,  including the decision to defer the increase in the small companies&rsquo; rate of  corporation tax and, through a new Her Majesty&rsquo;s Revenue and Customs (HMRC)  business-payment support service, allowing businesses in temporary financial  difficulty to pay their HMRC tax bills on a timetable which they can meet. The  Bank of England has also played a significant role by reducing interest rates  to their lowest level since 1951.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive has a key responsibility to ensure that the  people of Northern Ireland  feel the full benefits of national measures and initiatives. They also need to  urge local banks to ensure that the lower cost of borrowing is passed on to  households and firms, as well as the recent announcement in The Queen&rsquo;s speech  of additional protection to homeowners at risk of default. Tomorrow, I will be  meeting the leaders of the four main local banks to discuss that.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Despite the fall in interest rates, many householders still  find it difficult to pay bills. For that reason, I welcome the consultation on  a protocol for mortgage repossession cases that has been initiated by the  courts in Northern Ireland.  I support the stance that repossession should be a last resort, and that all  other possibilities should be considered first, to give hard-pressed families  every chance to remain in their homes. That move comes in parallel with an  initiative by the Northern Ireland Court Service that will provide a free  advice service for those involved in repossession proceedings and who do not  have their own legal representation.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I turn to the construction industry. The importance of that  sector&rsquo;s contribution to the Northern    Ireland economy cannot be understated. In  2007, the industry&rsquo;s output was in excess of &pound;3&middot;3 billion, which was a record  level of output and included unprecedented investment in infrastructure.  Therefore, it is of particular concern that the downturn in the housing sector  has had such an impact in recent months. Whereas developers, contractors,  suppliers, professional firms and many individuals working in that sector have  been directly affected, in a close-knit community such as ours, the wider  impact of job losses and the credit crunch touches us all in some way.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I also share the concerns raised by all industry stakeholders  &mdash; many of whom I have met &mdash; regarding the need for the planned capital  investment that is set out in the investment strategy to be delivered to the  marketplace as quickly as possible. Clearly, delivering against our plans in  the rapidly deteriorating national and international economic climate is a  challenge for Departments individually and the Executive collectively. In  particular, significant reductions in the level of forecast receipts &mdash; arising  from prevailing market conditions &mdash; have had to be incorporated into our plans.  At this difficult time, that is a challenge faced by businesses and Governments  of all political persuasions across the world.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Rather than supporting all the Executive Ministers in  rising to that challenge, some Members of the Assembly have sought simply to  portray the issue as some sort of black hole in the Budget. That demonstrates  not only a complete lack of understanding of the global economic conditions,  but also contempt for the people of Northern Ireland, who we are  working to serve. The fact that the Executive have put together a package to  respond to those emerging issues, while continuing to deliver increased levels  of investment across all areas of public service, underscores the fallacy of  that argument.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive have also had to manage the implications of recent  legal challenges brought to the courts on certain procurements in relation to  the investment strategy. Those legal issues will take some time to resolve, and  Members will appreciate that I cannot comment further on the specific cases.  However, I am determined to ensure that the planned construction of schools and  other public-sector infrastructure continues. I can announce today that  construction projects that were to be delivered using the framework agreements  affected will not be stopped.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: Instead, my Department will be working with a wide  range of Government construction clients &mdash; including the Department of  Education &mdash; to move the procurement of projects forward as quickly as possible on  a project-by-project basis. As a result, I can announce today that contracts  worth some &pound;115 million that were due to be delivered by those frameworks will  now move ahead, thus avoiding unnecessary delay and allowing those contracts to  go to the marketplace in this financial year. Crucially, that means that no  construction project &mdash; including major projects relating to schools and  colleges &mdash; will be held up pending the outcome of legal proceedings.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, I have had the opportunity, following the pre-Budget  report, to accelerate capital investment from 2010-11 into the two preceding  years, with a maximum of &pound;9&middot;4 million being accelerated into the present  2008-09 financial year. I am pleased to announce that the Executive have agreed  to my proposal that the full amount is accelerated for this year.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">In placing a major emphasis on ensuring that public  investment in infrastructure is delivered to plan, the latest forecasts from  Departments indicate that the total capital investment this year will be about  &pound;1&middot;5 billion. That is the largest level of investment in a single year in Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  history, and it is well over double the level that was delivered by the last  devolved Administration.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, expenditure this year is some 40% ahead of this  time last year. That level of expenditure represents a real and meaningful  achievement by the Executive in the most difficult of circumstances.  Furthermore, public-sector investment in infrastructure is due to increase over  the remaining years of the investment strategy. The level of planned  expenditure for the first three years of that strategy is in the order of &pound;5  billion.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Major infrastructure projects with an estimated value of  almost &pound;1&middot;3 billion are already under construction this year. They include  seven major projects worth &pound;265 million in the Health Service; three major  projects worth &pound;420 million on roads; 10 waste-water projects worth &pound;89  million; the Belfast sewers project worth &pound;127 million; four further education  projects worth &pound;83 million; 14 major schools projects worth approximately &pound;233  million; three projects run by the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure  worth &pound;46 million; and three urban regeneration projects worth &pound;26 million.  Those schemes are under way in this financial year.</p>
          <p class="TimePeriod">12.15 pm</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">A further range of projects is scheduled to go to the  marketplace before the end of this financial year. The total value of those  proposed schemes is in excess of &pound;400 million. They include major projects in  health, roads, water infrastructure, and schools and colleges. Some examples  are: Beechall Health and Wellbeing Centre at a cost of &pound;14&middot;8 million; Shankill  Health and Wellbeing Centre at &pound;11&middot;6 million; the A26 Ballee Road East at &pound;7  million; water infrastructure projects at Dungannon and Moygashel worth &pound;26  million; and a major PPP school project amounting to &pound;50 million.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The gross capital investment that is planned for the next  two financial years is intended to be well in excess of &pound;3 billion. We are  establishing a construction industry forum procurement task group to focus on  the key task of ensuring that the projects continue to be delivered on the  ground. That will provide an opportunity for a wide range of key industry  stakeholders, drawn from the construction industry group, to examine the procurement  procedures that are used by the public sector and to increase industry  understanding of public procurement.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Small businesses make an important contribution to the Northern Ireland  economy, and I encourage them to form consortia to bid for contracts and to  look for opportunities in the supply chains of successful tenderers. However,  it is also important to maximise the opportunities that small contracting firms  have to bid for public contracts. My Department will work with the industry and  Government construction clients in order to establish appropriate procurement  procedures to achieve that.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Public procurement policy requires that we advertise all  procurement opportunities that have a value in excess of &pound;30,000. In order to  assist small businesses to respond to those opportunities, the procurement board  &mdash; which I chair &mdash; has now agreed to implement a single e-sourcing system for  all its procurement activities. That system will increase the visibility of  tender opportunities and improve standardisation of approach to the  marketplace. That in turn will help small businesses and will lead to a  reduction in the time and cost of bidding.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">It is important to ensure that we make every effort to  address any impediments to the delivery of projects on the ground. It is often  claimed that our planning system can be a major obstacle in the flow of new business  for the construction sector. In response to that, the Minister of the  Environment and I commissioned the performance and efficiency delivery unit  (PEDU) to conduct a review of the processing of planning applications. Working  in conjunction with, and with the full and enthusiastic support of the Planning  Service, the review team concluded that there was significant scope to improve  processing times by better managing the often-repeated and lengthy interactions  between agents and consultees. The team also proposed a number of actions in  relation to better performance management, the reactiveness of the senior  management structure, and a need for short-term interventions in those planning  divisions where performance was adrift of the required level.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Both the Minister of the Environment and I endorsed fully  the detailed action plan that the Planning Service prepared to address those  issues, and we expect to see a measurable improvement in performance in the  short term. Once again, this is another example of this devolved Administration  delivering on our commitment to proactively challenge and improve public  services. I believe that it will pay dividends.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Cash flow is another key issue for local firms at this time  &mdash; particularly small businesses &mdash; given the apparent hesitancy of banks to  provide short-term liquidity cover. As a major purchaser of goods and services,  Northern Ireland Departments have a key responsibility to provide assistance in  this respect.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Each year, central Government in Northern Ireland spend more than &pound;2  billion on goods and services. That is &pound;2,000 million, a significant proportion  of which is spent with locally based businesses. Against an economic background  of very tight credit terms between businesses, and between businesses and  banks, prompt payment by the public sector is essential.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">In the current economic climate, we must do all that we can  to support the local economy, and a direct way in which we can achieve that is  by processing and paying Government bills promptly. For that reason, I have  asked all public-sector organisations to reduce their targets for paying  approved invoices from 30 days to 10 days.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">By reducing the amount of time that businesses may be out  of pocket for goods and services provided to the public sector, we seek to help  reduce the pressure that local businesses may be under, owing to their cash  flows, banking facilities or credit terms with their suppliers.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I have been engaged with our leading banks, and, as I  mentioned, I am chairing a meeting of the four main banks to discuss how they  might best assist consumers and local businesses through the very difficult  economic time. It must be ensured that all assistance schemes, such as the  small firms loan guarantee scheme and European investment bank funding are  fully utilised.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The focus of my work was not restricted to those who need  our help but included those who can help us. As a consequence of sustained  dialogue with the Chief Secretary to the Treasury and the Prime Minister, an  assistance package has been secured that is worth more than &pound;900 million over  this year and next. That includes access to funding to assist with our response  to the current economic position, and the removal of significant cost pressures  that we would otherwise have faced. Those pressures would have necessitated the  diversion of funding away from front-line public services, and I am grateful to  the Prime Minister for the personal attention that he has given that issue. We  continue to engage on a range of other issues that faces us.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">It is not only the construction industry that is feeling  the impact of the economic downturn. As the decline in activity persists, local  households and businesses are faced with further pressures on top of an  increased cost of living in the past year.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Despite the work that has been done, and the work that we  will continue to do, the Executive&rsquo;s response to the economic downturn must go  further. For that reason, the main focus of the December monitoring round was  on the economy, and not just on the range of other pressures that Departments  currently face.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">In preparation for the monitoring round, Departments were  asked to identify costed measures in response to the economic downturn that  could be delivered before the end of the financial year. However, Members will  be aware that Departments can do a great deal without the need for significant  additional resources. Measures include the debt-advice and consumer-protection  work that the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment is undertaking.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">All those proposals were discussed in the context of  available resources at the Executive meetings of 27 November, 8 December and 11  December, and at the Executive subgroup meeting on 4 December.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive concluded the September monitoring round with  an expenditure overcommitment of &pound;65 million. That has been offset by &pound;72&middot;6  million of reduced requirements that Departments identified, and a small amount  from the pre-Budget report.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive entered the December monitoring round with a  capital-expenditure overcommitment of &pound;103&middot;2 million. That follows the  suspension of the Workplace 2010 procurement process and the anticipated shortfall  in capital receipts as a result of the capital-assets realisation team&rsquo;s work.  That was offset by &pound;11&middot;1 million from the pre-Budget report and by &pound;31&middot;8  million of reduced requirements.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">However, the Executive were rightly concerned that the  relatively low level of capital-expenditure reduced requirements meant that  they would not be in a position to provide a sufficiently substantive response  to the downturn in economic conditions. Therefore, Departments were asked to  reconsider their capital-expenditure requirements for the remainder of the  financial year. That resulted in a further &pound;36 million of easements being  identified, which were then available for the Executive to allocate.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The low level of capital reduced requirements meant that  there was less for the Executive to reallocate but, as I have indicated, it  also meant that more capital projects are being taken forward, hence providing  immediate support for the construction sector, rather than those funds being  delayed by reallocation as part of the monitoring process.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">This implies, in the entirety of 2008-09, an additional &pound;270  million in net capital expenditure, and highlights the most significant action  that can be taken by the Executive and Departments in support of the local  construction industry &mdash; to deliver on the ambitious plans contained in last  year&rsquo;s Budget.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive&rsquo;s key decision was how much should be  allocated to the proposed measures in response to the economic downturn,  against the departmental pressures identified in the December monitoring  returns. Based on careful consideration of the proposals and in response to the  economic downturn, the Executive have agreed the following package of measures,  which focus on the construction sector and are designed to have the most  immediate impact.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">There will be &pound;20 million for the farm nutrient management  scheme, which has buffered the construction sector from the downturn in the  property market. That funding allows for the completion of schemes in which 40%  of funding comes from individual farmers, thus leveraging further support for  construction firms. The extra allocation will provide additional work for  construction firms worth more than &pound;33 million. The entire scheme is worth more  than &pound;200 million to the sector. Schools maintenance will be allocated an  additional &pound;4 million; roads structural maintenance will receive &pound;2&middot;5 million;  and there will be &pound;1&middot;8 million for public-transport capital works. Those  measures will provide extra work for the construction sector at very short  notice and improve our public infrastructure.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Fuel poverty has been at the heart of he Executive&rsquo;s  discussions. I welcome today&rsquo;s announcements that NIE Energy&rsquo;s electricity  tariff will be reduced by 10&middot;8% from 1 January 2009; that Phoenix Supply plans  to reduce its prices by 22&middot;1% from 8 January 2009; and that Firmus Energy will  further extend its price cap until February 2009, in order to help customers to  budget their energy needs into January &mdash; usually one of the coldest months of  the year. I commend everyone involved for their work in ensuring that the  tariff review process was completed speedily, which enabled those welcome  reductions to be announced before Christmas.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">However, the Executive believe that, at this stage, they  can, and must, do more to help offset the impact of increased costs already  endured by households. In December monitoring, the Social Development Minister  proposed that 65,000 households should receive support with their fuel bills  this year. However, I believe that we must go further.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: It is for that reason that I today announce &pound;15  million for fuel poverty, which amounts to a &pound;150 payment to 100,000 households  in receipt of income support or pension credits. The Office of the First  Minister and deputy First Minister (OFMDFM) will state later today how those  payments will be facilitated. That money will provide additional help to 65,000  households on income support, and to a further 36,000 on pension credit.  Pensioners will receive the &pound;150 on top of their winter fuel allowance of up to  &pound;250 for those aged 60 to 79 and &pound;400 to those aged over 80.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, the Executive also agreed to the following  allocations. There will be &pound;500,000 for flooding hardship in agriculture. With  the downturn in the economy expected to place significant downward pressure on  the price of agricultural produce, that funding will put those farmers already  suffering because of the severe flooding in the summer in a more stable  position as they move into increasingly difficult trading conditions.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I also propose to make available &pound;700,000 for the fishing  industry in respect of harbour and light dues, so as to provide some respite in  the face of rising input costs and falling quotas.</p>
          <p class="TimePeriod">12.30 pm</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I also announce a further &pound;20 million of current  expenditure to deal with a range of other pressures that Departments have  identified: &pound;1&middot;6 million to the Department of Health, Social Services and  Public Safety (DHSSPS) for children&rsquo;s funds, which follows agreement from  relevant Ministers about highest-priority projects; &pound;5 million to DHSSPS for  budget flexibility, which represents a third tranche of available funding to be  allocated to that Department during the year; &pound;4 million is a further  contribution to the increased cost of the special purchase of evacuated  dwellings scheme, although the Department for Social Development (DSD) must  take steps to meet the remainder of additional costs; &pound;3 million to tackle  pressures in a range of business areas in the Department for Regional  Development (DRD); &pound;2&middot;6 million to the Department of Education to fund back pay  and increased pay costs for part-time youth workers, following agreement on a  revised pay structure; &pound;2 million to the Department of the Environment (DOE) in  respect of lost income for the Planning Service from lower than expected  development activity; and a further &pound;1&middot;5 million to the Department of  Agriculture and Rural Development (DARD) to deal with pressures in respect of  animal health, because the rising market price of animals has implications for  the level of compensation payments.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Most available capital expenditure is required to fund a  specific package of measures in response to the economic downturn. However, it  was also judged that there is scope to make a further allocation, on top of  those in the previous monitoring round, of &pound;5 million to the Department for  Social Development for the housing programme. The consequence of those current  and capital expenditure allocations is that the Executive will leave the  December monitoring round with a planned over-commitment of &pound;75 million in  respect of current expenditure, and &pound;10 million in respect of capital  investment.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The fact that the Executive have been able to respond to  those important issues serves to illustrate what can be achieved by a fully  functioning devolved Administration. However, as I have already explained, much  of the normal business in which the Executive and Departments engage will  directly benefit Northern    Ireland&rsquo;s economy through capital investment  and other public spending.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">It must not be forgotten that although single, high-profile  initiatives are, of course, valuable, often the routine and sometimes  unglamorous business of day-to-day Government can make the biggest difference.  Simply reducing Departments&rsquo; underspend and focusing on delivering the  Executive&rsquo;s well-crafted and ambitious plans will provide much of the support  that is needed.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Northern Ireland Executive have limited tax-raising powers  at their disposal. However, I want to make further announcements on areas for  which we have responsibility. The Executive have already taken measures to  freeze the domestic regional rate, to defer water charges, and to introduce a  concessionary fare scheme, as well as plans to abolish prescription charges. In  addition, I have examined how reform of the rating system can provide further  assistance. Members will be aware that my Department has put several measures in  place in the rating system that already help households and businesses, and  which will continue to provide support during these difficult economic times.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">On the domestic side, the regional rate has been frozen at  2007-08 levels for the current financial year, for the next financial year, and  for the financial year after that. Coupled with deferment of water charges,  that will lead to substantial savings for many families. As a result of the  decisions that have been taken on the regional rate and water charging, the  average householder will be more than &pound;1,000 better off during the current  Assembly term than would have been the case under direct rule.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The lone pensioner allowance was introduced in April 2008.  It provides pensioners who are over 70 years of age and who live on their own  with a 20% reduction in their rate bill. Already, more than 20,000 pensioners  have benefited from the allowance. Changes to the rules on savings in the rate  relief scheme also make it easier for pensioners to claim relief. Recently, I  have also set out my plans to introduce a rate deferment scheme to allow  pensioners, if they so choose, to defer payments of their rates bill.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Work has also been taken forward alongside the Department  for Social Development to improve the take-up of rates relief and to ensure  that people who are entitled to relief receive it. At present, that is vital.  Having considered the current situation and the best way forward for households  and businesses, I intend to go further.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Shortly, I will bring forward details of the scheme that I  announced a few months back, which, from 2010 onwards, will provide a rate  rebate to people who carry out energy-efficiency improvements by bringing their  homes up to modern standards of insulation. That simple step will provide an  added incentive to householders to invest sensibly and effectively, help to cut  Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  energy bill and put a little more money into people&rsquo;s pockets.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">A further measure that I will take forward relates to my  earlier proposal to provide a five-year rates holiday to zero-carbon homes.  Following public consultation earlier this year, I was persuaded to go further  and to extend the scheme to include a two-year rates holiday for new low-carbon  homes. That will further help house-builders by encouraging demand for  energy-efficient housing, and, therefore, will provide a double benefit.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">On the business front, industrial rates have been frozen at  30%, which I am sure is already providing a welcome boost to many in the  manufacturing sector. Rate relief is already being provided to the freight and  transport sector, which is benefiting many of our important docks and transport  companies. However, I intend to provide further support to local business  through further changes to the rating system. Today, I can announce that I  intend to take forward a proposal for new legislation to allow a targeted  small-business rates-relief scheme to be introduced.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: Importantly, that scheme will be funded centrally  and not by charging other ratepayers more. The process of bringing final proposals  to the Executive and taking enabling legislation through the Assembly means  that, if it is passed, the scheme will come into force in 2010. However, it is  also necessary to give further help that will take effect as soon as possible.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Members will be aware of the announcement at the time of  the last Budget that the non-domestic regional rate &mdash; which applies to all  businesses &mdash; would increase only in line with the forecast inflation at that  time over the life of the comprehensive spending review period, so as to  provide much-needed certainty for businesses moving forward. However, to ensure  that we provide much-needed support quickly and effectively, I propose &mdash; as an  interim measure &mdash; that non-domestic rates should be frozen in cash terms for 2009-2010.  That will further enhance the competitiveness of local firms, protect jobs and  incomes, and represent a real saving for all the hard-pressed businesses  operating in Northern    Ireland during these difficult times. The  measure will be worth almost &pound;8 million to Northern Ireland businesses in  2009-2010.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: The Executive entered this monitoring round at a  time when economic conditions were in decline across the world. There is little  indication that the end is in sight, despite the unprecedented measures that  have been taken by a number of national Governments. The changing economic  conditions impact on us all, whether in household bills or the prospects of  local business.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The public sector has been described as being a &ldquo;cushion&rdquo;  for the Northern Ireland  economy, but it must be recognised that the downturn has also impacted on the  level of resources available to the Executive. Today&rsquo;s announcements show that  we are taking action by introducing a series of measures that will provide  maximum benefit to those areas most in need, while recognising the financial  constraints that we face. Within the powers that are open to the Executive,  this package is good for business, good for the construction industry and good  for families. I commend the statement to the Assembly.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Finance and Personnel (Mr McLaughlin)</strong>: Go raibh maith  agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I welcome the statement, and I commend the Minister,  his Executive colleagues and his officials for taking forward such a  comprehensive package in exceptionally difficult circumstances. In particular,  we should welcome the meeting with the local banks; the initiatives on  procurement, which are vital; and the planning-reform process that has already  started. The small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) sector will particularly  welcome the small-business rates-relief scheme, although there may be some  concern that it will not take effect until 2010, because the wolf is already at  the door in many cases.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I would hope that the Minister, given, I suppose, the  necessary cross-party support, would possibly be open to reconsidering that  timeline.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">For some time, the Committee for Finance and Personnel has  been highlighting Departments&rsquo; underperformance in financial forecasting and  monitoring. Given the current economic climate, it will be intolerable if  previous patterns of departmental underspend are repeated at the end of the  financial year. I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s comments on expenditure and the fact  that we are 40% in advance of last year&rsquo;s position. Last June, the then  Minister of Finance and Personnel, Peter Robinson, spoke of setting incentives  and sanctions at organisation and individual levels in order to raise the  standard of financial management in Departments. Can the Minister advise  whether progress has been made on establishing such incentives and sanctions?</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee for Finance and Personnel has received  reports that other Committees are experiencing difficulty in obtaining timely  financial information &mdash; including on monitoring rounds &mdash; from their  Departments. How important is that with regard to the scrutiny role of  Committees? Has the Department of Finance and Personnel (DFP) considered what  immediate pre-emptive measures Departments can take in order to avoid  significant end-year underspend?</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I thank the Chairperson of the Committee for Finance  and Personnel for his comments. I agree on the issue of underspend, and I am  grateful for the Committee&rsquo;s co-operation and work on that subject. As I said in  my statement, it is obviously good that money is being spent from capital  budgets because that means that work is being delivered on the ground. However,  we must guard against a situation whereby money remains unspent in capital  budgets at the end of the year. I am monitoring that situation closely, and I  am grateful for the Committee&rsquo;s assistance in monitoring that, too. I am sure  that each departmental Committee will keep that matter under review.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Chairperson referred to the timeline for legislation. I  want to enact legislation that relates to the small-business rates relief  scheme as quickly as possible, and I want it to be up and running by the start  of the new financial year in April 2010. Therefore, I look forward to MLAs&rsquo;  co-operation on that issue, which will be widely welcomed by businesses in Northern Ireland.  As I said in my statement, however, the Department is already taking action in  order that some help will come through to businesses from April 2009 by  freezing in cash terms the expected increase in the regional rate for  businesses.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Chairperson raised financial management issues, which  the Department will continue to discuss with him and the Committee. I am  conscious of the Committee&rsquo;s views on those matters, and I assure the Chairperson  of my continued co-operation in achieving our common purpose, which is to  ensure that we get the best value for money from every pound of public  expenditure in Northern    Ireland for the benefit of all our people.  That is why we are here.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I am sure that the House and, more importantly, the people of Northern Ireland  are grateful for the Minister&rsquo;s statement. I echo the comments of the  Chairperson of the Committee for Finance and Personnel in welcoming the freeze  on business rates &mdash; which will be a real-terms cut over the period &mdash; and the  prospect of a small-business rates relief scheme.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee for Finance and Personnel has taken a  long-standing interest in the important ongoing Civil Service reform  programmes. During the previous monitoring round, the House was told that  improved rates collection from Land and Property Services would be used to fund  those Civil Service reform programmes. Does the Minister still expect those  important programmes to be delivered in the allotted timescales?</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I am grateful to the Deputy Chairperson of the  Committee for Finance and Personnel for his remarks. He referred to the &pound;1&middot;5  million that was allocated to address the backlog in rates arrears during the  September monitoring round. Although that matter does not impact on councils&rsquo;  expenditure, we must address the issue.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Of course, all of us are conscious that households and  businesses are facing difficult times with respect to the bills that they have  to pay. Nevertheless, that work is progressing. The money that is to be raised  is to ensure that reforms take place without any extra call on money that would  be spent on front-line services.</p>
          <p class="TimePeriod">12.45 pm</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">It is important to note not only the measures referred to  by the Member but all the measures that have been initiated through rating  reforms, this year and last year, that are bringing real benefits to households  and businesses in Northern    Ireland.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement, although he will appreciate that I will  insist on disagreeing with the point that he made about the hole &mdash; and I hope  that he is not digging one for himself and the economy. However, every little  bit helps.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome what he said about the vulnerable, and I  particularly appreciate the relief he has offered to fishermen, including those  in my own constituency. It is also very good of him to help the Father of the  House over Christmas with the little bonus he has announced today. Every little  bit helps.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he expects the  economy to be out of recession by the third quarter of next year, yet most  economists predict that it will be much later, in 2010, before there is an  upturn. Does the Minister agree with the Chancellor, or does he share the  prediction of the economists? What contingency arrangements has the Minister in  mind to assist businesses, large, medium and small, through the next two years?</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I welcome what the Member has said about the  measures that I have announced. He mentioned the black hole, although he did  not dwell on it as much as he normally does, because he is beginning to see  light at the bottom of that hole. I hope that as he continues to study the  figures in more detail, he will increasingly realise the fact of the matter. I  have set out the financial position, and it is clear how we are going to deal  with those issues.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Member mentioned economists; I will not get into the  business of speculation or forecasting because one will get a different prediction  from each economist one meets &mdash; I see that the Member is acknowledging that by  nodding his head. If we are now going to listen to economists predicting when  we will get out of this downturn and how things are going to work out, we  should remember that six months or a year ago none of those economists  predicted that the economy would be going into a downturn to the extent that it  has done so. The vast majority of them were not predicting the current  situation facing the banks in relation to the credit crunch or the problems  with lending. Those are issues that have arisen now. Had there been consensus  that this would happen, some economists would have been saying something  different than what they said at the time.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I have announced substantial help for businesses. The  Member will acknowledge the fact that a small- business rates-relief scheme  will be introduced in Northern    Ireland for the first time. In April 2009,  we will take measures to remove &pound;8 million of costs that would have been paid  by businesses through rates. We have also welcomed the changes made by the  national Government in the pre-Budget report, and are working with the  Government on those changes &mdash; including deferment of corporation tax for small  businesses and the fact that they can now spread those payments across a longer  period. We will be working with the banks &mdash; and I have already been speaking to  representatives of the banks and will do so again tomorrow &mdash; on the need to  ensure that there is a maximum take-up of the small-loans guarantee fund and  the European Investment Bank route.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">It is right to point out that the Executive&rsquo;s and the  Assembly&rsquo;s decision to endorse putting the economy at the centre of the  Programme for Government has been entirely vindicated by events. Had that not been  done, Northern Ireland  would be in a much more difficult position now than it is. I am sure that the  Member will agree that what I have announced today &mdash; building on what has  already been announced, and taking account of the 30% cap on manufacturing rates,  and a lot of other issues &mdash; shows that a substantial amount is being done for  businesses. We will continue to work with the Construction Industry Forum for Northern Ireland, the Federation of Small  Businesses, the Confederation of British Industry, the Institute of Directors,  and others.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr McDonnell</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his statement. I note too the mutual admiration  society set up by McLaughlin. I hope that that is not a reflection &mdash; and I see  that he is on the run &mdash; of the fact that there have not been any significant  cuts in the budgets of Departments that are headed by the DUP or Sinn F&eacute;in. I  do not have tables with me to make it exactly clear, but &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr McDonnell</strong>:  I want to know why the attacks on the Department for Social Development, in  particular, have been so ruthless. According to my calculations, the DSD budget  has been slashed by some &pound;30 million. I &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr McDonnell</strong>:  If the heckling could be stopped, I would like to know whether the Minister  thinks that it is a good thing to attack the homeless and the vulnerable at  this time. If I am wrong &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr McDonnell</strong>:  If I am wrong, all I want is for somebody to clarify what the net addition or  reduction is to the Department for Social Development&rsquo;s budget in the December  monitoring round. I may have got it wrong, and I would be very glad for the  Minister &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I will stand corrected if I am wrong, but it strikes me  that &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr McDonnell</strong>:  My figures suggest that the budget that is meant to help the homeless and the  vulnerable has been slashed by &pound;30 million. Let somebody put me right.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: The Member talked about a mutual admiration society,  but he is actually quite amiable and friendly in private. I am sorry that he  felt the need to say that. However, he admitted that he was seeking information  rather than making an assertion, so I accept that he may not be totally au fait  with the situation.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Department for Social Development stressed that the  issue of fuel poverty was the priority in its approach to the December  monitoring round and in relation to economic hardship. Our fuel-poverty  measures go further than those sought by the Minister for Social Development.  We are allocating &pound;15 million to assist 100,000 people &mdash; including pensioners &mdash;  with their winter fuel payments. The Minister for Social Development&rsquo;s proposal  did not include those who receive pension credit, but this proposal does.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I am sure that Members of this Assembly and people  who receive pension credit will be delighted with that announcement.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">During the last December monitoring round, &pound;15 million was  allocated for social housing. This time, &pound;5 million has been allocated to  social housing, and there is still the February monitoring round and the  end-year position to come. Over the next three years, &pound;925 million will be  allocated to the social-housing budget. After reading the facts of the matter,  how anyone can suggest that that is some kind of slash to the DSD budget is  beyond me. I put on record that no budgets have been cut. As regards the  Departments that are under the control of the Democratic Unionist Party, I  understand that the only change that may be made is &pound;2 million to cover a  shortfall in receipts in relation to planning.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Department of Enterprise,  Trade and Investment (DETI) has not been allocated any extra moneys; neither  has the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure (DCAL) &mdash; despite surrendering  moneys. That must also be put on record. The Executive Ministers agreed  unanimously that the allocations &mdash; within our limited constraints &mdash; should be  focused on the areas that can best help our construction industry, households  and businesses. In the circumstances, we have formulated a package that will be  warmly welcomed by many people throughout Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  thank the Minister and his Executive colleagues for the statement. The Alliance  Party welcomes some of the new measures that were announced today. However, I  should stress that several existing departmental policies have been  re-announced.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Does the Minister share my disappointment that, due to the  way the Executive cut the Budget, we are not able to do more to accelerate the  rate of capital investment in Northern    Ireland? Our colleagues in Scotland are investing an additional &pound;100  million in social housing and, in England, the Government are  investing an additional &pound;1 billion. Furthermore, in Scotland,  an additional &pound;260 million is being invested in capital schemes and, in England, and  additional &pound;500 million will be invested in the green economy. Why are pro rata  investments not being made in Northern    Ireland?</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, will the Minister explain how he intends to  persuade the Treasury that fuel credits meet the parity principle?</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I can assure the Member that there is no difficulty  in respect of his latter point.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Although I am glad that the Member welcomed some aspects of  my announcement, I recognise that he must carpet some issues and, therefore, in  his first point, he picked on procurement. However, the Member has chosen bad  ground on which to take issue with the Executive. Already this year, &pound;1&middot;3  billion is being spent on construction and capital projects in Northern Ireland.  In 2003-04, that figure was &pound;676 million, so there has been a massive increase  &mdash; we are 40% ahead of where we were last year.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, in order to accelerate matters, two framework  projects, which are under attack due to legal challenges and which would  otherwise have caused other projects to be delayed, possibly until next year,  will be removed from the procurement process framework and secured by  individual, project-by-project procurement. That will ensure that approximately  &pound;115 million of construction work and capital investment in schools, colleges  and elsewhere will proceed this year. Therefore, we are taking action to deal  with the points that the Member raised.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Member said that some of my announcements are not new.  However, the small-business rates-relief scheme is new; the measure to address  the amount of rates that businesses pay is new; fuel credits are new; we are  introducing new procurement measures; and we are moving forward with PEDU in a  new way. Therefore, when the Member examines the facts, he should come to a  slightly different conclusion. Nevertheless, I welcome the fact that he  welcomed some aspects of my statement, and I entirely understand that he must  say some things for political reasons.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McQuillan</strong>:  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement, which is positive and constructive. Given  the importance of efficiency targets, what action has the Minister taken to  ensure that efficiency savings do not impact on front-line services? In  addition, will the Minister update Members about the situation in respect of  civil servants&rsquo; back pay?</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I thank the Member for his question. It is up to  each Minister, and his or her Department, to consider efficiency savings and to  produce proposals. In addition, no doubt, they will speak to their Committees  about such matters, which will, as they have already, be subject to debate in  the Assembly.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">As for the matter of equal pay, as I told the Assembly  recently, I am glad to say that intensive engagement with the Chief Secretary  to the Treasury and the Prime Minister resulted in assurances that pressures  that the Executive and the Assembly would otherwise have faced need not now be  faced.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">One matter that must be addressed is civil servants&rsquo; equal  pay. However, as a result of the work that we have undertaken, we are now in a  much better position to do that. It is my and my Department&rsquo;s desire to settle  that matter as quickly as possible &mdash; we must get money into people&rsquo;s hands and  pockets, not only for their sake, but in order to boost the economy. Therefore,  to ensure that money is paid out, in the coming days my officials will engage  intensively with individuals and with the trade unions.</p>
          <p class="TimePeriod">1.00 pm</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Anderson</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his  statement, and I note his comment that this year&rsquo;s total capital investment will  be double the amount that was spent, in the same period, under the previous  Executive. I would have expected that fact to have elicited a reaction from  other parties.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">As a member of the Committee for the Office of the First  Minister and deputy First Minister, I have heard a great deal of evidence from  across the North, from many stakeholders and people who are suffering as a  result of the levels of poverty and deprivation that exist across our society.  The Minister&rsquo;s announcement of &pound;15 million to alleviate fuel poverty &mdash;  including help for pensioners, which was not in the previous proposal &mdash; will be  welcome news for many people.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">However, today&rsquo;s statement must be about more than simply  reallocating moneys to programmes and projects. We must ensure that those  moneys will be spent effectively and efficiently. I wish to ask the Minister  about the procurement task group. If the Government are to construct buildings  or maintain roads, schools, houses or bridges, or whatever else the Executive  will do, can the Minister influence the terms and conditions of the contracts,  so that the social requirements that are built into procurement contracts that  were announced earlier this year can be implemented in a way in which will  result in the creation &mdash;</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Ask a question.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Anderson</strong>:  &mdash; of jobs for the long-term unemployed and the establishment of  apprenticeships? I was asking a question.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I thank the Member for her question and for raising  that issue. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.] </span>She and other Members will  know that environmental and social guidelines exist for the procurement  process. Therefore, that issue has been taken on board.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">We recognise that, when seeking best value and ensuring  that the best projects are advanced in the best way, there are several  dimensions to procurement. DFP&rsquo;s Central Procurement Directorate has been  working with other Departments and centres of procurement expertise to develop  the type of proposal that the Member mentioned. We recognise the issue, and I  am sure that Members will continue to raise it and to monitor my Department&rsquo;s  progress, and I welcome that.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Paisley Jnr</strong>:  Does the Minister realise that, by making such a statement on 15 December, he  is in great danger of being mistaken for St Nicholas? Perhaps the new St Nigel  of December will come more frequently at Christmas, bearing such welcome  statements and good gifts.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I represent an agricultural constituency, so I welcome most  the benefits for the farming community that the Minister mentioned, as well as  those that he has identified for small-business users.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">All Members received a Christmas card this morning from the  Scrooge of the Executive, the Minister for Social Development, which indicated  that she wants to share the future. Does the Minister of Finance and Personnel  accept that the Minister for Social Development did not want to share enough  when it came to the fuel-credit scheme? We very much welcome the Executive&rsquo;s more  ambitious action to ensure that more people &mdash; indeed, 40,000 more &mdash; will  benefit from the fuel scheme that Minister Dodds has announced today.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister tell the House what lies behind the  allocation of &pound;4 million to the special purchase of evacuated dwelling scheme?  That signifies a worrying trend to those of us who are interested in the  security and policing of our country.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, I understand that the Minister has identified an  additional &pound;5 million that can be allocated to the social housing programme.  That represents another bail-out of the Department for Social Development. When  will the Minister stop bailing out DSD and insist that the Minister for Social  Development runs her Department efficiently?</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I am not sure about being compared to St Nicholas; I  would have to grow a beard pretty quickly.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">It is worth re-emphasising that, according to what we heard  from DSD, clear emphasis was placed on fuel poverty. We have looked at that  issue.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly and the Executive must recognise also that an  enormous amount of money has been allocated to the warm homes scheme. That is a  welcome initiative that was introduced by the previous devolved Administration  and one under which good work continues to be done. I know that a review is  under way to examine how that scheme can be made to work even more effectively.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">We have gone further than what was proposed, and the  addition of 35,000 to 40,000 pensioners to the pension credit scheme will be  seen, especially by the older folk, as a very positive development at this  difficult time.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The special purchase of evacuated dwelling scheme (SPED) is  applied to individuals or families who have to move from their homes after the  Chief Constable has certified that security information about them has been  received. The Housing Executive is obliged to purchase the dwelling to enable  the individual or family to move. It is concerning that the budget for the  scheme is on the rise, and it is a matter for the Chief Constable and the  Department for Social Development to discuss that in more detail. At a time  when we are under budgetary pressures and when money is tight, it is deplorable  that more people are being moved out of their homes under the SPED scheme,  thereby bringing about the requirement for more money for the scheme.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Paisley Jnr mentioned social housing. Over the next  three years, &pound;925 million will be spent on housing in Northern Ireland.  The &pound;20 million that has been allocated in the September and December  monitoring rounds will be of enormous help to the social housing budget. The  February monitoring round and the end-year position will provide an opportunity  to consider further the social housing budget.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I can respond only to the bids that I receive and to the  emphasis and priority that Ministers place on them. If emphasis is placed on a  particular area of spending, we will respond to that. No Minister will receive  all their bids or, indeed, the full amount of their bids. There is simply not  the flexibility to do that, unless an underspend and reduced requirements are  declared to the Executive. One must remember that we are not obtaining new  sources of money; we are receiving money that has been reduced by other  Departments and allocating it to other Departments.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I  also thank the Minister for his statement, and I note some interesting changes  in it. In 2006-07, the level of planned overcommitment was some &pound;130 million,  yet actual underexpenditure was over &pound;250 million. However, the previous  Finance Minister reduced the level of overcommitment to &pound;100 million. Does the  Minister agree that in extending belatedly the amount of overcommitment, he is  reversing the decision of his predecessor and that he will be implementing one  of the ideas that was suggested by the Ulster Unionist Party in its submission  on the draft Budget?</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I do not accept that at all. In the day that is in  it, given the significance of the announcements that are being made, that sort  of point will be lost on 99&middot;99% of the population. It is interesting to hear  what the Member is saying, because another member of his party talks  continually about the black hole. If we were to go down the road of ever-increasing  overcommitment, which is what he is talking about, we would be storing up more  of a black hole.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">We have taken a prudent and sensible approach that is based  on previous experience as against what Departments are saying to us about the  current level of expenditure. The position changes from year to year, and in  this financial year, Departments are telling my Department and I &mdash; and that  information is all that I can go on &mdash; that they are monitoring carefully their  spending position, especially their capital expenditure, and that things are  tighter this year than they have been in previous years.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">However, I note that the Member generally welcomed the  statement and the various announcements that were contained in it.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his statement; it contains some good measures. However,  I register a complaint that the copies that were circulated were not  accompanied by the usual tables showing the full reductions and allocations  across all Departments. Mr Speaker, I ask you also to consider that omission.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister said that no budgets have been cut, and I know  that he would not want to mislead the Assembly. Will he confirm that, in this  monitoring round, the funding to the Housing Executive&rsquo;s capital maintenance programme  has been reduced by &pound;30 million? Work under that programme is carried out by  small and medium-sized building firms, and the materials come from small  suppliers across Northern    Ireland. Will he confirm, therefore, that  the net effect of his monitoring round on the construction industry is not to  benefit it but to damage it considerably?</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I do not know where the Member got that information.  In fact, an extra amount of &pound;5 million, on top of &pound;15 million in the last  monitoring round, has been allocated to social housing. Every Department  submits bids due to shortfalls, and I attempt to meet them. The Department for  Social Development is required, as is every other Department, to manage its  resources.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I have not made a cut, and I have not slashed the funding.  How anyone could perversely interpret what is being done is beyond me, unless  it is simply a wilful misinterpretation. However, it is interesting that the  SDLP Members have not even mentioned fuel credit or the extra investment to tackle  fuel poverty. None of them even said that they are glad that the measures that  I announced go further than their Minister&rsquo;s proposals. Instead, the SDLP is  considering how else to have a go.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Every Department faces pressures and shortfalls. My Department  met part of the shortfall in September and is meeting a further part now. The  year-end position will be considered, and the February monitoring round is yet  to come. The investment in social housing has not been reduced &mdash; it will, in  fact, receive more money.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his  statement, and I welcome the inclusion of pensioners in the package on fuel  poverty. The arrangements for making payments are to be announced later today;  will the Minister assure Members that payment to those in greatest need will be  expedited as much as possible? Go raibh maith agat.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: It is important that the extra money that I  announced for people on income support and poorer pensioners gets into their  hands and pockets as quickly as possible. The First Minister and deputy First  Minister will announce the details of the required legislation. I hope that  most Members will agree that payment should be expedited, through an urgent  procedure if necessary, to ensure that the power is activated as soon as  possible. I agree with the honourable Member on that point.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education (Mr Storey)</strong>: I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s  statement, particularly the announcement of an additional &pound;4 million for school  maintenance and a further &pound;2&middot;6 million to fund back pay and increased pay for  part-time youth workers. I should also place on record the appreciation of the  Education Committee that school building projects have been taken out of the  framework and will now proceed, because that issue has been raised, and it  causes grave concern.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The recent history is one of significant underspend, and,  if press reports over the weekend are to be believed, the Minister spends more  time in his Department than the Minister of Education does in hers. Taking that  into account, will the Minister assure the House that he is confident that  sufficiently robust systems are now in place to secure the annual capital spends  in all Departments, particularly the Department of Education?</p>
          <p class="TimePeriod">1.15 pm</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I thank the Member for his question and for his  references to the moneys for education. I emphasised the need to deliver, and  that is a matter for every Department. The Member highlighted the history of  the Department of Education, and my officials, officials from the Department of  Education, and other officials, are aware of the need to deliver on the  expenditure committed. The Department will continue to monitor that. The  Department of Education has major projects under way that run into double  figures in Newry, Omagh and Ballynahinch. The Belfast Education and Library  Board has a programme of &pound;120 million under construction at five locations in  north and east Belfast.  The South Eastern Education and Library Board has four new schools at  Towerview, Ballinderry, Brookfield and Pond Park,  and there are several other issues.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Member referred to the fact that the Department of  Education was one of those Departments caught up in legal challenges to the  frameworks as the result of the action taken to move those forward on a  project-by-project procurement basis, which means that a substantial amount of  work will go to the marketplace this financial year.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. As regards the contributions from  the SDLP Benches about cuts to services for the most poor and vulnerable in our  society, Sinn F&eacute;in will not support such cuts, which is why it supported the  statement at the Executive meeting &mdash; as did the SDLP. The Minister&rsquo;s statement  referred to contributing to the most vulnerable in our society.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the fact that contributions have been made to the  education budget for construction and youth leaders and that the framework  around school building has been unlocked. Has a bid been made to help classroom  assistants in the voluntary schools sector? If such a bid has been made &mdash; and  it appears to have been unsuccessful &mdash; will the Minister return to it in future?  Classroom assistants in that sector are being paid at a lesser rate than those  working in fully grant-aided schools.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: The Member asked whether a bid had been made for  classroom assistants. I remind him that the education budget as a whole amounts  to about &pound;1,800 million and, therefore, the amount of money talked about is relatively  small. I would be surprised if the Department of Education were not able to  deal with that issue, especially in light of the easements that have been allocated  to youth workers and other areas of expenditure. The Member is aware that there  will be further monitoring rounds.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">As my statement made clear, there will be help for the  education sector and for many other sectors. The fact that my statement  received the unanimous support of all Ministers in the Executive this morning  seems to run counter to some of the comments made in the Chamber. Nevertheless,  that does not surprise me. However, as we are tackling major issues and  introducing positive proposals, it ill behoves any party with a representative  in the Executive to try to distort the position, as that is not only untrue but  deeply damaging to its Minister&rsquo;s Department.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I want to make the Minister aware of the fact that St Nicholas was the patron  saint of fishermen and sailors. Perhaps the Minister is missing only a red coat  and a white beard today.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  Do you mean a black beard?</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  No &mdash; a white beard.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister has made &pound;700,000 available to the fishing  industry, and he referred to harbour and light dues. Will the Minister confirm  how much money that will mean to each of the fishing boats in the fleet? The  Minister also referred to &pound;1&middot;6 million for children&rsquo;s funds, which is  important. Will the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety have  to say whether those funds go to Home-Start, Live Start, Sure Start, or Mid  Start &mdash; any of those organisations that do great work with children&rsquo;s groups  across the Province?</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">How will today&rsquo;s announcement on construction projects  impact on small businesses? It is good to hear that jobs will be created for  the delivery of big projects, but will the jobs and benefits filter down to the  small construction businesses, of which Strangford, in particular, has a great  many?</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: The allocation for fishermen and the fishing  industry recognises the significant increases in input costs faced by those in  that industry. I am happy to write to the Member with details on the specific  issues that he raised; I do not want to bandy figures around on averages per boat,  and so on. No doubt other Members will be interested in that information, too.  I am sure that today&rsquo;s announcement will be welcomed by fishermen and the  industry in general.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The children&rsquo;s fund is a matter for the Department of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety in conjunction with the Office of the  First Minister and deputy First Minister. Again, those details will emerge; it  is a matter for prioritisation by the Department.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I mentioned in my statement the need to ensure that, as far  as possible, small businesses in Northern Ireland are able to get  involved in the supply and delivery of major construction projects. We must  remember that, in national and European terms, most of the companies here are  small or medium-sized enterprises. Not only did we introduce initiatives on  rates to help businesses, but initiatives were introduced in other areas, too.  Those involve procurement, the new e-sourcing, which will provide greater  visibility, and the new procurement task force, which will help smaller companies  to gain access to major projects. Those are initiatives that we want to discuss  further and develop as much as possible.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I welcome the announcement on fuel credits. I would be most interested to know  which Department will have responsibility for that particular budget and which  Department has the infrastructure and databases to administer the scheme. I  would like a specific response to that question.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I have a deep sense of unease and foreboding about the  whole budgetary process. It appears that, despite the best intentions of all  present, we have not got to the bottom of the issue. The Minister has put on  record that there will be no cuts in any Department. However, the Department of  Education submitted inescapable bids totalling &pound;33 million, but received only  &pound;6 million. That money will have to be found elsewhere. The Department also  highlighted the problem of capital receipts, and it said that not being given  such receipts would lead to the slowing down, or stopping, of projects. Thus, it  appears that there will be cuts. The most worrying aspect is that the Minister  of Education has, I think, indicated that she is no longer dealing with the  education and skills authority as an invest-to-save project, and that she will  not be able to meet her efficiency targets for this year.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Can the Minister tell us how he intends to allocate the  &pound;900 million that he received? Perhaps it would have been better to have a  complete and fundamental review of the Budget process, because we will have to  allow for some serious revisions in the years to come.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I am tempted to say that it is very hard to take  lessons in budgeting and keeping tabs on the books from the honourable Member,  given what he has been through in recent times. However, the fact remains that  no cuts have been announced in this statement. It is a complete fallacy and  nonsense to suggest otherwise.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I note that the Member welcomed the announcement on fuel  credits. I know and understand that some Members are scraping around to try to  find something negative to say. I understand that entirely, but the fact that  they have such a paucity of evidence to back up their argument illustrates how  out of touch they are with the facts that have been presented today.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Most people in Northern Ireland recognise that we  are in a very difficult economic situation. That is true not just for Northern  Ireland, but for the entire United Kingdom, every member state of the European  Union and the United States &mdash; for goodness&rsquo; sake, look at what the United  States is going through at present. By introducing the December monitoring  round, by bringing into play as many levers as possible, and through the  expenditure that has been made available &mdash; which can be made available only  through the surrender of money from other Departments &mdash; we are doing what we  can.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I said that we had limited levers at our disposal and  restricted opportunities to do what we can. However, it would have been a  failing on the part of the Executive and the Assembly if, having considered  what we can do for business and households, we had not convened a special  sitting today.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The fact that we have been able to announce substantive and  important initiatives today should &mdash; and will &mdash; be welcomed widely across the  community.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P J Bradley</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his statement. I note the further &pound;1&middot;5 million that  has been announced to help with animal health compensation payments. Does the  Minister agree that that annual allocation for compensation payments is  necessary due to the lack of a proper eradication programme? I accept that the  Minister had to allocate the extra money because of the rising price of  animals, but does he accept that a proper eradication scheme would probably  eliminate the need for compensation payments?</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I take it that potato growers who lost heavily in the  August flooding will not receive the necessary &pound;1,500 for each acre to match  their losses. Should livestock owners and cereal growers no longer expect 100%  compensation to match the losses that resulted from the flooding?</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I can respond only to the bids that I receive, and  on that basis, we have allocated money for compensation for losses due to  flooding.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Animal health is an important area, because spending money  on the prevention of disease means that less has to be spent to deal with  future outbreaks. The Member stated correctly that some of the extra  expenditure is inescapable because of the rising cost of animals. The  eradication programme is a matter that the Member has pursued with the Minister  of Agriculture and Rural Development, and I have no doubt that he will continue  to do so.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  I also welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement. Everyone in Northern Ireland will welcome the  announcement of the largest-ever investment in a single year.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister has decided to bring forward construction  projects in the education sector through the building of schools. Will he  ensure that all Departments bring forward construction projects as a matter of  urgency? I am sure that the Minister and Members are aware that the  construction industry is being crippled.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I am sure that the Minister will agree that Minister Paul  Goggins&rsquo;s recent decision to award the design contract for the new college at  Cookstown will also benefit the local economy.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: The new college at Cookstown is an important project  for the construction industry. It should also be noted that the Executive  decided a few weeks ago to proceed with the Titanic signature project, which is  a major scheme that will cost &pound;90 million, as well as the rapid-transit system  for Belfast.  Those are major construction projects that will not only deliver  infrastructural benefit to Northern Ireland for decades to come, but will  ensure that there is help for the construction industry. The Member also  highlighted the crucial issue of delivery &mdash; it is all very well to have the  plans in place, but it is essential that Departments deliver with their  allocated budgets for capital spend.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">In addition to the matters that I mentioned already, it is  important to put on record that the Minister for Employment and Learning  intends to implement two additional innovation projects for transport and  cancer medicinal chemistry next year. Those projects will cost &pound;2&middot;7 million and  will be conducted by Queen&rsquo;s University Belfast. Although no additional funding  is available for those projects at present, the Minister is proceeding with  them, and he is welcome to submit bids for them in future monitoring rounds.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">It is important to emphasise that no Minister is successful  in all, or, in some cases, part of the bids that he or she submits. The purpose  of monitoring rounds is to keep the situation under review from quarter to  quarter.</p>
          <p class="TimePeriod">1.30 pm</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his  statement. In particular, I welcome his comments about local banks passing on  the lower cost of borrowing to households and businesses and that the  repossession of people&rsquo;s homes should be a last resort.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">It is hoped that credit unions may soon be able to offer  enhanced financial services, including the depositing of child trust funds.  Will the Minister consider establishing, in the near future, a special fund  such as the one already operating in Britain to help the growth and  development of credit unions?</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I thank the Member for her question. There are  issues to be explored with the banks, and we will continue to explore those  issues. Like the Member, I welcome the courts&rsquo; initiative regarding the  protocols on house repossessions which has been taken forward during a  difficult time and with householders under pressure. It is important that the  repossession of someone&rsquo;s home be regarded as the last resort.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I note the Member&rsquo;s point on credit unions. Such matters  are the responsibility of the Minister of Enterprise,  Trade and Investment rather than for me, and I will ensure that the matter is  drawn to the Minister&rsquo;s attention, and I am sure that she will want to examine  it carefully.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his statement. On behalf of the opposition, I join my  colleague Stephen Farry in welcoming parts of it. It is regrettable that the  statement is being made later than we hoped for. Certain aspects of it, such as  the 10-day period for the payment of invoices to small businesses, are welcome.  However, that was announced by Lord Mandelson in early October. To compensate  for that, will the Minister assure us, at least, that when he says that he has  asked public-sector organisations, he uses the word &ldquo;asked&rdquo; in the same sense  as the Treasury does when it asks Departments to do things, and that he will  ensure that that happens?</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">As regards fuel poverty, although the one-off payment to 100,000  households in poverty is clearly welcome, would it not have been better to have  put some of that money into a major expansion of the warm homes scheme? Would  that not have had environmental benefits as well as benefits to small firms  that need business at the moment? Would it also have ensured that people were  protected against exorbitant charges in future?</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: The Member made several points. First, my statement  is not late; it is early. Normally, the statement on the December monitoring  round is made after Christmas, in January. It was our view that we should make  this statement on 15 December, despite the fact that it was resisted by some on  the Ulster Unionist Benches. There was a bit of an outcry that we should not  have had a special meeting of the Assembly today. I am glad that the Assembly  has met and that we are able to make these announcements today. However, I  notice that one or two of those were most vocal about today&rsquo;s meeting are  absent from the Chamber.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, Lord Mandelson&rsquo;s announcement about payment of  invoices was confined to England  and Wales.  This is for Northern Ireland,  and it is something with which we have been keen to proceed. I assure the  Member that it is my hope that edicts and statements from the Department of  Finance and Personnel will be regarded in the same way in Northern Ireland as edicts and statements from  the Treasury are regarded in England  and Wales.  I hope that other Departments are listening to what Lord Mandelson and I are  saying about that matter, and will agree with it.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Thirdly, the Member raised an interesting point about fuel  poverty. He asked whether it would be better to spend the money as a one-off  fuel credit or to put it into the warm homes scheme. Shortly, no doubt, we will  be criticised and be asked why there is no money for the warm homes scheme. The  Member will have to take that matter up with the Department for Social  Development because the scheme was not identified as a priority when the  Minister expressed her views about how the money should be spent. The choice  was there.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">We ended up in the worst of all worlds, because not only  was there no more money going into the warm homes scheme, but there was not  enough going into the fuel credit scheme to make it the proper scheme that was  desired. Consequently, we took steps to increase the impact of that scheme by  giving money to pensioners that are poorest in Northern Ireland and ensuring that  they will be sufficiently covered, and not just by the DSD scheme.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  I, too, welcome that scheme. Most of the SDLP foxes must have been shot this  morning, because they are distinctly quiet. Despite the fact that that party  tried to turn this into a negative morning, it is a positive one, which the  SDLP should recognise by standing up and so saying. It is a pity that the SDLP  Minister is not here. However, I suspect that she has another duty to perform.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I particularly welcome the fact that two major water-infrastructure  schemes, amounting to &pound;26 million, are to go ahead at Dungannon and Moygashel.  Those are welcome and long overdue. In the Minister&rsquo;s statement, he welcomed  NIE&rsquo;s announcement today that it will decrease its tariff by 10&middot;8%. It is good  news that prices are going in the right direction. However, I am sure that the  Minister agrees that those price reductions must go further. We will watch  developments with interest. We urge the Minister and the Executive to keep a  very close eye on that matter.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, I am pleased that, rather than doing what  others have decided to do, the Minister of Finance and Personnel has stepped in  to take the lead on the issue of fuel poverty. Fast-track payments will provide  some relief to pensioners in Northern    Ireland. Does the Minister agree that the  rolling-out of the scheme is imperative? Does he also agree that that should be  done effectively, efficiently and quickly?</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Many struggling pensioners will take considerable comfort  from the measures that the Minister outlined in his statement. I ask the  Minister again to give an assurance that fast-track payments will be expedited  as quickly as possible. It is a fact that the Executive will make a payment of  &pound;150 to more than 100,000 householders who are in receipt of income support and  pension credit &mdash; 65,000 and 36,000 respectively. That is to be welcomed. I  commend the Minister for his positive attitude. If others had adopted the same  attitude earlier in the year, that measure could have been implemented before  Christmas.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I thank the Member for his contribution. He  mentioned the water projects at Dungannon and Moygashel. Four major Northern  Ireland Water projects, with an aggregated value of &pound;44&middot;5 million, will come to  market between now and the end of financial year. Those projects are welcome for  the construction industry and for building the foundations of a sound  infrastructure for Northern    Ireland. In the Member&rsquo;s constituency, the  Castor Bay to Dungannon trunk main is worth some &pound;21 million, and the Moygashel  waste-water treatment plant is worth &pound;5&middot;5 million. For Members who represent North Antrim, there are two water projects of note: one  at Bushmills, which is worth &pound;8&middot;2 million; and one at Toome, which is worth  &pound;9&middot;8 million</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Member, among others, emphasised the need for speed on  the issue of fuel credits. They said that the matter must be progressed  quickly. I know that my colleagues in the Office of the First Minister and  deputy First Minister have been apprised of that and will be announcing details  of how we are to proceed. I am sure that the Member&rsquo;s words will echo around  the House, and among other Members, and will build the case for the Bill&rsquo;s  accelerated passage to ensure that that is done as quickly as possible, so that  the money goes to pensioners and those on income support.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I call Mr Billy Armstrong. I ask that the Member be brief when asking his  question, because time is almost up.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Armstrong</strong>:  I welcome the news that the planned construction of schools will continue. I  also welcome the proposed investment that will benefit mid-Ulster. In the light  of the Minister of Education&rsquo;s flawed decision to close the soundly constructed  Maghera High   School, can Minister Dodds assure me that money will be  prioritised for the construction of a newbuild high school at Magherafelt,  which is also supposed to accommodate the pupils from Maghera High School?  If the Minister cannot provide that assurance, will he join with me in calling  on the Minister of Education to keep Maghera  High School open, at least until Magherafelt High School is rebuilt.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I can briefly say, Mr Speaker, that, as far as I am  concerned, I am very hopeful that the Magherafelt school project will proceed  in the near future. I am grateful for the Member&rsquo;s supportive comments.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  That ends questions to the Minister on his statement.<strong><span style="text-transform:uppercase; font-size:12.0pt; "> </span></strong></p>
          <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="4"></a>Executive Committee Business</p>
          <p class="H4StageHeading">Impact of the Global Economic Downturn</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to three hours for the debate.  The proposer of the motion will have 20 minutes in which to propose and 20  minutes in which to make a winding-up speech. Chairpersons of Statutory  Committees will have up to eight minutes in which to speak, and all other  Members who wish to speak will have five minutes.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister (Mr P Robinson)</strong>: I beg to move</p>
          <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly takes note of the measures taken by the  Executive to strengthen the local economy and support those most vulnerable in  society against the impact of the global economic downturn.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Today, our twin priorities are to get the economy moving  and to alleviate the hardship that many people are facing. Just as hard-working  families and businesses must prioritise, so, too, do Government. It is our job  to ensure that we make the right choices. In the present economic crisis, we  must chart a course through the economic difficulties and be conscious of the  limited levers that are at our disposal. We will do so, building on the solid  foundations that we have laid since May 2007.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The world economic problems were not created here, but we  must do all that we can to alleviate them and to position ourselves for  recovery. The deputy First Minister and I are pleased to present the  consolidated package of measures that has been identified by the Executive to  address the adverse impact of the current economic slowdown. Earlier today, the  Finance Minister announced allocations that are focused on providing support to  the local economy. That funding can help to address our key priorities. The  complexity and the evolving nature of the economic challenges mean that it is  not possible to deliver a one-shop solution to the whole problem, but I believe  that the steps that we have taken can make a real difference.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The events of recent months have vindicated the decision,  which is set out in the Programme for Government, to make the economy our  highest priority. Having our eye firmly fixed on the economy has aided us  during the storm. Many of the programmes that we have already put in place are  addressing problems that arise from the current crisis. We must now alleviate short-term  hardship, refocus on and deliver the priorities and provide an added stimulus  where it is most needed.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The current crisis poses a twin threat, and we must deal  with both. One threat is to the social welfare, health and well-being of  people, particularly the most disadvantaged. The other threat is to our  economic prosperity, which is represented by our business, commercial and  industrial interests. The Executive recognise both dimensions of the crisis,  and have identified a package that provides support to local business and to  local people.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">In recent months, Ministers listened to the concerns of  stakeholders across all sectors of the economy. From that engagement, and from  discussions at the Executive table, we concluded that the core problems  associated with the credit crunch can be best addressed by focusing action  around five themes: energy and fuel poverty; dealing with debt; support for the  housing market and construction industry; support for household budgets and  mitigating the threat of unemployment; and support for business. I shall deal  with each theme in turn.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive&rsquo;s goal is for essential energy to be made  affordable to people and businesses. In the past year, local gas and  electricity tariffs have risen by about 50%, which places significant pressure  on business and household budgets. The energy regulator has announced that  prices will be adjusted downwards, and I welcome his announcement. However, the  fact that oil prices have fallen back to their lowest level in many years would  lead most people to expect that some further relief in energy costs should  continue to feed through to the local economy. We will continue our engagement  with the regulator and the energy companies.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Fuel poverty is not a product of the credit crunch; we have  been addressing the problem for some time. For example, this year, we have  already allocated &pound;21 million to tackle fuel poverty through the warm homes  scheme, which aims to improve energy efficiency and to reduce energy  consumption in eligible households. The scheme has improved the lives of 60,000  people.</p>
          <p class="TimePeriod">1.45 pm</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">To build on that, we want to explore further the options  for introducing social tariffs for energy supplies. The Department of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment (DETI) is working with the regulator&rsquo;s office  to establish what scope exists for regulatory action to make tariff changes for  those in fuel poverty. An initial report is expected early next year.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">We also want to consider further the options for brokering  energy supplies. The Housing Executive is currently investigating the potential  for acting as a broker to procure discounted energy for its tenants, and we  look forward to the outcome of that process.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Even over the relatively short life of the Administration,  we have learned that we need to be prepared for the unexpected. Devolution  means not only being able to address people&rsquo;s needs, but being able to do it  quickly. As the Administration of a small region, we need to be able to react  quickly.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">We have faced many and varied crises: flooding, bluetongue  and the meltdown of the world economy. The lesson is that we need to be  prepared, financially and legislatively, so that we can act promptly to protect  local interests. We need resilience and flexibility in and across all the  portfolios that make up the Executive. Therefore, I announce today that the  Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister (OFMDFM) proposes to  introduce a Bill to provide for permissive powers to implement remedial action  in response to any circumstance that the Executive agree warrants rapid and  effective action.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">That power is intended to regularise the allocation and  distribution of funds in response to any crisis or hardship situation. It will  extend the Executive&rsquo;s powers to deal effectively with poverty and  disadvantage. However, they may determine that the delivery of the relief or  programme would be better channelled through, or implemented by, another agency  or Government Department. To keep the legislation effective, the Executive will  not prescribe &mdash; except in generic terms &mdash; the nature of the exceptional needs  or crises. I hope that that legislation will be in place before the end of  January. It will be used to authorise &pound;15 million for fuel poverty, which will  provide for payments to some of those most in need.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The second of the five themes that I listed was debt. In  difficult circumstances, the incidence of debt will escalate. Beyond the  provision of &pound;4&middot;5 billion in social welfare services, the Executive will  continue to support a range of debt advisory services. DETI has in place a  three-year, &pound;1&middot;2 million contract with Citizens Advice to continue to provide  free, effective, high-quality debt advice at centres across Northern Ireland,  with a particular emphasis on one-to-one debt advice in areas where consumers  have limited access to that type of help or assistance. In the two years to 31  March 2008, the service handled some &pound;30 million of consumer debt and attracted  more than 2,000 new clients. It handled inquiries involving a total of &pound;5&middot;5  million of consumer debt during the quarter ending September 2008, and dealt  with 518 new cases in the same period, signalling a major upward trend in  demand.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive have already responded in that area. DETI  announced that funding will increase to &pound;1 million per annum over the next two  years, expanding the current service and funding a new telephone-based debt  advice service. In difficult economic times, the most needy in the community  can often resort to desperate measures to make ends meet. In conversations with  voluntary and community groups, there is evidence of an increase in illegal  money lending, which causes great concern. Such practices attract exorbitant  interest rates, which result in those least able to pay paying most. DETI&rsquo;s  Trading Standards Service has launched a campaign that seeks to tackle loan  sharking. Early in the new year, DETI will propose an initiative on the  enforcement of consumer credit legislation. That will specifically target the  issues of instalment credit, doorstep selling and illegal money lending, while  actively promoting the benefits of responsible borrowing.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The increase in loan sharking is worrying and  disappointing: it is worrying because of the dark and sinister nature of the  activity, and disappointing because there is already a viable and commendable  alternative. We are most fortunate in having to hand a network of credit unions  with which we are keen to engage. We shall explore further how we might work  with them to enhance and support the network and promote responsible borrowing  at a local level.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The third set of issues relates to the housing and  construction sector. The roots of the present economic turmoil lie in the  transaction streams of toxic loans made in the US sub-prime housing market. The  knock-on effect of that has slowed down our economy and dented the confidence  of developers, homeowners and first-time buyers, inevitably having a serious  impact on the local construction industry.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive have already taken a number of steps to deal  with that issue. For example, this year, the capital expenditure of the  Executive is at its highest level in history. That has provided a stimulus to  the economy while leaving a positive long-term legacy. Around &pound;1&middot;3 billion  worth of major public-sector schemes are currently under construction, and,  following the pre-Budget report, we have accelerated an additional &pound;9&middot;4 million  into the present year. Moreover, in addition to our &pound;150 million social-housing  programme, in 2008 the Executive have introduced a number of innovative  programmes to help people get homes.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">In order to further assist the construction industry, the  Executive recently announced our intention to press ahead with proposals for  the Titanic signature project. Work on that project will begin next month, with  600 jobs being created during construction alone.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The House will also be aware of the need to accelerate  planning approvals. When I was Finance Minister, I set up the performance and  efficiency delivery unit, and set as its first task an examination of the  Planning Service and the identification of measures to speed up planning  decisions. I am delighted that progress is being made, and I welcome the  statement by the Finance Minister that he and the Environment Minister will be  implementing proposals in that area. It will make a real difference to the  construction sector and, in the longer term, will significantly assist economic  growth.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The outcome of the December monitoring round will offer a  further boost to the construction sector, with allocations being made to: the  farm nutrients management scheme; school maintenance; roads structural  maintenance; public-transport capital works; and the public-sector housing  programme. The Executive have also asked Ed Vernon to update the capital  realisation task force&rsquo;s report in light of the seismic changes in the economic  climate since that task force reported to Ministers last December. He is to  explore the potential for the task force to be resourced to support Departments  on all major asset-realisation opportunities.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Fourthly, we must address the problems currently facing  households. From the first days of the present Administration, we have provided  practical support for local people. This year&rsquo;s domestic regional rate has been  frozen, and that freeze will be maintained for the next two years, thus saving  households and businesses &pound;27 million this year. Early-payment discount schemes  and lower-income rates relief have saved households a further &pound;7 million, and the  transitional rates relief scheme has seen &pound;20 million provided to households  over the last two years.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive have also announced that water charges for  the domestic sector will be deferred for yet another year. That deferral is  worth an average of &pound;160 per household. The cost of a prescription in Northern Ireland  will be reduced to &pound;3 next January, and prescriptions will be free of charge by  April 2010. That will cost the Northern Ireland Executive &pound;13 million per annum  when charges are fully abolished.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive have also announced the extension of the free  bus pass scheme. Since 2007 some 240,000 people aged 65 and over have taken  advantage of free bus and rail services. A further 90,000 individuals aged 60  to 64 will be entitled to free travel in Northern Ireland under the new scheme.  That extension will cost a further &pound;4 million per annum.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">In addition to the actions which the Executive have taken  and the fact that interest rates are at their lowest levels since 1951, the  pre-Budget report also announced measures that should relieve some of the  financial pressures on household budgets. Those measures include the 2&middot;5%  reduction in VAT, the increase in personal income tax allowances, and the  introduction of increases in pensions credits, child benefits and child tax  credits.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Although some of us would have preferred a larger cut in  VAT in more focused areas, nonetheless, the reduction should be worth around  &pound;190 million to households in Northern    Ireland. We are also looking at ways of  increasing the uptake of social security benefits and providing better  information to consumers about the fair price of commodities across Northern Ireland.  We expect announcements to be made on those areas very soon.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The fifth issue that we must address is the needs of  business. In order to deal with the present difficult situation, DETI has  announced the accelerated support service &mdash; with a budget of &pound;5 million &mdash; to  assist Invest NI clients by providing advice in the form of on-site support.  That will identify projects in areas such as financial and cash-flow management  and improving supply chains, all of which should assist cash flow in  locally-owned small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">We have also announced our intention to enhance support to  apprenticeship training. The Department for Employment and Learning is working  to promote apprenticeships through the Alliance of Sector Skills Councils. The  Steps to Work scheme will enable the completion of apprenticeships even where  an employer is not available. That is a mark of our confidence that the Northern Ireland  economy will weather this economic storm and, in coming out the other side, we  will want to ensure that we have all the skills needed to sustain a vibrant  economy.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">We have also announced increased funding of &pound;14&middot;5 million  to fund strategic investment to allow our two universities to build additional  and sustainable research capacity and capability. Additionally, to help  business with cash-flow management, the Government&rsquo;s main payments processing  facility, Account NI, has amended its operating system to facilitate faster  payments and will endeavour to ensure that invoices submitted through the  shared services centre are paid within 10 days.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">During my time as Finance Minister, I capped manufacturing  rates at 30% and froze the non-domestic regional rate, in real terms, for the  rest of the comprehensive spending review period. I am pleased that the  Executive have agreed to go further, with the Finance Minister&rsquo;s announcement  today of a new and targeted small business rates-relief scheme and a freeze in  cash terms of the non-domestic regional rate for a further year, by which time  I hope that the legislation necessary to proceed with the small business rates-relief  scheme will be sufficiently advanced.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Most commentators agree that the roots of the current  economic crisis lie in difficulties within the banking industry. The deputy  First Minister and I have already met with representatives of the local banking  sector and we intend to meet with them again tomorrow to ensure that all sides  in our economy are aligned to fully support each other in the best way  possible. In particular, we want to be able to advise the Prime Minister  whether any steps need to be taken to ensure that interest rate reductions are  passed on by our four main banks to their customers.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The deputy First Minister and I have agreed to establish a  cross-sector advisory forum to continue our dialogue with business, trade  unions and voluntary and community stakeholders. One of the benefits of devolution  for our community must be access to decision taking. We believe that that  ongoing engagement will be of mutual advantage as we move forward. The  Executive are committed to putting their full weight into supporting people and  businesses through the current economic turmoil.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Over the past months, we have listened to the community,  met with a range of stakeholders and learned from best practice elsewhere. It  is too easy to forget what life was like under direct rule. If those who would  advocate the end of devolution got their way, householders in Northern Ireland  would have less money in their pockets, businesses would be paying more in  charges, and our economy would have been in a measurably much worse state.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Our role is in delivering for the people of Northern Ireland,  and even in the most difficult of circumstances, I believe that we are making a  real and positive contribution. The measures outlined should provide a solid  foundation on which to build recovery and future prosperity. They are the  clearest possible example that devolution is making a difference to the people  of Northern Ireland,  and I commend them to the Assembly.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order, Members. Before I call Mr Kennedy as Chairperson of the Committee for  the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister, there are a number  of Members who are Chairpersons of Committees who wish to speak as Chairpersons  of those Committees this morning. There is nothing wrong with that, but they  may also want to make a personal statement while they are on their feet.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">They may even want to make a political statement while they  are on their feet. I say to all sides of the House that it is vitally important  that Members clearly indicate the capacity in which they are speaking when they  are addressing the House.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Chairpersons of a number of Committees are looking for  lecterns from which to speak; unfortunately, all the lecterns that we have are  being used. There is nothing wrong with the Chairperson of a Committee speaking  from a lectern; however, today we are out of lecterns.</p>
          <p class="TimePeriod">2.00 pm</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName">The Chairperson of the Committee for the Office of the  First Minister and deputy First Minister (Mr <strong>Kennedy)</strong>: As Chairperson of the Committee for the Office of the  First Minister and deputy First Minister, I am pleased to speak in this  important debate, which provides a welcome opportunity to take note of the  measures the Executive have taken to strengthen the local economy and support  those most vulnerable in society against the impact of the downturn in economic  conditions. Although I do not have a lectern, I am happy to offer my comments.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The statement from the Minister of Finance and Personnel  reminded me of the Perry Como hit that is currently doing the rounds: &lsquo;It&rsquo;s  Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas&rsquo;.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>A Member</strong>:  Are you going to sing it?</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  No singing allowed.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The impact of the global economic downturn is being felt  across many sectors. Recently, my Committee heard evidence from representatives  of the construction industry, and the construction and property group, on the  impact of the global recession on that sector. Those groups underlined the  seriousness of the current situation and emphasised the need for intervention  in order to save jobs and make provision for future apprenticeships. Therefore,  I welcome today&rsquo;s announcement that public-sector construction schemes worth  &pound;1&middot;2 billion are currently on site and that a construction industry forum will  be established to ensure that the pace of construction jobs continues in these  difficult times.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee&rsquo;s engagement with the Department and the  strategic investment board has focused on what actions can be taken in the  short term to kick-start the economy. The Committee wrote to all Departments  urging them to do whatever possible to regenerate and create jobs.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee underlined the importance of ensuring that  invoices were not subject to long delays in payments being processed. I welcome  the announcement that the public sector has changed its target for paying  approved invoices from 30 days to 10 days. That should improve cash flow in the  organisations that provide services and supply Government Departments.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">There is no doubt that the freezing of domestic rates will  be a welcome announcement for all households in Northern Ireland. The lone  pensioner allowance introduced in April 2008 helps the over-70s through a 20%  reduction in their rates bills. That is particularly welcome for those old  people in the community who sometimes have to make the very difficult choice  between having heat and having food.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The decision to scrap prescription charges will make a  financial difference to those people most in need. On a personal note, I want  to congratulate my party colleague Minister Michael McGimpsey for bringing that  forward; it was, after all, an Ulster Unionist Party manifesto commitment.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive&rsquo;s decision to support Titanic Quarter  Limited&rsquo;s proposal for a Titanic signature project in Belfast has the potential to deliver a much  needed boost to the local economy at a time when the construction sector is under  significant pressure. It has the potential to be a premier tourist destination  that, undoubtedly, will generate international interest. Hopefully, it will  provide a tourist attraction of world-class excellence in Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive&rsquo;s decision to approve new planning guidelines  is also good news for the construction industry. That will, hopefully, protect  the rural environment and provide another boost for the building trade.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that the First Minister and deputy First Minister  took the opportunity during their recent trip to the US  to speak again to powerful and influential business people in order to promote Northern Ireland  and all that it has to offer. Members look forward to hearing in the new year  about the progress that was made on that trip.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive are committed in the Programme for Government  to eliminating child poverty &mdash; a goal that will prove a test to achieve in very  difficult economic circumstances. The Committee for the Office of the First  Minister and deputy First Minister has received the Executive&rsquo;s response to its  report on child poverty. In the coming months, it will measure progress; in  particular, on recommendations made in that report.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The First Minister mentioned proposals to bring forward  legislation for a rapid response capacity, presumably by accelerated passage.  The Committee will want to see the detail of that, but I hope that it will seek  to co-operate with the Department on such an important piece of legislation, in  order to enable the Executive to respond to events quickly. I welcome that  OFMDFM will meet energy companies and, in particular, will meet again with the  banks. It is crucial that interest-rate reductions are passed on immediately to  customers.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Mindful of the Speaker&rsquo;s cautionary remarks, I will make a  few comments on behalf of myself and my party. The First Minister spoke of the  threats in economic terms. Many Members believe that potential political  threats to these institutions remain, and they hope to have moved away from  blocked Executive meetings. An unfortunate and regrettable amount of time was  lost in that period, and I hope that such actions are not repeated by Sinn  F&eacute;in.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">There is a crying need for joined-up government in Northern Ireland.  It is essential that the Executive and all the parties that serve in it  function in a properly joined-up manner. I very much hope that the two largest  parties recognise and remember that. It is in the interests of all the people  of Northern Ireland  who elected us that we all work together in face of the considerable economic  challenges before us. On that basis, I commend the motion.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Social Development (Mr Simpson)</strong>: I will comment on  behalf of the Committee on the measures set out by the First Minister. Members  are aware, as has already been said, that the whole world faces the most  significant sustained economic threat in recent history. Governments in various  countries and other jurisdictions have adopted a range of approaches. In other  places, some respected politicians appear to have set aside their lifelong  devotion to certain economic deals in the hope of insulating their economies  for the worst period of the expected recession.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Others appear to cling steadfastly to principles of  economic management that they hope will leave their economies in good enough  shape to recover quickly, once the recession finally ends. Against that  backdrop, the options faced by the Executive are not easy. The choices are more  important and far-reaching than, perhaps, any that the Executive have made to  date.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">As Chairman of the Social Development Committee, I want to  comment on a few of the measures that have been announced. Recently, the  Committee was briefed on the impact of fuel poverty on numerous groups, such as  children, the elderly and people who suffer from serious illness.  Notwithstanding the welcome announcement that has been made on gas and  electricity prices, fuel poverty still presents a significant challenge. The  Committee welcomes the effort to deal with that challenge through the  introduction of a &pound;150 payment to 100,000 households that are in receipt of  pension credit and income support. I am sure that everyone welcomes that  payment.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">That said, however, everyone will recognise that more  targeted instruments might also be necessary if the Department&rsquo;s objective of  eliminating fuel poverty is to be achieved. The warm homes scheme is one of  those targeted instruments. The Committee welcomes continuing support for the  scheme, although it awaits with interest the revision of that important scheme,  which, it is hoped, will lead to better targeting of resources towards the fuel  poor.</p>
          <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Molloy] in the Chair)</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">As members are aware, the new housing agenda targets the  provision of over 5,000 new social homes during the next three years. That  target is an important part of the strategy to deal with the 38,000 people who  are on the housing waiting list, 20,000 people who are in housing stress, and  9,000 people who are officially homeless. The building or purchase of 5,000 new  homes will, of course, not solve all of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s housing  problems. However, it will be a substantial and important first step.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">When the new housing agenda was launched, the world was a  different place. The construction industry was booming. Construction employment  was high; so, too, were house prices. Now, the construction industry is  contracting rapidly. The housing market is almost in freefall, as housing  starts and sales trickle away to almost nothing. Yet, homelessness and housing  waiting lists, for example, do not change.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Social Development Committee welcomes the indication in  the First Minister&rsquo;s statement that measures including the purchase of  off-the-shelf housing, the provision of a mortgage-rescue scheme, and the  phased introduction of developer contributions are to be promoted. It is hoped  that those measures will help to reduce social-housing demand problems and will  also have a welcome effect on Northern    Ireland&rsquo;s beleaguered construction industry.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee also welcomes the emphasis on value for money  that underpins the measures that have been described. Members would be annoyed  &mdash; disgusted, even &mdash; if any additional money for construction partially  disappeared into additional costs, with limited additional housing completions  or reductions in waiting lists.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I assure the House that the Social Development Committee  will, as always, carefully review monitoring rounds and zealously chart the  progress of the Social Development Minister&rsquo;s new housing procurement strategy.  The Committee, therefore, awaits with great interest the outworking of the  Finance Minister&rsquo;s new approach to procurement. We will do our best to  helpfully advise the Minister for Social Development in securing best value for  the housing agenda and the Department&rsquo;s other anti-poverty measures.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The measures that have been announced represent a  significant &mdash;</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I am mindful of the Finance Minister&rsquo;s statement on the December monitoring  round. The Member has referred, rightly, to the housing crisis and to money for  housing. Is he aware &mdash; as he should be, as Chairperson of the Committee for  Social Development &mdash; that the housing programme is now minus &pound;30 million? That  will have a negative, adverse impact on the ability of the Department and the  Housing Executive to maintain houses and to implement improvement schemes.</p>
          <p class="TimePeriod">2.15 pm</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson of the Committee for Social Development</strong>: That point  was raised when the Finance Minister was making his announcement earlier. He  made it clear that an extra &pound;80 million is being given to housing development.  There seems to be a query about whether money for social housing has  disappeared or whether more money has been given to social housing. As the  Chairperson of the Committee for Social Development, I will seek clarity on  that matter and bring a report to the next Committee meeting.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The measures that were announced  today represent a significant investment in Northern Ireland&rsquo;s future. There is  currently no more important job in Northern Ireland than guaranteeing  that future. Therefore, I ask that the Office of the First Minister and deputy  First Minister re-emphasises the critically important role that Committees will  have to play in the review of departmental expenditure and monitoring rounds generally,  and in the delivery of the outcomes associated with the measures that were  announced today.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson of the Committee for Finance and Personnel (Mr  McLaughlin)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I welcome the opportunity to discuss these important  issues. Although the Department of Finance and Personnel has only a limited  direct responsibility for many of the issues that the Assembly is considering  to help alleviate the impact of the economic downturn, its overall strategic  expenditure role will be vitally important. As the Chairperson of the Committee  for Finance and Personnel, I will outline some of the issues that the Committee  is currently scrutinising, which are relevant to today&rsquo;s announcement.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">At a strategic level, the  Committee is of the view that the economic downturn and the emerging pressures  make it all the more vital that maximum impact and value for money is achieved  with the finite resources that are available. That will require the public  sector to improve its performance in the management of resources and programmes  and in achieving business targets. To that end, a number of immediate and  longer-term measures are required.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Given the economic climate, my  Committee believes that it is essential that previous patterns of departmental  underspend are not repeated at the end of the current financial year. My  Committee has applied a focused and consistent scrutiny on Departments&rsquo; underperformance  in financial forecasting and monitoring, which results in late declarations of  large amounts of resources and in high end-year underspend.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The 2007-08 figures for both  in-year reduced requirements and end-year underspend show a huge variance  between Departments&rsquo; financial performances compared to their opening Budget  positions. Some &pound;407 million in resource expenditure and &pound;313 million in  capital expenditure was either reallocated or unspent. That highlights a major  weakness in Departments&rsquo; budgeting systems and in senior officials&rsquo; standards  of financial management.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">In that context, my Committee  recently called for an external review of the current arrangements for the payment  of substantial performance bonuses to the most senior ranks of the Civil  Service and the public sector. I hope that we will get a positive response to  that call. Departments and their respective scrutiny Committees need to make an  immediate and concerted effort to ensure that there is effective forecasting,  monitoring and management of the limited available resources.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Regarding the more immediate  term, my Committee has called on the Department of Finance and Personnel to  take the lead in identifying pre-emptive measures that can be taken in the next  four months to safeguard against significant year-end underpsend. Having said  that, I recognise the strong efforts that the Minister has made to get detailed  information in good time.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">In order to improve resource  management in the longer term, a higher priority should be given to  implementing the recommendations in last year&rsquo;s PKF report on financial  management in the Civil Service. The Committee recognises that Department of  Finance and Personnel (DFP) is working on programmes of mandatory financial  training for senior civil servants and on improving the monthly financial  information that is given to departmental boards.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">More needs to be done, however,  to move from an incremental to an output-based approach to budgeting and  expenditure, as recommended in the PKF report. In these difficult times, that  will ensure that all expenditure is examined, as opposed to the current  situation in which only bids for additional resources are examined. The  Committee has welcomed DFP&rsquo;s commitment to begin such a programme of  examination.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee believes that Departments, including the  Department of Finance and Personnel, need to undertake more management analysis  of expenditure. Although levels of spend are an important measurement of  performance, they should be viewed in the important context of delivery of the  Executive&rsquo;s priorities and the Programme for Government.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The public expects us to deliver the Programme for  Government. The Committee notes the opinion of Department of Finance and  Personnel officials that an information gap exists that must be filled in order  to enable such analysis to be carried out. In its report on the Executive&rsquo;s  draft Budget 2008-11, the Committee highlighted the fact that delays in capital  projects can increase &mdash; directly and indirectly &mdash; overall costs significantly,  and called for steps to be taken to ensure the effective planning and  management of capital projects with a view to minimising delays and the  resulting underspend.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">In the current economic climate, the Committee repeats that  call, especially in light of the construction industry forum&rsquo;s evidence, which  highlighted delays in establishing capital projects and the problems that that  situation poses for the local construction industry. During his earlier  statement, the Minister of Finance and Personnel addressed some key issues that  affect that industry, particularly in areas of planning and procurement. I  welcome that. Those issues can and should be considered as opportunities to  enable the Executive to respond to the difficulties that are affecting the construction  industry.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive have an opportunity to accelerate &pound;86&middot;5  million of capital expenditure into the 2008 and 2009 financial years. That  will effectively bring forward spend that was earmarked for the subsequent  years. Although the Committee welcomes the flexibility that is on offer, given  the extent of previous capital underspend by Departments &mdash; and that is what we  know, as opposed to what we are entitled to expect &mdash; it has urged the Executive  to ensure that any capital funds that are accelerated in that way can, and  will, be spent efficiently in the years to which they are now allocated.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, the Committee is aware of the risk that  sufficient funds might not be available to deliver capital plans in 2010-11,  and we must ensure that that risk is anticipated and managed effectively. The  Executive&rsquo;s Budget for 2008-11 included capital receipts for Departments of  &pound;486 million, &pound;266 million and &pound;612 million respectively over the three  financial years. Department of Finance and Personnel officials recently  informed the Committee that &pound;60 million of receipts that the capital  realisation team was intended to generate will probably not be delivered this  year and that, following the suspension of Workplace 2010, &pound;175 million in  capital receipts that was designated for the Department will not materialise.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Departmental officials stated that the &pound;200 million capital  receipt for the Crossnacreevy lands, which is due in 2010-11, is uncertain and  is, in some people&rsquo;s view, completely unlikely. The Committee recognises that  the downturn in local property markets has adversely affected the level of  planned receipts from the disposal of surplus assets. However, it is important  to establish contingency measures, because the failure to achieve asset-realisation  targets &mdash; especially if additional measures are required to alleviate the  economic downturn &mdash; can have exaggerated effects.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee wrote to the Department of Finance and  Personnel on 14 November to urge it to consider issuing advice to all Departments  to accelerate the process of paying suppliers. We received a welcome  reaffirmation that that will happen. We must address the cash-flow  difficulties.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Local banks must play a vital role, and the Committee  recognises and applauds the efforts of the First Minister and deputy First  Minister, who have met with the local banking representatives. Moreover, I  welcome tomorrow&rsquo;s meeting with the Finance Minister. The Committee has been  trying to coax local banks into engaging directly and urgently on practical  measures that they could take, in the current climate, to assist consumers and  local businesses.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">A revised regional economic strategy should be introduced  to replace the current proposals, because that is a matter of significant  concern.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I regret the fact that so many DUP Members have left their seats.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  The senior Member for North Antrim is still  there.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  Some younger Members could learn lessons from the elder representative on the  Benches opposite.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">In his initial comments, the First Minister spoke of the  benefits of devolution. One wonders, then, why it took the DUP 10 years to  grasp the opportunities presented by devolution under the terms of the Good  Friday Agreement. Some Members mentioned the 154-day delay in the Executive  meeting. I wonder whether any analysis has been conducted by the Minister of  Finance and Personnel or the First Minister and deputy First Minister into what  impact that delay has had on the economic downturn &mdash; bearing in mind that all  other Governments and regional Assemblies have been working assiduously since  the early autumn, when news of the economic downturn started to emerge.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">During the suspension &mdash; or blocking &mdash; of the Executive, the  First Minister said that he had passed some two dozen papers, and would be  forwarding them to the deputy First Minister. We have yet to see any output in  relation to those two dozen papers, because members of the Committee for the  Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister have, as yet, been  unable to scrutinise any strategy to tackle cohesion, sharing and integration &mdash;  in other words, a shared future. Given that there was a substantial report, and  that there are ongoing costs of division, one would have thought that savings  could be made through a shared future. Many groups are dependent on the moneys  that are attached to such a strategy.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">As yet, no anti-poverty strategy has been produced by the  First Minister and deputy First Minister, yet we have heard much talk of their  adoption of Minister Ritchie&rsquo;s innovative means by which to tackle fuel  poverty. I notice that they are all great champions of that this morning. Sinn  F&eacute;in, in particular, is now silent on the point that that initiative will give  money to NIE; it now recognises that that money will go directly to benefit  families that are suffering most from high energy costs.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the First Minister&rsquo;s commitment to meeting with  the banks, and to tackling loan sharks &mdash; something that is a great scourge in  many communities. I wish the First Minister and deputy First Minister all the  best in their efforts. I note that reference was made in the statements to the  deferral of water charges. Again, it is interesting that Sinn F&eacute;in and the DUP  campaigned in the Assembly elections on the basis of no water charges, not  deferral of water charges. I am sure that many people across the North remember  the billboards and posters that were erected, presumably by Sinn F&eacute;in, that  stated that Sinn F&eacute;in says no to water charges &mdash; &ldquo;Stop the water tax&rdquo;, I think,  was what they stated. Those all seem to have disappeared.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Chairperson of the Committee for Finance and Personnel  spoke about the capital realisation task force, and the failure of capital  assets to be realised, with the resulting detrimental impact that that will  have on the Budget. Yet the Minister of Finance and Personnel and the First  Minister referred to the black hole, which they said did not exist, and  castigated other Members for referring to it. At times, they do not like to  face reality.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The programme announced today provides for an additional &pound;4  million for school maintenance, yet there is still a &pound;217 million backlog in  funds for school maintenance. One wonders how that will be fixed. The fact that  no decision has been made on the Maze/Long Kesh site continues to dog the  building of a better future for us all, and indecision on elite facilities for  sport causes a lot of concern.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Much reference has been made in the debate to Christmas.  However, as we should all know, the true meaning of Christmas is about a family  for which there was no shelter when the mother was about to give birth. If that  were to happen today in the twenty-first century, I presume that, rather than  having to go to a stable, one would be able to go to at least a slurry shed,  because there are certainly not enough homes for families.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  welcome the statement in so far as it goes. I also welcome the fact that there  is now double the DUP representation, and that they have almost as many Members  in the Chamber as the Alliance Party. Perhaps that is a sign of things to come.</p>
          <p class="TimePeriod">2.30 pm</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I accept that the economic downturn is a global situation  with national dimensions, but it also has a local dimension. We, in this House,  should be in no doubt about the serious effects that the economic downturn is  having on households and businesses in Northern Ireland. Regional  Governments have a responsibility, and there are many things that they can, and  should, do.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive have not acted in a timely, decisive or  effective manner. Devolution brings with it the ability to do things  differently, but the flipside of the coin is that there is a responsibility to  act and to put policies and measures in place that are similar to the actions  being taken in other jurisdictions. That has not been done sufficiently well up  to now.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive have two specific responsibilities. The first  responsibility is to help Northern Ireland  through the economic downturn; the second is to prepare Northern Ireland  for recovery. If done correctly, those two actions will be mutually  reinforcing. The key lies in targeting existing commitments to help to  modernise and rebalance our economy.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The recession in Northern   Ireland may not be as deep as in the rest of the United Kingdom  because of the public-sector cushion, but we should not be complacent about  that. It is a major structural issue. The fear is that the downturn in Northern Ireland  will be longer and recovery will be slower because we have not put measures in  place to address the major imbalances in the economy. I agree with the  Chairperson of the Finance Committee: the downgrading of the regional economic  strategy is a major concern.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive do not have access to significant tax-varying  and borrowing powers, so the key lies in what is being done with the public  expenditure that is under their control. I welcome the commitment to pay  public-sector bills within 10 days. However, Lord Mandelson introduced that  scheme in Whitehall  in the middle of October 2008: why did it take us six weeks to introduce it?  Cash flow is critical to small businesses, particularly in Northern Ireland,  given the nature of our economy.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, timely decisions have not been taken on fuel  poverty and energy efficiency. The British Government introduced their scheme  for England  and Wales back in early September 2008; we are only getting round to discussing  what we are doing about fuel poverty in December 2008. We are three months late  and are already into the teeth of what has been a very cold winter. Help for  pensioners is coming a little too late.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">There are also major challenges with respect to capital  spending. Will the 2008-09 Budget be fully spent? If not, that will be a major  indictment and a failure across Government. The second question is whether  capital spending can be accelerated. I note the strong emphasis that the  Finance Minister gave to the scale of existing commitments towards investment.  The Alliance Party has already made its concerns clear regarding the balance of  that investment in relation to the opportunity costs for rebalancing our  economy.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">However, the real issue to discuss today is the scale of  the increase in capital investment and where that is being targeted. On a  pro-rata basis, the scale of capital investment here is not equivalent to that  being made in other jurisdictions. This morning, I commented on that and on the  scale of social-housing investment in Scotland  and England and the wider  investment including &pound;500 million across England in retooling for the green  economy.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Budget was very tightly drawn, which is a major  problem. There are already opportunity costs from a divided society &mdash; but  populism has been given precedence over prudence, and we did not fix the roof  when the Sun was shining. Now, the Executive have to give undue emphasis to  balancing the books while other jurisdictions are placing emphasis on greater  fiscal stimulus. We are still playing games with populism instead of making  proper, prudent investments.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Short-term benefits can make a difference in some respects,  but the real challenge lies in what can be done about the long-term  restructuring of our economy.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>:  Does my friend agree that the dead hand of the Environment Minister seems to be  on today&rsquo;s statement, as absolutely no mention has been made of developing the  green economy, which is a major opportunity for Northern Ireland?</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member will have an extra minute.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  agree entirely with the comments of my colleague. There are huge opportunities  for Northern Ireland  in relation to renewable energy. When one considers the prices that people are  paying for fuel, the flaws in our local infrastructure are partly to blame.  Therefore, major gains can be made from proper investment.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Similarly, with respect to fuel poverty, we welcome fuel credits.  However, although they will bring people short-term benefits, one must ask  whether those resources could be better used by investing in the warm homes  scheme in order to improve fuel efficiency, which would produce long-term  benefits not just for this Christmas but for many winters to come. Tackling  problems in such a manner would not only help individuals in the short term but  would benefit society and the economy in the long term.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, although some aspects of today&rsquo;s statements are  good, much more could be done in Northern Ireland. Speaking on  behalf of the Alliance Party and the opposition, I say that the measures  announced today are not good enough and do not go far enough. The Assembly  could do a lot better for Northern    Ireland &mdash; we are not being sufficiently  ambitious.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  First, I shall direct some remarks towards Mrs Kelly. I am not the DUP&rsquo;s elder  statesman. Perhaps, the Member did not notice me sitting here. If she is happy  to do so, I will compare my birth certificate with the Member&rsquo;s any day of the  week.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Had the Ulster Unionist Party&rsquo;s wishes been granted, we  would not have been here today. Mr Basil McCrea, ably assisted by Sir Reg  Empey, argued on the radio that, rather than attending the Assembly, Members  should have taken their holidays earlier. Therefore, we are discussing this  matter because of the DUP and because it wishes to make progress in Northern Ireland.  The five months&rsquo; absence of Executive meetings was not because DUP members were  not prepared to attend &mdash; we were always ready to attend &mdash; and we are prepared  to undertake any work that the public asks us to do in order to ensure that the  economy has every opportunity to recover. Today, a DUP Minister has been able  to announce the &pound;15 million fuel credits scheme, so it is much better that DUP  Ministers are here making announcements than being at home, as recommended by  the Ulster Unionists.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I am glad that the Assembly did not adopt the scheme  proposed by the Minister for Social Development and that we have gone considerably  further by giving money to pensioners, who would have been excluded and left  behind by the SDLP. Many more people will benefit from the scheme announced by  the Finance Minister.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I apologise on behalf of the Chairperson of the Committee  for Agriculture and Rural Development, who is unable to be here because he is  in Westminster  to attend a debate about the economy. However, he said that the Committee is  delighted that &pound;20 million has been allocated to the farm nutrient management  scheme. That is not just good news for farmers; it is good news for the  environment &mdash; because the works are necessary &mdash; and for the construction  industry.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, I welcome the &pound;700,000 assistance for the  fishing industry, and I know that the hard-working MLAs &mdash; such as my colleague  Mr Wells &mdash; who represent the fishermen will also welcome that money.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, I welcome the &pound;500,000 that will go to the  flooding hardship assistance scheme for agriculture. Despite the poor efforts  by the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development&rsquo;s economists, I welcome  the fact that the Finance Minister has turned that situation around. I also  welcome the &pound;1&middot;5 million to alleviate animal-health pressures; however, in  conjunction with that, it is important to ensure that we properly deal with,  and eradicate, bovine TB and do not spend money compensating farmers for  culling cattle. In bovine TB hotspots, there must be a badger cull &mdash;</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: You  just lost Jim Wells.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  Jim and I agree and disagree on many matters, but we remain good friends.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Planning was mentioned, and the 2,000 additional houses  that will be approved as a result of PPS 21 and the speeding-up of the planning  process. That is good news, and I strongly welcome it, but I would further welcome  news about private-sector planning applications that are ready to go, such as  that of Westfield,  which would create 1,500 new jobs at Sprucefield. The sooner that that  application can be turned around and those new jobs are on the scene the  better.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Moreover, the private sector must step up to the mark, and  I welcome the talks that are taking place with the banks. Nevertheless, the  banks must pull out all the stops &mdash;</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  As I recall, when the Member was Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure, in  reply to a question, he said that a decision on the Maze/Long Kesh site should  be made by November 2007, in order to meet planning and other requirements, and  that development of that site would have provided some 10,000 jobs. As a  representative of Lagan   Valley, is he not  disappointed that no decision has been reached by late 2008?</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  The Maze project should go ahead as soon as possible. It is a matter for OFMDFM  to establish that agreement. I welcome the fact that the Royal Ulster  Agricultural Society has obtained planning permission for a part of its land,  and I know that it has strong interest in moving to the Maze site. We should be  looking at that site as a strategic opportunity to create many good-quality  jobs in Northern Ireland &mdash;  perhaps a base of more, better-quality jobs than exist anywhere in Northern Ireland  with regard to the numbers. That site has the ability to deliver that. I will  continue, publicly and privately, to press for a decision and to push that  particular door.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">With regard to the private sector, the banks must step up  to the mark. In fairness, most banks have cut their base rates. However, many  of them, with regard to the small businesses that they serve, have added  additional money on to that base rate. Instead of getting the base rate plus 2%  or 3%, they are adding another 1&middot;5% or 2% on to it, and that is having a  detrimental impact on those businesses.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">NIE&rsquo;s paltry price cut of 11% is not enough. The price of  electricity is 37% higher than it was last year. NIE must review its prices  again, not in September, but early next year. In addition, the supermarkets  have not passed on to their customers the reduced commodity prices. The  supermarkets must be brought to book &mdash;</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>:  The Member must conclude his remarks.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  They are overcharging the public, especially in the run-up to Christmas, and  they are ripping people off.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName">The Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for Health,  Social Services and Public Safety (Mrs <strong>O&rsquo;Neill)</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. As Deputy Chairperson of the  Health Committee, I welcome the package of measures, which, I hope, will begin  to alleviate the worst effects of the current economic downturn for those who  are most in need.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The impact of the downturn is already biting deep, and it  is difficult to predict how long it will last. Although no specific elements or  measures in the package come under the banner of the Health Department, it is  universally recognised that people&rsquo;s state of health and, often, their mental  well-being are directly affected by many of the issues being discussed today,  such as fuel poverty, social disadvantage, exclusion, unemployment and  redundancy. Therefore, it is no accident that promoting health and well-being  is one of the key priorities in the Programme for Government and that about  half of the Assembly&rsquo;s public funding goes on health, social services and  public safety.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The effects of the economic crisis can be worse for people  who are already on low incomes. At this time of year, we are all familiar with  campaigns that warn about the effect of cold weather, particularly on  vulnerable older people, young children and people of any age who have a  serious or long-term medical condition.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">It is a fact that many more people die during the winter  than in summer due to the effects of cold weather. During severe winters, the  number who die increases greatly due to heart attacks, strokes and respiratory  illnesses that are brought on by a drop in body temperature. A report published  today by the Institute of Public Health in Ireland warns of an increase in  winter deaths due to an increase in fuel poverty.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Older people, in particular, are often at greater risk from  cold weather because they might not keep their homes warm enough during winter  months. That may be because they use insufficient heating because they cannot  afford to pay, or worry about paying, higher fuel bills. We are also familiar  with the overused expression that some people now have to choose whether to eat  or heat. It is a clich&eacute;, but, unfortunately for many, it is a fact. Any  measures that will help vulnerable people who find themselves in that situation  are, therefore, welcome.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>:  Does the Member agree with the point that I made earlier that, rather than  protecting vulnerable people for one Christmas only, the Executive should spend  money on protecting people in the long term, through the warm homes scheme.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy  Chairperson of the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>:  I welcome the Member&rsquo;s comments. I agree; we are in a difficult situation now,  but we must protect people in the long term.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The economic downturn has meant that more people have found  themselves out of work. That applies across the board. The fall in house prices  and the lack of available mortgages for those who might wish to buy houses has  resulted in the almost total collapse of the house-building sector.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The impact is felt well beyond the house-building sector  and into the building-supply chain &mdash; from estate agents to furniture retailers.  Other sectors, too, are affected.</p>
          <p class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">We have seen the collapse of Woolworths Group plc and MFI,  both of which are in the hands of administrators and whose staff face great  uncertainty. In my area, jobs in Powerscreen are under serious threat, and, due  to a lack of orders, the company has introduced unpaid short-term layoffs for  300 of its 500-strong workforce.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The economic downturn is having an enormous impact, and not  only of a financial nature. It is causing untold stress and worry that is  affecting people&rsquo;s health. They are worrying about unpaid bills and mortgages  and, perhaps, the threat of losing their jobs or homes. It is right, therefore,  that the Executive should look at what action can be taken to help people at  this difficult time.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Today&rsquo;s announcement about bringing forward capital  programmes to produce jobs and to provide some stimulus for the construction  industry is very welcome. I welcome, too, recent announcements by the Minister  of Health, Social Services and Public Safety about capital investments, which,  as well as providing essential health and social care facilities, will provide  much-needed jobs in the sector.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">For some time, the Committee for Health, Social Services  and Public Safety has been concerned about the urgent need to move ahead on one  capital project: the proposed women and children&rsquo;s hospital in Belfast. In a recent debate on the issue, the  Chairperson of the Committee said that the journey towards a regional maternity  hospital began about 14 years ago and the decision to build a women and  children&rsquo;s hospital was made more than five years ago. Due to a lack of  funding, however, work has not even begun.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister said that the facility was a priority for him  but that the funding was not available. The Committee has written to the  Department of Finance and Personnel urging that the money be made available as  a matter of urgency. Surely, today offers an opportunity to provide the initial  funding that will enable clearing of the site to begin, to relocate existing  services and, finally, get the project under way.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I want to make some comments in my capacity as the Sinn  F&eacute;in spokesperson on health and disability. The Health Service has many  challenges, and Sinn F&eacute;in is committed to working in the Assembly and the  Executive &mdash; and with the Minister &mdash; to address those efficiently and  effectively. However, we are concerned about the lack of information that is  being provided to ourselves and the unions on decisions that are being made on  such issues as the 700-plus job cuts in front-line nursing. In recent days, we  learned of Mary Harney&rsquo;s plans to make cuts in the Health Service in the  Twenty-six Counties in an effort to address the economic crisis. We cannot  stand by and allow that to happen anywhere in Ireland.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Health Service is under pressure; there is never enough  money for health. However, the Department has set itself a number of  unrealistic targets around, for instance, discharges from Muckamore Abbey   Hospital and adequate and  appropriate respite care. That is not what we want to see: we want to see  continued advances in those, and more, areas.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Members have to deliver for the people whom they represent;  they must do everything that they can. Today&rsquo;s announcements are a move in the  right direction. Sinn F&eacute;in is committed to delivering further on those promises  and delivering for the people. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr Ian  Paisley</strong>: Today, we stand at the edge of a dark ocean. Anyone who thinks  that the situation will be of a few days&rsquo; generation is wrong. The nations of  our globe are in a sad and sorry state. Often, I wonder why the clever men who  are involved in finance were not able to give due and timely warning to those  over whom they had power that this situation would come. However, it has come,  and we are facing serious and sad days.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I remember the soup kitchens that existed when I was a boy.  I remember the churches gathering second-hand clothing. I remember the queues  at the church gates to receive that clothing &mdash; and the people were welcome to  it. At this time, we need to think seriously about what we are doing and where  we are going.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, we should say that it is a good thing that  this House is in operation at this time. Is it not a good thing that the people  of Northern Ireland  have voices, and certain powers which they can exercise for the help and  alleviation of the strains and the testing days that are ahead?</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">We have all had our arguments over devolved rule, but if  ever we needed devolved rule, we need it today, when the individual elected  representatives of Northern Ireland &mdash; no matter from what side they come or  what their politics might be &mdash; have a say in doing something that will help at  this time.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Help is needed for the housing and employment frameworks.  People need help to pay for fuel and food, and they need help with their  finances. I am glad that our Ministers are meeting the banks, and it would be a  very good thing if bankers were righteously to search their consciences.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I feel strongly that it is wrong for banks to foreclose on  good customers simply because a bleak period lies ahead of us. Many people have  come to see me when their loans have been called in because the banks wanted to  be sure of getting their money, but everyone else went to the wall. I have  talked to the banks and to my colleagues, and I trust that tomorrow the banks  will be made to face up to their extremely important responsibility. What is  the point of our Government giving money to the banks, only for them to hold on  to it for their own private welfare and use? That practice must end.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome statements from the Ministers that they will help  all those who need it, but that help amounts to very little. As was mentioned  here today, I am a pensioner, and many pensioners are doing the right thing:  for example, some have told me that they do not require the money and intend,  therefore, to give it to the wee lady down the street who needs it. That shows  good spirit, and I salute people who want to help others whom they know are  going through a sad and terrible time.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Members may look to the future and honestly face up to its  challenges, but we must act now. I am glad that the Executive are meeting  again, and I welcome their decision.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I ask the Member to bring his remarks to a close.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr Ian  Paisley</strong>: If I had chaired some of the meetings that have been held in the  past number of days, I do not know what would have happened or what would have  been said, although I reckon that it would have been pretty hot stuff. However,  I can say that we are here now and we have a job to do. Let us do that job, and  let us do it heartily.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">At the end of the day, truth, honesty and justice will  prevail, and the Province will emerge at the other side as a better Province,  because people will have been driven closer to one another by their common  needs.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Regional Development (Mr Cobain)</strong>: I preface my remarks  by saying that the Committee has not had time to study the proposals that were  announced today. My remarks will, therefore, reflect previous comments that  were made by the Committee, but they are relevant to today&rsquo;s debate.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">As Chairperson of the Committee for Regional Development, I  welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on today&rsquo;s motion, which  states:</p>
          <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;That this Assembly takes note of the measures taken by the  Executive to strengthen the local economy and support those most vulnerable in  society against the impact of the global economic downturn.&rdquo;</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee has, on many occasions, urged the Executive  to continue to invest in roads and public transport infrastructure. Investment  in infrastructure underpins all aspects of life in Northern Ireland, including the  social, economic and environmental elements. The people of Northern Ireland  need &mdash; and deserve &mdash; the best infrastructure: good quality roads and an  integrated public transport network are required to take people to places of  work, education, training and social services.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Sustainable and viable ports and airports are critical for  connecting Northern Ireland  with the rest of the world, bringing tourism and businesses into Northern Ireland  and enhancing our ability to compete in the global economy.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee for Regional Development is concerned that  the Department is facing significant resource and capital pressures, in excess  of &pound;27 million and &pound;17 million respectively, in the current year. Northern Ireland already spends some 21% less  per capita on its transport networks than the rest of Great Britain.  There has been underinvestment in structural road maintenance over the years,  and that continues to be the case. Apart from the road safety implications, on  a purely financial basis it costs four or five times as much to carry out  reactive maintenance than proactive treatments.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">In recent years, we have made progress on investment in  both roads and public transport, which has contributed to the development of a  vibrant and sustainable economy in Northern Ireland. At this time of  global economic downturn, it is essential for everyone in Northern Ireland  that that investment not be wasted and that the progress made not be lost.  However, with the current pressures on public spending, it is vital that public  money be spent wisely and with an eye to the longer-term well-being of the Northern Ireland  economy. Investment in infrastructure now will bring much-needed jobs,  stimulate the local economy and make Northern Ireland a more attractive location  for inward investment and skilled workers. Those steps would help Northern Ireland  to recover as quickly as possible when, and if, global economic conditions  improve.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Deputy Speaker, I will now make three or four brief  remarks in my capacity as an MLA. The &pound;150 fuel credit is a move that  representatives across the House will welcome, in light of the increasing  challenges of fuel poverty. However, questions must be asked about the link to  pension credit. Ongoing difficulties surround the uptake of the pension credit,  which penalises those who have saved or who have a modest occupational pension.  Why then is fuel credit linked to that entitlement? It could, and will, exclude  thousands of pensioners in poverty and fuel poverty.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">A report launched today by the Institute of Public Health  urged that fuel poverty programmes should not be limited to those claiming  social welfare or social benefits. A means-tested benefit such as pension  credit is a particularly weak foundation to build on. Tens of thousands of  pensioners will not benefit from that scheme. At the end of the financial year  I, and other Members, will be interested to see how much money has been spent  on pension credit.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Growing numbers of households in Northern Ireland are facing  personal and household debt beyond their means, and rapidly rising unemployment  is another great danger. September witnessed the highest monthly increase in unemployment  in the Province in 22 years, which has resulted in significantly increased  demands for debt counselling and advice. Do today&rsquo;s proposals really represent  the type of increased support that is required? From my experience, they do  not. The flood of debt facing our society could bring unprecedented personal  and economic misery, and we must ensure that we are serious about addressing  that need.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Since its introduction in 2001, the warm homes scheme has  been central to addressing fuel poverty and the ill health associated with it.  The popularity of the scheme is known to every MLA. However, despite  ever-increasing demands, next year&rsquo;s budget allocation will see little increase  in the money allocated to that scheme. Targets have been set for fuel poverty,  and all of those targets have been missed over the past few months. If we are  really serious about addressing fuel poverty, then the money invested in the  warm homes scheme does not reflect that.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, the suggestion was made today that the Department  for Social Development (DSD) will lose &pound;30 million of its budget, which would  have been used for the provision of the housing programme. The impact on the  most vulnerable in our society would be significant. Such a move would raise a  number of issues, and it will be interesting to hear directly from the First  Minister or deputy First Minister on that matter.</p>
          <p class="TimePeriod">3.00 pm</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  thank the First Minister for his statement. It contained a significant amount  of good, which the public will welcome.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Any response to the economic crisis must be on two levels;  we must think about the short term and the long term. In the short term, it is  absolutely right that we protect the needy and most vulnerable in our society.  I very much agree with the comment from the former First Minister Dr Paisley  about the relevance of this devolved Assembly. If we cannot be aware of, and  alert to, the needs of the most vulnerable, we will fail as an Assembly.  However, I do not think that we will fail in that regard. For that reason, I  very much support today&rsquo;s announcements on meaningful measures to address fuel  poverty.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I also welcome the announcement on debt. DETI is already  allocating significant resources to the provision of advice on money matters,  and I welcome the news that that funding has been extended today. DSD has run a  successful campaign to increase benefit uptake. The First Minister also  reported that, which is good.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I give a huge welcome to the First Minister&rsquo;s remarks on  dealing with loan sharks. We sometimes complain about the banks. However, if  people get into difficulty with the banks, they get a letter in the post; if  they run into difficulties with loan sharks, they are much more likely to get a  brick through the window. Therefore, the introduction of proper enforcement  methods is long overdue, and the law must adequately protect those who live in  very vulnerable areas and exist in circumstances of which many of us have  little awareness.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I was pleased to hear the comments about the positive role  of the credit unions. They can make a huge contribution here, and I am very  much in support of the Committee for Enterprise,  Trade and Investment&rsquo;s ongoing inquiry into credit unions.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I now turn to the longer-term approach. We are experiencing  a major international economic crisis. Just today, we heard about the  remarkably and aptly named Mr Madoff, who was thought to be a major banker and  investor but is now known to be involved in what is essentially pyramid selling  on a gigantic scale. That affects us because we now know that UK banks that have a presence in Northern Ireland  are involved in that matter.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Robert Peston, the BBC&rsquo;s business editor, recently  described the current state of the world economy as:</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText"><span style="font-size:8.5pt; ">&ldquo;a crash as historic as the end of communism&rdquo;.</span></p>
          <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Therefore, we will not restructure the whole basis  of capitalism overnight. It will take a considerable number of years to  complete that project and to get real confidence back in the system. We must be  aware of the longer term and build our economy accordingly.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Much was said today about capital investment. I repeat the  fact that 42% of all this year&rsquo;s spend is aimed to be spent in the last three  months of this year. Thus, rather than spending having been brought forward, it  has, in fact, been delayed, and that brings with it a huge risk of underspend.  The Minister of Finance and Personnel has now told us that he is availing  himself of the facility to bring forward &pound;9&middot;4 million of spend from next year.  However, given the current inability to spend existing funds, we must ask  whether there will be the ability to spend that extra &pound;9&middot;4 million.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I want to mention our procurement system and to refer, in  particular, to construction. We know about the two major legal cases that are  being taken against Executive Departments. In recent days, I read the report on  the Rathlin ferry contract. The report approved the award of the contract but  said that there were very significant errors in the process and made 12  recommendations.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">That tells us that we have a major problem in our  procurement system. Today&rsquo;s announcement by the Finance Minister that the  frameworks process is being abandoned is a huge vote of no confidence in our  procurement system. It is 15 December, so we have to ask whether outstanding  projects for this year can be delivered &mdash; and the money allocated to them spent  &mdash; with such a sudden change in the procurement system.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s U-turn on banking regulation &mdash;  when I first asked him about it, he said that it was not a matter for the  Assembly.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Will the Member draw his remarks to a close?</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  welcome that the Minister of Finance and Personnel has recognised that the  Assembly and our Ministers have a key role in engaging with the banking system.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Adams</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Ba mhaith liom an Coiste  Feidhmi&uacute;ch&aacute;in a mholadh as na molta&iacute; a chuir s&eacute; i l&aacute;thair le d&eacute;ile&aacute;il le fadbh  an bhochtanais. I commend the efforts of the Executive in bringing forward the  measures announced today, and I thank the First Minister for his comments.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The credit crunch respects no boundaries or borders, and  its effects are being felt all over this island and throughout the globe. An  unregulated free market does not work for working families or for the poor &mdash;  that is the big historic lesson to learn. The problems here are compounded by a  legacy of underfunding and poor infrastructure from British direct rule.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The options available to the Executive are limited due to a  lack of economic and fiscal sovereignty, inadequate subvention from the British  Government and the negative effects of partition. The Minister of Finance and  Personnel drew attention to that three times in his statement and he spoke of  the limited levers under his control. I commend him for the measures that he  has taken in areas over which we do have responsibility, but it may be useful  for him to identify powers that would assist him if they were devolved from London to the Assembly.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive must also be commended for reallocating  successfully almost &pound;70 million, particularly in regard to the fuel credit  initiative, which will help families and pensioners who are most at risk of  fuel poverty.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">It is important to note that the British Treasury also  attempts to impose its political and fiscal philosophy on how the Government  here do their work. For example, it attempts to dictate that the public sector  can be effective or efficient only if it is exposed to competition from the  private sector and contends that assets should be sold off and public services  privatised. Incidentally, that is the same strategy that the Irish Government  pursued as they wilfully squandered the wealth of the Celtic tiger &mdash; it is the  wrong strategy. T&aacute; s&eacute; thar am go raibh athr&uacute; ann: t&aacute; smaointe agus bar&uacute;lacha  nua de dh&iacute;th.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The economy must serve the people. Rather than being judged  on the wealth of its elites, society should be judged by the condition of its  lowest class &mdash; the working poor and those citizens caught in the poverty trap.  I particularly welcome the remarks by the Member for North Antrim Dr Ian  Paisley on that issue.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Strategies should be developed North and South to chart a  different way forward. That means ending the nonsense of two competing  economies on this island &mdash; an all-island economy makes sense. In the North,  among other initiatives, that means pressing the British Government for greater  fiscal autonomy and the ability to gather taxes and manage our economy  independent of British Treasury restraints. Sin &eacute;, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Go  raibh m&iacute;le maith agat.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Buchanan</strong>:  I welcome the opportunity to speak briefly in the take-note debate. I will  focus my remarks mainly on health as I am a member of the Health Committee and  am interested in the subject.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Today, it is clear that there is evidence, if evidence were  needed, that the devolved Government is working for the people of Northern Ireland.  There is no doubt that the current economic climate has caused major concern  across every sector in Northern    Ireland, not least in the health sector.  Severe financial pressure in the business world, on families, elderly people  and on the workforce, where many jobs hang in the balance, has placed undue  stress on many individuals and families. In some instances that has led to ill  health, thereby placing extra pressure on the Department of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety. Therefore, in the midst of the global economic  downturn, it is of the utmost importance that front-line services in the Health  Service be protected.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">On numerous occasions, Members have raised major concerns  about the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety&rsquo;s proposals to  cut front-line services, using efficiency savings as a smokescreen to justify  those cuts. Proposals to cut 720 nursing jobs and to close many residential  care homes and nursing homes across the various constituencies while at the  same time cutting back on home-help services that provide vital care for  elderly people and disabled people in their own homes are a retrograde step.  Such proposals demonstrate a lack of vision, which will have further  detrimental consequences for the most vulnerable.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Today, however, I am glad that the Minister of Finance and  Personnel has taken the lead, not only in releasing &pound;1&middot;6 million to the  children&rsquo;s fund but in releasing &pound;5 million to the Department of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety for budget flexibility, which represents the third  tranche of available funding that has been allocated to the Department this  year.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  Does the Member agree that the &pound;1&middot;6 million that has been allocated to the  children&rsquo;s fund will go some way towards alleviating the concerns about some of  the Home Start, Life Start, Mid Start and Sure Start schemes, which do good  work for children?</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member will have an extra minute to speak.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Buchanan</strong>:  I agree with my colleague. The good work of those organisations has been  recognised, and the money, used wisely, will further that work.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that the extra &pound;5 million that has been allocated to  the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety will be spent  wisely on the delivery of front-line services. I remind the Minister of Health,  Social Services and Public Safety of his promise to the Assembly that  front-line services would not be affected by efficiency savings. I call on him  to be faithful to that commitment and to halt any proposed cuts in front-line  staff and service delivery. He should tell the Assembly, at his earliest  convenience, in which areas he proposes to spend the extra money for the  delivery of much-needed front-line services to protect the elderly, the sick  and the vulnerable.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">There is no doubt that today&rsquo;s announcement is a good one  for the people of Northern    Ireland. Even in the midst of tight  financial constraints, it behoves us all to work to ensure that action is taken  and that delivery is forthcoming without delay.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure (Mr McElduff)</strong>: Go raibh  maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. On behalf of the Committee for Culture,  Arts and Leisure, I wish to change the record a wee bit. The Committee has  consistently campaigned for greater investment in sports and the arts; it has  always taken the view that the potential for the arts and sports to contribute  to the local economy has never been fully exploited.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I will focus on the arts. It is not always appreciated that  spending on the arts results in a net contribution to the economy. Research  carried out in 2006 showed that every &pound;1 invested by the Arts Council and by  the arts in general returns just over &pound;3&middot;60 to the local economy. Furthermore,  arts funding maintains more than 2,000 jobs here. Given that some of our more  traditional industries are in difficulty because of the worldwide economic  downturn, this is the time to explore those areas of the economy that are, at  present, relatively untapped. The arts are one of those areas.</p>
          <p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I know that Car&aacute;l N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n is particularly anxious that I  address the issue of creative industries. One of the key goals of the Programme  for Government is to grow the creative industries sector by up to 15% by 2011.  The Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure, therefore, welcomed the fact that  the Minister launched the creative industries innovation fund in October. The  creative industries are a diverse sector of the economy, and their value has  not been fully understood or appreciated in the past. They cover a wide range  of businesses &mdash; advertising, architecture, film companies, publishers, theatre  companies, musicians, and artists, to name but a few. It is a growing sector  and one in which employment has increased by 8% between 2001 and 2005. In  comparison, during that same period, the economy as a whole grew by only 4&middot;7%,  indicating that the creative industries are a fast-growing sector.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">However, that should not result in a feeling of complacency  in Government. Much work has still to be done in developing the creative  industries to their full potential. Our Committee, therefore, welcomed the fact  that the Executive have allocated &pound;5 million to the creative industries  innovation fund. We urge the Executive to ensure that, in future, funding for  the creative industries continues to grow and that cuts are not made in that  area. Government as a whole must commit themselves to investing in our cultural  capital by supporting initiatives that increase the quality, visibility and  value of the creative industries here. Cross-departmental working is crucial.  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment and the Department for  Employment and Learning must work closely with the Department of Culture, Arts  and Leisure (DCAL) to ensure that we get the best deal for our creative  industries.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">There is a need to support arts professionals during these  tough times. The Committee is acutely aware that, at this time of global  economic downturn, artists and arts professionals can be particularly  vulnerable. Unfortunately, those working in the arts can be some of the most  exposed workers in our society, living hand to mouth and often unsure of when  they will next be in employment. They often have to find part-time work to  supplement their artistic endeavours; however, in these times, such work may be  even harder to come by. Indeed, the Committee recently held a round-table  meeting with stakeholders from the theatre sector. We heard from  representatives of the union Equity, and other key stakeholders, who made that  very point.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I conclude by urging the Executive to look closely at how  the arts and creative industries can be part of the solution to our current  economic problems. For that to be achieved, long-term and steady investment in  the arts is required. We should remember that funding for the arts here in the  North is still the lowest in these islands, at only &pound;6&middot;13 per capita. Funding  for the arts in Scotland is  &pound;11&middot;93 per capita and in the rest of Ireland is &pound;12&middot;61. Therefore, there  is plenty of room for improvement in that regard.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Speaking on a personal level, I welcome the Executive&rsquo;s  listening ear for the construction industry over the past few months.  Representatives of the construction industry got organised and addressed the  First Minister and the deputy First Minster, other Ministers and Committees in  the Assembly. I think that the series of initiatives announced today, and those  being undertaken at this time, to bring forward capital development schemes  indicate that the Executive are listening to the construction industry. That  can only be helpful. Many builders have said that, after Christmas, they do not  have a programme for work. We must do anything that we can to assist the  construction industry.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I am pleased that the Minister of Finance and Personnel is  meeting the leaders of the local banks tomorrow. He follows in the footsteps of  the First Minister and the deputy First Minister, who have held a series of  meetings with financial institutions during and since the summer. Developers in  west Tyrone have said that, very often, not only do banks not help, but they  actively block the potential of getting the mortgage market on the move again.  I have a letter in my possession that states that chartered surveyors now must  ask housing developers for disclosure of incentives, under changes in the red  book.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">That is troubling developers who are in a position to  provide houses to reach first-time buyers, but are being blocked by financial  institutions. At this time, sympathy and support is called for, not obstacles.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Naturally, I remind Members about the area west of the  Bann. My party leader, Gerry Adams, referred to a legacy of underfunding and  poor infrastructure. The effects of that can be multiplied three or four times  west of the Bann, where there has been a history of underinvestment.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">To enhance competitiveness, greater attention must be paid  to poor access to broadband in some rural areas. If the Minister of Enterprise,  Trade and Investment were in the House, she would probably say that the North  of Ireland has 100% reach for broadband access and that that is ahead of the  rest of Europe. However, I remind the Minister  that, although the percentage may be in the 90s, it has not reached 100%. In  places such as Broughderg, Cappagh, Eglish and Eskragh in County Tyrone,  people have the right to compete on a level playing field for business  opportunities, so I ask the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment to  ensure that access to broadband is rolled out to reach 100%, as has been  suggested.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  It is always good to follow Mr McElduff and to hear him mention places such as  Eskragh. His earlier comments were similar to an audition for a role in the  arts, but I am unsure whether he was welcoming the project or was opposed to  it. He did not make that clear, so he may wish to clarify.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I broadly welcome the reallocation of funding that has been  announced today. It is interesting that the thrust of the motion was about the  global economic downturn, yet the debate has focused primarily on local issues.  That is what the Chamber is about &mdash; all politics is local. Members have  outlined a long list of projects that they would like to see helped and  supported, and they are entirely right to do so. I shall focus on a couple of  those.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">It was announced that &pound;20 million would be provided to the  farm nutrient management scheme, but I do not want the farming community &mdash; or  the wider community &mdash; to think that that money will reopen the scheme, because  it will not. I understand that that money has already been spent, or is earmarked  to be spent, in the next couple of weeks. Farmers will not be able to get back  on to the rollercoaster and submit a new application to the farm nutrient  management scheme; there will be no new opening of doors in that respect.  However, I welcome the fact that backup will be provided.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The amount of &pound;500,000 that is to be provided for flooding  hardship in agriculture is welcome, but that amount will not nearly be enough  to cover the damage to the crops, grassland and buildings from the flooding of  August 2008. The amount of &pound;500,000 is, however, a reasonable start, and I look  forward to seeing where, specifically, it will be spent.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I am pleased that Mr Poots talked about the fishing  industry, because that industry, especially at this time of year, suffers  extreme hardship and difficult times as a result of the EU discussions. I am  pleased that Northern    Ireland has moved into line with some other  European countries by providing support to the fishing industry.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The amount of &pound;2&middot;5 million for roads structural maintenance  is not enough. Mr McElduff and I will strongly agree that the west of the  Province is underfunded. Given the fact that the public transport system is  very limited and that there is no rail system, the west of the Province has to  rely on the road infrastructure. Report after report has highlighted the lack  of investment in the roads infrastructure in the west of the Province.  Maintenance is at the core of that, and there is not enough finance for roads  maintenance in those areas.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The &pound;1&middot;5 million allocated to animal health is welcome, but  unless a genuine effort is made to eradicate brucellosis and bovine TB in the  Province, no overall long-term overall progress will be made.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I am concerned that the &pound;85 million in the overall plan is  an over-commitment. However, I assume that the Executive have thought this  through. I assume they know that the money will be found and that we will not  be left with a deficit at the end of the year.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The &pound;15 million allocated to easing fuel poverty and the  &pound;1&middot;6 million for the children&rsquo;s fund must be welcomed by all Members: no one  will consider those announcements to be bad news. However, there must be  long-term strategies in both areas. Although such short-term investment will  help at this time, it will not provide the overall long-term investment needed  for the children&rsquo;s fund and for eradicating fuel poverty. Difficulties will  recur over the next couple of years, and a longer-term strategy is needed.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: I  welcome the announcements that have been made following this morning&rsquo;s  Executive meeting.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Over the last few weeks, I have met groups from the University of Ulster,  Oxford University and elsewhere. Each group  asked about the economic policies that the Assembly can implement to cope with  the current global downturn. Across the world, Governments are asking  themselves the same questions, and they are bringing forward measures to make a  difference at some level. The Assembly is in the same position.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">As has been said, fiscal policy is largely determined by  our national Government at Westminster.  They take the lead in making announcements on issues such as the lowering of  VAT to provide a stimulus for spending in the retail sector, and on tax and  social security matters.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">We are limited in what we can do: global problems will not  necessarily be fixed locally. I heard what Mr Elliott said about all politics  being local, and it is important that the Assembly acts to ease the  difficulties that are experienced locally. A devolved Assembly can take several  measures to ease the burden on households and businesses throughout Northern Ireland,  and it is important that the Executive have now done so.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The health of the economy was central to the Programme for  Government, and the Executive recognised the importance of creating a  competitive economy in Northern    Ireland. Unfortunately, the unpredicted  global economic crisis has affected all of us and created its own problems.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">In my maiden speech in the Assembly, I referred to the many  young people who were struggling to get on the property ladder. In many cases,  they stretched themselves financially in order to get a home. Now, many of them  have seen the value of their homes crash and have negative equity to cope with,  on top of other financial woes that they may be experiencing. For that reason,  I welcome moves made elsewhere to help families keep their homes and avoid  repossession.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Several announcements that were made in the Programme for  Government and since, though made in economically brighter times, are helping  people in today&rsquo;s tough economic circumstances. The freeze on the regional  rate; the deferment of water rates; the announcement on prescription charges,  and the extension of free public transport to the over-60s are all very  welcome, and the benefits can be seen in today&rsquo;s economic climate.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">We have already heard about the crisis in the construction  industry. Many Members and Assembly Committees have been lobbied by the  representatives of that industry. We have been left in no doubt as to the  importance of the contribution that the sector makes to the Northern Ireland  economy. The announcement, some weeks ago, that the Titanic signature project  was to proceed was welcomed. It will create the jobs that the industry so  desires. The Finance Minister has indicated that several other projects will  commence and that he is determined that none will be held up pending the  outcome of legal proceedings.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Other projects would be equally beneficial. In my  constituency of East Antrim, a massive project  has been planned for a plot of land in Magheramorne, which is about the same  size as the Titanic Quarter. It would mean hundreds of jobs and new houses and  would have a hugely positive impact &mdash; not only on the local area, but on the  building and construction sector across the region. I hope that the Executive  can make progress on that matter.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I also welcome the fact that the A8 road project in Larne  will go ahead: that is overdue. It will significantly improve journey times and  safety on that strategically important stretch of road.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Today&rsquo;s announcements are good news for people across the  Province, and they will be welcomed by those in the farming industry, the fishing  industry, schools and small businesses. This morning, we also heard that energy  prices will fall. Many of us would like to see a further reduction, as the  price of electricity this Christmas will be significantly higher than it was  last Christmas. Nonetheless, it is a welcome development.</p>
          <p class="TimePeriod">3.30 pm</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">One of the sectors hardest hit by the current global  economic downturn is the small-business sector. Banks are not lending in the  same manner as before, and small enterprises &mdash; which make up the overwhelming  number of businesses here &mdash; have had to lay people off and close down.  Therefore, I welcome the fact that the Finance Minister confirmed today that he  will be meeting the four main local banks tomorrow, particularly following  their refusal to meet the Finance Committee. That is another positive  announcement.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Also welcome was the previous announcement that industrial  rates have been frozen at 30% and, undoubtedly, local businesses will support  today&rsquo;s announcement that there will be further changes to the rating system in  the weeks ahead. In particular, I welcome the announcement that there will be a  small-business rates-relief scheme, similar to that which exists in GB, and  that non-domestic rates will be frozen in cash terms for 2009-2010. That will  be worth in the region of &pound;8 million to local businesses.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Of course, it is not only local businesses that have been  affected by the economic downturn; individuals have also been affected. For  that reason, I welcome the &pound;15 million targeted at addressing fuel poverty. We  heard earlier that that will provide for a payment of &pound;150 for some 100,000  individuals across Northern    Ireland who are in receipt of income support  or pension credits, and will be paid on top of the fuel allowances that they  already receive. It is also positive that the warm homes scheme, which the DUP  pioneered, is also set to continue.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, I welcome today&rsquo;s announcements and look  forward to seeing these measures make a real impact on people across the  country.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Anderson</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat. I support the motion.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in recognises the scale of the challenges facing our  economy and the need for decisive action. The economic downturn is an issue  that has demanded the attention of all Ministers, and it should not be seen &mdash;  as some Members seem to think &mdash; as an opportunity for selfish and irresponsible  party political point-scoring. The people do not want to hear politicians  squabbling over who did or did not do what; they want action. I welcome the  measures being taken by the Executive to alleviate the burden, such as the &pound;15  million being set aside to tackle fuel poverty. Thankfully, that will now  include pensioners on pension credit, something that was not part of the  original proposal made by the SDLP Minister for Social Development.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">It has been said many times that there is little that the  Executive can do in relation to the global economic downturn. However, it is  clear that, even within the constraints of a block Budget, there are steps that  can and must be taken. We must listen to people such as Eleanor Gill from the  Consumer Council, who, only today, said that the system has failed the most  vulnerable in our society. The proposals suggested by the deputy First Minister  in September represent tangible measures that can and will make a difference to  people&rsquo;s lives, but if we are to confront and change the failed system that  Eleanor Gill and others have talked about and which we have inherited, we must  do more to implement new and innovative measures. Indeed, that is something which  we committed ourselves to in the Programme for Government.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Recently, I attended a regeneration seminar in Derry. At that seminar, the point was made that the  definition of insanity is to continue doing the same thing while expecting a  different outcome. For too long, this system has been doing the same thing. It  has spent resources in the same manner, and, predictably, the outcomes have not  changed. While part of the North and some of the people have prospered, the  rest have been left behind. However, I firmly believe that social requirement  in public procurement is one area in which we can make a massive impact,  utilising the billions of pounds spent through the investment strategy in the  coming years to maximise the economic and social benefits. To that end, I  welcome the First Minister&rsquo;s comments today with reference to the social  procurement guidelines and the comments made earlier by Minister Dodds.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">In practical terms, that means that public-spending  projects should include social objectives such as the employment of the  long-term unemployed and apprentice training. That is a smart, intelligent  governing mechanism that should be used to maximum effect. For example, if one  job was created or one apprentice trained for every &pound;500,000 of public money  spent &mdash; which is by no means an ambitious target &mdash; that would equate to 40,000  jobs and training for people who otherwise would have little or no access to  those facilities and jobs.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Everything that we do must be underpinned by the needs of  the people, particularly those who are in the greatest need &mdash; the most  vulnerable in our society and what have been referred to as &ldquo;hard-pressed  households&rdquo;.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Unfortunately, that concept of social justice has still not  registered with elements of the system here. That is why it has failed the most  vulnerable in our society, and Eleanor Gill and others repeatedly tell us so.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">There are still those in the Civil Service and in political  parties who pay lip service to that agenda but, behind the scenes, work hard to  resist it. They refuse to implement equality impact assessments properly. They  block and frustrate innovative measures, because they do not want to  countenance change, nor do they want to see resources go to people and areas  that really need them. They want to keep doing things in the way in which they  have been done in the past. They want to keep things as they are, yet they tell  us that they will make a difference, and that there will be different outcomes.  That is insanity.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">There is still much work to do, and, collectively, we need  to break down and dismantle bit by bit the old guard whom we have inherited. It  is not just about building buildings but about building a better future. If we  are determined to deliver real change &mdash; the kind of change that people demand  and deserve &mdash; we must change the way in which we do business; otherwise, there  will be no change.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">This is the final debate of the year, so I will end by  saying that Members should stand up for Derry.  Go raibh maith agat.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Neeson</strong>: I  welcome today&rsquo;s statement; however, a great deal of that spend was already in  the system, so that must be borne in mind. I particularly welcome the Utility  Regulator&rsquo;s announcement today about the reduction in electricity and gas  charges. I am somewhat disappointed with NIE for stating that its price review  will not be done again until autumn 2009. That is an issue that we need to take  up with NIE.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Today&rsquo;s announcement from the Utility Regulator shows the  importance of devolution to Northern    Ireland in many ways. It reflects the work that  the Committee for Enterprise,  Trade and Investment did, because we took up that issue. I also welcome the  tenacity that the Consumer Council showed on the issue, particularly the work  of its chief executive, Eleanor Gill. As an MLA and as a member of the ETI  Committee, I also welcome the very good working relationship that has been  developed with the Utility Regulator. However, the next step is to take on  board the recent report from former regulator Douglas McIldoon. NIE&rsquo;s  purchasing policies undoubtedly need to be reformed.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Scottish Parliament recently agreed a national contract  for the supply of electricity to the entire public sector. That will be  developed in order to gain significant efficiency savings and economies of  scale. From April 2009, the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s Warm Deal and central heating  programmes will be replaced by a new energy-assistance package, which will  provide a one-stop shop for tackling fuel poverty.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Of course I welcome today&rsquo;s package to tackle fuel poverty  in Northern Ireland,  but I must say that it has come around three months too late. As someone said  earlier, it has already been a very cold winter, and no doubt many people &mdash;  some very vulnerable people &mdash; have suffered because of fuel costs in recent  months.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">David Ford referred earlier to the extension of the warm  homes scheme, and I agree with him entirely. I know that other Members referred  to that as well. I have previously welcomed the decision to give the go-ahead  for the Titanic signature project. That will undoubtedly give much-needed work  to people in the construction industry.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">However, there are outstanding decisions to be made about  other projects. For example, what is happening with the Maze stadium project?  What is happening with the proposal to build a new policing college in Northern Ireland?  Decisions need to be made on those projects.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">In his pre-Budget speech, the Chancellor, Alistair Darling,  awarded an extra &pound;1 billion for social housing. Will Northern Ireland benefit from that  under the Barnett formula?</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I believe that it is important for the Executive to make  growing the economy a priority. However, I must admit that I am still deeply  concerned about the changes to the Start a Business programme in Northern Ireland.  That issue must be taken on board. Several small businesses have been created  already under that programme, and if we want to grow the economy, it is obvious  that the small-business sector will have an important part to play.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The people of Northern Ireland want and need  certainty. We do not want to repeat the debacle of the Executive not meeting  for some considerable time.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Purvis</strong>: I  must give the Executive credit for attempting to be creative in addressing some  of the very serious problems that the Province is facing. However, the  Executive and the Minister of Finance and Personnel appear to have applied most  of that creativity to the accounting that was done to allow for the generous  spending claims that were made today.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">It is not my job to massage the egos of Ministers; I think  that their respective party colleagues have done that very well already. My job  is to represent my constituents fairly and consistently, and that is what I  intend to do.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Today&rsquo;s announcements seem to have been fattened up  significantly through the re-announcement of programmes and spending that are  already under way. At least 14 programmes in today&rsquo;s announcements are already  under way, and at least four programmes will not apply until next year. Most  importantly, the Executive have offered a &pound;70 million promise: they are  spending money that they do not have. That type of creativity has serious  long-term consequences.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">We are told that this is a plan that is focused on aiding  social welfare, the well-being of citizens, local businesses and the economy. However,  it seems to be a provision for fuel credits, a plan for the construction  industry, a meeting with the banks, and a few more talking shops to consider  additional steps. I hope that the Ministers have more luck with the banks than  did the Committee for Finance and Personnel.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I do not mean to diminish the measures that were introduced  to address fuel poverty. It is good news that &pound;15 million of reallocated funds  will help to alleviate fuel poverty. Undeniably, that is the first place that  any available funds from the Government should go. However, not enough is being  done to address seriously that very real problem.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Restricting fuel credits to those who are on income support  and pension credit does not go far enough to meet the need that exists right now  in our society. It is a false consolation to include in today&rsquo;s statements the  reductions in electricity and gas tariffs when 70% of working households living  in fuel poverty rely on oil to heat their homes.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Two weeks ago, a single father raising four children came  into my constituency office. He is struggling to pay his bills; he qualifies  for incapacity benefit and receives child tax credit, which helps. However, it  is not enough to make ends meet, especially when, in common with most  households, he is still trying to cope with the recent rise in fuel and food  prices.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Families in which there are children and that do not  receive income support or pension credit do not qualify for the winter fuel  allowance. The definition of a vulnerable household needs to be expanded to  include those people with children, even when the children live with them only  part time.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">We know that Northern Ireland  has the highest level of fuel poverty in the UK, meaning that hundreds of  thousands of children are affected. We also know that in the long term,  improving the home environment saves the Government millions of pounds in  health costs.</p>
          <p class="TimePeriod">3.45 pm</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">It is right, and important, that the Assembly take the  initiative in expanding that safety net, particularly for those with children.  It has also been suggested that those funds will be administered by OFMDFM,  rather than by the Department for Social Development. I do not have clarity on  that, because the Minister of Finance and Personnel declined to respond when  asked that question directly this morning. Perhaps the deputy First Minister  will answer that question.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">It would be questionable, particularly on the grounds of  cost and efficiency, for OFMDFM to administer those funds. The Department for  Social Development manages the warm homes scheme and oversees winter fuel  payments, which suggests that it already has the infrastructure and experience  required for fuel-poverty programmes. The Executive are surely not so  small-minded as to play political games with such an important issue as fuel  poverty.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I question the timeliness and the efficacy of the  Executive&rsquo;s measures. Much of the spending is focused on the construction  industry, which will receive a direct financial response. I guess that the  assumption is that, once that industry is booming again, the benefits will  filter down into more jobs and employment. The effects of such trickle-down  thinking have been seen in the past, and they were not pretty.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Every other sector seems to get little more than a promise  of a meeting, consultation, or review. Small businesses suffering from  cash-flow and credit crises are being offered debt relief. The 40,000 &mdash; and growing  &mdash; applicants for social housing are offered nothing new, other than a reminder  that their situations will be considered.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Let Members not pretend that today&rsquo;s announcement is more  than it is &mdash; the most vulnerable remain vulnerable, and businesses that are  struggling to stay afloat remain in a difficult position.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member must bring her remarks to a close.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Purvis</strong>:  It must be ensured that support and relief is offered from the bottom up, and  not just the top down.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  There is no doubt that all Members understand the predicaments and problems  caused by the economic downturn. However, the Minister of Finance and  Personnel&rsquo;s statement at least gives some hope about how to address those  Province-wide issues.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The economic downturn is not a meltdown &mdash; that distinction  must be made. There is light at the end of the tunnel. The Assembly must ensure  that people do not get lost in the darkness and that they are helped until the  light becomes brighter.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Alan Greenspan said that the credit crunch is a  once-in-a-century &ldquo;credit tsunami&rdquo; that is devastating for many and  life-altering for most. However, the recovery of some countries indicates that  the damage can be repaired, that new life emerges, and that progress resumes.  The Assembly is working hard in order to ensure that those who suffer most and  are hit hardest receive help.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">On the issue of fuel poverty, a Northern Ireland house condition  survey in 2006 found that 34% of households were in fuel poverty. The  Minister&rsquo;s response today is to give an extra &pound;15 million for fuel poverty, and  to increase the number of households that will benefit from that money to  100,000. That is an excellent example of doing something now that personally,  practically and honestly affects people.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The profit made by oil companies is one of the problems  beyond the Assembly&rsquo;s control. In the first three months of this year, Shell  posted a profit of &pound;3&middot;9 billion. During the same period, BP&rsquo;s profits rose to  &pound;3&middot;31 billion. Therefore, profits that the oil companies made, and the direct  impact on everybody of the cost of oil and other fuel cannot be controlled by  the Assembly. However, moving forward a few months, on 13 October, the price of  oil had dropped to $77 a barrel. It is now down to $40 a barrel, and things are  starting to turn around.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the 10% decrease in the price of electricity, but  NIE could have done more. A 10&middot;8% drop after a year in which tariffs rose by  some 40% scratches the surface, rather than helps. Where are the extra profits  going? Are they going to shareholders as dividends, or to oil fat cats? I am  concerned that NIE has not sufficiently cut its prices.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Gas companies have reduced their prices by 20%.  That is one way to try to alleviate the problem.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the Minister of Finance and Personnel&rsquo;s statement  in which he mentioned that &pound;700,000 will be provided for the fishing industry.  I will be keen to see what affect that money will have, and I hope that it will  trickle down to each boat and their crews. At long last, Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  fishing industry can look to the Assembly and say that it has provided them  with something. For too long, fishermen have been the poor relations in the  Department of Agriculture. I also welcome the commitment from the Department of  Finance and Personnel to the children&rsquo;s fund, from which the Assembly can take  encouragement.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, I want to comment on a credit crunch seminar  in Ballymena last month to help companies to increase competitiveness and  profitability by focusing more on generating efficiencies and introducing  better processes. Specialist guidance was given at that seminar, which is a  vital survival tool in the current difficult economic climate.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Northern    Ireland businesses must place even greater  focus on increasing the value added to their products and services. I commend  the Minister of Enterprise,  Trade and Investment for jobs that have been created. Mrs Foster is doing  everything in her power to encourage business investment. Around &pound;16 million of  investment by US global medical-device manufacturer, Caridian BCT, has resulted  in 235 jobs that will be based in Larne, which is in Mr Ross&rsquo;s constituency.  That is good news. I hope that some of that prosperity will come down the  length of Strangford. A Member on the opposite Benches mentioned creative  industries. My area, Strangford, offers advantages for such industries.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Many good measures have been announced during the debate.  Let us welcome the December monitoring round and look forward to a better  future for the people of the Province.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Obviously, there has been some follow-on from the Minister of Finance and  Personnel&rsquo;s statement, as well as that of the First Minister. The motion calls  on the House to review the Executive&rsquo;s actions. The most telling thing that I  have seen so far has been the public disagreement between one Minister and her  colleagues. It appears that there are some difficulties to be overcome.  Perhaps, Mr Savage disagrees with me.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  He is tearing up your speech.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  He is tearing up my speech: absolutely. Thanks, George.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The real issue is that Northern Ireland needs a Government  of national unity, in which all political parties are represented around the  table. All leaders of major parties should be involved in order to reach  collective decisions. One might think that, surely, such a Government already  exist. However, that is not the case.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Ms Anderson said that people are fed up with squabbling.  That seems rather strange when, for 152 days, all that we saw was squabbling.  The nub of that dispute, if I understand it correctly, came down to respect for  the mandates of all people &mdash; not just those of the two big parties, but those  of the other parties as well. If it gets to the stage where there is no respect,  the Assembly must examine other forms of Government because it would be  apparent that a four-party mandatory coalition does not work. We will have to  see whether a two-party voluntary coalition would work any better.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Of course, there has been discussion about why it is  important to get together and deal with problems. People chide and chastise the  banks. I can tell you that while banks are many things, they are not stupid. If  they are not coming forward to do what people want them to do &mdash; to throw money  into loans, for example &mdash; there must be some reason for that. The reason is  probably worse than the problems that people currently face. I am extremely  worried that during the next 12 months, people will be hit by further massive  liabilities that have not yet been reported. I wonder whether Northern Ireland  has the financial strength to tackle those issues.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">As regards to why those issues must be tackled, Mr Buchanan  mentioned the health budget. I look at the education budget and I see a bid for  inescapable pressures of &pound;33 million. A paper that the Education Committee  received on the December monitoring round notes:</p>
          <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;even if funding is not secured for these purposes the  costs will be incurred and will have to be met from within existing resources&rdquo;.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Those pressures include funding for part-time youth  workers; the increased cost of cleaners; increased energy bills; job evaluation  for educational welfare officers; job evaluation for classroom assistants; and  teacher redundancy costs. We did get some money for maintenance, but we did not  get the money that is needed to deal with those issues. The paper that the  Department of Education&rsquo;s finance director sent to the Committee states that  without the capital funding, the Department will:</p>
          <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;slow down or temporarily halt work on some projects  at a time when there is already a significant pressure on the budget.&rdquo;</p>
          <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Some expenditure on projects that have already  started is going to stop.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I thank the Member for giving way, and I note his concerns about spend on education  and capital projects. Does the Member agree that there have already been  considerable stoppages? Work at three colleges in my constituency faces a  further delay &mdash; of a minimum of six months &mdash; on work should have been dealt  with in the current financial year. What has happened to the money?</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I assume that I will be given an extra minute in which to speak.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I am grateful to the Member, because I was about to come to  the issue that she raised. The issue is not about money; it is about the releasing  of money. Decisions must be made to ensure that money is made available. In  order to do something different to provide advice or support and to be a part  of this inclusive Government, we must make a radical attack on red tape. We  need to ensure that people make decisions quickly, and certain decision-makers  in the Civil Service must be taken to task.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">We must concentrate on education, training and planning.  The planning system was discussed earlier today. The simple fact is that  economic factors are not brought into planning decisions. The potential  creation of 1,000 jobs or other potential benefits is not factored into those  decisions. Decisions must be made by people on the fringes of policy. Money  that is currently earmarked for major projects &mdash; such as the John Lewis project  &mdash; will not be made available if we do not make decisions. Jobs will be lost  across the Province at a time when we can ill afford for that to happen.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Paisley Jnr</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I am sorry, but I do not have time.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">China  and India  are worried that their growth rates will fall below 8% and that they will face  civil insurrection. No one here mentions that peace and reconciliation seems to  have been forgotten. Who is going to build the future of our country? We need a  Government of national unity.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs McGill</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I welcome the statements that have  been made in the House today. I particularly welcome the unanimous agreement  about the statement on the December monitoring round and Executive business.  The theme of all politics is local, and I will continue with that theme.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the announcement of the &pound;15 million fuel-credit  package and the measures that are aimed at helping the construction industry.  However, I understand that the agricultural flooding hardship scheme will not  provide relief for people who have lost animals. I must register my  disappointment if that is, indeed, the case. People in my constituency have  lost sheep, and it is a major issue for them.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">A LeasCheann Comhairle a Member mentioned an anti-poverty  strategy earlier. We must be made aware of whether such a strategy will be  introduced. Earlier in the year, I attended a seminar that was held by the  Northern Ireland Anti-Poverty Network. Other Members were there too, including  Fred Cobain and Anna Lo, with whom I had a long conversation after the seminar.  At that time, I gave a commitment that I would raise the issue of tackling  poverty with the First Minister and the deputy First Minister.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">At that time, there were several negative comments.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I thank the Member for giving way. The Member mentioned the anti-poverty  strategy. However, the problem is that there is no such strategy. All Members  would be delighted if the Executive and the First Minister and deputy First  Minister produced that strategy.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member is allowed an extra minute for taking an intervention.</p>
          <p class="TimePeriod">4.00 pm</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs McGill</strong>:  Thank you, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Member for his intervention, and  I hope that an anti-poverty strategy will be introduced.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The indices show that my own area of West Tyrone suffers  from multiple deprivation. I hope that that is recognised during discussions.  The Executive&rsquo;s summary paper states:</p>
          <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;We have enhanced the Employment Service with 130 new  staff recruited to deal with rising unemployment and the search for new work.&rdquo;</p>
          <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That matter requires clarification. The jobs and  benefits office in Strabane will lose approximately 30 jobs. I know that  Minister Ritchie has a listening ear, and I am keen to discuss that issue with  her in the future. All politics is local, and job losses in Strabane &mdash; to  either Foyle or Omagh &mdash; should be addressed.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive&rsquo;s summary paper shows that &pound;83 million of  public-sector construction schemes are under way at eight further education  colleges. The Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister and the  Executive must consider that Strabane requires a newbuild further education  college. Some money has recently been allocated to that project, and I welcome  that development on behalf of the director of the North West Regional   College.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I note that, as part of the Department for Employment and  Learning (DEL) movement and capital grant, approximately &pound;3 million of funding  from the North West   Regional College  will be allocated to Stranmillis and the higher education sector. That &pound;3  million will, apparently, transfer to the higher education sector this year. Go  raibh maith agat.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Enterprise,  Trade and Investment (Mr Durkan)</strong>: I welcome the debate and support the  take-note motion. As Chairperson of the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Investment, I recognise  that not all the proposals included in the statement are new. As Dawn Purvis  said, not all of the measures are being implemented right away; some will be  introduced in the future. However, we recognise that that is the nature of such  measures.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Some of the provisions outlined in the announcement of the  Executive&rsquo;s position relate to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment. The Committee welcomes the Executive&rsquo;s continued commitment to help  people who are in debt and their commitment to increase funding to citizens  advice bureaux. I note the emphasis on action against loan sharks that is  planned for early 2009. It seems that part of that action will focus on  enforcement of the Consumer Credit Act 2006, which is, in essence, a devolved  matter. We must remember that fact if we intend to increase confidence that the  Assembly is maximising the leverage afforded by devolution.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">However, the Department&rsquo;s policy so far has been simply to  do things exactly on a par with GB and not to use our devolved power. In the  current circumstances, if we are serious about action &mdash; not just against loan  sharks but also against many high-street names that charge inordinate and  exorbitant rates of interest &mdash; we must consider whether we are using all the  tools that devolution has made available.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">In another place I am co-sponsoring a Private Members&rsquo; Bill  that would place a legal cap on the amount of interest that anyone can charge.  When one sees the rates of interest that some people are being charged,  particularly in the present situation, one&rsquo;s response is that there ought to be  a law against it. Between the powers available here and those elsewhere, we  should ensure that there are such laws.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the indications from the Minister of Finance and  Personnel and from the First Minister and the deputy First Minister about their  efforts to meet the banks. I hope that they do so not just on their own behalf  or on that of the Executive but on behalf of the entire Assembly. We all  recognise the need for the banks to achieve stability and liquidity, but that  is so that the banks can in turn share those with the rest of the economy,  particularly with hard-pressed businesses. However, that is not happening.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Members of the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Investment and I heard  directly from people in business who were at a loss to understand why their  borrowing rates are being increased when the headlines are about the decreasing  base rate. Of course, the banks say that they are no longer on the base rate  but are on the London  interbank offered rate (LIBOR), plus, plus, plus. I hope that the First  Minister and the deputy First Minister make clear to the banks what people are  saying about them. Banks in Northern Ireland &mdash; which are wholly owned  subsidiaries of banks in Britain &mdash; are not doing what their parent banks are  doing, but are going in the opposite direction. The main banks in Northern  Ireland are doing the same thing and telling customers that if they do not like  it they should go elsewhere &mdash; a &ldquo;let them eat cake&rdquo; attitude &mdash; and that is  leading many people to talk increasingly about a cartel. That needs to be  brought home to the banks. They may be able to avoid Committees of the  Assembly, but they cannot avoid the impression that is growing about how they  are conducting themselves.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome support for moves to ensure that credit unions  will be in a stronger position to provide a wider range of services. The  Committee for Enterprise,  Trade and Investment is working on that report &mdash; we will meet tomorrow to  finalise our recommendations &mdash; and hopes that Ministers will be able to take  that forward, here and with the Treasury.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">We also heard about the Economic Development Forum  subgroup, which can make recommendations in the present economic crisis &mdash; that  is a good thing. I also welcome indications that there is a cross-sectoral  forum, as the First Minister highlighted in his speech. It is important to  ensure that Government here has a direct feel for what is happening in the  economy. The accelerated support scheme amounting to &pound;5 million, which the  Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment announced, focuses on Invest NI  clients; however the Committee for Enterprise,  Trade and Investment wants that to be made available to other clients. Invest  NI clients represent only a small fraction of the business interests in this  community, so that needs to be extended. I welcome indications from the  Minister that she wants to consider that.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">We need to ensure that everyone who can help and support  business is enabled to do so, and that means that there must be real support  for Enterprise Northern Ireland,  not just using the means and channels of Invest NI. I endorse what Sean Neeson  said about the start-a-business programme. Earlier this year, the grant for  that programme was removed, as Invest NI and the Department claimed that it was  not needed. However, reports are coming from local economic agencies that that  loss of grant has made a real difference. We are not helping with economic  development if we are not helping people who are starting businesses and who  are supporting those who are doing so. That needs to be remedied.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I also hope that the Executive think about remedying the  removal of the integrated development fund. That decision was taken in the  context of the Budget and the Programme for Government. However, in the present  circumstances &mdash; in which people in different areas are trying to respond on a  cross-sectoral basis and trying to get Departments and local government to  create a response to the economic challenges that they face &mdash; now is the time  when we need an integrated development fund to help people. I hope that the  Executive will look again at those issues.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Speaking personally, I note the indications that were given  about the small-business rate-relief scheme. On top of the measures that are  already in place, what will result from those indications will be welcome. I  again ask the Executive to consider the whole issue of rates on vacant  property. I know that there is relief for vacant manufacturing properties, but  other businesses have found themselves stuck with vacant property that they  cannot let due to market conditions. They are being crippled with rate demands  at levels that they never experienced previously. That also needs to be  addressed.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Announcements were made today about reductions in energy  prices. The Committee will be tracking those further with the regulator and  others. As other Members said, we want to implement the recommendations that  were made in Douglas McIldoon&rsquo;s recent report about unlocking some of the costs  that are built in to our energy system.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">At a wider level, on top of the good-news announcements  that the Executive emphasised today, we must recognise that budget squeezes are  biting in Department after Department and at lower levels. For example, health  trusts are considering reducing numbers of nurses and maternity beds and  shutting children&rsquo;s and old people&rsquo;s homes. We need to remember the wider  context in which all of that is taking place.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member should draw his remarks to a close.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Enterprise,  Trade and Investment</strong>: We should take account of the totality of the  Executive&rsquo;s decisions when we measure who is helping in the downturn and who is  not.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Newton</strong>: I  preface my remarks by referring to Mr Basil McCrea&rsquo;s appeal for a &ldquo;Government  of national unity&rdquo; &mdash; whatever that is. I do not know why he feels that we do  not have unity, because the Executive are united in their approach to this  issue. Many of us remain unconvinced of his attitude to and skills in  decision-making and managing budgets.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Today is a good day for devolution in Northern Ireland.  The Executive have been responsive to needs right across the community and have  been in line with today&rsquo;s statements from the energy companies about the  reduction of energy costs and fuel-poverty issues that the Assembly has  addressed. It is certain that those matters would not even have been on the  radar of direct rule Ministers.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">In setting the Programme for Government, the Assembly  agreed the need to build for our future economic prosperity. The foundations  were laid upon the encouragement and development of our current business base.  We are a small-business economy &mdash; we do not have enough of the large  multinational, branded companies. An average business here pays only around  &pound;1,200 in rates each year. The small-business rate relief to be introduced in  2010 and the freeze on the business rate will offer those businesses the  opportunity to compete on a level playing field with their competitors in England and Scotland.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Deputy Speaker, I am grateful that you have allowed me  to speak at this stage in the debate, knowing that I was not here earlier. I  conclude by saying that the Assembly will never be satisfied &mdash; nor should it  ever be satisfied &mdash; by helping those who face hardship.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Newton</strong>:  No; I will not give way. The Executive, acting in concert, have addressed  outstanding issues. We are in a better place today than we were at the end of  last week.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy  Chairperson of the Committee for the Environment (Mr Boylan)</strong>: Go raibh  maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. The Committee considered recently the  Department of the Environment&rsquo;s submission for the December monitoring round.  Members are concerned that the Department of the Environment has submitted  easements of nearly &pound;500,000 due to delays in recruitment. Given the current  circumstances of our economic climate, the Committee believes that that should  not be allowed to happen.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">It is unacceptable on two counts. First, everyone is  acutely aware that hundreds of people are being made redundant and that many  more are worried about the security of their jobs in the longer term. Secondly,  the two areas in which the Department of the Environment (DOE) has failed to  appoint staff are in traffic enforcement and in fighting illegal waste-management  activities. The Environment Committee identified both those matters as being  hugely important priorities for the Department.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee has just spent weeks scrutinising the Goods  Vehicles (Licensing of Operators) Bill, and many members raised concerns about  the ability of the Department to enforce the new regulations that will emanate  from that Bill. In fact, several witnesses indicated that there is not so much  a need for new legislation as better enforcement of existing legislation.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Nevertheless, the Department has been unable to recruit  adequately to meet current needs, not to mention being unable to bring on board  the additional staff required to enforce any new laws.</p>
          <p class="TimePeriod">4.15 pm</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Similarly, the Committee heard much about the constraints  in which the Department has found itself when attempting to tackle illegal  waste activities, and about how more resources are needed. However, the  Department has been unable to spend the money that it asked for to put such  measures in place. Therefore, the Committee has called on the Department to  address those concerns, particularly taking note of its sensitivity about  underspend as a result of its failure to recruit during the present economic  downturn.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Nonetheless, some of those recruitment difficulties appear  to be due to procedural problems that lie outside of the Department&rsquo;s control,  so the Committee for the Environment urges the Department of Finance and  Personnel to urgently address those impediments so that, at least, Government  recruitment can be maximised quickly and efficiently, and so that all  Departments are able to achieve their recruitment needs and expectations within  the given timeframe.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, the Committee notes that a reduction in  anticipated planning applications has led to a departmental shortfall, in  respect of which it is bidding for more funding. The Committee acknowledges  that that is due, in part, to the economic downturn. However, given that the  planning guidance on development in the countryside should allow some movement  in that area, the Committee has asked the Department to confirm whether the  shortfall will be eased. Consequently, I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s confirmation.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Moving on from Budget matters, over the past several weeks,  the Committee has been made aware of other environmental opportunities that  could, and should, be considered during this time of economic pressure. For  example, members recently heard evidence from an organisation that  manufacturers sustainable, urban-drainage systems, and it was informed that  using semi-permeable paving and bricks in place of conventional products would  reduce the impact of flooding and protect water quality, without adding significantly  to costs. The Committee has sought more information about that, and it has  asked other Committees to investigate the extent to which their Departments are  considering that enterprising approach.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">During a recent presentation from the Carbon Trust, the  Committee was advised that reducing carbon emissions should not be  automatically considered a cost burden. The Carbon Trust has demonstrated to  many companies that there are economic advantages to reducing carbon  footprints, with large economic returns possible from small initial  investments. In addition, the trust advised the Committee that it has carried  out research that demonstrates that between 8,000 and 30,000 jobs could be  created by adopting a low-carbon economy. The Committee awaits further information  on that report; however, in the present economic downturn, the ability to  maximise companies&rsquo; efficiencies and increase employment opportunities, while  reducing carbon footprints, must be welcomed.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee concludes that reallocating DOE underspends  would have been unnecessary if the budget allocation for the recruitment  process had been better used. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: I welcome the debate, and I have listened intently to Members&rsquo;  contributions. I have no doubt that all Members wish to act on behalf of those  in our communities who are most in need, and in the interests of businesses,  including the construction industry. Moreover, we all acknowledge the uncharted  waters of the present global economic situation.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The debate has been wide ranging, as have the measures  taken by the Executive, which are designed to strengthen the local economy and  support the most vulnerable people in society, particularly pensioners and  households living in poverty. On several occasions, the Assembly has said that  present economic crisis is a real challenge to it, to communities and to  businesses &mdash; it is not amenable to a single, quick fix, and we should clear  from our heads any notion that it might be.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">In order to meet those challenges and to deliver for the  community, the Executive must act quickly, collectively and effectively. We  have sought to act in a way that will expedite money to those most in need. We  have attempted to build the maximum consensus on this matter, and we have acted  within limited means to alleviate hardship and bolster businesses, particularly  in the construction industry.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">We have set aside funds of &pound;44&middot;5 million to provide, among  other things: &pound;15 million fuel credit for families and pensioners who are at  most risk from fuel poverty; &pound;20 million for farm nutrient management; &pound;4  million for schools&rsquo; maintenance; &pound;2&middot;5 million for roads&rsquo; structural  maintenance; &pound;1&middot;8 million for public transport capital works; &pound;0&middot;5 million for  agriculture flooding hardship; and &pound;0&middot;7 million assistance to the fishing  industry. That investment in schools, roads and farms will have an immediate  impact on the local construction industry.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Another &pound;1&middot;2 billion worth of public-sector construction  schemes are currently on site. They provide much-needed employment and include:  &pound;440 million of Department for Regional Development projects; &pound;200 million in  the schools estate; &pound;83 million at eight further education colleges; and &pound;265  million in health estate construction.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">We have supported the local construction industry, and we  must ensure that we achieve the maximum benefit for local firms and local  communities. That is why the implementation of social procurement guidelines is  essential; we need to circulate every pound of spend through our communities.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">We have acted within the limits of our existing powers to  redress the impact of rising costs and the downturn in the global economy. We  have sought strategic interventions that will sustain us into the future.  However, we must recognise that the future is uncertain. We have faced an  unexpected series of incidences throughout the past year &mdash; many of which could  have had disastrous consequences &mdash; including flooding, bluetongue and the  recent events in pork production.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">As I said, we are in uncharted waters with regard to the  global economic climate. That is why we must be prepared; we must be able to  react, in a timely and effective way, to any crisis that might develop. That is  why we seek to accelerate legislation through the Assembly in January to develop  a rapid-response capacity to the current issue and others if and when they  arise. I hope that all Members will support that work.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">As Members will have heard, the Executive have not been  sitting on their hands on the issue. We have acted, and we intend to do more.  &ldquo;Action&rdquo; is the key word. We are aware of the need to deliver on the measures  that have been highlighted today in order to address the credit crunch and the  economic downturn, and we are well aware of the difficulties that households  and businesses face.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I very much welcome the comments that Danny Kennedy made,  as Chairperson of the Committee for the Office of the First Minister and deputy  First Minister. He indicated that his Committee is happy to work with us in  introducing urgently the legislation to provide a rapid-response capacity for  dealing with emergency and urgent situations as they arise. In order to build  the resilience that we need to effectively withstand unexpected crises that lie  ahead, we must have flexible and effective enabling legislation as well as  financial capacity.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Mitchel McLaughlin, as Chairperson of the Committee for  Finance and Personnel, said that we were required to improve our  financial-management systems and processes. He talked about the almost habitual  scenario in which Departments end the financial year with significant  public-expenditure underspend. It is my strong view that any Department that  ends this year with material underspend will have many questions to answer and  explanations to provide. Mitchel was not the only Member who raised that issue;  quite a few Members mentioned it.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Edwin Poots mentioned that NIE must review its prices early  next year. The managing director of NIE recently said:</p>
          <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;if, as we hope, lower fuel costs are realised, NIE  Energy will pass on the benefit to customers as soon as we can.&rdquo;</p>
          <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">We can all endorse that view.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Fred Cobain said that support for debt advice, to which the  First Minister referred, was not enough. I am advised that from 1 April 2009,  Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment funding for face-to-face debt  advice will double to &pound;800,000 for the next two years. In addition, a further  &pound;200,000 will be provided to introduce a new telephone debt-advice service.  That will bring annual spending on debt advice to &pound;1 million. That is a  significant increase in funding in response to the increase in demand for the  service.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Barry McElduff mentioned the availability of broadband,  particularly in rural areas. I am advised that broadband services delivered by  a number of different technologies are available to anyone who chooses to  purchase the service.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Barry McElduff, Alastair Ross and a number of other Members  mentioned the need for banks and lending institutions to adopt a constructive  attitude to dealing with debt &mdash; whether personal or business loans. I endorse  that view, and it will be a central point in our discussions with the banks.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Barry McElduff talked also about creative industries. I am  sure that I speak on behalf of all Members when I congratulate Eoghan Quigg on  his magnificent performance in coming third on &lsquo;The X Factor&rsquo; on Saturday  night. He is 16 years old and is a shining example of a young person who has  put his best foot forward and has done so in a positive manner that has shown  the young people of the North and this island in a good light.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Sean Neeson welcomed the announcement on the Titanic  signature project and asked what had become of the Maze/Long Kesh projects. It  takes time to make decisions on such major projects, because it is important to  ensure that we achieve the best outcome for all. Members should note that we  have approved a &pound;3&middot;5 million second-stage remediation programme, which is  essential to prepare the site for future use.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">This afternoon, departmental underspends were talked about  inside and outside the Chamber. Every quarter, Departments that have underspent  will submit money for reallocation to other projects. In the current monitoring  round, the Department for Social Development surrendered &pound;39 million. That,  together with moneys from other Departments, was reallocated to redress  hardship and aid the construction industry. That reallocation was agreed,  without dissent, at this morning&rsquo;s Executive meeting.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Basil McCrea read out the list of expenditure bids that  were not met. However, we all recognise that decisions relating to public  spending &mdash; particularly given a limited budget &mdash; are always difficult. Many  pressures emerge, and most of them relate to issues of great merit. However,  our role is to set priorities and manage our Budget. The Education Minister is  sitting beside me, and I am sure that she experiences as much pain and  difficulty with budgetary issues as any other Minister does, but I do not hear  her squealing and roaring about it. She comes to the Executive meetings, fights  her corner, recognises that there is a limited Budget and &mdash; along with everyone  else &mdash; plays as a team member.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">There will be more financial pressures in the years ahead,  and that is why we want to ensure that we reinforce the resilience and  flexibility of our financial systems and our legislative powers to respond to  new crises.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">Claire McGill talked about the Social Security Agency. The  agency is consulting on a strategic business review, which proposes that  front-office services will remain in Strabane, but back-office services may be  relocated across the western district.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">A number of other issues were raised by Members, and I have  referred already to Danny Kennedy&rsquo;s contribution. The debate had a positive and  constructive tone and mood, and it is obvious that Members realise that today&rsquo;s  announcement is important and is one that will have a positive effect.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">However, it is unfortunate that at a time such as this,  some Members will take the opportunity to snipe. Dolores Kelly talked about  water charges and about what the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in had said about them. I was a  member of the Executive at the beginning of the decade &mdash; at the beginning of  the century. The first time that I heard about water charges was when David  Trimble, S&eacute;amus Mallon and Mark Durkan brought them to the Executive. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">I am not saying that to score political points. They  brought those issues to the Executive against a background in which, they said,  the Treasury was waving a big stick at them and was telling them that it would  come down on their Executive like a ton of bricks if they did not deal with the  issues at hand.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  Are you going to introduce them?</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: The point that I am making is that the first time that I heard  mention of water charges was during my time as Minister of Education: when Mark  Durkan, S&eacute;amus Mallon and David Trimble brought the matter to the Executive.</p>
          <p class="TimePeriod">4.30 pm</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Will all Members please make their remarks through the Chair?</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: Dolores Kelly&rsquo;s comment about Sinn F&eacute;in and the DUP misses the  point completely. Recently, those two parties have done something that the SDLP  said that they would never do. After we began working together, the SDLP kept  telling people that it would never last and that it would fall apart. The past  five months have been difficult, but there is no prospect of the Executive  falling apart. The job and responsibility of every Member of the Executive,  even those who are the sole representatives of their party, is to play a team  role. If we play together as a team, we will be much more effective. All  Members should recognise that we face huge challenges as we move forward.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">My friend and former First Minister Ian Paisley Snr made a  positive and constructive speech on the need to govern ourselves in a way that  delivers for the people whom we represent. When I worked with him in the Office  of the First Minister and deputy First Minister, he showed himself to be wise  about how to proceed in the future, regardless of the past &mdash; and the Assembly  will, of course, talk ad infinitum about the past. He is well on in years, but  he is focused not on the past, but on how to move forward into the future, and  he made a positive contribution today.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">The debate was exceptionally wide-ranging, and many of  Members&rsquo; comments will be helpful as we progress. The current economic downturn  will not last for ever; it will pass. The Assembly must emerge from it with a  stronger economy and a more prosperous community. To accomplish that, however,  we must not focus only on the credit crunch. To underpin the economic  prospects, the Assembly must look beyond the next six to 12 months and  concentrate on delivering the Budget, the Programme for Government and the  investment strategy. Those are intrinsically linked, and, together, they  represent the Executive&rsquo;s strategic plan. The Executive&rsquo;s priorities focus on:  growing a dynamic, innovative economy; promoting tolerance, inclusion, health  and well-being; protecting and enhancing the environment and natural resources;  investing to build the infrastructure, and delivering modern high-quality and  efficient public services.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">It is also important to meet the Taoiseach, Brian Cowen, at  the earliest opportunity to discuss the economic downturn across the island and  explore how the two Governments can co-operate, on the basis of mutual benefit,  to generate economic activity and alleviate hardship.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">A LeasCheann Comhairle, the measures that have been  outlined today are the correct ones to address the economic downturn, and they  represent all that the Executive can do to support the economy during this  difficult time. Aimed at addressing the immediate impacts of the downturn in  the short term, the measures are consistent with the Programme for Government  and its longer-term aims.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyText">In uncertain times, the Executive do not know what next  year will bring. However, we know that we will require flexibility to act, and  the Executive and Assembly must act collectively for all of the people. We must  effectively redress hardship and build the economy. With our collective will  and ability, we can meet any challenge that is thrown at us and deliver a  community in which wealth is created and shared. Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat</p>
          <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
          <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly takes note of the measures taken by the  Executive to strengthen the local economy and support those most vulnerable in  society against the impact of the global economic downturn.</p>
          <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I wish everyone a very happy Christmas.</p>
          <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Adjourned at 4.34 pm.</p>
