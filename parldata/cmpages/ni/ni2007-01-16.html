		  	<p class="H2DocumentDate">Tuesday 16 January 2007</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The Assembly met at 10.30 am (Madam Speaker in the  Chair).</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Members observed two minutes&rsquo; silence.</p>
		  	<p class="H3SectionHeading">Private Members&rsquo; Business</p>
		  	<p class="H4StageHeading">Social Disadvantage and <br>
		  		Educational Attainment</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  The Business Committee has agreed to allow two hours for each of today&rsquo;s  debates: <span style="letter-spacing:-.05pt; ">the Member moving each motion will  have 15 minutes, </span>with a further 15 minutes for the winding-up speech.  All other Members who wish to speak will have a maximum of 10 minutes.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Two amendments have been selected and published on the Marshalled List. They will be moved in the  order in which they appear on the list. When the debate is <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt; ">concluded, I shall put the question that each  amendment</span> be made in turn. If that is clear, I shall proceed.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
		  	<p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly recognises the link between social  disadvantage and educational attainment and recognises the sterling work of  educationalists in addressing this situation; and further calls on an incoming  Executive to develop a strategic approach to raising the attainment levels for  the most disadvantaged in our society.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Go raibh maith agat, a  Cheann Comhairle. Ba mhaith liom an r&uacute;n seo a mholadh, agus t&aacute; &aacute;thas orm  &eacute; a chur os comhair an Tion&oacute;il.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">I note that two separate amendments have been tabled; I am  happy to accept both, because they add substance to the original motion.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">First and foremost, I  call on the Assembly to acknow-ledge the direct link between social  disadvantage and educational attainment. The Department of Education&rsquo;s business  plan for 2006-07 concedes that those from disadvantaged  backgrounds do not gain the full benefits of education. The anti-poverty  and social exclusion strategy &lsquo;Lifetime Opportunities&rsquo; concurs, stating that:</p>
		  	<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Research shows that chances of escaping from poverty  are greatly improved by educational attainment. Therefore the focus is and will  remain on breaking the link between poverty and educational underperformance.&rdquo;</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">An interesting point was raised at a seminar organised by  the Association of Teachers and Lecturers (ATL) in Grosvenor House on Friday  last. There was a debate on whether there was such a thing as a good school or  a bad school.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Would it be in order to regulate the clock in order to  guide me through my 15 minutes?</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brolly</strong>:  Your time is up.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  My time is up, according to Francie Brolly.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">A spokesperson for NASUWT (The National <span style="letter-spacing:-.2pt; ">Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women  Teachers)</span> <span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt; ">said that there was no  such thing as a bad school, but that</span> there was such a thing as a school  with large numbers of children from socially disadvantaged backgrounds. That  was a very interesting statement.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Educational  disadvantage starts from an early age &mdash; often by the time children reach  primary school. The strongest predictors of an individual&rsquo;s educational  attainment level &mdash; class background, parental income levels and social and  economic background as a key barrier to  social mobility &mdash; have long been recognised.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Social disadvantage, as experienced by children in education, operates at many different levels.  Household income, presently  represented in the North by entitlement to free school meals, has been  shown consistently to be a significant determinant of educational outcomes.  There is a direct correlation between free school meal entitlement and average  GCSE score, according to research carried  out by Ian Shuttleworth and Peter Daly. In one particular survey, it was found that those entitled to  free school meals achieved an average GCSE score of 34&middot;8%, while those not  entitled to free school meals achieved an average GCSE score of 52&middot;5%.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">At school, disadvantage is shown by the percentage of  children from lower-income families and socially deprived areas. I draw the  attention of Members to an answer given by Maria Eagle on 11 January to my  colleague Sammy Wilson, a Member for East Antrim. He had asked how many  children from Protestant and Catholic family backgrounds left school with fewer  than five GCSE qualifications at grades A to C in the last year for which  figures were available. The answer was as follows:</p>
		  	<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The requested information relates to the 2004-05  school year and is as follows: (a) 4,232 (39.3 per cent of Protestant school  leavers) (b) 4,566 (35.9 per cent of Roman Catholic school leavers).&rdquo;</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">In the North, then, there were almost 9,000  children leaving school without five GCSEs.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">There is the famous example of the small percentage &mdash;  despite the very best efforts of the teachers &mdash; of children from controlled  schools in the Shankill area of Belfast who tend to pass the transfer test and  progress to third-level education. I emphasise that there is no such thing as a  bad school. Unionist political leaders should show more leadership in helping  to address the issue. That is the message that we consistently pick up from  educationalists in that area.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">In September 2000, a report by Tony Gallagher and Alan  Smith &mdash; &lsquo;The Effects of the Selective System of Secondary Education in Northern Ireland&rsquo; &mdash; investigated the  11-plus and the link between social disadvantage and educational attainment,  and it showed that children of parents who could afford coaching and home  tuition, in a pleasant home environment conducive to study, were better placed  to do well in the transfer test.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Gallagher and Smith&rsquo;s report stated that:</p>
		  	<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Our evidence suggests that parents pay up to &pound;15 per  coaching session.&rdquo;</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">It further stated that teachers feel that there is  an unfairness in the procedure &mdash;</p>
		  	<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;&hellip; compounded by the fact that not all parents are  able to afford out-of-school coaching.&rdquo;</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Inequality is therefore present at the personal level, at  school level and at the third level. Research from Patrick Clancy of University  College Dublin, written in 2001 and entitled &lsquo;College Entry in Focus: A Fourth  National Survey of Access to Higher Education&rsquo;, confirms that there is a huge  gap between access levels to third-level education in the Twenty-six Counties.  He found that while 70% of students in fee-paying schools went on to third  level, only 38% of vocational school students did so. It is also clear that  that situation did not improve greatly during the recent economic boom and, in  some respects, even worsened. Participation rates within third level in some  working-class areas of Dublin, such as Dublin 11, which is Finglass and  Ballymun, and Dublin 22, which is Clondalkin, already among the lowest in the  state, fell by 3% between 1992 and 1998, when participation rates in  third-level institutions were generally rising by 6%.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Educationalists are working hard at all of that, but they  need support and help. I want Members to note that education takes place not  only in formal settings, but at home and in the community. Educationalists  involved in early childhood education have described as &ldquo;a mental wasteland&rdquo;  the early developmental and educational experiences of some very young children  in disadvantaged circumstances.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">The great problem in all of that is that the con-sequences  in later life of low educational attainment are significant and central to  maintaining the cycle of deprivation and poverty. Low attainment can lead to  unemployment and worklessness; and the cycle continues. To reinforce the point  that there is a direct link between educational attainment and social  deprivation, I draw Members&rsquo; attention to a study undertaken by the New Policy  Institute, produced with support from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, which  draws on the latest available data to monitor indicators of poverty and social  exclusion. It highlights many statistics regarding educational attainment. I  will not cite those statistics now, but I direct the attention of Members to  that study.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Educationalists, as I have said, work extremely hard to  help disadvantaged pupils to achieve. I know this to be the case, for it was  brought home to me at a seminar in Dundalk, where there were representatives  present from Sinn F&eacute;in, the SDLP, the Ulster Unionist Party, the DUP, the  Alliance Party, Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Labour Party. It was an excellent  initiative, taken by a number of school principals under the auspices of the  Primary Principals&rsquo; Association. It addressed the link between educational  attainment and social disadvantage. There I discovered that teachers deserve  every support because they themselves are highly motivated in very difficult  circumstances. I heard a story from a school in inner-city Dublin: a female  teacher had occasion to open the schoolbag of a pupil and found a syringe in  the schoolbag. I also heard stories from loyalist areas of Belfast of how, in  recent times, feuding between loyalist groups impacted hugely on schools. It is  difficult in such environments for educationalists to do their work.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">In rural communities too, distance from essential services  is an indicator of poverty, and I acknowledge the great work that  educationalists do in these circumstances.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">The Executive &mdash; no, I will be an optimist and say the  &ldquo;incoming&rdquo; Executive &mdash; must develop a strategic approach to raising attainment  levels for the most disadvantaged in society. That should be a constant theme  and an identified priority. There must be a demonstrable and real determination  to tackle inequality and place that at the centre of education policy and  planning. The Department of Education and the incoming Executive must focus on  that.</p>
		  	<p class="TimePeriod">10.45 am</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">There must be significant increases in funding. Concerted,  targeted action will be needed to impact positively on the quality of the  education experience in the areas of greatest social need and in traditionally  marginalised groups, such as Irish Travellers, people with disabilities and  those from ethnic minorities. That money must be targeted. It is not a matter  of making a few million pounds available to trickle down as &pound;5,000 here and  &pound;5,000 there: there must be real investment.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">The Department of Education must be directed to consult  beyond the normal suspects, such as education and library boards and sectoral  providers. We should seek to include  individuals from trade union backgrounds and non-governmental organisations.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Not every Member is a supporter of the civic forum concept,  as I am. Provision was made in the Good Friday Agreement for an all-Ireland  consultative civic authority or body. The Civic Forum produced a good report on  social disadvantage and educational attainment that would be worth revisiting,  even for those Members who might be sceptical about the value of hearing what  civic society has to say.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">There must be creative thinking. It will be the Executive&rsquo;s  business to ensure that there is cross-cutting relevance of departmental  responsibility.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>: I normally would, Mervyn, but I have only two minutes left. I  have a substantial conclusion to make, so, in this instance, I will not give  way.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">I call for an integrated approach to address the environmental and social factors impacting on  children&rsquo;s ability. Sure Start is an excellent initiative and needs to  be resourced properly. It is making a difference, and it must be expanded in  the crucial area of earliest possible intervention and strategies, so that  children can gain the full benefit of the initiative as they move forward into  formal education.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">We need improved working arrangements between education &mdash;  both the voluntary and statutory sectors &mdash; social services, health and housing.  How, otherwise, will we reduce illiteracy and innumeracy, which are so  prevalent? Do Members need reminding of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC)  report at Westminster on improving the levels of numeracy and literacy and how  it should be tackled?</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">How will we lift up the expectations of communities blighted by deprivation without an integrated  approach? We should be serving the educational interests of the child &mdash; every child, not just those from more  advantaged backgrounds. There is a direct link between social  disadvantage and educational attainment. Our educationalists are doing a great  job and doing their best, but they need support. That support will come in the form of political will and major investment.  Although the Department of Education has a list of reform initiatives  aimed at addressing this issue, the Executive and  all of the relevant Departments must work together. Go raibh m&iacute;le maith  agat, a Cheann Comhairle.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  I beg to move amendment No 1: At end insert</p>
		  	<p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;, including an investigation of the reasons why this link  exists, and to implement effective existing and new measures to address this  problem.&rdquo;</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Is ceist ollmh&oacute;r &eacute;  seo, agus is &eacute; an d&uacute;shl&aacute;n is m&oacute;, b&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir, at&aacute; romhainn i gc&uacute;rsa&iacute; oideachais sa taobh seo t&iacute;re. Molaim an  Comhalta &oacute; Iarthar Th&iacute;r Eoghain agus f&aacute;ilt&iacute;m roimh an chinneadh s&rsquo;aige glacadh  leis an d&aacute; leas&uacute;, n&oacute; ceapaim go gcuireann siad tuilleadh nirt leis an r&uacute;n.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">This issue is perhaps the biggest challenge facing  education in Northern Ireland. I congratulate the Member for West Tyrone on  moving the motion, and welcome the fact that he has agreed to the two  amendments, as they both add strength to the motion.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Research clearly shows that there is a link between social  disadvantage and educational underachievement. Low educational attainment is a  result of social deprivation. Therefore, if  we are to address the problem of low educational achievement, we must  also address social deprivation. Attempting to address educational attainment without taking cognisance of, and  addressing, social deprivation could be likened to addressing the  symptoms without trying to address the root cause.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Only 37% of school-leavers from the most deprived areas  leave with five or more GCSEs; the Northern Ireland  average is 61%. The skills base in neighbourhood renewal areas also  compares unfavourably when measured against the rest of Northern Ireland, with  only 28% of people from age 16 to pensionable age qualified to level 2. The Northern Ireland average is 45%.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Social deprivation is a complex problem with many different  elements. Several key background variables are associated with the impact of  social deprivation on educational attainment. These include: pupils&rsquo; personal  characteristics; prior attainment; gender; health; low income; parental  unemployment; housing conditions; family  size; fluency in English; availability of stimulating reading materials  in the home; parental interest; and involvement in, and encouragement of,  literacy and numeracy. There are also local factors such as the attitude of the  local community and peer groups to education and its value, and the feelings of  alienation and social exclusion felt by many.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">A report into the Northern Ireland literacy strategy, which was carried out on behalf of the Northern  Ireland literacy steering group and published in October 2006,  illustrated substantial research on the neighbourhood effects on educational  attainment.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Tests for the existence of the effects on educational  attainment of 2,500 young people in Scotland found significant negative effects  linked to deprivation in the home and neighbourhood and educational attainment.  The study concluded that policies to alleviate educational disadvantage cannot  focus on schooling alone but must form part of a broader initiative to tackle  social deprivation in society at large.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">It is now generally accepted that the children who face the  greatest obstacles to raising attainment are those who come from a  disadvantaged family, live in a disadvantaged neighbourhood or attend a school  with many disadvantaged children. Over 102,000 children in Northern Ireland  live in poverty. That gives an idea of the scale of the problem.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">If social deprivation, as one of the major causes of  educational underachievement, is not addressed as part of a coherent strategy,  it will simply ensure that the vicious circle of underachievement continues  unabated into the next generation. The  Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister&rsquo;s  anti-poverty strategy makes that point about poverty itself.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Reviewing the factors that account for the variance in educational attainment, it is evident that  combinations of social disadvantage powerfully affect performance, with  a variation of up to 75% among schools in attain-ment by 16-year-olds at GCSE  associated with pupil intake factors. It is important that we research the  influence that those, and other factors, have on educational attainment. We must  formulate policy and strategy to change attitudes and raise awareness about the  role and value of education to the individual and to provide parents and  communities with the resources and skills to change attitudes locally and to  support the efforts of teachers and other educationalists in tackling the  problem.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Tackling the multiple deprivation factors that have  persisted in many areas for decades is a priority of the anti-poverty strategy. Education has a major role  to play in that process, not only through the formal education system, but in the home and community. The  Department of Education&rsquo;s role should be taken forward in con-junction with the Department of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety, the Department for Social Develop-ment and  the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Academic selection has further compounded the problem.  Research by Gallagher and Smith highlights that academic selection tends to  produce:</p>
		  	<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;a disproportionate number of schools which combine  low ability and social disadvantage in their enrolments, thereby compounding  the educational disadvantages of both factors.&rdquo;</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">School factors can raise the levels of educational  attainment, sometimes by as many as 14 GCSE points for average pupils. Hence,  schools are a good place to improve children&rsquo;s skills. However, a strategy that  focuses solely on the improvement of average school performance is likely to be  a less effective means of reducing educational underachievement than one that  additionally includes communities, families, teachers and educationalists in a  cross-cutting departmental approach that also addresses the causes of social  deprivation.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">There is a broad consensus that intervention in the early  years is among the most effective means of improving educational performance  and outcomes. Such interventions are likely to be an important facet of  strategies that help to lift children out of cycles of deprivation and on to  positive pathways. Promising evidence suggests that well-designed programmes  are successful in raising levels of educational attainment and creating further  positive outcomes in later adult life. The most successful programmes are  defined by early and intensive intervention and include a follow-through  component in the later stages of the child&rsquo;s development.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">The Nobel laureate in economic sciences, Dr James J Heckman  states that:</p>
		  	<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Investments in social policies that intervene in the  early years have very high rates of return while social policies that intervene  at later stages in the life cycle have low economic returns. A large body of  scientific evidence shows a &ldquo;persistent pattern of strong effects&rdquo; derived from  early interventions. Significantly, these substantial, long-term benefits are  not necessarily limited to intellectual gains, but are most clearly seen by  measures of &ldquo;social performance&rdquo; and &ldquo;lifetime achievement&rdquo;. In other words,  people who participate in enriched early childhood programmes are more likely  to complete school and much less likely to require welfare benefits, become  teen parents or participate in criminal activities. Rather, they become  productive adults.&rdquo;</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">In general, research  studies suggest that, in comparison to having no pre-school experience,  all forms of pre-school experience have a positive impact on the levels of  attainment in national assessment tests taken at age seven. In addition,  pre-school attendance has been found to improve school commitment, reducing the  risk of disaffection and delinquency during later schooling. However, the  quality of that provision is a significant determinant of the effects on  educational attainment. High-quality provision involves small groups of  children, high adult-child ratios, a balanced curriculum and well-trained  staff.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">As the Member for West Tyrone Mr McElduff mentioned, all  Members are aware that the Northern Ireland  Audit Office (NIAO) report &lsquo;Improving Literacy and Numeracy in Schools&rsquo;  and the House of Commons Committee of Public  Accounts report &lsquo;Improving literacy and numeracy in schools (Northern  Ireland)&rsquo; &mdash;</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  Will the Member draw his remarks to a close, please?</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  &mdash; show that there are serious problems with the current literacy and numeracy  strategy. I will not go through all the points made in that report, but  conclude by saying that the Department of  Education has undertaken to carry out a review of the strategy. The  opportunity should be taken to include any new strategy &mdash;</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  Mr Bradley, I must ask you to finish.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  &mdash; and any strategy that attempts to address educational attainment without  tackling the underlying social deprivation at the same time will be doomed to  failure. Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle.</p>
		  	<p class="TimePeriod">11.00 am</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText"><strong>Mr McCausland: </strong>I beg to move amendment No 2:<strong> </strong>At  end insert</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText"><span style="font-size:8.0pt; ">&ldquo;The Assembly also notes the  recent report on &lsquo;Improving literacy and numeracy in schools&rsquo; in Northern  Ireland by the House of Commons Committee of Public Accounts; and calls on the  Department of Education to fully fund and implement an effective literacy and  numeracy strategy; and further calls for the setting up of Education Action  Zones in areas of high educational disadvantage.&rdquo;</span></p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Across much of Northern Ireland our educational performance  is high. Our system produces some of the best-qualified and educated young  people in the United Kingdom. However, it is also true that there are  significant areas of low educational attainment and disadvantage. It is  imperative that special attention be given to the children and schools in  communities where low educational attainment exists.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">The Member for West  Tyrone, Mr McElduff, referred specifically  to the levels of disadvantage in the Shankill area and called for the  area&rsquo;s politicians to give leadership. In response, I point out that those of  us who represent that area have been giving leadership, and my colleague from  West Belfast will speak presently on that.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">In fact, with regard to education, it is an area that I am  particularly interested in having spent my teaching career in the Shankill area  during the 70s and early 80s. Furthermore, having sat for many years on various  schools&rsquo; boards of governors in those areas, I am familiar with the situation.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, when it comes  to advising people, perhaps the Member for West Tyrone should give  advice to colleagues from his own party on  the Belfast Education and Library Board, so that when we propose that  there be a more equitable allocation of resources so that areas such as the  Shankill get their fair share, his colleagues will not vote against that.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCausland</strong>:  No, because my time is quite limited.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">When one realises that the Belfast Educational and Library  Board spends only a few hundred pounds on youth services in areas such as lower  Shankill, where there are large numbers of young people, and greater  Ballysillan, where several thousand young people live, while approximately  &pound;80,000 is spent on an adjacent community, one realises that this is not a  matter of objective need, but rather of disadvantage and discrimination.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">It is right to highlight the commitment and dedication of  the teachers in the schools, but often their task is made more difficult by  decisions that are taken elsewhere. Having spoken to teachers in many schools  and visited them on a regular basis, I cannot adequately express the  appreciation that they deserve for their commitment and dedication. However,  their task is often made more difficult by decisions made elsewhere, particularly in the Department of  Education.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Quite often, decisions are made without properly consulting those who are actually teaching and  working in the communities; they are the people who have a better  insight into what is needed. The task of teachers and especially of principals  in areas of educational disadvantage is often made harder by an ad hoc approach  to tackling educational disadvantage.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">For example, instead of  a coherent approach to funding schools, principals are faced with a  plethora of extra funding packages outside their core funding, with different  criteria, mechanisms, timescales and accounting rules to draw down the money.  The end result is that, while the resources are welcome, they may not be as  effectively used as they might be. The system increases the administrative  demands on principals already overstretched and under pressure, so if the  Department of Education simply carried out its work in a more effective and  systematic way, it could relieve some of the pressures on the principals and  teachers in those schools, thereby freeing up more time for principals to deal  with educational issues instead.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">All children deserve a good start in life, and we have a  responsibility to ensure that everything possible is done towards that  objective. However, 20% of children leave school in Northern Ireland without  achieving the required standard in numeracy and literacy. We talk about  educational disadvantage and underachievement, but numeric and literary skills  are essential for life. We need to understand why the problems arise and the  factors that contribute to them.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP&rsquo;s amendment is, therefore, valuable; it proposes  that there should be a full investigation into the core issue of why the link exists. Unless the problem is known, there is no chance of solving it. It is  important to identify the factors.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">It is about more than simply financial disadvantage; it is  about community and family issues, aspirations, ambitions, role models and the  value that communities and societies place on education. All those factors feed  into the difficulties that arise in these communities. Identifying the problems  is, therefore, an initial and important step.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">We also need a coherent  and comprehensive strategy to address the situation and resolve the  problems. That must be a sustained strategy, rather than one that lasts for 18  months or two years. To turn a community or a problem around is often a 10-year  process.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">There is a link between social disadvantage and educational disadvantage. My amendment proposes  that:</p>
		  	<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The Assembly also notes the recent report on  &lsquo;Improving literacy and numeracy in schools&rsquo; in Northern Ireland by the House  of Commons Committee of Public Accounts&rdquo;.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That report was published in November 2006. The  amendment calls on the Department of Education to address this issue and to:</p>
		  	<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;fully fund and implement an effective literacy and  numeracy strategy; and &hellip; for the setting up of Education Action Zones in areas  of high educational disadvantage.&rdquo;</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) report notes that  literacy and numeracy are key skills and that children who do not acquire an  appropriate level of competence in those skills are seriously disadvantaged,  possibly for the rest of their lives. The report highlights underachievement  among boys, which constitutes a cultural challenge. It urges the Department to  give particular attention to the worrying  performance of boys in the Belfast Education and Library Board area.  Educational underachievement is a widespread problem. However, it is  particularly acute among boys in inner-city areas. There is a higher level of  achieve-ment among girls. The reasons for that disparity must be identified and  tackled.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">The report also highlights the evidence it received that:</p>
		  	<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;among socially deprived communities in Belfast,  significant differences between Protestant and Roman Catholic children exist in  GSCE English and Mathematics &hellip; This raises a concern that children in  Protestant working-class areas may not be enjoying equal educational  opportunities.&rdquo;</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">This issue comes through strongly in the report.  The problem is across the board; it is more acute among boys than girls; and it  is particularly acute in Protestant areas &mdash; especially among boys in  working-class Protestant areas.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">The differential in  educational disadvantage between Protestant and Roman Catholic  communities, even where there are similar levels of social disadvantage, was  also highlighted in the report of the Government&rsquo;s Taskforce on Protestant  Working Class Communities. At the time of its publication, much attention was  focused on the actions that were to follow from it. It was remiss of society  not to pick up on the core problem of educational disadvantage in those areas,  as highlighted in that report and in the PAC report.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">The differential is influenced by more than the deprivation  that is measured by the Noble indices. There are social factors that are almost  impossible to measure, such as the value that a community or society places on  education and the nature of the relationship between communities and schools.  Those are complex problems that demand a comprehensive approach.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">The PAC report goes on to say that the Department of Education is the lead body for education and,  therefore, has a responsibility to ensure that an effective literacy and  numeracy strategy is properly resourced and implemented. We must acknowledge  the report because it is strong and specific in its criticisms and  recommendations. When it appeared in November 2006, it did not receive the publicity  that it should have. It would be remiss of the Assembly not to take this  opportunity to draw attention to the report and to call on the Department of  Education to respond to it in a meaningful and effective way.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>: The link between social disadvantage and poor educational  attainment is, regrettably, clear and unambiguous. However, the failure of  society to reverse the extent of social disadvantage &mdash; which, in turn, contributes to poor levels of educational  attainment &mdash; is not a problem that is unique to Northern Ireland, nor  should it be used as an excuse. That problem is common throughout the United  Kingdom, and some people, therefore, do not believe that it is a priority that  must be dealt with. Correspondingly, it should be acknow-ledged that the problem of poor educational  achievement cannot and should not be laid at the feet of academic  selection, which is used in Northern Ireland, or blamed on the non-selective  system used in other parts of the United Kingdom.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">I wonder whether the motion, which quite rightly commends  the work of teachers, is entirely fair in calling for a strategic educational  approach as the central means for raising academic achievement. Are we part of  an enabling process? Are we more likely to get closer to the solution by  seeking strategic approaches and investigations on the causes of social  disadvantage and the impact that social deprivation has on children who are  preparing for the first day when they enter a learning environment? Without  such an enabling process, there is no doubt that children will &mdash; and do &mdash;  suffer.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">I believe that a child&rsquo;s preparation for school begins at home, under parental influence. That influence  endures through partnership between parents and teaching professionals  during the child&rsquo;s school life. I do not accept any rule of thumb or social  measure that states that, because a child is not from an upwardly mobile  background, or has unemployed parents, or has a single parent, or receives free  school dinners, that young person should automatically be branded as socially  disadvantaged and therefore expected to fail academically.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">The solution to this problem cannot rest entirely within an  education system or in its application. It is alarming that so many young  people are leaving school without basic qualifications and remain dependent on  the state for income support. The savings to be made by getting people off the  unemployed list and into gainful employment would make it worthwhile to  carefully examine expenditure aimed at dealing with numeracy and literacy  failings at the youngest possible age &mdash; not  long afterwards when young people are about to leave school. We make a  mistake by addressing the issue only when children are about to leave school  with no qualifications, rather than when they are beginning school. Putting  additional resources into early-years learning would make sense. The rewards  would be priceless and society would benefit in real terms.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Members will recall with  concern and disappointment the 2006 House of Commons Public Accounts Com-mittee  report on improving literacy and numeracy in our schools. I believe that one  comment in that report stands out:</p>
		  	<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo; The Department&rsquo;s record on literacy and numeracy  suggest to us that it has lacked commitment to and confidence in its target  setting.&rdquo;</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">The report also stated:</p>
		  	<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;We also expect the  Department to maintain a consistent approach to targets rather than  adjust them when results are falling short.&rdquo;</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Moreover, the report spells out the depth of the problem,  and where educational responsibility ultimately lies:</p>
		  	<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The Committee expects the Department for Education to  take urgent steps to improve the teaching of literacy and numeracy within  schools. This is essential if we are to ensure that deficiencies in literacy  and numeracy do not continue to be a major handicap for future generations of  young adults after they leave school.&rdquo;</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Is that not it? That is  the core element of the strategic approach required to ensure that  future generations do not leave school deficient in numeracy and literacy  skills.</p>
		  	<p class="TimePeriod">11.15 am</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">The Department&rsquo;s  response to the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee was that work  is under way to address the plethora of challenges issued by the Committee. If  Members are to believe that, how long do we have to wait for ideas and  suggestions, and for reasons &mdash; or even excuses &mdash; that can explain how children  in Protestant working-class areas may not be enjoying  equal educational opportunities? How will the fact that more Protestant  19 to 24 year olds than Roman Catholic 19 to 24 year olds lack basic  qualifications, and that Protestant males make up the highest proportion in  that age group, be explained?</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">I do not ask these questions to suggest that Roman Catholic  children are subjected any less to social deprivation and the resultant  deficiency in numeracy and literacy skills; that is not the case. Rather I  wonder why the evidence shows that marked difference between Protestants and  Roman Catholics. For the problem to be resolved, the approach simply must  acknowledge that and concentrate on dealing with the problem cutting across our  community. There is no sectarian or religious divide in this issue.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">The motion draws attention to the issue, and both amendments  go some way towards seeking out further matters that need to be addressed  urgently. However, what is missing &mdash; and perhaps we will hear it later &mdash; is a  firm indication that this House more than cares about young people who live in  socially disadvantaged conditions and young people who leave school  educationally disadvantaged. Those are two distinct issues, but they are linked  by shared consequences for some &mdash; although not all &mdash; young people.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">If we can explore that commonality and resolve those dual issues  that result in disadvantage at home and at school, we will be able to devise  strategies for implementation. If we just sit back and talk about the issue, we  simply add to the growing list of young people without basic qualifications.  The motion and the amendments are a start. I hope that this is the beginning of  the end of the talking, and I support the motion accordingly.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Campbell</strong>:  This topic is important, and I wish to address my brief remarks to elements of  both amendments, which were tabled in the names of SDLP Members and my  colleague Mr McCausland.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">There is no doubt that  much research has been carried out on underachievement, and the  underachievement of urban working-class Protestant children has become part of  folklore, with the children on the Shankill Road being singled out for  particular attention. Efforts have been made to establish why that is the case  and to consider what improvements can be made.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">I particularly support both amendments, the first of which  calls for an investigation into the reasons why social disadvantage is linked  to educational underachievement.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  On a point of order, Madam Speaker. On behalf of my party, it is my duty to  wind on the motion. However, if Members are not prepared to say whether they  support the substantive motion, it is difficult to ascertain whether they are  supporting it or are speaking against it. Is it in order for Members to state  their position at the start of their address?</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  Mr O&rsquo;Dowd, my understanding is that Members do not necessarily have to comment  on the motion at the start of their speech &mdash; they can do so at any time during  the speech. The content of Members&rsquo; speeches is obviously a matter for Members,  but usual convention is that they comment on the motion at some stage during  their address.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Campbell</strong>:  Thank you for that freedom, Madam Speaker. I am glad that we have the liberty  to speak and elaborate on the subject matter. If there was some concern among  Sinn F&eacute;in circles at the start of my speech, I am sure that there will be even  more as I reach the end.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">The links are there and are well documented. The Department  of Education must produce a full report that establishes how literacy and  numeracy skills can be increased in those sections of the community where the  problem is greatest.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">In these few minutes, I will dwell on an issue that to date has not been brought to the fore, namely a  parental issue in Protestant working-class areas. It has been suggested  in recent years that due to the loss of the heavy-engineering capacity of the  1960s and 1970s and the employment opportunities that arose from it, some  parents do not assist and persevere with their children through education. Many  urban working-class parents do not take that line.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Those employment opportunities have not been available in Northern Ireland for 15 or 20 years.  However, the public sector in Northern Ireland has continued to employ  around 60% of the workforce. If children are to get employment, promotion and  all that is best for them, most parents know that that is statistically more  likely in the public sector. There is a perception among many parents in urban  working-class Protestant areas that that is a closed shop for their children.  Therefore there is no incentive for them to get the qualifications required for  employment in an area that statistics have shown to be more difficult for them.  I applaud the SDLP amendment for that reason and because it is necessary to  establish the links that exist between social disadvantage and educational  attainment.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">I have tabled a motion with regard to the public sector  workforce that, hopefully, will come up in the weeks ahead. Effectively, this  would enable us to reassure parents in working-class areas that there are  openings and incentives for their children and that if the education  establishment can ensure that children attain  the numeracy and literacy skills and qualifications to go on to higher  education and then into the public sector, there would be no closed door.  Currently, there is a closed door to many from Protestant working-class  communities in agencies such as the Housing Executive and the Child Support  Agency. When that door is seen to be opened, parents from those areas will  ensure that their children are incentivised to get the education they need.  However, the Department for Education must draw out the links that exist  between under-attainment and socially disadvantaged areas.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">That is why I support the motion, and why, if the  amendments are accepted, the entire House should be able to support the motion. If so, we can make progress. If the reasons for these links are established, it  will open up not just educational attainment but the prospects for  better employment across the community. That will be advantageous and positive  for the entire community. Given that, I am delighted to add my name not just to  the motion, but also to the motion as amended.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  I congratulate the Members who brought the timely motion and the amendments to  the attention of the House. I will begin by declaring an interest: I am a  governor in two primary schools in Newtownabbey. One is set in a leafy suburban  avenue, and the other is in the middle of a public housing estate. Both schools  are served by dedicated teaching staff, are led by energetic and visionary  principals, are supported by interested  parents and have the confidence of their communities. However, there the  similarities begin to disappear.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">One of the schools has a stable budget, an enrolment figure  of almost 100% and a settled and experienced teaching staff. It does not have  any composite classes. The other has composite classes, an unpredictable and  inadequate budget, and it is forced to shed a member of staff annually. In many  cases, the most experienced staff offer themselves since, in budgetary terms,  they are the most expensive, and, by emulating Captain Oates, they sacrifice  themselves to save the school the greatest amount of money.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Therefore the system, as currently operated by the  Department, increases the risk of failure for some children and adds to the  educational disadvantage of an entire community. It is little wonder that  sections of society undervalue education when the educational establishment so  obviously undervalues them.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">The link between social  disadvantage and educational attainment is clearly seen on examination  of two wards in greater Belfast. The Hillfoot ward is apparently the least  deprived in Belfast. In that ward, some 75% of school leavers achieve five or  more GCSEs at grade C or above, 75% enter further or higher education, and fewer  than 2% are entitled to free school meals. By contrast, the Shankill ward is  the most deprived. In that ward, 26% of school leavers achieve five or more  GCSEs at grade C or above, and fewer than 20% go on to third-level education.  It is also worth noting that a massive 54% of post-primary pupils are entitled  to free school meals in the most deprived of wards.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">At primary level, 37% of 11-year-olds in the more deprived  wards failed to reach level 4 English, and the comparable figure for Northern  Ireland is 23% overall. Thirty three per cent of 11-year-olds in those wards  failed to reach level 4 maths, compared with 21% across Northern Ireland. Those  children were failing before they reached the age of 11; they were not failed  by a selective system. Rather, there are inherent weaknesses in the system from  its earliest years and before formal schooling even begins.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">There are community influences that cause one in every five  women to have no formal qualifications and one  in every four men to be without basic qualifications. There are also  stark differences between the two com-munities. In the 19 to 24 age cohort, 27%  of Protestant males lack qualifications and 19% of Roman Catholic females are  without basic qualifications. Gender, community and location have a bearing and  influence on the potential outcomes of our young people and what they can  expect to experience.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">The House of Commons Public Accounts Com-mittee published a  report in December 2006 entitled &lsquo;Improving literacy and numeracy in schools  (Northern Ireland)&rsquo;, and it makes many observations. Most of them question the  role of the Department of Education, and rightly so. If any school had received  such a scathing report from the inspectorate, the principal would have been  replaced, the staff retrained and the governors retired. The report found  &ldquo;disturbing differences&rdquo; in achievement between pupils of different religious  backgrounds in the Belfast area. Among the socially deprived, the report found  that there were &ldquo;significant differences&rdquo; between the attainment of Protestant  and Roman Catholic children in GCSE English and Maths. The report further noted  that the Committee &ldquo;expects&rdquo; the Department of Education to take urgent steps  to improve the teaching of literacy and numeracy in schools, and that:</p>
		  	<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The Department has a pressing responsibility to take  the lead in identifying and championing best practice in literacy and numeracy  teaching in schools.&rdquo;</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">The report also stated that the Department needs to provide  &ldquo;a clear direction and impetus&rdquo; in the promotion of literacy and numeracy  performance.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">The Public Accounts Committee report states:</p>
		  	<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The Committee will be interested to learn what steps  the Department takes to address the issue.&rdquo;</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">The report further notes that the Committee was extremely disappointed that targets had been  frequently adjusted.</p>
		  	<p class="TimePeriod">11.30 am</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">As Members of the House, we also expect the Department to  maintain targets rather than to adjust them when results are falling short.  Does that not suggest a Department that was so busy focusing time, effort and funding on tilting at the windmill of  selection that it failed to address its most basic function? That  function is to ensure that all pupils complete their primary education armed  with the two essential skills on which the rest of their educational progress  depends &mdash; adequate levels of literacy and numeracy.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">The failure of the Department to grasp that fact is as  startling as it is inexcusable. It must now seriously address the factors that  inhibit progress in deprived areas rather than galloping off on a crusade of  social engineering. The Department should examine current pupil-teacher ratios  in the areas that the report highlighted. The Department could do that by  forming a task force from the current high  number of unemployed young teachers whose enthusiasm could be merged  with the expertise of staff already in schools who understand the needs of  deprived communities.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Let the Department expand and properly fund initiatives  such as the Sure Start and Reading Recovery programmes. Reading Recovery programmes  have proved to improve a child&rsquo;s reading ability by 20 months within a calendar  year; if that is not available in a school, a child&rsquo;s reading ability may only  improve by five months, and the child may thereby fall further behind. What  happens in Northern Ireland? The funding is cut. What happens in England? They  seek to expand such initiatives. Such schemes are designed to raise standards  in schools; instead of being stop-start, they should be mainstreamed where the  need to raise standards is obvious rather than the current crazy system, where  expertise is pushed back into a classroom and financial support is removed.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">If a school succeeds, how is it rewarded? The money is  taken away. Teachers are trained to teach these fairly skilled operations, but  what happens? The school cannot afford to have teachers out there and pushes  them back into a classroom. That inexplicable process infuriates the school  principal and staff, and who knows what  danger it causes to the child or parent, whose expectations have been raised only to be dashed?</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Finally, Madam Speaker, I wish to repeat &mdash; and I am sure  that you will object &mdash; my plea for 50:50 recruitment  among the teaching force. Since 1998, male applicants to the  primary-school-teacher course at Stranmillis  University College have dropped from 23% to 17%. At the same time, male intake to the post-primary  teaching course has slumped from 41% to 28%. That is a serious reflection on  how men view the teaching profession and the career structure that it provides.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">In modern society,  especially in many deprived areas, the one-parent family is becoming  more prevalent. Young boys growing up in such a situation are denied the  opportunity of finding a positive male role model in the home. Increasingly,  they are also failing to find a positive male role model in school, especially  during the formative early years of primary education. That situation must be  addressed if we are to interest boys in education.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">If the Government can manipulate the recruitment of  policing and attempt to justify it as being in the interests of the community,  they can introduce the same principle into teacher training in the interests of  society. Failure to do so will reinforce other socially undesirable routes to  status that are, unfortunately, available in marginalised communities. However,  such routes ultimately lead not only to ruin for the individual but ruin for  the area concerned.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">As you will know, Madam Speaker, the Committee for  Education discussed this issue when this body functioned properly in the past.  We brought the issue to the attention of previous Ministers and sought advice  from across the United Kingdom. Eight years later, I cannot understand why  decisive steps have still not been taken to ensure that those children who are  most marginalised and deprived, who, time and again, have been readily  identified as such, cannot be served by a decent education system.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brolly</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I support the motion  and the amendments tabled to it. Poverty is one of the greatest issues that  British direct rule has failed to tackle.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">All the evidence demonstrates that child poverty must be  addressed through early intervention. However, the loss of both teaching and  support staff, particularly from schools that operate in areas of multiple  deprivation, only further undermines support for those most at risk from  poverty. That is why I support the motion and the proposed amendments.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">In November 2006, the  Joseph Rowntree Foundation launched a report that monitored poverty and  social exclusion in the North. In chapter 8, which considered education, the  findings on outcomes for younger children were:</p>
		  	<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;On average, the higher the level of deprivation in a  school, the less likely it is that its children will have reached level 4 at age  11.&rdquo;</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">In the most deprived fifth of schools, however, about one  third of children do not reach that level.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">The findings also revealed:</p>
		  	<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;In English, 37 per cent of 11-year-olds in the most  deprived fifth of primary schools failed to reach level 4 in 2005. This  compares with an average of 23 per cent for all schools. In maths, the figures  were similar but slightly lower: 33 per cent in the most deprived fifth of  primary schools failing to reach level 4 compared to 21 per cent for all  schools.&rdquo;</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">The findings on 16-year-olds lacking reasonable GCSEs  showed:</p>
		  	<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;In 2004/05, 5 per cent of 16-year-olds obtained no  GCSEs, 9 per cent obtained some but fewer than five GCSEs and a further 23 per  cent obtained five GCSEs but not all at grade C.&rdquo;</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">The findings continued:</p>
		  	<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;As a whole, this headline measure has come down, from  47 per cent in 1994/95 to 37 per cent in 2004/05. But almost all of this fall  has been in the group getting five GCSEs but not at grades A-C. By contrast, there has been no fall in the numbers  getting no GCSEs and no fall since 1997/98 in the numbers getting fewer  than five. Rather, as the headline measure has gradually improved, the  proportion getting few or no GCSEs at all has remained largely unchanged at  around 15 per cent, or one in seven of all 16-year-olds.&rdquo;</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Of those children who are entitled to free school meals,  the report states:</p>
		  	<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;the proportion getting few or no GCSEs has remained  at around 30 per cent over the decade, double the rate for all 16-year-olds on  average.&rdquo;</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">The report highlights young people who have been in care as  a particularly disadvantaged group. It states:</p>
		  	<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;In 2003, 50 per cent of those young people who leave  care had no qualifications at all on leaving school &mdash; 10 times the national  average &mdash; and only 10 per cent got 5 or more GCSEs grades A-C compared to a  national average of 60 per cent.&rdquo;</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">The findings on the destination of school-leavers revealed:</p>
		  	<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;On average, the higher a local area&rsquo;s level of  deprivation, the lower will be the proportion of its school leavers going on to  further or higher education. For example, over the four years to 2001/02, some  45 per cent of school leavers living in the most deprived fifth of wards went  on to further or higher education compared with 65 per cent in wards with  average levels of deprivation.&rdquo;</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">The report states that about 10% of 16-year-olds to  18-year-olds in the North &mdash; some 10,000 people &mdash; are not in education,  employment or training. Among 19-year-olds to 24-year-olds, more young men than  young women &mdash; 24% compared with 20% &mdash; lack basic qualifications.</p>
		  	<p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Deputy  Speaker [Mr Molloy] in the Chair)</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Among young men and young women, more Protestants than  Catholics lack basic qualifications. The group with the highest proportion  lacking basic qualifications is young Protestant men, at 27%, and the group  with the smallest proportion lacking such qualifications is young Catholic  women, at 19%.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">It is a matter of regret that some politicians refuse to  support change to a system that has not served our children, particularly the  most needy, well. I again commend my colleague Martin McGuinness for having  relieved us of the embarrassment of the 11-plus, a system that condemns 75% of  11-year-olds to the educational and social scrap heap, demoralising many who  are already deeply demoralised.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Twenty-two per cent of the working-age population in the  North lack any qualifications. That proportion is far higher than anywhere else  in Britain or Ireland. The anti-poverty  strategy Lifetime Opportunities has proposed four cross-cutting themes  in relation to children, sustainability and a shared future. The goal for  early-years, which covers the ages of 0 to 4 years is:</p>
		  	<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;to ensure that every child should have a chance to  develop their full potential in infancy regardless of social background.&rdquo;</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">The goal for children aged between 5 and 16 is:</p>
		  	<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;to allow all children and young people to experience  a happy and fulfilling childhood, while equipping them with the education,  skills and experience to achieve their potential to be citizens of tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Again, unless we truly recognise the link between  social disadvantage and educational attainment, and are radical and brave  enough to change the old status quo, we will be failing our children.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">The anti-poverty strategy&rsquo;s goal for people of working age  is:</p>

		  	<p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Tell that to children in care who leave school with  no qualifications or to many of the North&rsquo;s citizens, who see employment as the  route out of poverty. However, employment is not an option for those with  disabilities, for example, or for people caring for young children or older  relatives. We must consider all our people.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Through its skills strategy, the Department for Employment  and Learning is committed to ensuring that the workforce is literate and  numerate by 2015. However, many will not achieve that or reach an acceptable  level of competence unless this Assembly recognises the link between social  disadvantage and educational attainment and sets itself to do something about it. Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat, a Cheann  Comhairle.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Farrell</strong>:  Other Members have highlighted the links between social disadvantage and  educational achievement in children. I shall take this opportunity to briefly  consider how the situation applies to adults and 16- to 19-year-olds &mdash; the  people whom the education system has failed.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">I have spent all my working life in education. Until the  Christmas holidays just past, I was involved in the implementation of the  Department for Employment and Learning&rsquo;s essential skills programme. That  programme was introduced by my colleague Carmel Hanna when she was Minister for  that Department.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">The United Kingdom has the highest rate of literacy  problems in Europe, and Northern Ireland has the highest such rate in the  United Kingdom.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">It is estimated that  one in four of the adult population of Northern Ireland lacks the basic  skills essential to function fully in our society &mdash; they cannot read a bus or  train timetable; they cannot complete everyday forms; they cannot read to their  children or help them with their homework; and, in some instances, they cannot  read the instructions on prescription medicines.</p>
		  	<p class="TimePeriod">11.45 am</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">We are all familiar with  the &ldquo;gremlins&rdquo; advertisement on  television, which encourages adults to take advantage of the excellent  provision available under the essential skills programme. The Department for  Employment and Learning is to be congratulated on this initiative and on the  funding that has been made available through it; however, it was long overdue.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Fifteen years ago, I was seconded from my further education college to the Southern Education and  Library Board in order to develop its paltry adult education provision.  At that time, adult literacy classes were totally underfunded. They were  generally held in cold, leaky mobile  classrooms at the edge of college campuses using volunteer tutors and  learning material that was designed for young children. There was a stigma  attached to attending those classes. Many adults spent years trying to pluck up  the courage to take the first step across the door. Where transport was available,  they would often travel to another town for fear of being spotted attending  literacy classes by someone they knew.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Although there was little or no money, dedicated staff  throughout the North dreamed up innovative ways of addressing the problem and  removing the stigma. I think of the exciting &ldquo;cook the books&rdquo; project in Whiterock adult education centre, where women  learned literacy and numeracy skills through the medium of cookery  classes, thereby removing the stigma of going to learn to read and count. There  are other examples throughout the country. Eventually, the introduction of  computers lent dignity to the situation, with adult learners able to say that  they were going to computer classes rather than to adult literacy classes.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">This motion recognises the sterling work of  educationalists, and there are many unsung heroes and heroines out there who  have worked to help adults overcome social disadvantage through basic  education. Tribute must be paid to the Educational Guidance Service for Adults,  to the adult provision in the further education colleges and to the many  voluntary organisations in the field.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Throughout the North there are groups and centres battling  away daily to address the issue of overcoming social deprivation through adult  education. That can be seen particularly in the area of women&rsquo;s education.  Again, tribute must be paid to the Training for Women Network, which, through  EU funding mechanisms, has supported a wide range of women&rsquo;s education  programmes throughout the North. We see them in our cities, towns and villages.  In my own constituency of Lagan Valley, wonderful work is being done by the  Footprints Women&rsquo;s Centre in Poleglass and the Atlas project in Lisburn.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">I could relate countless tales of adults&rsquo;, particularly  women&rsquo;s, journeys through education and of how they have grown, gained  confidence, found fulfilment and ended their cycle of poverty. Unfortunately, I  do not have the time, but local newspapers regularly carry photographs of  mature students on graduation day proudly holding the degrees that they have  obtained, having worked their way through the adult progression route, through  access provision and finally to a degree.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 1 calls for an investigation into the reasons  for the link between social disadvantage and educational attainment. Of  particular concern to educationalists in the field of adult education is the  difficulty in attracting men into the provision. That is not peculiar to  Northern Ireland and is probably linked to the fact that girls are, as some  Members mentioned earlier, outperforming boys throughout the education system.  However, some research into the lack of male participation in adult education  would be welcomed.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">I started by saying that one aspect of my recent work  involved the embedding of essential skills in further education. Specifically,  this work was with young men in the construction trades &mdash; boys who, under the  new guidelines, have to attain level 2 in literacy and numeracy, the equivalent  of grade C at GCSE. Many of them are reluctant learners in further education.  They have joined the construction industry and do not quite understand why they  still have to do mathematics and English; they thought that they had left all  that behind them at the school gate. However, they give examples, from their  work experience on building sites, of mature men in their communities who carry  the burden of illiteracy and are prevented from achieving their full potential  in a society where the basic skills are so necessary in this day and age.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Although sterling work has been done, some people in  Northern Ireland are still caught in the trap of social disadvantage. That trap  has been brought about through lack of education. Let us investigate the links,  highlight the good practice and develop measures to address the issue.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">I support the motion.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Copeland</strong>:  As I have done previously, I am speaking to a motion for which there is an  absence of muscle that can transmit the thoughts of the House into legislation.  At this stage, there is little point in doing anything else. We are involved in  a process that could be described as political speed-dating: we are not quite  sure of the outcome, but its function will be to meet interesting people in the  hope that something else in the future might occur.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">I must declare an interest based on the fact that a  substantial number of the citizens of my constituency fall into those  categories that are bandied about: the &ldquo;socially deprived&rdquo; and the  &ldquo;disadvantaged&rdquo;. I am not comfortable with apportioning those titles to any of  our citizens, but I must do so because of the way in which statistical  information on this matter is gathered.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">It is probably patently obvious to all Members that I did  not receive the benefit of a grammar-school or a third-level education. A few  days ago, the Speaker of the House and I shared what I can only describe as a  wonderful and moving experience in the Senate Chamber. Two groups of children,  one from Holy Cross Boys&rsquo; Primary School in North Belfast and the other from  Beechfield Primary School on the interface of my own constituency, came  together for a debate. They had prepared an Order Paper, apportioned speakers,  the Speaker presided over the debate and Hansard reported it. They had their  speeches prepared, and their points and arguments were well made. They  eventually resolved that, in future, children would not be required to wear  school uniforms.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Members might think that that is a minor event, but those  children come from two areas that have similar housing, aspirational and unemployment circumstances. They are  also similar in that those terms that we use, &ldquo;disadvantage&rdquo; and  &ldquo;underachievement&rdquo;, can be applied to them. They are identical in every respect  apart from where they choose or choose not to go to church on Sundays. They put  their points forcefully, eloquently and intelligently, and I found it humbling.  At the end of the debate, I explained to them that if any of them had been  MLAs, what they had proposed and agreed on would in a few short weeks be a  matter of law. I hope that somewhere, in some of those kids, a seed was planted  that will convince them that change can be occasioned by words.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">My son is an interesting case. When he was nine years old,  we were told that he would never be able to read and write. Consequently, we  did not subject him to the vagaries of the transfer procedure, and he went  instead to Lagan College. He entered the lowest academic stream of that school.  Although the alphabet that described his class was constructed in such a way  that he was not supposed to know about the stream that he was in, he did know.  By work, by luck and by growing older, he managed to move up through the  school&rsquo;s system to such a degree that he got four As, two Bs and a C. He wants  to be a doctor, and he is on course to be so. However, it will take him until  he is 27 to achieve that because he did single- instead of double-award  science.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">The truth is that the brightest gems are found in the  darkest mines, the richest coal in the deepest seas, and the most precious  metals are the hardest and most expensive to extract. We must not permit the  postcode area in which a child is born to affect his or her entire life.  Education makes people free, but there is a cost.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">I am a simple person. At one stage, I concluded that the  primary responsibilities of education boards were to ensure that everyone had  access to the possibility of change that could be brought about through  education.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Imagine my shock and horror when I discovered that the  primary legislative requirement on education boards is to live within their  budgets.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">The answer to all of the questions that have been raised  during this debate can be summed up in just a few words: the funding of need.  This House and this society must value education and believe in our heart of  hearts that education can create change. We must take steps to ensure that  those at one end of the spectrum &mdash; those who enjoy the benefits of grammar  schools; who go to universities; and who go to London and elsewhere in England,  Wales, Scotland, or around the world &mdash; return to this Province the investment  that we have made in them.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Dodds</strong>:  There is no doubt that there are distinct connections between social  deprivation and poor educational attainment. However, it is very important that  we do not automatically place all children from socially disadvantaged  backgrounds in one category. Some schools with pupils from such backgrounds  prove that excellence in education is possible for all.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Although there is much good work being done in individual  schools, there is a growing recognition that the Department of Education has  not served our children well. I agree with the Member for Strangford David McNarry, who cited the failure of the  Department&rsquo;s 1998 literacy and numeracy strategy. Instead of implementing  targets, the Department simply shifted the goalposts and allowed targets to  slip. That type of leadership is partly responsible for the lack of success  that has led us to where we are today.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">The 2006 report of the Westminster Public Accounts Committee  on improving literacy and numeracy in schools draws serious conclusions that  are of specific concern to those of us who represent socially deprived areas,  particularly in the greater Belfast area. The report states that:</p>
		  	<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;among socially deprived communities in Belfast,  significant differences between Protestant and Roman Catholic children exist in  GCSE English and Mathematics. This raises a concern that children in Protestant  working-class areas may not be enjoying equal educational opportunities.&rdquo;</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">That conclusion mirrors the findings presented in the  Department for Social Development&rsquo;s &lsquo;Renewing Communities&rsquo; document, which  stated that a lack of educational attainment is a serious concern for  Protestant communities.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Wards in my  constituency, such as Shankill, Crumlin, Woodvale, Highfield and  Glencairn, show high levels of deprivation and are among the most deprived  areas in terms of education and skills. By focusing on these areas, I am neither denying nor condoning the  existence of educational deprivation in other areas. However, these  areas of my constituency are often cited as examples of deprivation, and  perhaps it will be useful for this House to examine how the Department of  Education has let children down in those communities.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">In October 2003, the then Education Minister, Jane Kennedy,  visited the Shankill area. She subsequently announced  that &pound;2&middot;7 million would be made available for education action zones,  which, she claimed, would be:</p>
		  	<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;child-centred,  multi-agency responses based in local schools and working with the local  community to improve services [that will] complement existing successful  structures, such as the North-West and West Belfast &amp; Greater Shankill Task  Forces &hellip; I would see the first Education Action Zone coming on stream by September  2004.&rdquo;</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">That sounded good, but by the autumn of 2004, with no  education action zone in sight, I made further representations to that very  forgettable Education Minister, Barry Gardiner. He wrote back to say that the  goalposts had been moved and that there was no requirement for an education  action zone to be based in a particular area, but that it could be thematic,  and that education and library boards would be invited to submit bids for such  funding.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">It is to the shame of the Department of Education and a  series of Education Ministers that no such education action zone has  materialised in that educationally disadvantaged area of Northern Ireland.</p>
		  	<p class="TimePeriod">12.00 noon</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">At a recent meeting  with the current Minister a couple of weeks ago, she admitted that  education action zones in her own constituency have proved to have a positive  effect, when managed well and working to specific targets for improvement.  Here, however, it seems that such specific, targeted action is well beyond the  capabilities of the Department of Education.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Today, I demand that the Minister take immediate steps to  introduce an education action zone in the greater Shankill area. She must  ensure that there is sufficient funding to improve teacher-pupil ratios and to  provide extra special-needs teachers. She must also take steps to improve access to healthcare professionals such as  speech and language therapists, who are in such short supply.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">With no progress on an education action zone, local  teachers and community workers in the Shankill area got together with the  Belfast Education and Library Board and the North and West Belfast Health  Action Zone to submit a bid to the Integrated Development Fund, which  administers a pot of money generated by the West Belfast and Greater Shankill  Task Forces. Almost four years later, that has not resulted in any funding  being made available to hard-pressed teachers and communities in the greater  Shankill and west Belfast areas.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Perhaps we should consider recent statements and initiatives. Following consultation with school  principals in the greater Shankill and in north Belfast, several  initiatives that could aid the education sector were identified in the renewing  communities action plan. Recent meetings that my colleague for North Belfast  and I attended with school principals from north Belfast showed that they are  experiencing a slow, backlogged system that finds it almost impossible to  release funding to schools on time, leaving principals with too much  bureaucracy and the additional burden of finding alternative finance for  schemes until the necessary funding is released.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Last year, the Secretary of State announced the children and young people&rsquo;s fund, with money  becoming available for extended schools. To date, the Belfast Education  and Library Board has released only 25% of the funds for this year, and it is  almost the end of January. How can school principals deliver a service when  such action clogs the system?</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Children with special educational needs are particularly  affected in areas of social disadvantage. The  complicated system of obtaining adequate healthcare and education  provision often means that parents find it difficult to access services.  Parents find the statementing system complicated and intimidating. I fear that  it disadvantages children from deprived backgrounds whose parents do not have  the support or clout to demand extra provision for their children.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">The current system of funding for special needs  disadvantages children in Belfast. The city has a disproportionately high  number of children with educational and emotional needs but does not receive  extra funding to support them. The difference in approach from one education  and library board to another means a difference in the service provided to  children. A common approach should be a priority for the new single education  authority, and there should be strong criteria for funding to ensure that  provision for special needs is applied to all areas equitably.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Another aspect of educational disadvantage that  particularly affects children with special needs is the shortage of educational  psychologists. Last year, the Belfast  Education and Library Board had the equivalent of 26 full-time  educational psychologists, servicing a growing list of demands from children in  the area.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">This year it is 23, and, because of difficulties with  offering long-term contracts, they are finding it very difficult to recruit  extra educational psychologists into the system. If a child does not see an  educational psychologist, he will not get a statement of needs and his rights will  be infringed. That also needs to be urgently addressed.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">I have confined myself to my own constituency for a very  important reason: too often Education Ministers, the Secretary of State and  every other politician have used the Shankill for a cheap headline about the  lack of educational attainment or, indeed,  the fuzzy feel-good picture that announces some initiative. Today I have  tried to explain to the House why these areas continue to fail. They continue  to fail because in spite of plenty of announcements, we have little sustained  follow-up action. If we are to break the cycle of deprivation in these  communities, we need to pay attention to that action and ensure that it is  sustained over a long and specific period of time.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">I support the amendment in the name of my party colleague  and urge the House to do likewise.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>: I  am delighted with the debate that we have had here this morning. I hope that  every new Member who turns up to the Assembly on 26 March is given a copy of the Hansard report of this debate,  because it will hold all the solutions to the problems that afflict so many people in society. I do not want to be  repetitive, but 25% of people  between the ages of 16 and 64 suffer from  serious levels of illiteracy and innumeracy. My new colleague, Marietta  Farrell, spoke very well about that.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Barry McElduff opened the debate and ventured into the  heartlands of unionism. Of course, he got a response to that, but the issues we  are addressing this morning do not know any political boundaries. They exist  everywhere, and I will touch on that later.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Dominic Bradley highlighted the neighbourhood effects of  social deprivation and urged us to focus on a broader initiative. He also  talked about multiple deprivation. Nelson  McCausland, who represents North Belfast, has spoken in the past about  this. I certainly think that he made a convincing argument for greater  equality. Norman McNarry made a very valuable contribution &mdash;</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  His name is David.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>: My apologies. He was the first to mention the most recent  Public Accounts Committee report.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Gregory Campbell ventured into the old sectarian issues and  mentioned the closed door on public jobs. I should like to remind him that the  door for public jobs in Coleraine is open at the moment, but it is open outwards, whether you are Siobhan or Sammy,  Silvia or Sean. That is the door to County Hall, to HM Revenue and Customs and, shortly, to the Social Security  Agency. Those people who will be  losing their jobs in the public service will have nowhere to go because  Coleraine has an extremely narrow industrial base. That is very sad; it is not  something to laugh about.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Francie Brolly pointed out that while the number of  children leaving school with five or more GCSEs is rising, the number leaving  with none has not changed; that is a matter for regret.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">I listened carefully to Michael Copeland, who spoke about  his son; all of us could learn something from that. If all children were to be  given the right support, they could achieve the best.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Diane Dodds confined her contribution to issues that affect  north Belfast, and other Members have also covered that area. She rightly  pointed out that the &pound;2&middot;7 million that was promised for the action zone was not  delivered. Since the introduction of direct rule, that is the type of diet on  which we have been fed.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Adams</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>: I  will not give way while I am making my winding-up speech. On second thoughts,  since it is yourself, Gerry, I will give way.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Adams</strong>: Maith th&uacute;. T&aacute; m&eacute; bu&iacute;och den Chomhalta. T&aacute; br&oacute;n orm nach raibh  m&eacute; anseo ar maidin nuair a bh&iacute; an Teach ag pl&eacute; an &aacute;bhair th&aacute;bhachtaigh seo.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Member for giving way, and I apologise that I  was not here earlier for the debate.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">By the way, I was late in arriving to the Chamber because I  was meeting the direct-rule Minister with responsibility for education; we met  specifically on the need to establish an  educational initiative for the Shankill. Does the Member agree that all  our young people have <span style="letter-spacing:-.25pt; ">a right to equality  of opportunity, based on objective need</span>, including the best educational standards for the Shankill as well  as for the Falls, and for all places in between?</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>: I  could not agree more, which is why I was somewhat disappointed when, on two  occasions during the mandate of the Northern Ireland Assembly, the then  Minister of Education lowered the attainment targets for Key Stage 2 and Key  Stage 3; on a third occasion, he extended  the time limit. Manipulating, and tampering  with, targets is not the way to achieve the kind of success about which  Gerry Adams has just spoken.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">A previous Public Accounts Committee quizzed  representatives from the Education and Training Inspectorate. I asked them why they were not screaming from the  roof tops about the lack of support that there is for teachers in many schools in socially deprived areas. The  officials wrote up glossy reports and persecuted good teachers, forcing them  out of the profession early, but they did not address the issues.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">This issue was discussed in previous Assemblies. One of the  most influential contributions was made by our deceased colleague David Ervine,  who, time and again, spoke passionately about educational poverty in loyalist  areas of Belfast. He also spoke about the low number of children who pass the  11-plus in those districts and about the absolute need to tackle social  disadvantage by ensuring that every child has an equal chance of maximising his  or her educational potential.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">I have no doubt that David Ervine understood that education  is the greatest weapon to give to any child; my mother, God rest her,  repeatedly told me that. Education is a far more powerful weapon than a gun or  anything else that may have been used in the past to change our society. It  remains so, and I am glad that everyone accepts that fact.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Social disadvantage is not confined to those areas about  which David Ervine spoke; it is everywhere in Northern Ireland. Today, the  threat is not about being sucked into  paramilitarism but into drugs, crime and the other evils that compound  the very social disadvantage that we are discussing. Social disadvantage is  regional, as is illustrated by the various indicators that are used by the  Government and their agencies. In Coleraine, the most affluent wards sit cheek  by jowl with the most socially deprived wards. The same applies elsewhere, but  it applies particularly in the north-west and in other border regions. Recent  announcements that have been made by various  Departments to centralise Civil Service jobs, either in Belfast or in  marginal constituencies across the water, do nothing to address social  disadvantage. I suspect that the jobs that are being lost in Coleraine and  other places are being relocated for the wrong reasons.</p>
		  	<p class="TimePeriod">12.15 pm</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">I worry about the capacity of any future Assembly to  address those &mdash; and other &mdash; issues that have arisen for historical reasons or  as a result of neglect by direct-rule  Ministers who have been here for 30 years too long.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">I am no longer certain that all political parties are  committed to decentralisation. I hope that I am not giving away any secrets by  saying that the Subgroup on Workplace 2010 and Public Sector Job Location had  considerable trouble finding a form of words that suited the DUP. However, I  hope that decentralisation becomes a major issue in the new Assembly.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">We need to move on and get the Assembly up and running. It  needs to be not a piece of window dressing to stabilise democracy but a vehicle  that will, without difference, introduce  policies that will address genuinely the  inequalities, injustices and discrimination that affect the lives of so  many people in both communities and, indeed, in ethnic minority communities.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">For too long, the twin evils of poor education and social  disadvantage have been used not to fix, but to exploit, the problem. That has  been unhelpful and, dare I say it,  disgraceful. I hope that the time has come when our only reason to talk  about the crisis is to fix it. The best way  that we can reach that point is to tell the world that we are no longer  sitting on the fence playing funny wee  games; we are going after the real issues that affect people who have  suffered grievously and who have borne the worst brunt of the instability and  violence that I hope is part of history. I hope that the Assembly exists on 26  March so that we can take action as a result of today&rsquo;s debate.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">In making my winding-up speech, I commend my party  colleague for tabling the motion. I support the amendments, both of which he  has accepted. That shows political maturity on his part and on the part of my  party. It has been disappointing that recently in the Chamber, regardless of  the value of amendments, they are opposed because they have been tabled by Sinn  F&eacute;in. There is no need for Members to go into their safe zones just because a  political party to which they may be politically or diametrically opposed  tables a motion or amendment.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Many interesting contributions have been made today. The  debate has been good, given the extent to which any debate in this Assembly can  be useful. However, it has been interesting to hear the various views from around the Chamber on social  disadvantage and educational underachievement. I listened carefully to Nelson McCausland&rsquo;s contribution. It was  interesting because he quoted from various reports that have identified  underachievement in Protestant areas. That underachievement clearly exists. To  paraphrase him, he said that a report is needed on the reasons for that underachievement. I could not agree with him  more. As has been said, if 27% of young Protestant males leave school  with no qualifications, that means that we as a society have collectively  failed them. We must identify the reasons for that.</p>
		  	<p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Madam Speaker in the Chair)</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">There are many interesting reasons for that. John Dallat  spoke about David Ervine, whose contribution is missed today. David Ervine  spoke at length on this matter and on the attitudes in the Protestant/loyalist  community to itself, to education and to its sense of a lack of pride. Far be  it from me to discuss a report that has not been written, but as an outsider  looking in, I see that the influence of role models is one reason for those  attitudes. As politicians, we are all role models. If a politician continues to  tell his or her community that there is no confidence, that we are on the road  to rack and ruin and that there is no future, generations coming after him or  her will listen and garner no hope from that message. However, if that  politician tells his or her community that there is a future, that we can work  our way through those difficulties and that we can collectively build a new future on this island, surely hope  and optimism will be instilled in that community. That will then filter down to  the young people, who will see education as the way out of poverty.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">It is remarkable that those on the Benches opposite  continue to support the 11-plus, despite all the evidence that we have heard &mdash;</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  The Member is misrepresenting it. Withdraw that.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  David, with respect, I will come to your comments in a moment.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">The Members opposite  continue to support the 11-plus, which has clearly been shown to  discriminate against those in disadvantaged areas. However, the system has to  be approved &mdash;</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I thank the Member for giving way, but he needs to do more research. It is  clear that the 11-plus no longer enjoys widespread political support, but that is separate, and entirely different,  from academic selection. The Member had better understand the difference  between the two.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  The UUP once told us that we need more than words. Changing the words does not  alter the fact that there is still a selection process.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Michael Copeland, who spoke well this morning, told us  about his son who was told at nine years of age that he was a failure. His son  is now training to be a doctor, and I wish him success for his future. Will we  tell our children at 11 or 14 that they are failures? No. We should ensure that  all children &mdash; regardless of their social background &mdash; are given the same  opportunities as everyone else and that we can educate our way out of poverty  and social disadvantage.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  Would the Member be surprised if I informed the House that, in the Subgroup on  Schools Admission Policy, my proposal that the subgroup oppose the 11-plus  received the following response: Sinn F&eacute;in and the SDLP supported the proposal;  the DUP and UUP opposed it?</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>: I  thank my colleague for that piece of research; he has saved me the bother of  having to look it up.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">In relation to deprivation and social attainment &mdash;</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  Will the Member ask his colleague &mdash; who is  giving out information from a closed subgroup, the minutes of which have  not yet been approved and which he should not disclose, even to the Assembly &mdash;  to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth of his story?</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Certainly.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  There is a subgroup meeting at 12.30.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  I will join David in the afternoon for further discussion on the matter.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>: I  thank Members for those interesting contributions.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">I represent a constituency that has areas of high  deprivation, one of which is an estate called Ardowen. Three years ago, Ardowen  had been practically demolished by hoods &mdash; a small minority came into the  estate and almost destroyed it. The local people said, &ldquo;Enough is enough; we  have had all we can take&rdquo; and they stood up to the hoods. The hoods left and  the estate was rebuilt. However, the most amazing thing that came from that  project was that people set up a homework club in a derelict house, for which  they received small amounts of funding. That  small homework club includes people  from all communities: the travelling community, ethnic minorities, and  the Protestant and Catholic communities.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">For the first time in that area there is a possibility that  children will leave secondary school to go to university.  Up until now, only one person from that area graduated from university.  Due to the work of the local community other children in the area have a  future.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">My colleague Barry McElduff spoke about the need for civic society to be involved in educational  attainment. That is a classic  example of communities coming together, facing their difficulties and  noting that the way out of the poverty and disadvantage that we face is through  education. They did it themselves, and I congratulate them for it.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">If we are to achieve  anything in relation to the motion and the amendments &mdash; I have been  accused of making the same speech on a different day, and I will do that again  today &mdash; we need a local Minister who is accountable to the Assembly to make  decisions. As Michael Copeland told us, when he was at the debate in the Senate  Chamber &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Is that confirmation on power sharing? Sorry, I missed  that. Is that a yes to power sharing?</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>:  Will you tell that to your Ard-Fheis?</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Sorry, I thought that that was a yes to power sharing; I picked it up wrong.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: Are  you supporting policing?</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Was that a yes to power sharing?</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>: I  will check Hansard to see what the Member said.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">As Michael Copeland told us, he attended a debate in the  Senate Chamber between two north Belfast primary schools. It was a brilliant  debate, from which both schools emerged empowered. They had decided against the  wearing of school uniforms; unfortunately for them, however, debating the issue  was all that they were able to do. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  We are similar in that we are having an  excellent debate with worthwhile contributions from both sides of the  House, but we cannot make decisions. I hope that Mr Dallat is right, and that  we return on 26 March. When I check Hansard, I hope to find that my colleague  Mr Weir said yes to power sharing; that we can  ensure that we are the decision-makers on education; and that this  Assembly can hold to account the former education Ministers who let down Diane  Dodds and the Shankill community.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  That includes yours.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  He is here.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>: I  do not believe that our Minister of Education let anyone down. If an education  Minister is not doing his or her job or any party is not doing its job, the  electorate will deselect them.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Oh!</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  On that note, I will end my remarks. Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle.</p>

		  	<p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Main Question, as amended, put and agreed to.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
		  	<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That this Assembly recognises the link between social  disadvantage and educational attainment and recognises the sterling work of  educationalists in addressing this situation; and further calls on an incoming  Executive to develop a strategic approach to raising the attainment levels for  the most disadvantaged in our society, including an investigation of the  reasons why this link exists, and to implement effective existing and new  measures to address this problem. The Assembly also notes the recent report on  &lsquo;Improving literacy and numeracy in schools&rsquo; in Northern Ireland by the House  of Commons Committee of Public Accounts; and calls on the Department of Education  to fully fund and implement an effective literacy and numeracy strategy; and  further calls for the setting up of Education Action Zones in areas of high  educational disadvantage.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  Members will know that the Business Committee has arranged to meet as usual at  lunchtime today. I propose therefore, by leave of the Assembly, to suspend the  sitting until 2.00 pm.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The sitting was suspended at 12.27 pm.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyTextItalic">On resuming (Madam Speaker in the Chair) &mdash;</p>
	  	<p class="TimePeriod">2.00 pm</p>
	  	<p class="H4StageHeading">Sudan</p>
	  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  The Business Committee has agreed to allow two hours for the debate. The Member  proposing the motion has 15 minutes to speak, with 15 minutes for the  winding-up speech. All other Members <span style="letter-spacing:-.05pt; ">who  wish to speak will have a maximum of 10 minutes.</span></p>
	  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Hanna</strong>: I  beg to move</p>
	  	<p class="Q3Motion">Bearing in mind the appalling human tragedy in Darfur, this  Assembly calls on all democratic governments, especially the Irish and British  Governments with which this Assembly has particular interaction, to use all  their influence on the Government of Sudan to accept immediate deployment of  the United Nations force in Darfur, as mandated by the United Nations Security  Council.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">This is the first motion dealing with matters outside  Northern Ireland to be tabled in the Transitional Assembly. I will explain  briefly why I have tabled it even though the Assembly has no power over matters  in Northern Ireland, let alone thousands of miles away in east Africa.  International development is a reserved matter, but international development  and awareness-raising are functions of a devolved Assembly.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">The International Development All Party Assembly Group, set  up in the Assembly in late 1998, was one of the  most successful of all-party groups, and it continued <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt; ">to meet during suspension. It has hosted many  functions</span>, such as the Make Poverty History campaign and the <span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt; ">report of the Commission for Africa. It has held  meetings</span> <span style="letter-spacing:-.2pt; ">with the Secretary of State  for International Development</span>, Hilary Benn; the Republic of Ireland  Minister of State with special responsibility for Overseas Development and  Human Rights, Conor Lenihan; and Patricia Ferguson in the Scottish Executive.  The group has had several meetings with the all-party groups in Scotland and Wales. It was made clear to the group at its  meetings with Mr Benn and Mr Lenihan that the door is ajar for it to  become much more involved. At the meeting with Patricia Ferguson, we learned  how much the Scottish Parliament is doing for international development, and  how much Members could achieve in that respect, if only progress could be made in restoring the Assembly.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">Most Members will be aware of the response of our Lord when  he was asked: &ldquo;Who is my neighbour?&rdquo; He told the parable of the good Samaritan,  the lesson of which is that none of us can walk past on the other side of the  road. Members cannot ignore what is happening in the rest of the world. The  Assembly should use whatever influence it has with the British and Irish  Governments, both of which &mdash; in fairness to them &mdash; have been active in relation  to the crisis in Darfur.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">On their own, the people of Northern Ireland were unable to  solve their political problems until the issues were internationalised. At that  point, not only did the Irish and British Governments became involved, but so  too did the European Union and the United States. We have benefited enormously  from the hundreds of millions of pounds  contributed by the International Fund for Ireland, by Jacques Delors&rsquo;s  Special Support Programme for Peace and Reconciliation, and by EU structural  funds. Northern Ireland has also benefited immensely from the time, energy and  commitment of people such as Senator George Mitchell, and many others. They did  not walk by on the other side of the road; rather, they gave us significant  chunks of their lives to help us sort ourselves out.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">I am grateful to Dr James Uhomoibhi of the African Development Centre in Northern Ireland for  information. We know of more than 100 Sudanese families living here,  many of whom have been displaced. The human fallout from what is happening in  Darfur has already reached our shores.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">Darfur, along with Iraq, Burma and the Democratic Republic  of Congo, has some of the worst examples of starvation and mass abuse of human  rights taking place in the world today. Sudan, of which Darfur is a western  province, is broadly divided between the Muslim north and the Christian and  animist south. The Government in Khartoum have been waging ferocious warfare  for four years against rebels from black African tribes who took up arms,  accusing the Khartoum Government of discrimination and oppression. That  conflict has now spilled over into Darfur, and the cost of that warfare is  immense.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">Darfur is approximately two thirds of the size of France,  with a population of around 7&middot;5 million people, most of whom are engaged in  subsistence agriculture. Between 200,000 and 300,000 people have been killed &mdash;  people who, even in the best of times, were among the poorest on the earth. It  can be very hard to get our heads around those numbers and imagine that they  are people like us. Imagine the number of bodies that are piled up dead in that  place.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">Around 2&middot;5 million people have been displaced and forced to  keep continually on the move in a very harsh equatorial, arid climate. Even  worse, the combatants in the conflict have been using human rights abuses and  violations of the worst kind as weapons of war: systematic targeting of  individuals; the deliberate destruction of homes, grain stores and water  sources; abductions; mutilations; and the systematic use of rape in ethnic  cleansing of the worst kind, with the aim of <span style="letter-spacing:-.25pt; ">driving  out the non-Arab ethnic groups from their villages.</span></p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the role that the UK Government has played at the  United Nations in supporting the special session of the Human Rights Council on  Darfur and in securing United Nations Security Council Resolution 1706, which  has extended the UN mission in Sudan, mandating  it to cover Darfur and calling for 22,500 UN troops and police officers to support the 7,000 members of the  African Union Mission already in Sudan.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">All that work done at the United Nations is right and good.  The problem is that the Sudanese Government have delayed and prevaricated on  the deployment of an effective UN  peacekeeping force in Darfur and imposed preposterous demands, such as  limiting the UN force to African participants only, not wearing the blue UN  helmets, etc.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">It should be accepted that the African Union force is too small to deal effectively with the situation  in Darfur on its own. The only effective force would be a United Nations force. If and when that force is deployed  &mdash; and I hope to God that it happens  soon &mdash; its priorities must include effective human rights protection and  security for those who are most at risk in the camps, towns and villages; ensuring the safe and voluntary  assisted return for the very many displaced people and refugees; and the  disarmament of the Janjaweed Arab militia.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">The Irish Government do  not have the same influence as the British Government; nonetheless they  have used all their influence, particularly in the European Union. The work of  Irish-based agencies such as Concern has been exceptional.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">Darfur, as Members  probably know, borders on Chad and the Central African Republic. One of  the grave dangers of Darfur&rsquo;s conflict is the destabilisation of other  countries in the region. We have already seen some  conflict in Ethiopia and Somalia. A second danger &mdash; hopefully less  likely &mdash; is that the international community  will turn a blind eye, as happened in Rwanda. I hope that that will not  happen.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">We in Northern Ireland have to be aware that the scale of  what has happened and is happening in Darfur far exceeds anything that we can  imagine. The sheer numbers of people and deaths make the situation difficult to  understand.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">I want to mention the humanitarian work and the courage of  the Northern Ireland-based aid agencies, which I know are represented here  today. Banded together they are known as the Coalition of Aid and Development  Agencies (CADA). I am talking about the development and human rights agencies.  I will list them alphabetically: Amnesty International, Christian Aid, Concern,  Oxfam, Save the Children, the Red Cross, Tr&oacute;caire and War on Want. I apologise  if I have left any out.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">Most of those agencies,  which engage in humanitarian relief  work, have been forced out of Darfur by the sheer ferocity of the conflict and, indeed, by the  Government. Some of them have now returned, and I hope that we can  achieve more stability so that they can all go back. They are desperately needed.  Nearly three million people depend on international aid for food, shelter and  medicine. All we can do is support the work of the agencies through our own  financial contributions.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, I hope  that the parties in this Assembly will back the motion. The people of  Northern Ireland are not lacking in compassion and sympathy for those worse off  than themselves. This was evident in our response to the tsunami disaster two  years ago. We are consistently among the  highest contributors to charitable and international development relief  work. The role played by the agencies, by faith-based missionaries and by those  without any faith, over generations, is a magnificent story that has yet to be  told.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">We, the elected representatives of the people of Northern  Ireland, can express what is best in our community by supporting this motion  today. To paraphrase the poet, no community is an island. We all walk in each  other&rsquo;s shadows, whether it is the farmer, the worker, the businessman, the  student, the child, the homemaker or the homeless. We share our common humanity  with the wretched of the earth in Darfur, where completely helpless people are  being destroyed by a conflict that is not of their making. Please support this  motion.</p>
	  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
	  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Moutray</strong>:  The Republic of Sudan is the largest country by area in Africa, and is bordered  by nine other African nations. It has had a troubled relationship with many of  its neighbours due to what is viewed as its aggressive Islamic stance.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">Omar al-Bashir led a military coup in 1989, and since then  has controlled the country, aligning himself with Islamists and others,  including Saddam Hussein and the Taliban.  Sudan has an authoritarian Government, with all effective power in the  hands of Bashir. For 20 years, until 2005, he waged a civil war with Christians  in the south of the country that displaced more than four million people and killed an estimated two million. A peace  treaty was eventually signed in 2005, when it became clear that the south could  not be overrun.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">Sadly, as this conflict abated, another was brewing in the  neglected western region of Darfur, where Arab Janjaweed militia have attempted  to ethnically cleanse the region of its native inhabitants.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">On 9 September 2004, US Secretary of State Colin Powell  called the Darfur conflict &ldquo;genocide&rdquo;, acknowledging  it as one of the worst humanitarian crises of the twenty-first century.  To date, two million people have been displaced and possibly up to 400,000  killed. Despite a peace agreement, brokered by the African Union and signed in May 2006, the Sudanese  Government and Government-sponsored militias have continued to launch  attacks on the citizens of Darfur.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">I had the privilege of visiting Sudan in 2004 as part of a  delegation of politicians. We met many of the Government and opposition groups,  including the Democratic Unionist Party of Sudan. Any similarity was in name  only. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">I found Sudan to be a country rich in mineral resources.  However, Sudan is ruled by an authoritarian, fundamentalist Islamic Government  that is content to inflict Sharia law on the entire population to the extent of  executing juveniles for non-capital crimes. As recently as last New Year&rsquo;s Eve,  police fired tear gas into the Anglican  cathedral in Khartoum and proceeded to  attack worshippers with whips and sticks and to damage cathedral  property &mdash; that is indicative of the levels of tolerance and religious freedom  in Sudan.</p>
	  	<p class="TimePeriod">2.15 pm</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">A small contingent of African Union peacekeeping troops is in Darfur, but is largely ineffective.  A deployment of United Nations troops is needed, as advocated by the  former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan. As recently as last  weekend, there were reports of the Sudanese  Government unleashing aerial bombing raids on refugee camps in the Darfur  region. Time is of the essence. I call upon the UK Government, and all  democratically elected Governments, to bring their entire combined influence to  bear on the Government of Sudan to accept a deployment of United Nations troops  now. I support the motion.</p>
	  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Birnie</strong>: I  welcome the debate and congratulate my colleague from South Belfast Carmel  Hanna on introducing the motion.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">Western Governments, and perhaps other Governments, should  intervene in Sudan. The UK Government have a particular responsibility for two  reasons: first, the United Kingdom is a permanent member of the UN Security  Council; and, secondly, because of the UK&rsquo;s significant historical links with  Sudan. It must be remembered that, for much of the last century, Sudan was, in  effect, a protectorate of the British Empire.</p>
	  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  Hear, hear. At the time of General Gordon.</p>
	  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Birnie</strong>: That is going back even further. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span><span class="Italic"> </span></p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">Mrs Hanna and Mr Moutray have outlined much of the strong moral argument for intervention. The  statistics are frightening: between 200,000 and 400,000 people have died  in Darfur, and over two million have been displaced from their homes. An  enormous population has moved into refugee camps.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">As outlined by the proposer of the motion, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), including  charities such as Oxfam, Save the Children, and many others, have been  doing good work in bringing humanitarian relief to those people living that  extremely precarious existence. However, their work is seriously hindered by  the extent of the ongoing violence in the area. It is a complex triangular  conflict involving the Sudanese Government, as mentioned by Mr Moutray, the Janjaweed militia and a fragmented series of rebel  groups. Some peace arrangements are in place, but they have proved  patchy so far. As Mrs Hanna noted, Darfur is an enormous tract of land &mdash; almost  the size of a large European country.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">The continued failure to co-ordinate an adequate  international intervention to support the stabilisation of Darfur and allow  humanitarian efforts to proceed unhindered represents a failure to learn from  history. The record of the twentieth century in that regard is dismal. The  international community was silent as Turkey  launched what many regard as the first genocide of modern times against the Armenian population during the First World War. In 1945, as everyone should  know, the discovery of Nazi death camps produced the very understandable  reaction of &ldquo;never again.&rdquo;</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">Yet by 1994, in the  space of barely 100 days, 800,000 people were massacred in Rwanda,  largely along tribal lines. That has already been referred to this afternoon. It is significant that a UN stabilisation force  was deployed to deal with that, but, numerically, that force was tiny and was hobbled by inadequate support and equipment.  Indeed, some might say that it was hobbled  deliberately. Its remit, as given by the UN Security Council, was always  going to be extremely limited.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">The difficulties that  were faced at that time have been movingly  described in a book called &lsquo;Shake Hands with the Devil: The Failure of  Humanity in Rwanda&rsquo; by the Canadian General Dallaire, who was the commander of  the UN peacekeeping force in Rwanda. It is worth reading that book to ponder  the implications that that situation has for places such as Darfur.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">We could say, as some people might when they hear about  today&rsquo;s motion, that the part of Sudan that we are debating is a faraway land of which we know nothing. Of  course, those words should be familiar: Neville Chamberlain said the same of  Czechoslovakia in 1938. We all know what that subsequently led to.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">On 17 September last  year, representatives of various international  aid charities and some Churches in Ireland &mdash; and, indeed others &mdash; said  in Belfast that adequate and timely intervention in the region is necessary. We  should take note of that and remember that it was said on the designated day  for Darfur.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, we should ponder the pledge that the United  Nations made on 17 September 2005. That said that the international community  has a responsibility to protect people. That applies even to Governments that  menace the lives and liberties of their own citizens.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">The UK Government secured the passing of UN Security  Council Resolution 1706, which proposed sending a UN stabilisation force of roughly  22,500 people to that part of Sudan. That resolution should be implemented as a  matter of urgency because, although Members have referred to the African Union,  which comprises the roughly 7,000 troops who are already in the region, those  numbers are clearly not adequate to perform the task that is in hand.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">In recent years, Prime Minister Blair referred to Africa as  a:</p>
	  	<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;scar on the conscience of the world.&rdquo;</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">It is time to heal that  scar, and by supporting the motion we at least make a contribution to that,  however small.</p>
	  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I welcome today&rsquo;s motion, and I thank Carmel for  tabling it. I also welcome the fact that we are debating such a serious  issue.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an  r&uacute;n, n&oacute; is &aacute;bhar an-t&aacute;bhachtach &eacute; seo.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in is deeply concerned about the grave situation in the Darfur region of Sudan. It is  particularly concerned about the continued attacks of the Janjaweed militia against the civilian population. That  militia group is supported by the Sudanese Government. Sinn F&eacute;in is also  concerned about other human rights abuses and about the humanitarian crisis.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in supports the central role played by the African  Union and the United Nations in seeking to resolve  the Darfur crisis. As Esmond said, to date 7,000 African Union troops  have been deployed, but, despite their best efforts, they have not been able to  prevent the conflict worsening. The conflict in Sudan needs a political, not a  military, solution.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">The conflict began in 1955, the year before Sudan gained  its independence. It has been going on for all but 11 of the 48 years that Sudan has been independent. To date, the Sudanese Government have failed to  protect their people. Until the signing of the comprehensive peace  agreement, the Sudanese Government and the Janjaweed  &mdash; that Government&rsquo;s militia &mdash; and the Sudan People&rsquo;s Liberation  Movement, spent the previous 21 years fighting a bloody war. Over two million  people died, four million were displaced and over 600,000 people fled the  country as refugees.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">The United Nations has supported a peace process to try to  ensure that there is a political solution and to protect the people of Sudan,  particularly the civilian population. In August 2006, the UN Security Council  passed a resolution to support the deployment of a UN peacekeeping force to  protect the civilian population and to implement the peace agreement.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in welcomes the announcement in December <span style="letter-spacing:-.3pt; ">that the Sudanese Government accept a UN force,  although</span> my party is concerned that  they appear to be pulling back from commitments given. Given the gravity  of the situation, it is essential that the  international community continues to  exert pressure on the Sudanese Government to disarm the Janjaweed  militia immediately and create the  conditions in which there can be a peaceful resolution to the conflict.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">The UN programme is dynamic and includes a comprehensive human rights programme, which  includes the establishment of 12 human rights institutions and a  national human rights centre, monitoring the police and visiting detention  centres to prevent torture and ill-treatment.  It also includes specific training for the police, promotion of the rule of law and an independent  judiciary.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">The international  community must act decisively and ensure that the humanitarian programme  is facilitated and reaches the poorest, most affected people. It is essential  that aid agencies are supported and their work facilitated. Along with other  Members, I commend the work that Irish aid  agencies have done in Sudan and urge them to continue their efforts. It  is worth noting that despite its being a  small country, Ireland contributed more than &euro;16 million in support of  Darfur during 2004-06.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">In the 1980s, I worked  for three and a half years in El Salvador,  Guatemala and Nicaragua. I saw the suffering that people endure during  conflict, particularly women and children.  I saw sights that I never want to see again. When I came home from central America, I worked with Tr&oacute;caire and met some amazing Irish and British  people who were totally committed to alleviating the suffering of people  in various countries throughout the world. I want to pay tribute to people from  across these islands who work abroad for peace and justice, international  development, human rights and conflict resolution.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">The UN has an essential  role in resolving the Sudanese conflict.  During the 1990s, I was proud to be part of the UN-led observer mission in  South Africa when the first free and fair elections were held and Nelson  Mandela was elected President. I remember  feeling proud to wear the blue and white colours of the UN, knowing that  on that occasion, the international community had played an important role.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">I also want to pay tribute to Mary Robinson, who has done  tremendous work throughout the world as President of Ireland and as UN High  Commissioner for Human Rights. She was so effective that some more powerful  Governments did not support her continued role.  I know from experience in many of those countries that she had tremendous support among the men,  women and children who were  suffering from conflict and whose human rights she actively supported.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">One of the most important things that the Assembly can do as part of the international community is  support aid agencies and create awareness of the root causes of  conflict. There is no point in ending a war and not dealing with its causes and  finding ways to resolve it. The international community must shine a light on  the suffering people in Sudan and help  create the conditions for  rebuilding, rather than destruction and death, during the next 50 years.</p>

	  	<p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Wells] in the Chair)</p>
	  	<p class="TimePeriod">2.30 pm</p>
	  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  I support this important motion and commend Carmel Hanna for bringing it to the  House today. Anyone who has witnessed the appalling scenes in this desperate region of the world cannot be  anything but horrified at the suffering of so many people. These are human beings, God&rsquo;s creatures the same as  ourselves. They are inhabitants of our world, and it is important that  we try to help in whatever small way we can.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">In our own country we have many disagreements and  arguments. However, the misery of Darfur and other places makes our squabble  seem almost obscene. I pay tribute to the organisations based throughout these  islands that are working flat out to make things better for those people in  Darfur and in other dark areas of the world.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">I know that the British and Irish Governments are working  to aid this region. However, there needs to be more pressure for the deployment  of a United Nations force in Darfur. What is happening there is an affront to  the rest of the human race, and immediate action is required. The Alliance Party  fully supports the motion.</p>
	  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dawson</strong>:  Throughout human history there are countless  cases of the unimaginable horrors that man can inflict upon his fellow  man. The Holocaust, Cambodia, the former Yugoslavia, Rwanda &mdash; the list is as  endless as it is horrific. The African Union Mission &mdash; a missionary  organisation well known to, and supported by,  many people in Northern Ireland &mdash; has said that the situation in Darfur  is the world&rsquo;s greatest humanitarian crisis,  that the situation in the region is one of genocide, and that the  insecurity orchestrated by Khartoum impedes the delivery of aid. That view is  supported by a House of Commons research paper which states that:</p>
	  	<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;no independent observer disputes that war crimes or crimes  against humanity took place.&rdquo;</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">I was struck by the words of the New York Times journalist  Nicholas Kristof:</p>
	  	<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;In my years as a journalist, I thought I had seen a  full kaleidoscope of horrors, from babies dying of malaria to Chinese troops  shooting students to Indonesian mobs beheading people. But nothing prepared me  for Darfur, where systematic murder, rape, and mutilation are taking place on a  vast scale, based simply on the tribe of the victim. What I saw reminded me why  people say that genocide is the worst evil of which human beings are capable.&rdquo;</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">The little that we know about death and destruction in this  country is too much. However, our experiences cannot compare to the pure terror  that the people of Darfur are enduring, or match the sheer scale of the  situation in Sudan. The number of deaths in Darfur has been impossible to  accurately estimate. The United Nations estimated in September 2006 that  400,000 people had lost their lives. In a region of six million souls, that  represents 7% of the population. Translated into a Northern Ireland context,  that would mean the death of nearly 120,000 people.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">The horror stretches far beyond that butchery. Some two  million people are believed to have been driven from their homes and forced to live as displaced persons in camps  in Sudan or across the border in Chad. More than 3&middot;5 million people are  completely dependent on international assistance for their survival. The misery  of millions forced to live in the squalid conditions  of a refugee camp is compounded by the fact that there is no peace or security there either. Reports are rife  of people being killed, raped and attacked in and around refugee camps, yet  that horror is preferable to returning home, where starvation and slaughter  await.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">It was statistics such as those that prompted the United Nations resolution of 31 August 2006.  However, it is an indictment of the  United Nations, and its member states, that almost five months later,  this African region has had neither the peacekeepers nor the adequate humanitarian  aid that it requires. Sadly, the record of the global community in instances of  genocide is poor, and Darfur is no different.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">What is it about the African continent that puts it beyond  the limits of the international community? We have witnessed the troubles in  Rwanda, Zimbabwe and now the Sudan, and the international community has  signally failed the peoples of those regions by failing to act for their  protection.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">Why are the people of that continent &mdash; and their rights &mdash;  of less importance than the people of Kosovo, Afghanistan or Iraq? The  international community has had no difficulty taking action, up to and  including military action, in those areas, but in Africa, and in the Sudan in  particular, no effective action has been taken.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">This is in spite of the UN&rsquo;s own legal construct &mdash; namely its &ldquo;responsibility to protect&rdquo;. This  responsibility was described in the resolution adopted by the UN General  Assembly in September 2005, which indicated that states are:</p>
	  	<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;prepared to take collective action, in a timely and  decisive manner, through the Security Council, in accordance with the Charter,  including Chapter VII, on a case-by-case basis and in cooperation with relevant  regional organizations as appropriate, should peaceful means be inadequate and  national authorities are manifestly failing to protect their populations from  genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity&hellip;.and its  implications, bearing in mind the principles of the Charter and international  law.&rdquo;</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">I realise that there are nearly as many caveats in that  statement as in the recent Ard-Fheis motion published by Sinn F&eacute;in, albeit that  the UN statement is shorter. However, if ever there was a case for  international collective action, Darfur is it.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">The situation in Darfur is all the more hopeless given that, thanks to its oil reserves, Sudan is  potentially one of Africa&rsquo;s richest countries. That it continues to have  some of the worst development indicators is a disgrace. However, we need to  take note that the Joint Assessment Mission for the Sudan has warned that:</p>
	  	<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Unless the absorptive capacity of the GoSS to handle  reserves is quickly increased, and unless accountable and transparent  governance is developed, oil revenues could &mdash; as happened in Angola and other  post-conflict states &mdash; result in corruption and the entrenchment of  unaccountable elites.&rdquo;</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">Currently, much of the oil is traded with China. Some see  that as one of the reasons why the UN has been unwilling to act. If that is the  case, it is a further indictment of the international community&rsquo;s inability to  take action.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">It seems that while Africa is incapable of being helped,  China is incapable of being touched: it can continue with human rights abuses,  destruction of the environment and the obstruction of an end to genocide while  the international community simply stands idly by. In Sudan, China takes the  oil and pays lip service to UN involvement, but it stands by the Sudanese  Government in resisting the UN peacekeeping force.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">In Darfur, the failure to implement properly the will of  the world community is undermining the excellent humanitarian effort, to which  Members have referred. Humanitarian organisations have been constructing  shelters, building and restoring schools, constructing clinics and hospitals  and providing people with life&rsquo;s essentials, and that work is in constant  jeopardy. Those relief efforts will undoubtedly collapse if security cannot be  established. As the Africa Inland Mission (AIM) reminded us, the Government in  Khartoum is impeding that work.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, although I am always reluctant to encourage  foreign states to involve themselves in the affairs other states, the world  cannot simply turn a blind eye to the  plight of the people in Darfur. Immediate international action is  required. The deployment of the UN peacekeeping force, the support of the  African Union&rsquo;s troops in the meantime and the enforcement of a no-fly zone  can, and will, improve security.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">The pursuit of a diplomatic solution to the conflict must  step up a gear, and the international community must back up its security  commitment with aid that can help the people of the Darfur region to build some  semblance of a normal life.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">I support the motion.</p>
	  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I welcome this motion and hope  that it receives unanimous support from the  parties in this House.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">For a number of years, Sinn F&eacute;in has called for the Dublin  and British Governments to use whatever influence  they have in whatever forums they participate, whether that be the  United Nations or the European Parliament, to help bring to an end the tragedy  that is Darfur.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">In 2005 and 2006, the Sinn F&eacute;in Ard-Fheiseanna passed motions that called on the Sudanese  Government and all other combatants  to comply with the Humanitarian Cease Fire Agreement on the Conflict in  Darfur of 8 April 2004. Sinn F&eacute;in TDs signed an all-party motion in Leinster  House that called for the support for peacekeeping and humanitarian efforts in  the region, and Sinn F&eacute;in MEPs, Bairbre de Br&uacute;n and Mary Lou McDonald,  co-sponsored a similar motion in the European Parliament. It goes without  saying that Sinn F&eacute;in will wholeheartedly support the motion before the House  today.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">I repeat that call for the Sudanese Government to honour  their promises to facilitate the access of humanitarian relief organisations to  the affected populations; to support the work of the African Union to provide  security to internally displaced peoples; and to allow ceasefire monitors.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">In addition, the  international community must continue to provide humanitarian assistance  to the region and support demands for the  establishment of a pan-African criminal and human rights commission. The  purpose of that commission would be to investigate and prosecute the forces,  Government-supported militias and officials that were responsible for the  Darfur massacre.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">I call for the Dublin and London Governments and all Governments worldwide to act decisively to  support the people of that region. There must be an end to the genocide,  and the Sudanese Government must not be allowed to prevent humanitarian efforts  to assist the people of the region.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">The conflict between Government forces, pro-Government  militias and rebels in the Darfur region of Sudan  has led to more than 200,000 casualties and over two million internally  displaced persons and refugees, despite the Darfur Peace Agreement of 5 May  2006.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">The huge political and  media interest in the occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan has  overshadowed the ongoing humanitarian  tragedy in Darfur. Attacks on humanitarian workers have meant that in  many areas their work has ground to a halt, ensuring that the civilian  population continues to suffer. It is  imperative that all Governments impress on the Sudanese Government that  they must accommodate and not hinder peacekeeping and humanitarian efforts in  the region.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">Every effort must be  made to ensure that Sudan does not  slip back into full-scale conflict. I wish to commend the work that has  taken place in an attempt to bring an end to this conflict, and I particularly  commend the efforts of the African Union. It is essential that that work  continues and is built upon and bolstered by the United Nations.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">The international  community must focus on assisting a political resolution to the  conflict. As with our own conflict, that is  crucial if a sustainable peace is to be built, and every effort should  be made to realise the power-sharing provisions of the Darfur Peace Agreement  in a meaningful way.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">The United Nations Security Council Report of the  Secretary-General on children and armed conflict in the Sudan, covering May to July 2006, details incidents of human  rights abuses against children. It focuses on:</p>
	  	<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;the killing and maiming of children, their  recruitment and use as soldiers, grave sexual violence, abductions and denial  of humanitarian access to children, and indicates that these violations  continue in the Sudan largely unabated.&rdquo;</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">The international community must make every appropriate  effort to protect all vulnerable children in areas of conflict such as this and  bring an end to these serious abuses. It should also use every opportunity to remind the Sudanese Government of their  responsibility to protect their citizens from violence and to guarantee  respect for human rights.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">In recognition of that responsibility, members of the  international community should support UN Security Council resolution 1706  (2006) of 31 August 2006 and its  implementation; support the deployment of a United Nations peacekeeping  force to ensure the protection of the civilian population; and the  implementation of the Darfur Peace Agreement.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">I encourage those Governments that have influence over the  Sudanese regime to persuade it to meet its humanitarian obligations and to  respond to the wishes of the international community by committing itself to  taking all appropriate measures to advance the Darfur Peace Agreement. The  violation of children, women and other people in Sudan must stop. Go raibh m&iacute;le  maith agat.</p>
	  	<p class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
	  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farren</strong>: Almost 60 years ago, just three years after the most genocidal conflict in human history, the  United Nations General Assembly adopted the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of  Genocide by declaring genocide to be a crime under international law  that the civilised world must seek to prevent.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">Today&rsquo;s motion directs Members&rsquo; attention to an instance of  ongoing genocide of tragic proportions. As other Members have said, it is good  for us to raise our horizons above our own sordid squabble from time to time,  and to direct our attention to the tragedies that are happening in places such  as Darfur and other parts of Africa, where the scale of human suffering is way  beyond anything that has been experienced here.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">Members know that the Darfur region of Sudan is but one  example of where that has been most evident. Tragically, there is a long list  of instances, particularly in Africa, in which similar atrocities have recently  occurred. In countries such as the Congo, Rwanda, Angola, Sierra Leone, Liberia  and Somalia, the plight of ordinary people has been ignored by those who are  determined to dominate politically and to exploit and plunder their natural  resources.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">The Darfur region of Sudan has been embroiled in a deadly  conflict that has been at its most intense over the last few years, but it has  stretched back over several decades. The stated political aim of the rebels is  to compel the Sudanese Government to address the underdevelopment and political  marginalisation of their region and to allow it to share in the considerable  wealth that the country is capable of generating. In response, the Sudanese  Government, through its regular armed forces and, as mentioned by several  Members, the Janjaweed, have targeted civilian populations and ethnic groups  from which the rebels principally draw their support.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">Article 3 of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights  &mdash; itself almost 60 years old &mdash; promises that:</p>
	  	<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security  of person.&rdquo;</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">However, hundreds of thousands of civilians have  been murdered, and more than 2&middot;5 million people have been displaced into  unprotected camps throughout Sudan and into neighbouring Chad. Article 5 of the  declaration also states that:</p>
	  	<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel,  inhuman or degrading treatment&rdquo;.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">However, hundreds of women are raped or sexually  assaulted every week with no force to protect them. Not since the Rwandan  genocide of 1994 has the world seen such a calculated campaign of displacement,  starvation, rape and mass slaughter.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">The international community has recognised those atrocities  as genocide. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has described  the situation in Sudan and Chad as:</p>
	  	<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;the largest and  most complex humanitarian problem on the globe.&rdquo;</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">The Darfur Peace Agreement, which was brokered in May 2006 between the Government of Sudan and  one faction of Darfur rebels, has not been implemented. Deadlines have been ignored, and violence has  escalated. Infighting between rebel groups and factions has dramatically increased, adding a new layer of  complexity to the conflict.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">As other Members have said, the violence has made it  dangerous, if not impossible, for most of the millions of displaced people to  return to their homes. Humanitarian aid agencies face growing obstacles to  their attempts to bring widespread relief to the region. In August 2006, the  United Nations&rsquo; top humanitarian official  described the situation in Darfur as &ldquo;catastrophic&rdquo;. As a consequence,  some of the aid agencies have been compelled to withdraw, from parts of the  region at least. Only the most courageous remain.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">More than two years ago, the UN Security Council adopted  resolution 1556, which demanded that the Government of Sudan disarm the  Janjaweed. The same demand is also an important part of the 2006 Darfur Peace  Agreement. In August 2006, the UN Security Council took the further step, as  others have said, of authorising a strong UN peacekeeping force for Darfur.  Despite those actions, the Janjaweed is still active and free to commit the  same genocidal crimes against civilians in Darfur, aided by &mdash; indeed, complicit  with &mdash; the Sudanese Government.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">International experts agree that the UN Security Council  must deploy a peacekeeping force with a mandate  to protect civilians immediately. Until it arrives, however, the  underfunded and almost overwhelmed African Union Mission in Sudan must be  bolstered. At present, it is almost incapable of offering any real and  sustained forms of protection. Governments and international institutions must provide and ensure access to  sufficient humanitarian aid for all those in need.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">Despite the grand talk and all the calls for it, we are still seeing insufficient action. That lack of  international action has allowed the  Sudanese Government to continue with what USAID and the United Nations  have called &ldquo;ethnic cleaning&rdquo; in the region. It is obvious that the Sudanese  Government have no intention of stopping their indiscriminate massacre of the  Darfuri people.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">Although the UN regards the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Convention on the Prevention  and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide as major statements of principles to which its member states claim to be  committed, those principles ring hollow and offer no consolation to the people of Darfur if they remain only on  paper and are ignored by the world&rsquo;s major powers.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">We have very little influence; we have no direct  responsibility. We should, however, try to ensure that the British and Irish  Governments at least heed what is being said here. We call on them,  particularly through the European Union, to put economic pressure on the  Sudanese by placing travel restrictions on individuals who are strongly  suspected of involvement in genocide in Darfur. Revenue flows from the  petroleum sector in Sudan should be specifically targeted, and a proportion of them redirected to provide relief in the Darfur  region.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, the International Criminal Court (ICC) should  pursue and extend its present investigations into crimes against humanity that  have already been committed, and should threaten that robust action will be taken against anyone who commits atrocity  crimes in future, in order to  maintain legal pressure on the Khartoum regime. On the military front,  the UN Security Council should back demands that the Sudanese Government cease  offensive military flights over Darfur, with the immediate establishment of a  no-fly zone to deter aerial attacks on civilians.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">It is time to champion the Universal Declaration of Human  Rights and the Convention on the Prevention and  Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, not by words, but, insofar as we  can, by actions. We are compelled by the conscience of the world at least to  highlight this humanitarian disaster, and so help restore dignity and hope to  the suffering people of Darfur. If we do not, we betray our commitment to human  rights and risk compromising the very nature of our own conscience.</p>

	  	<p class="B3BodyText">A child is sent to the pump for water. He carries his tin  can, as he walks with his sister. They hear a noise, and, looking into the distance, they see a man on a horse. The  boy turns to his sister and shouts for her to run. He watches helplessly as the man with a mask lifts his sister. The  boy is knocked to the ground and lies in the dirt while his sobbing sister is  carried away. Planted in his heart, the first seeds of hatred, which will  blossom as he grows, threaten to consume him as he returns to his mother  empty-handed, without the water and without his sister, and so the cycle of  hatred continues in this war-torn country.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">The UN has said that the war in Sudan is the worst  humanitarian crisis in the world. Darfur is a region the size of France and has  seen, since 2003, the deaths of more than 200,000 people and the displacement  of four million refugees to other regions and other countries such as Chad and  the Central African Republic, which cannot take the strain or the attacks from  the Sudanese Government-assisted arm of  terrorism &mdash; the Janjaweed &mdash; who are  now beyond the control of that Government.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">Sudan is in real danger of exploding and destroying  bordering nations, as refugees flood into countries that have neither the  resources nor structure to support them. They flee up to 300 miles on foot.  They walk and run while dragging their children along with them. They have no  food and only whatever water they can scoop up as they go along, while all the  time they are in fear of soldiers from both sides of the divide. They arrive at  the refugee camps exhausted and ill to the point of death, only to find that  there is not enough food, water or medicine.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">In the past week alone,  it has been reported that there have been 200 deaths in Darfur; however,  anyone who knows the reality of the situation there will be aware that the figure is probably closer to 1,000. For  every one skirmish reported, another five take place. That cannot continue. As the nation focuses on the glaringly  obvious catastrophe in Darfur, it must also be remembered that the rest  of Sudan is in crisis. There is little food and a shortage of medical supplies.  The only education that children receive comes from what they see around them:  their mothers and sisters taken and raped; their food and clothing stolen; and  the rampant spread of disease. What kind of  graduates does such an education produce?  It produces graduates filled with hatred, anger and resentment. It  produces a new and even more embittered  generation of men and women who understand only violence and degradation, who know no other way, who have no  hope, and who feel little other than rage and  anguish. That is the future of Sudan &mdash; north, south, east and west &mdash; if  something drastic is not done to end what has been referred to as genocide.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">A former Sudanese slave, abducted as a child, spoke  recently at a rally outside the United Nations headquarters in New York. She  said:</p>
	  	<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Immediate action  must be taken to end the genocide in Darfur. The international community cannot allow another Rwanda to take place.&rdquo;</p>
	  	<p class="TimePeriod">3.00 pm</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">Members have spoken of other countries where similar  problems have arisen, such as Uganda and Rwanda. This is as relevant to us in  the Province and in the UK as a whole as it was to the Americans at that rally.  There is a duty upon the right-thinking people of the strong nations to ensure  that no people is made extinct and that no children are made to see, much less  suffer, the atrocities that are rife in Africa.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">We should have learned that standing by, wringing our hands  and tutting, will not induce dictators and evil men to repent. We must take a stand for those who have no voices, speak out for the rights of the  oppressed, seek truth and justice, defend the poor and needy, lift up  the weak and do what is right. Sudan is  full of needy people, not just in Darfur but in the poverty-stricken  south, which is in desperate need of structure and stability, and grossly  affected by the crippling events in Darfur.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">There has been a peace accord since 2005 uniting the north  and south of Sudan. This made provisions in which the rich north made  commitments to share the oil profits and bring the south out of poverty and  disease, but the leadership has since continued to ignore the needs of the  south. The UN has a responsibility to enforce the commitments made.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">The crisis in Darfur has distracted attention from the fact  that the whole of Sudan is suffering. Christians in the south are being persecuted by Muslims, their churches burnt and their clergy arrested. No infrastructure  has been created, and the people are  continuing to die of starvation and  disease, exacerbated by the problem of refugees from the west and  escapees from war-torn Darfur.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">The African Union has deployed 7,000 soldiers in an attempt  to curb the process, but it has sent them out in smatterings of 100 here and  100 there, with the result that they can make no impact whatsoever on what is  happening in this huge region. The rebels remain determined to fight against  the Government, and the Government seem powerless to dissuade their terrorist army from rape and pillage. That further inflames  anger until there can be no hope of the nation repairing itself. There  can be no hope of the southern province having a more secure future or a chance of regeneration as long as this  level of conflict is maintained. The monster has gone far beyond the  control of those who created it.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">An estimated one million people in Darfur have no access to  clean, disease-free water, food, medication and education. A further one  million have only limited access, and that number will continue to grow as more  and more aid agencies are forced to withdraw from the area. Concern has  recently announced that it has been forced  to pull out its aid workers due to uncertainty over their future, and  other organisations have also been removing their workers. That means that less  food, medication and clothing is getting in than ever before. There is also no  one to distribute it. Conflict between rioting factions arises over control of  the food, and no one is there to ensure that those in need receive help. The  strong use their weapons to take from the weak what was sent especially for them. That cannot continue; aid must  be allowed in, and the UN must be allowed to step up and fulfil its obligations  to this needy people.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">The UN has stated its wish to send approximately 20,000 peacekeepers into Sudan, but the Government  of Sudan have refused. The British  and Irish Governments cannot and must not accept this. The Assembly too  has a responsibility to do all in its power to ensure that this is not just  taken lying down. We must push to do the right thing and send in the  peacekeepers to ensure that vital aid is delivered to the critical areas to  begin the process of rebuilding the nation and to enforce the commitments of  the 2005 peace accord.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">The southern and  western parts of Darfur are entitled to the food, medication and  education that have been promised to them.  For far too long they have lived with the stench of death in every  corner. The time has come for the UN to proactively ensure that the people of  Darfur &mdash; and Sudan as a whole &mdash; have that little bit of security that the force  can bring.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">The time of waiting to see whether the Government in Khartoum will fulfil their obligations is long  past. We have seen how they turned a blind eye and gave backhanders to a  terrorist organisation as it carried out countless  atrocities. We understand that the terrorists are now a complete law  unto themselves, doing whatever they please and accountable to no one &mdash;  especially not those in Government who once supported them. Now is the time for  the UN to do what it was formed to do; to step up to the mark and stand firm  against evil men, no matter what form they take.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">As an Assembly, it is  our duty to do so, and we cannot, and  must not, shirk that responsibility. The lessons of the past must be  learnt well. We must ensure that the 70% of the people of Sudan who do not have  the medication that they need receive it; that the children receive the education that they need to rebuild  the country; that the whole of Sudan  benefits from its rich oil reserves; that focus is placed on the nation  as a whole; and that the full horrors of Rwanda, and other genocides, do not  occur in Sudan.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">I support the motion, but we must keep in mind the valid  saying:</p>
	  	<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Evil triumphs when good men do nothing&rdquo;.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The Assembly must do something and ensure that  something is done.</p>
	  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>: We have heard much about the genocide, horror and human rights  abuses that continue to be perpetrated  against the people of Sudan. Continued urgent action is required by the  British and Irish Governments to ensure  immediate international political action through the African Commission on Human and Peoples&rsquo; Rights, the European Union and the United Nations. They  must address the ongoing conflict, death and destruction in Darfur and  the crises caused through the displacement of families, creating extreme  poverty, denying people access to scarce water supplies, and continuing famine  and malnutrition.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">More than 200,000 people have died, and over two million  people have been forced to flee their homes and are living in makeshift  shelters in crowded camps or massed on the edges of towns and villages in  Darfur and eastern Chad.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">The current crisis started in 2003, when ethnic  African rebels took up arms  against the central Khartoum Government, charging them with neglect. In Sudan,  the Government have been accused of unleashing the Janjaweed paramilitary group  of Arab nomads, which has been blamed for the worst atrocities in the conflict.  Several other tribal militias also plague this vast arid region of Sudan, where  scarce resources regularly pit nomadic tribes against sedentary ones. Many more  people have been affected by the conflict and are now extremely dependent on  humanitarian assistance, as traditional means of livelihoods have been  destroyed by the war, which has been raging for over four years.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">Only last week, the crisis deepened when more than 200  people died in clashes between ethnic African farmers and nomadic Arabs in  southern Darfur. That led the Sudanese Government to send emissaries to try to  reconcile the tribes involved.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">Survival remains difficult and dangerous for the displaced  people of Darfur. The same Government that funded, supported and participated  with the Janjaweed militias to drive the  displaced people out of their villages and lands now refuses to allow  the transition from the current African  Union Mission in Sudan peacekeeping force to a larger and better equipped United Nations peacekeeping mission in Darfur, which  has been mandated by the United Nations Security Council  to protect civilians. The very  Government whose obligation should be to protect their people are  denying them protection.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">Since 2004, after  several African Union Mission in Sudan-brokered agreements, the  Government in Sudan have failed to take effective steps to disarm the Janjaweed. Worse still, the Janjaweed militias are  not only being incorporated into paramilitary organisations, such as the  Sudanese Popular Defence Forces and the Border Intelligence Guard, but it is alleged that they are being brought into the  regular army. Instead of being disarmed, they are being rearmed. Some  observers, such as the victims of the attacks in Jebel Moon, have described  those who attacked them as being armed with brand new weapons and wearing new  Sudanese army uniforms. It has been suggested that the African Union forces now face mistrust on the part of the internally  displaced people of Darfur.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">What can the  international community do to assist the beleaguered people of Darfur? First, all Members of the  Transitional Assembly should unite to condemn attacks that various parties to the conflict have perpetrated against  the civilian population, the personnel of the African Union Mission in the Sudan, and humanitarian agencies.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, we must urge those parties to the conflict that have not done so to sign the Darfur Peace  Agreement and cease the armed  conflict. Thirdly, we must press the Government of the Republic of Sudan  to implement without further delay the  terms agreed to in Addis Ababa on 16 November 2006 for the deployment of  a joint United Nations and African Union peacekeeping force in Darfur.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">We commend the African  Union Mission in Sudan for its work in the Darfur region and recommend  that it continue with its efforts to  resolve the conflict. We urge the Government of Sudan to acknowledge the  report of the African Commission on Human  and Peoples&rsquo; Rights 2004 fact-finding mission to Darfur and submit its  response to the commission.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">If Members believe in challenging human-rights abuses in Ireland and Britain, in upholding the  principles of equality and social  justice, and in upholding the rights of those who are oppressed,  marginalised, attacked or assaulted in our own country, we must urge the  international community and the British and Irish Governments to ensure that  action is taken in Darfur to protect those who are being maimed, pilloried,  raped and displaced daily in Sudan.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">Without a Government to  protect them, the displaced people  of Darfur must look to regional and international organisations to help  them. The Irish and British Governments, the American Administration and the European Union must not be found wanting. The  African Union and the United Nations must help. At its thirty-eighth  ordinary session, the African Commission on Human and Peoples&rsquo; Rights adopted a  very important resolution that called on the Government of Sudan to comply with their obligations under the African  Charter on Human and Peoples&rsquo; Rights. I am conscious that the Minister  for Foreign Affairs, Dermot Ahern, said last year that Ireland would continue  to do all that it could at an international level to bring the violations to an  end. The United Kingdom Government are committed to the Darfur Peace Agreement  and maintain that Sudan should accept a UN peacekeeping force.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">I suggest that the  African Commission on Human and Peoples&rsquo;  Rights should continue to exert its authority by urging the Government of Sudan to ensure the effective  protection of civilians in Darfur and to consent to the deployment of a UN peacekeeping mission. That is now required,  and both the British and Irish Governments must continue to press for that.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">My colleague Carmel Hanna referred to meetings that my  party has had with the Scottish Executive, the Irish Government, and with the  Secretary of State for International Development, Hilary Benn. When restoration of the Assembly is achieved, we must  ensure that we can use some of the money that is given to us to assist  projects in Africa, particularly those in Sudan. We must be able to demonstrate practical and pragmatic  assistance to those people, albeit in a small way. That would be our  commitment.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">I commend the work of the non-governmental organisations  and Third World agencies on the island of Ireland for their work in Africa,  particularly in Sudan. It has been an uphill struggle for those organisations,  but they have shone a beacon of light on the displacement and abuses that have  been perpetrated against the ordinary people.</p>
	  	<p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
	  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Donaldson</strong>:  I commend the Member for South Belfast Carmel Hanna for tabling the motion. As  a Transitional Assembly, it is important that we give thought to the issues  that confront Northern Ireland, which will be priorities for Members and any  incoming Executive. Nonetheless, it is good that we take time out from that to  consider the needs of people in other parts of the world, where clearly there  is suffering. The level of their deprivation as a result of conflict is so much  greater and more pressing than our needs in Northern Ireland.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">It is a human tragedy, and I will not repeat the many incidents and atrocities that have already been  catalogued by other Members during the debate. In another place, I am a  member of the executive of the all-party group on Africa. We have considered  conflict situations in Africa, the impacts that they have on the economies of  countries and the manner in which they undermine democracy. In Sudan, we have  also seen how tribal and regional interests deteriorate into very dangerous  conflict situations, with tragic loss of life.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">I recently read a book about the siege of Khartoum. It was  interesting to reflect that even then, when the Sudanese appeared to be united in some respects against the  colonial forces, there were tribal and regional tensions, and that is evident  today. In Africa, it is so often the case that although democratic countries  have emerged from the colonial past, those democracies are fragile. They are coalitions of various tribal and  political interests that in ordinary situations would be resolvable by  dialogue. Sadly, they deteriorate into violence and conflict, possibly for  historical, tribal reasons.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">So it is with the tragic situation in Darfur, which we have  heard so much about this afternoon. At times &mdash; I am sure that many Members feel  likewise &mdash; I am left wondering why it is that in such conflict situations, the international community at times seems to be  powerless to do anything to prevent them. When such situations do occur,  it is powerless to prevent their escalation. Tragically, we have seen that in  Rwanda and in other parts of Africa, and the situation in Darfur has again  highlighted the inadequacies of the international community and the  deficiencies of the international institutions to cope with conflict  situations. We should be in the business of conflict prevention and not just conflict resolution. As part of an international  community, we should also try to identify where there is potential for  conflict and do what we can to resolve problems before any situation  deteriorates into the sad state that we see today in Sudan.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">We must re-examine those international institutions that have been tested, time after time, in eastern  Europe, the Balkans, Kosovo and  Rwanda, and have been found seriously wanting. Some argue that there are  limits within which the international community must work and that there is a limit to how much involvement  it can have. However, we need to  re-examine those institutions and find out where there is a need to  create or enhance conflict-prevention mechanisms, which ought to be designed to identify regional and international  conflicts, or the potential for them. Systems, procedures and resources  must be available to help those regions and countries to try to overcome their  difficulties without having to resort to conflict.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">The debate should not only be concerned with what we should  do in Darfur to try to resolve a situation that has got out of hand and become  a human tragedy, but about the lessons that  we should have learnt after Rwanda and Kosovo. In reality, however, we  have not learnt that much at all about conflict prevention.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">In the years ahead, we,  as an Assembly, would do well to  consider what contribution we can make. As a region, our influence is  limited, but we have had our own conflict.  Slowly but surely, we are creating the institutions that we hope will not only lead us beyond the  transition from that conflict, but will help to prevent conflict in the  future. If that is the case, and those mechanisms prove to be successful, we  surely have a duty to share our experiences with other parts of the world in  promoting conflict prevention as well as resolution.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">Northern Ireland has its part to play, as does this  Assembly. In due course, I would like an all-party Assembly group to be formed  to consider these issues. There is no doubt  that there is consensus in the Chamber on this issue, and the hon Member  for South Belfast Mrs Hanna should know that this side of the House would be  happy to co-operate in forming an all-party group  that could examine such issues and consider how our experiences might be  shared with other regions in potential conflict situations.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">I hope that the Darfur Peace Agreement will result in a  peaceful outcome, but I suspect that there is some way to go before the  problems are resolved. We have heard of instances of the agreement being  breached and how factions are still engaged in dreadful acts of violence and atrocities against men, women and  children. In time, I hope that those  atrocities will be documented. If war crimes have been committed, I hope  that those responsible will be brought before the international courts and  dealt with in the proper way that helps to resolve conflict, not to exacerbate  or repeat it. That is not retribution; it is about establishing the mechanisms  and agreements that will prevent the conflict in Darfur from resuming.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">I hope that the lessons learnt from Sudan can be replicated  in other areas. There is a need for stronger international  institutions &mdash; not to interfere, necessarily, but to offer, help,  guidance and support in resolving and preventing conflict.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">This debate is a valuable opportunity for us to show that,  in tune with the spirit of the people of Northern Ireland, we have an interest  in what happens in other parts of the world. The generosity of our people never  ceases to amaze me when it comes to giving money, resources and time to help those in need. Many Members have  mentioned the humanitarian aid agencies from this island and within these  islands, especially those in Northern  Ireland, which have made a major contribution in conflict situations to  bring aid and humanitarian care to those in need.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">We in the political realm ought to follow that spirit and  example and consider what we can do to make a contribution in the international  community towards conflict prevention in the future. That would be the best  legacy that we could offer to the embattled and beleaguered people of Darfur.</p>
	  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>: I am honoured to take part in this debate. It is more  important than we realise. I hope that the people  of Darfur, and their families in Northern Ireland, will know that it is  taking place. Given the speed at which the modern media send messages across  the world, I believe that those people will know.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">On a lighter note, I remember that 10 minutes after the little incident that is known as the &ldquo;brawl  in the Hall&rdquo; &mdash; in which I had no part&mdash; I received a text message that  read:</p>
	  	<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Saw you on TV in Cambodia.&rdquo;</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, people will find out about the debate.</p>
	  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  What were you doing in Cambodia? <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
	  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>: I hope one day to go there. It is a beautiful country that has been through terrible conflict.  However, it is now one of the most popular tourist destinations in the  world.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">I take the opportunity to thank the International Development All Party Assembly Group, which was  the only Assembly group to meet during suspension. I pay tribute to  Carmel Hanna, not because she is a party colleague,  but because she rose above party politics and co-operated on that group  with other political parties. I pay the same tribute to the Speaker, Eileen  Bell, who was a tremendous support and who was most helpful in trying to keep  it functioning. Indeed, she was also a member of the group.</p>
	  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Hanna</strong>: The Deputy Speaker was also a member.</p>
	  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>: I  am told that the Deputy Speaker was also a member. That is the last that prompt  I am taking. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">One of the most important things to come out of today&rsquo;s  debate is not simply the call for action on Darfur but the need to plan ahead  for a new Assembly and to ensure, as Jeffrey Donaldson suggested, that a  properly resourced international development group is established. That group  must be allowed to project the high level of humanity that exists on these  islands.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">Other parts of the world suffer as a result of conflict.  Every day I receive messages from Zimbabwe, which was mentioned earlier. I hope  that the people who are responsible for atrocities there are made answerable  for their war crimes.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">My own experience of Africa is centred on Malawi. As Members of the previous Assembly, David  McClarty of the Ulster Unionist Party and I had the opportunity to go to  Malawi and sign an agreement in the former capital of that country, Zomba.  Arising out of that visit, the University of  Ulster, the University of Malawi, local fire brigades, schools, churches  and farming groups came together to identify  projects and parallel committees in their respective parts of the world.  I tell that story to encourage others to promote similar activities.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">My wife spent six weeks last year in Blantyre in Malawi  working as a classroom assistant, and her experience  shows that all that work was beneficial. The local schoolchildren had no  pens, no desks, no chairs and no running water: they had nothing but a desire  to be educated. They benefited from that  arrangement. I am sure that a future Assembly would encourage Northern  Ireland&rsquo;s local councils and other organisations to establish a similar  arrangement. That was a model for perfection, and I hope that it is emulated.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">Next week Members will  have the honour of inviting the Chief Executive of the Zomba Municipal  Assembly to this House. That shows that Members should not underestimate the influence that they have in  other parts of the world.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">Once again I pay tribute to those who, in difficult times, have managed to retain an international  dimension. Referring to Jeffrey Donaldson&rsquo;s speech once more, while in Malawi I was asked: &ldquo;what&rsquo;s in this for  you?&rdquo; That was one of the hardest  questions that I have ever been asked. I had to think carefully about  it, but Jeffrey Donaldson has perhaps provided an answer: Northern Ireland has  had its conflicts and its own problems in the past, but we can learn from other parts of the world, for example their respect  for the environment and the way in which they go about treating scarce  resources; we can achieve a lot from that.</p>
	  	<p class="TimePeriod">3.30 pm</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">We must not forget our young people. Linkages of the kind I  have already mentioned create opportunities for our young people to engage with  the wider world. Increasingly, many of them go to Africa, and other developing  countries, to build hospitals and schools, and to work on other community  projects. It allows people to get beyond the old mite box, where one simply  gave the money and forgot about it. The world is now a smaller place. We cannot  escape what is happening in Darfur, Zimbabwe, Malawi and the other countries, and we can play a very useful role.  Hopefully, after today, we will have laid the foundation stone, not only  to acknowledge the inhumanity that exists in Sudan, but also to make firm  resolutions for a future Assembly, and to ensure that, as in the past, it does  everything humanly possible to narrow the division between the haves and the  have-nots.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">This morning we spoke  about the correlation between social  deprivation and education here at home. The same principles apply in every other part of the world. I know from experience that in Malawi and Zomba, in  particular, where schools have been supported financially to buy textbooks, school equipment and to bore holes for  water, children have the tools to  allow them to go on to further education, to begin to address the  problems for themselves, and to share their experiences with us. I cannot think of a more honourable role in life  than to be engaged in that. Once  again I congratulate Carmel Hanna, who kept this subject alive through  thick and thin.</p>
	  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  There is not very much more that can be said in this debate. I am reminded of  the words of Einstein, who said:</p>
	  	<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;A sure sign of  madness was doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a  different result.&rdquo;</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">That has been the history of mankind. We have resorted to  war, violence, tribalism and sectarianism over and over again, and we have  looked for a different result. However, we are simply mad to expect a different  result. Violence and sectarian division &mdash; whether here or in Africa &mdash; will end  up in tragedy. We have heard a lot about the tragedies of Darfur and Sudan,  which have impeded the growth of that great country for many decades.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">This debate has shed a lot of light on the situation. It  has been tremendously well informed, and Members who have listened to the  debate have learned a lot. The contributions from all sides of the House have  been outstanding, and all parties have created a consensus to try to do  something to assist the people of Darfur in their plight.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">I congratulate my colleague Carmel Hanna for moving the motion, as have colleagues in different  parties. She has done a tremendous service to the House, and reminded  Members of the International Development All-Party Assembly Group, which has  remained intact despite suspension. As  Jeffrey Donaldson said, whenever we  get back to a full working Assembly, that group must be encouraged to  reform and make a contribution to the work of the House.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">Through local government and the Administration that we  will establish, we can make a contribution to all parts of the developing  world, as John Dallat has pointed out. This is particularly relevant to areas  such as Darfur and its regions, because they need practical assistance. We can  give that because we have good people, in all different walks of life, who are  interested in assisting the people in the developing world. We have expertise  in the Water Service, housing, education and medical services, and we can make  contributions on such matters to certain parts of the developing world. We can  contribute in this way to Darfur. We can help to rebuild the infrastructure in  that part of Sudan. Just handing over money is not good enough.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">Many people throughout the world have been very generous  towards us here in Northern Ireland. The European Union, Canada, New Zealand,  Australia and the United States have all been generous to us. We should repay  their generosity.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">A genuine consensus of concern for the developing world,  and Darfur in particular, is evident today right across the House. There is a  generosity of spirit, which is renowned amongst Irish people, whether they come  from the North or the South. That spirit can be seen in the missionary work  that Irish people have embarked upon throughout the world for many decades, for  example. That missionary work, not just confined to evangelising, brought about great benefits in education, medical  and other services, which uplifted people. The contribution was not simply  about religion or proselytization. It tried  to contribute something to many different parts of the world and in  particular to Africa.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">As George Dawson has said, why is it that the world has  failed Africa? I cannot give an answer to that, but he is right to highlight  that failure. We have not mentioned the Congo today, which witnessed the loss  of four million people in a short period of time. The complexity of the problem  there makes it potentially a worse situation than that in Darfur, although some  progress has been made in restoring some form of normality to that particular  country.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">We do owe our help to the people of Africa, because it is our duty as citizens of the world, and as  Christians, to assist those in need. We cannot walk on the other side of  the road. We must help our brothers and sisters throughout the world, as Carmel  Hanna has said.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">Caitr&iacute;ona Ruane pointed out the importance of the United  Nations and how important it is that we support its work. We must support the  creation of a stable and secure region in  Sudan, where people can live in peace. Military  and security must be established in that region. It is also important, and  I must emphasise this, to remember that the  International Commission of Enquiry pointed out in 2005 that there were  many violations of human rights and humanitarian law in this conflict. Indeed,  the General Secretary of the United Nations has a select list of suspects who  could well be charged with crimes against humanity, perhaps even genocide. That  select list has been given to the International Criminal Court. This is an  important process.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">If worldwide legal and  humanitarian standards are to be  established, those who have committed crimes against humanity or against the laws of war &mdash;  particularly those responsible for  genocide &mdash; must be pursued. As Carmel Hanna said, turning a blind eye to  genocide, or to any crimes against humanity, would be a disservice to humanity.  Such crimes cannot be tolerated. Therefore if,  as I hope, prosecutions are brought in the International Criminal Court,  that process must be supported. There must be no horse-trading between the  United Nations and the Sudanese Government or anyone else involved in such  crimes. The UN must not go easy on offenders or withdraw charges that it has  brought before the International Criminal Court.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">Any political solution must include the prosecution of  those who have committed the foulest of offences &mdash; and some horrible offences  have been committed. Se&aacute;n Farren mentioned the systematic rape of women in  Darfur. That is an act of mass terrorism. It is not simply incidental to a battle or the aftermath of a battle: it  is a deliberate policy of terrorism that cannot be tolerated. Therefore it is  important that where there is sufficient evidence against individuals,  prosecutions are brought.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">The International Commission of Inquiry on Darfur  discovered violations of law not only by the regular Sudanese army but also by  Arab militias associated with the central Government, the army and the rebel  forces. No group that is part of the highly complex conflict in Darfur is innocent of crimes against humanity;  therefore it is important to take a balanced approach. Everyone supports a  political settlement in Darfur and will work  to bring that about. However, justice for those who have been so  victimised by the conflict must not be jettisoned. It is important that that  message come from the House. Parties must play their part in trying to bring  about a resolution to the problems in Darfur.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">As Jim Shannon said, the situation in Darfur is the worst  humanitarian crisis in the world today. If so, Members have a solemn duty to  try, in our own small way, to assist. We  will not change the situation overnight. However, if we, as part of the  political process, albeit a small part, make some small contribution, we can  achieve a good result. I agree with Jim Shannon that evil triumphs when good  men do nothing.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">As good men, we must not  do nothing; we must work to achieve a  just and proper settlement to the problem in Darfur. I was alarmed when  Margaret Ritchie said that the Sudanese  Government are in the process of integrating the Arab militia, the  Janjaweed, into the regular army. That sinister development must be highlighted  and opposed.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">It is important to bear in mind the substance of the motion, which is support for the United Nations  Security Council resolution that UN and African Union forces be deployed  in Darfur. That is the only guarantee of the peace and stability necessary to  allow a political solution to be devised.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">We must remember the lessons of Rwanda and of the former  Yugoslavia, and we must remember in dealing  with the situation that the people who committed crimes in those  countries are being brought to justice.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyText">I commend the motion to the House on behalf of its proposer, and I commend the House for its  patience and generosity of spirit in dealing with the motion and for  creating and developing a consensus around the issue. I am sure that those who have suffered deeply in Darfur will  appreciate it.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	  	<p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
	  	<p class="Q3Motion">Bearing in mind the appalling human tragedy in Darfur, this  Assembly calls on all democratic governments, especially the Irish and British  Governments with which this Assembly has particular interaction, to use all  their influence on the Government of Sudan to accept immediate deployment of  the United Nations force in Darfur, as mandated by the United Nations Security  Council.</p>
