I will then  call the Minister to move the second motion, before putting the Question  without further debate.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to four hours  and 30 minutes for this debate. The Minister of Finance and Personnel will have  up to one hour in which to propose the motions and up to one hour in which to  make a winding-up speech.

	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I wish to make it clear to the Minister of Finance and Personnel that he has  one hour in which to speak to the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: The Assembly&rsquo;s main focus today is on the final  spending proposals for the current financial year, and on providing Departments  and other public bodies with the legislative authority to finalise expenditure  in 2008-09. Therefore, I propose to address two important Supply resolutions,  in order to seek the Assembly&rsquo;s approval of the Executive&rsquo;s final spending  plans for 2008-09 and to provide interim resources and funding for the first  few months of 2009-2010, in the form of a Vote on Account.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The levels of Supply set out in the resolutions are  requested under section 63 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998, which provides for  the Minister of Finance and Personnel to make recommendations to the Assembly  leading to cash appropriations from the Northern Ireland Consolidated Fund.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The first resolution seeks the Assembly&rsquo;s approval for the  issue of a total cash sum not exceeding &pound;12,485,717,000 from the Northern  Ireland Consolidated Fund, and for the use of total resources not exceeding &pound;15,730,008,000,  as detailed in the spring Supplementary Estimates 2008-09, which were laid  before the Assembly on 9 February 2009.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The reconciliation from the total resources to the cash sum  required excludes non-cash items, such as depreciation and the cost of capital,  and it includes provision for capital expenditure and adjustments for debtors  and creditors and the use of provisions.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The amount of cash and resources for 2008-09, covered by  the first resolution, supersedes the Vote on Account provision in the Budget  Act (Northern Ireland) 2008, which was passed in the Assembly this time last  year, and the additional provision for 2008-09 in the Budget (No. 2) Act  (Northern Ireland) 2008, which was passed in June 2008.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The second resolution seeks the Assembly&rsquo;s approval on the  issue of a cash sum of &pound;5,618,965,000 and resources of &pound;7,078,596,000 on  account for the 2009-2010 financial year, in advance of the consideration and  approval of the 2009-2010 Main Estimates and the Budget Bill by the Assembly in  June 2009.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Once approved by the Assembly, the resolutions are the  precursor to the Budget Bill, which I plan to introduce to the Assembly later  today. Subject to Assembly approval and Royal Assent, it will provide the  formal legal authority for Departments to incur expenditure for this financial  year and for the first three to four months of the 2009-2010 financial year.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I, therefore, remind Members of the importance of the  Supply resolutions for which approval is being sought today. As Members are  well aware, Budgets, which set spending plans for future years and on which we  rightly spend many hours debating, and the in-year monitoring rounds, which  amend those plans, do not, in themselves, convey cash or resources to  Departments. Nor do they provide Departments with the legal authority to spend  that cash or to use those resources. That will be done today through this  legislature&rsquo;s approval of the Supply resolutions and the Estimates, followed by  the associated Budget Bill. That means, of course, that after the close of the  financial year the Assembly will hold Departments accountable for managing and  controlling that spending and use of resources within the limits authorised  today.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members will be aware of the important role that has been  played by the Public Accounts Committee in ensuring accountability to the  House.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Speaker, I am sure that you will be gratified to hear  that I do not propose to try the patience of the Chamber with the detail of  every Department&rsquo;s spending plans, as set out in the spring Supplementary  Estimates volume that is before the House. Rather, I will leave Members to  study the detail &mdash; as, I am sure, they have &mdash; and at the end of today&rsquo;s debate,  I will endeavour to deal with any issues raised. However, Members will  appreciate that I will not be able to respond to specific departmental queries,  and in such cases, where appropriate, I will ask the relevant Minister to issue  a written response.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As this is only the second time that the House has  considered spring Supplementary Estimates, I will remind Members of two things.  First, the final Estimates reflect the spending plans of Departments &mdash; not the  total spending plans of the wider public sector, including arm&rsquo;s-length bodies.  Secondly, they reflect the annually managed expenditure as well as the  departmental expenditure limits. I appreciate that during Budget debates and  monitoring rounds, the focus is on the assigned departmental expenditure limit,  over which the House has full discretion regarding allocation of spend, but we  must remember that the Northern Ireland Budget also includes approximately &pound;8 billion  of annually managed expenditure for demand-led services, such as social  security benefits and public-sector pension schemes.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In that context, the spring Supplementary Estimates reflect  both the departmental expenditure limit changes that were agreed at the June,  September and December monitoring rounds, and the annually managed expenditure  changes that have been agreed since the presentation, in June 2008, of the Main  Estimates.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Following the decisions that have been taken by the  Executive since the December monitoring round, additional headroom has been  built into the spring Supplementary Estimates in order to facilitate final  decisions in the February monitoring round.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I will provide the House with details of the headroom in  order to pre-empt any misunderstanding by Members or any confusion that might  arise during the debate. Two items of provision have been included that relate  to decisions that have been taken since the December monitoring round and  which, therefore, are required to be included in the Estimates and the Budget  Bill. Those provisions are the &pound;15 million in the Department for Social  Development (DSD) Estimate for the fuel poverty package, and the &pound;3&middot;9 million  in the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development&rsquo;s (DARD) Estimate along  with &pound;2&middot;9 million in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment (DETI)  Estimate for the voluntary cull and disposal scheme and hardship payments in  relation to the contaminated feed incident.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Estimates have also been adjusted to reflect the  changes that resulted from the reclassification of Northern Ireland Water  (NIW). Members will recall that I negotiated the cover for that with the Chief  Secretary to the Treasury and the Prime Minister in respect of the additional  non-cash costs associated with a deferral on the introduction of water charges.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">At the preparation of the spring Supplementary Estimates in  early January, it was thought prudent &mdash; since the Estimates and the Budget Bill  are the final statutory ceiling on spending plans &mdash; to include some headroom  amounting to &pound;60 million in order to provide the Executive, in the current  economic downturn, with the flexibility in February monitoring to make  allocations if resources become available. Such headroom has been included with  strict conditions. For instance, resources that have been allocated in February  monitoring must be used only for the agreed purpose, and virement approval will  not be given later to cover excess spending in any other areas.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Departments have also been advised that inclusion of  headroom is not an indication that additional resources will be allocated by  the Executive where the latest position is clear that resource constraints are  as tight as anticipated by the Executive in December. I am sure that Members  will appreciate the wisdom of that course, and if it had not been followed,  Members would, rightly, be levelling criticism for short-sightedness and lack  of flexibility.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to indulge in a backward look at the financial year  that is fast drawing to a close and which has resulted in the Estimates that  are before the House today. In the three monitoring rounds that have passed so  far this year, a total of &pound;134&middot;6 million of reduced requirements were  surrendered by Departments. As well as reducing the opening overcommitment, we  were able to meet &pound;84&middot;9 million of bids from Departments for emerging pressures.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Estimates include an increase of more than &pound;25 million  in various demand-led social-security benefits that the Department for Social  Development administers.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">12.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In addition to the &pound;134&middot;6 million resource reduced  requirements, Departments declared reduced require&shy;ments of &pound;135&middot;2 million on  the capital side, and bids to the value of &pound;54&middot;6 million were met. In order to  boost capital spend in the current economic climate, &pound;9&middot;4 million was brought  forward from 2009-2010 into this financial year.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members will recall some of the main allocations made  during the current financial year to date, including an allocation of &pound;20  million capital to DSD to assist with the capital-receipt shortfall that the  downturn in the housing market caused. That was provided in order to maintain  the provision of social and affordable housing, and &pound;6&middot;5 million was also  allocated for the special purchase of evacuated dwellings. Recently, DSD has  been provided with the flexibility to move a further &pound;10 million from other  areas of its budget into its budget for social housing. Other allocations  include &pound;20 million capital for the farm nutrient management scheme, which will  have a significant impact for the construction industry at this crucial time;  &pound;5 million to the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development for animal  health; &pound;700,000 assistance for the fishing industry; and &pound;500,000 for flooding  hardship.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Allocations to the Department of Education include &pound;5 million for the extended schools programme;  &pound;4 million for school maintenance; and &pound;2&middot;6 million for part-time youth  workers&rsquo; pay arrears. An allocation of &pound;15 million was made to the Department  of Health, Social Services and Public Safety (DHSSPS) under the first call on  available resources, which was agreed as part of the 2008-2011 Budget. The  Department of the Environment (DOE) was allocated &pound;1&middot;5 million for flood relief  to local councils, &pound;1&middot;9 million capital for the Planning Service computer  system, and &pound;2 million for a shortfall in planning-application income.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">An allocation of &pound;6&middot;2 million capital was made to the Department  for Regional Development (DRD) for Warrenpoint harbour. Other allocations  include &pound;2&middot;5 million for roads&rsquo; structural maintenance; &pound;1&middot;8 million for  public-transport capital works; and &pound;2&middot;8 million capital and &pound;500,000 resource  for the Assembly.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It was agreed that in the 2008-2011 Budget, the Department  of Health, Social Services and Public Safety would have flexibility to manage  spending pressures in its own budget rather than declare reduced requirements  and submit bids. That has allowed the Minister of Health, Social Services and  Public Safety to reduce prescription charges to &pound;3 for each item from 1 January  2009, something that I am sure that all Members welcome.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The past year was difficult, as there was an  ever-tightening fiscal situation, which culminated in the economic downturn  that has gripped the nation and the world. In December, the Executive responded  to the economic difficulties with a &pound;70 million package of measures designed to  support local business &mdash; including the construction industry &mdash; and low-income  households, which included the &pound;15 million allocation to tackle fuel poverty.  Members must not forget that in addition to that, the Estimates for 2008-09  include provision for approximately &pound;2,500 million of social-security benefits  and income support for the people of Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is important to listen to the construction industry&rsquo;s  concerns. As well as bringing forward &pound;9&middot;4 million of investment into the  current financial year, I announced in December that some &pound;115 million of  construction projects that were scheduled to go to the market via the  frameworks will now proceed to tender by March 2009. Therefore, the delivery of  projects is not being held back to cover some alleged hole in the 2008-09  Budget, as was claimed by some but has proven to be spurious. Total capital  investment in 2008-09 is now expected to exceed &pound;1&middot;4 billion &mdash; that is a record  for investment in local infrastructure.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Moreover, industrial rates have been frozen at 30%. Rates  relief is being provided to those in the freight and transport sector, which is  benefiting many of our important docks and transport companies. I have also  announced further support to local business through further changes to the  rating system, including a freeze on increases in business rates next year, as  well as the introduction from 2010 of a rates-relief scheme for small  businesses.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly and the Executive have presided over the  delivery of services in Northern    Ireland, expenditure for which totals almost  &pound;16,000 million in the current difficult financial year. Although there remains  considerable scope for improvement over the current financial year, public  services have continued in an effective manner, unforeseen issues have been  addressed, and assistance has been given to local businesses &mdash; including in the  construction industry &mdash; and to households that the economic downturn and fuel  poverty have affected.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Turning from the current financial year and looking ahead  to 2009-2010, the second resolution that is the Assembly seeks approval for the  issue of a cash-and-resource Vote on Account to continue existing services in  the early months of the next financial year until the Main Estimates and  corresponding Budget Bill are approved by the Assembly. I want to make it clear  that the Vote on Account is around 45% of the final 2008-09 provision for cash  and resources, and is not based on the opening Budget position for 2009-2010  agreed in January last year as part of Budget 2008-2011. In addition, the Vote  on Account is based not only on the departmental expenditure limit on which the  Budget 2008-2011 focused, but on the &pound;8 million of annually managed  expenditure, a substantial proportion of which is spent on social security benefits.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have to remind the House that failure to pass the Vote on  Account resolution would have serious consequences for the delivery of public  services in Northern Ireland  beyond 31 March, and the electorate of Northern Ireland would not forgive  the Assembly for jeopardising that expenditure.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As we look forward to the next financial year, and the  predictions surrounding the global economy, we must recognise the difficult  challenges that lie ahead for the Assembly and the Executive. We must work  together to juggle competing proprieties within a finite Budget to deliver  public services. The current economic situation highlights the importance of  the Programme for Government, with its focus on the economy, and as we continue  with its implementation, underpinned by the Budget and the investment strategy,  endorsed by the Assembly, and endorsed unanimously in the Executive, we have  the opportunity to steer Northern Ireland through the storm that is already  battering our local economy and impacting on households.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Within our remit as a local devolved Administration, we  have been able to respond to local needs, and we will continue to do that in  future.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy  Chairperson of the Committee for Finance and Personnel (Mr Hamilton)</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his opening remarks and his explanation of the context  of the spring Supplementary Estimates and the Vote on Account. I wish to make  some opening remarks on behalf of the Committee for Finance and Personnel, and  if time permits, to make some personal remarks. I will seek to indicate when  that switch is being made, although Members may be able to tell by my more  pronounced gesturing and pointing around the House.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">At its meeting on 4 February 2009, the Committee took  evidence from departmental officials on the spring Supplementary Estimates for  2008-09 and Vote on Account for 2009-2010. On behalf of the Committee, I thank  the officials for helping us to navigate our way through, what are by  necessity, detailed and complicated documents. That evidence session  represented the culmination of a process of Committee scrutiny of the quarterly  monitoring rounds, both strategically and in relation to the Department of  Finance and Personnel&rsquo;s (DFP) own position.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Budget approved by the Assembly in January 2008  contained three-year plans for 2008-2011. The spring Supplementary Estimates,  Vote on Account and associated Budget Bill, which are considered annually by  the Assembly each February, emanate from the agreed Budget. They give  Departments the authority to spend, and they set control limits for  Departments, through which the Assembly can hold Departments to account. The  Committee has approved accelerated passage for the Budget Bill, which is to be  introduced later today, and the Chairperson has written to the Speaker to  confirm that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In layman&rsquo;s terms, the spring Supplementary Estimates  encapsulate the changes in departmental budgets, especially during the  quarterly monitoring rounds. The spring Supplementary Estimates for 2008-09  seek the Assembly&rsquo;s approval for any additional resources and/or cash needed  over and above what was detailed in the Main Estimates for 2008-09, approved by  the Assembly in June 2008.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The spring Supplementary Estimates for this year include  what is described as additional headroom in respect of a number of departmental  Estimates, which will facilitate allocations in the February monitoring round.  The headroom will cover changes since the December monitoring round and areas  where Depart&shy;ments intend to bid for resources in February, provided such bids  have been initially assessed as reasonable and are in areas to which the  Executive may allocate funds, if available. This addresses the timing issue, in  that the Budget Bill, containing both the spring Supplementary Estimates and  the Vote on Account, needs Royal Assent before the end of March to allow  Departments to have the legal authority to continue to spend in the early part  of 2009-2010.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Departmental officials cannot, therefore, wait to finalise  the Estimates until after the outcome of the February monitoring round has been  announced in early March.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The headroom provision means that any funding that becomes  available may be allocated in the February monitoring round, and the Estimates  will then give Departments the capacity to take on and spend that money. If  that headroom had not been built in, some of the Executive&rsquo;s recent decisions,  such as the decision on actions to address fuel poverty, could not be  implemented and accounted for in February.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">When giving evidence to the Committee, DFP officials stated  that that decision was not taken lightly, given the need for Estimates to be  taut and realistic and written to the latest Budget position, which was agreed  in December. However, given the decisions that the Executive have made since  the December monitoring round, it was thought prudent to build in headroom for  this year. The headroom will be used only if allocations are made in February  and, therefore, does not pre-empt Executive decisions. Strict conditions have  been laid out, and the Minister may wish to reassure the Assembly on that  matter later, when he gets a chance to do so.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although total headroom of &pound;342 million resource and &pound;96  million capital has been built in, those amounts may not, in fact, be allocated  in February. The headroom provision may ultimately reflect somewhat on the  accuracy of the Estimates. However, the Committee welcomed the flexibility and  transparency afforded by that approach, and DFP officials assured the Committee  that they have asked Departments to inform their respective Committees of the  headroom that has been built in to the Estimates.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In relation to budgetary changes that emanate from  quarterly monitoring rounds, the Committee for Finance and Personnel has once  again fulfilled an active scrutiny role throughout 2008-09. DFP officials have  briefed the Committee on the Department&rsquo;s position before each monitoring round  and have provided in-depth written responses to the queries raised. Following  the Minister&rsquo;s plenary statement on the outcomes of each monitoring round, DFP  officials responsible for central finance have briefed the Committee on the  strategic and cross-cutting issues that relate to public expenditure.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee worked with DFP officials to develop a  standardised format for monitoring-round information to facilitate Committee  scrutiny of departmental submissions, and it is conducting an inquiry into the  scrutiny of the Executive&rsquo;s Budget and expenditure. Stage three of that inquiry  will review the in-year monitoring process, and in that regard, the Committee  welcomes the fact that DFP is committed to its own review of the process, which  is to be completed by the end of March. The outcome of that review will feed  into the Committee&rsquo;s inquiry. DFP officials have assured the Committee that  movements of money during monitoring rounds are scrutinised &mdash; initially by DFP  and subsequently by the Executive &mdash; to ensure that the Executive&rsquo;s priorities  in the Programme for Government have been put to the fore.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The previous Minister of Finance and Personnel outlined  three possible reasons for the return of funds by Departments: greater than  planned efficiency; the overstating of resource needs upfront; or a failure to  deliver the planned level of public services. I, therefore, repeat the call  that was made last year for Statutory Committees to examine the resources  returned by their respective Departments and to question why they have been  released and whether they have been returned at the earliest possible  opportunity. Returning money on a large scale must inevitably affect delivery,  and the information base must be improved centrally to measure that effect and  to facilitate DFP&rsquo;s strategic challenge function, especially in examining  whether Departments are overstating resource needs when bidding for particular  programmes.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I will now turn to the motion on the Vote on Account for  2009-2010. It is a practical measure that provides for the sums needed to  enable public services to continue during the early part of the financial year  until the Main Estimates and associated Budget Bill are debated before the  summer. I, therefore, support both motions.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I now wish to make some comments in a personal capacity. I  reiterate my comment about the seriousness of the debate. We often hear the  media and the public say that the House does not debate serious enough issues.  However, the budgetary process is the most serious issue that we can debate,  and we will discuss it today, in the two motions before the House, and  tomorrow, in the debate on the Second Stage of the Budget Bill.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Those are serious issues in serious times. I would suggest  that it is no time for silly stunts. Mr Speaker, I would praise you in your  wisdom if you were to rule as out of order &mdash; if it is appropriate &mdash; the  frivolous silly stunt that is the attempt to cut a penny from the Estimates.  That sort of stunt would be more befitting Fawcett&rsquo;s Circus than this Assembly.  Just think of the amount of paper that was printed to inform Members of that  attempt. It cost more to print that paper than would have been saved had a  penny been taken off the Estimates and the Vote on Account. Indeed, if the  Members who put the amendment forward had been strangely convincing enough to  persuade the majority of Members to support their silly idea, infinitely more  than a penny would have been spent on reproducing the very thick Estimates  document, which is published every year and which, of course, would have needed  adjusting.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Regardless of future Budgets or Budget processes, Members  need to get a grip of themselves. I cannot predict what Members will do, but I  have a fairly good idea of how some parties in the House will behave later  today, and they need to get a grip of what is before us. We are debating last  year&rsquo;s Budget, which, as I said, was agreed by the vast majority of Members.  Today, we are trying to formalise our in-year monitoring process and provide  what is known in the vernacular as a &ldquo;cash float&rdquo; for Departments for the next  year so that they can continue with their business.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">12.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members attempted to table an amendment seeking to reduce  departmental budgets by a penny. What they really want to do is to reduce  departmental budgets by more than just a penny. Their calls for the re-writing,  or wholesale redrafting, of budgets would have to be financed by taking money  from other Departments, given that there is no new money, and no desire in any  part of the House to raise money in the midst of a recession through increased  rates or other measures. It must be pointed out that some of the vital public  services that Members cry about needing more money would be hit significantly  by such a reduction, such as the Education Department, which spends huge sums,  or the Health Department, which receives around 50% of the total Budget.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I will give way providing that the Member bears in mind the time that I have  left to speak.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I take the Member&rsquo;s point about frivolous motions on board. In the area that he  has responsibility for, is it likely that Land and Property Services will  implement a new strategy for rating reform that incorporates IT replacement?  Will savings be made in the areas that have been identified, such as IT staff,  software licences and maintenance? Will he be able to make the savings from  accommodation and staff restructuring?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I have absolute confidence in the ability of the Minister and his team to  deliver on those matters. I thank the Member for promoting me &mdash; I am not  responsible for anything. That is a question to ask the Minister at a later  date.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am glad that the frivolous amendment was rejected. Did  the Members who tried to table that amendment ask their Minister &mdash; the Minister  of Health, Social Services and Public Safety &mdash; if he would be happy for &pound;500  million to be taken from his budget to pay for their ideas.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Will Members check that their mobile phones are switched off? Someone is  operating a mobile phone, or has one switched on, which is affecting the audio  equipment.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Employment and Learning (Ms S Ramsey)</strong>: Go raibh maith  agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I apologise for arriving late. I am glad, as always,  to speak as the Chairperson of the Committee for Employment and Learning. The  Committee has noted the Department for Employment and Learning submissions to  DFP, and I will make some observations on the Department&rsquo;s reduced  requirements.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As Members are aware, the Committee has previously stated  that it has issues with the Department&rsquo;s underspends, which it has discussed in  its meetings with the Minister and his departmental officials. The Committee  notes that, although underspends for individual projects and programmes appear  relatively small in comparison with the Department&rsquo;s allocation in this monitoring  round, they are significant as a proportion of the budgets of certain projects  and programmes.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">From its discussions with officials, the Committee has  ascertained that underspends on some skills and work-readiness demand-led  programmes are associated with time lags before participation becomes mandatory  for clients. For example, in this monitoring round, the Department is showing a  reduced requirement of almost &pound;700,000 for the Steps to Work programme, which  has arisen because demand for that programme has not reached expected levels.  That is because it is not mandatory for 18- to 24-year-olds to enter the programme  until they have been on jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance for six months. In addition, that  period is 18 months for those aged 25 and over, which is something that the  Committee queries.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As a result of the time lag and our knowledge that the  number of unemployed people has risen dramatically in the recession, the  Committee expects that funding levels for that and other Department demand-led  programmes on unemployment will have to rise. We emphasise that to the Finance  Minister and urge him to be forthcoming with funds for those important programmes  when increases are required. The Executive are also considering that matter.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">At the same time, the Committee highlighted to the  Department that investment in upskilling and reskilling the workforce must  continue if we are to take the best advantage of the economic upswing when it  comes. A highly skilled workforce will attract foreign direct investment and  other investment. The Committee would support any funding bids that the  Department might make for such programmes. We remind the Minister of Finance of  the commitments in the Programme for Government with regard to upskilling and  reskilling the workforce.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee notes that a number of the Department&rsquo;s  reduced requirements arise from unfilled vacancies, and we are concerned that  the Department is unable to fill those vacancies in this time of recession. We  urge the Finance Minister to take note of the prevalence of the Departments  that are making reduced requirements because of unfilled vacancies. If those  vacancies remain because of skills-gap issues, that matter must be addressed.  It is appropriate that the Finance Minister should address those issues with  his Executive colleagues, including the Minister for Employment and Learning.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We also ask the Finance Minister to be particularly aware  of reduced requirements across the Department resulting from slippage on  capital projects. The Committee for Employment and Learning has taken the lead  on the issue, and we wrote to all the Statutory Committees and their Ministers  urging that capital projects not be allowed to slip and, where possible, pushed  forward.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The construction industry has been one of the worst-hit  industries in the recession, and the Committee is concerned that if the  situation is allowed to continue, we will lose many skilled workers to projects  abroad, setting back the construction industry by years. As always, the  Department can depend on the fact that the Committee will be supportive of its  budget judgements when appropriate, but there should be no mistake that the  Committee has sharp teeth and a keen sense of smell, and we will be looking  closely at all the financial arrangements that come before us. Go raibh maith  agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  The Ulster Unionist Party will not be supporting the Minister today. Our  unanimous view is that what may have worked when the initial Programme for  Government was approved is not working today. Therefore, we cannot endorse what  the Minister asks the House to support, as it is not in Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  best interests. That has been our consistent view. We recognise that the  Minister is also being consistent, albeit consistently wrong. It is a  difference of opinion between us.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The chasm is as deep as the hole that the Minister oversees  in an out-of-sync Budget, coupled to an unfit-for-purpose Programme for  Government. We have consistently asked the Minister &mdash; <em>[Interruption.]</em></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  We have consistently asked the Minister to show us the evidence and the  outworkings to which he gives credibility, to demonstrate that what was  workable in a recession-free period holds good in today&rsquo;s recession-riddled  times and to convince the people who are desperately trying to keep a roof over  their heads and a business solvent that what the Assembly votes for today will  really impact on, and make a difference to, their lives and to their places of  work.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, we would like the Minister to explain why the  dysfunctional, delusional direction pursued through the financial conduits of  the Department keep turning into a blind alley. Last year&rsquo;s routes are blocked,  and we do not hear solutions &mdash; only the re-cooking of last year&rsquo;s recipe. If  the Minister intends to take his party and his Sinn F&eacute;in soulmates down the  tubes of a rollercoaster of financial folly, be my guest, but he will not be  taking the Ulster Unionists with him.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Let us take a good look at the Department&rsquo;s lamentable  performance under the Minister&rsquo;s watch. When I have finished, perhaps he will  tell me if he were in my position, would he vote for more of the same &mdash; targets  in disarray, too many key components running into the ground.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister has lost control of spending. There is no strategy  attached to the strategic stocktake. Shortfalls of the dimension now exposed  will not be met by in-year monitoring, efficiency savings or reliance on  underspends. One day the Minister boasted of a letter dispatched to Ministers  warning them not to overspend, but in a press statement last Friday, the  Minister had crawled back into conceding his dependency on underspending. He  even introduced the abandoning of projects. Which is it to be: Departments  tilting at overspends, or Departments handing money back from underspends? I  will come back to that issue.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">What is all this about cutting projects? Will the Minister  reveal which projects he intends to axe? Surely they cannot include road  improvement: DRD spends 18% of what is spent on road repairs in England. He  cannot axe the &pound;22 million of capital spent on infrastructure projects that has  already been kicked into the next financial year. What are the projects that  the Minister intends to cut, and how do they relate to this debate?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister inhabits his own monetary world, in which  shortfalls are called &ldquo;pressures&rdquo; and new money is called &ldquo;easement&rdquo;. It is a  world of euphemisms.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">How is the Minister feeling today? Is he comfortable with  how the past year has worked out? Are targets safe and set for delivery on  time? Is enough being done to reduce costs? What new ideas does he have for  minimising costs and maximising outcomes? I pose those questions because the  Minister has cocooned himself in systematic denial.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Who is to blame for the millions of pounds overlooked in  the collection of rates? Who was at fault for the &pound;200 million lost in the sale  of the Crossnacreevy plant-testing station? Is &pound;100 million &mdash; or is it nearer  &pound;200 million &mdash; that is balanced precariously over civil servants&rsquo; pay claim?  That will mean a sizeable extension of our loan capacity when the money is  borrowed. Is it possible to borrow money from the Treasury for that purpose?  Can the Minister guarantee that those claims will be met? How does he intend to  pay back that loan to the Treasury, and what will be the repayment timescale?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, there is the remarkable debacle of Workplace  2010, whereby an estimated &pound;175 million of revenue was lost due to what is best  described as incomprehensible incompetence of the worst kind. Was &pound;10 million,  &pound;12 million or &pound;14 million spent on consultants and some kind of golden project  under finders-minders fees? Will the Minister tell us who the lucky recipients  were? Having apparently wasted those millions and lost out on the &pound;175 million  in revenue, will he tell us who took the decision to mothball the Workplace  2010 project? Will he confirm that, long before the decision to pull the plug  was taken, his Department was aware that the two final competitive bidders were  already engaged in talks about a merger?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Is that not a disgrace? Not only has some &pound;14 million that  was spent on dubious fees been wasted, but more than &pound;175 million of revenue  has been kissed goodbye, and another project has been abandoned &mdash; for  refurbishment, so I hear. I wonder where the money will come from to tackle  worn-out buildings and office supplies.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Those are not pressures; the roof is caving in. At least  Obama had the grace to admit that he &ldquo;screwed up&rdquo;. The Minister is in retreat.  He is totally reliant on underspend and hopes that the historic inadequacies of  the Departments will be repeated. That is a solution over which the Minister  should not stand, because such posturing is an indictment of the ineffectiveness  of the financial machine for which he is solely responsible.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Yet the Minister does not come to the House short of  advice, some of which is bound to have made to him many of the points that I  have been banging on about for the past five months; he need only read the  newspapers and the economists&rsquo; forecasts. Perhaps he does not do that. There is  no chance of reducing child poverty by 2011, and little chance of a 50% growth  in creative agencies, realising &pound;120 million of private-sector investment or creating  6,500 new jobs. We must not forget that, just around the corner, are water  charges, and now, we are told, the financing of policing and justice &mdash; another  deal.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The republican/DUP show goes on. They can vote in or out  whatever they can agree on, and the record shows that they agree on a great  deal. However, despite their power, their control of the purse strings and of  most of the Departments, they, like the figures, fall short on solutions.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There has been talk that in some of the advice offered to  the Minister there is a proposal that could bring &pound;50 million into his kitty &mdash;  by way of the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in agreeing to a 1% freeze on public-sector salary  increases and ending bonus payments to senior civil servants. Does the Minister  intend to put such a recommend&shy;ation into action today?</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">12.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We are dealing with a document of substantial reading,  complete with the potential for serious consequences for the Finance Minister  and those who control the Executive. It is a worthy piece of work, and its  author is no secret. Somewhat mysteriously, however, it is stamped: &ldquo;embargoed  until further notice&rdquo;. Can the Minister tell us who commissioned that work, who  placed that strange embargo on it, and when will it be lifted? Has that  restriction got anything to do with today&rsquo;s debate? What does the Minister  intend to do with it?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister has made an about-turn on underspending. In  the interest of public confidence, will the Minister outline where he stands on  underspending? Will he detail any urgent measures that he is considering but,  so far, has not disclosed? That is another good reason why we will not be  supporting the Minister.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  The Assembly is &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order, order. The Member has the Floor.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  nearly had the floor, hopefully, I have now. <em>[Interruption.]</em></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order, order.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  The Assembly is certainly well aware of the concerns &mdash;<em> [Interruption.]</em></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order, order. All Members who want to speak in this debate will have an  opportunity to do so.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I am sure that the clock will be brought back  to zero.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly is well aware of the concerns that the SDLP  has about the budgetary process. It was our desire for a full Budget process in  order to respond in a significant way to the economic downturn. However, we  recognise the importance of the Vote on Account in providing the money for  Departments for the next year, and therefore we will not be seeking to divide  the Assembly on that matter. I hope that that will provide the opportunity for  a reasoned and reasonable debate on the issues. It is in that spirit &mdash; <em>[Interruption.]</em></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order, order.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  am sure that the timekeepers will note that my time is being severely limited.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Within the strategic stocktake, &pound;1 billion of pressures  were not provided for; in response, we were told that half of those pressures  are likely to disappear like chaff in the wind. In a previous debate, I pointed  out that a number of those issues did not look to me like chaff in the wind. In  response, the Minister gave the Mr Micawber answer that something will turn up.  Although we hope that something will turn up, we feel that more is needed.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>A Member</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  involuntarily gave way a number of times and I need the time that is available.  If there is time at the end I will give way, but I doubt that that will be the  case.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There are question marks around the deliverability of the  current Budget, and the capital asset realisation is a major concern. The  investment strategy is very dependent on that, and that problem has not been  quantified. I would be grateful if the Minister would address that concern. A  further major issue &mdash; little discussed &mdash; is PFIs, on which the investment  strategy is very dependent. There is a banking crisis and, surely, those PFIs  must be dependent on funds coming forward from the banks. Again, no information  has been forthcoming on the consequences of that for the investment strategy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I say directly to the Minister; if he is aware of issues of  concern around the delivery of the Budget, I believe that he is under a duty to  tell us now, even if those issues have not been fully quantified.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It concerns me greatly &mdash; and the Assembly should have been  even more concerned than it was &mdash; that the equal pay issue was known to the  Minister concerned six months before he presented the Budget statement but the  Assembly was never given any indication of it. That type of situation should  not happen again.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The strategic stocktake document quantifies the deferment  of water charges as &pound;2 million being lost from the Budget over the two-year  period. It has been estimated that the equal pay issue will cost at least &pound;100  million in back pay. Perhaps that has been provided for, but I want to ask more  about that. If there is anything in excess of that &pound;100 million, it has not been  allowed or provided for. That is a recurrent theme.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to talk about the &pound;900 million that has been talked  about and presented as new funds from the Treasury. It is not new money; &pound;800  million of it is simply extra money that would have been charged in relation to  the accountancy rules because of the deferment of water charges. The Treasury  has simply said that it will absorb that; it is not new money for the Northern Ireland  block. We believe that the &pound;100 million is for equal pay, and I would be glad  if the Minister could confirm that. Does that money have to be repaid in due  course? If it has to be repaid, no money at all is being made available to the  block.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the downturn, it is possible that the rate receipts will  not make the values that had been predicted. I know all about the increased  sums that are coming from what were previously thought to be vacant properties.  In the pre-Budget report, the Chancellor talked about a further &pound;5 billion  being taken out of Budgets as a result of further efficiencies. Barnett  consequentials could follow from that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Previously, I quoted a departmental official who referred  to programmes having run their course and needing adjustment in the light of  the present economic downturn. That amplifies the SDLP&rsquo;s real concerns about  whether the economic downturn is being responded to adequately. I noticed that  the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment was asked about that during  Question Time last week, and she did not give a lot of an answer. She referred  to information seminars, and I give credit to the initiatives that Invest  Northern Ireland (INI) is carrying out. I noticed the elaboration of that  initiative from INI&rsquo;s recent publication, and that it is doing significant work  to give support to companies through current difficulties.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, I do not think that enough is being done. Other  countries have substantial measures on reskilling and on the upgrading of  skills in response to unemploy&shy;ment. That must be replicated, but new measures  are not being introduced in line with those. I worry that strategic focus is  being lost, that not much is being done about the current situation and that we  are losing sight of the bigger picture.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">On 4 February 2009, in a letter to the Committee for  Finance and Personnel about what the Department is doing about Varney II, DFP  stated:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;On the specific request for a paper on progress, this  has been overtaken by external events, particularly the fact that the economic  climate is now materially different from when Sir David Varney produced his  Review in April 2008. The Executive is now focussed on putting in place  measures to address the economic downturn.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I do not see a lot of measures in relation to the  economic downturn, and I am worried by the shift in focus and the fact that we  seem to be losing sight of what needs to be done about the bigger picture and  the longer term.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Invest Northern Ireland  says that Northern Ireland  is now placed 113 out of 203 regions in the EU25 for innovation. That is the lowest place  of any UK  region. It says that Northern Ireland  lags behind the UK  average for entrepreneurial activity. Those are fundamental challenges, which  can be summed up in one word: &ldquo;competitiveness&rdquo;. The global economy has been  greatly shaken in recent times, but it remains a global economy, and the only  future for Northern Ireland  is to compete in that global economy. We need to know that the Minister has his  focus on that, but that does not necessarily seem to be the case.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The First Minister, when he was Minister of Finance, said  that there was no escalator and that we must use the stairs &mdash; the trouble is  that nobody is pointing to the staircase any more. At present, the fundamental  direction must come, in particular, from the Minister of Finance. We are living  through a contemporary crisis that must be ridden out, but we must keep our eye  on what will happen to our companies, businesses and society after the crisis.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Speaker, you and Members might have noticed that, thus  far, I have not mentioned the word &ldquo;housing&rdquo;. I rest my remarks on that  innovative note.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  The motions provide, as Mr Hamilton said, a very important opportunity for the  Assembly to debate the nature and level of public expenditure in Northern Ireland.  At the outset, I declare my intention to criticise the Minister and the  Executive. However, my party is a constructive opposition party and it does not  intend to divide the House on the motions.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  wonder what Ulster Unionist Members are playing at, because the simple fact is  that if the motions are not approved, Departments &mdash; including the two that are  headed by Ministers from the Ulster Unionist Party &mdash; will have no money to  spend from 1 April 2009. I wonder whether the Ulster Unionist tactic has been  approved by those Ministers, who must have signed up to the motions when they  were discussed in the Executive. The Alliance Party does not have such  complications.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is important to acknowledge that the debate is even more  important in the context of the economic downturn. Even the Alliance Party  concedes that the global economic crisis is certainly not the Executive&rsquo;s  fault, but there are important issues to which the Executive must attend.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There are two broad questions &mdash; first, are the Executive  doing everything within their power to mitigate the effect of the economic  downturn on Northern Ireland?  Indeed, the Executive may have particular responsibilities in that respect.  Secondly, are the Executive doing enough to rebalance and modernise our economy  in order to ensure that Northern    Ireland is best placed to take advantage of  recovery, once it comes? My party has had major concerns from the outset about  whether the Budget and the Programme for Government are fit for purpose. Those  questions are even more acute today.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I, like Mr O&rsquo;Loan, believe that contradictory messages are  being sent. The Executive have said that there is no need to reform or revise  the Programme for Government (PFG) or the Budget because both already  prioritise the economy. However, the Varney II Report was dismissed by the  Executive on the grounds that they were already committed to the  recommendations in that report. As Mr O&rsquo;Loan said, the Executive are saying  that they can no longer implement the recommendations in the Varney II Report  because events have overtaken them. That surely begs the question &mdash; of the  Minister and of the Executive &mdash; have events not also overtaken the Programme  for Government and the Budget?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We have been unhappy with a number of the spending changes  made in the course of the year, because we do not believe that they adequately  address the issues that face us.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If Basil McCrea wants me to give way, he is more than  welcome to ask. He is saving himself for later, OK.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We must take account of how other national and regional  governments around the world are responding to the economic downturn. Last  week, the US Congress passed an $800 billion stimulus for the US economy. In  December last year, the UK Government passed a stimulus worth around &pound;20  billion. Our Scottish counterparts &mdash; a regional Government with similar powers  to our own &mdash; have provided their own stimulus in the context of their powers  and responsibilities. The Scottish Parliament&rsquo;s forthcoming Budget Bill makes  provision for &pound;227 million of capital expenditure, including &pound;120 million for  affordable housing.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Unfortunately, I have not included much on housing in my  speech, because I assumed that Declan O&rsquo;Loan would cover that gap, but there we  go.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">1.00 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is interesting that in the Scottish Government&rsquo;s  response to the Council of Economic Advisers&rsquo; first annual report, Scotland&rsquo;s  First Minister, Alex Salmond, said:</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;As Scotland&rsquo;s  government our responsibility is to prioritise action that, in the short term,  mitigates the impact of the downturn while shaping policy that, in the longer  term, ensures Scotland  not only recovers, but emerges stronger&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Certainly, I do not often agree with Alex Salmond.  However, his remark hits the nail on the head as regards what a regional  Government should do. I am disappointed not to have heard such rhetoric from Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  Ministers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Similarly, the Irish Government, Germany  and Canada  have engaged in stimulus activities that tend to share four key elements: to  bring forward investment; to increase social housing; to develop the green  economy; and to introduce tax incentives, which are usually targeted. There has  not been much meaningful action on those issues in Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As regards investment, I note that the Finance Minister has  promised capital spend of &pound;1&middot;4 billion during the current financial year and  has pointed out that that is a record figure. It is a net figure from the  Budget. However, examination of the investment strategy and gross figures leads  one to anticipate that, in budgetary terms, around &pound;5&middot;4 billion of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  money, with a potential additional &pound;450 million, will be spent during the  current three-year period. That amounts to at least &pound;1&middot;8 billion each year.  Therefore, investment is already &pound;400 million less than what the investment  strategy suggested should be spent on capital during the current financial  year.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I understand the Member&rsquo;s point. I am glad that he has, at least, finessed some  of the arguments that he has made previously in the media with regard to  investment of &pound;1&middot;4 billion versus &pound;1&middot;8 billion. Will he accept that net  investment of &pound;1&middot;4 billion is still a record level of investment in infrastructure,  is far in excess of the &pound;1&middot;1 billion that was invested in 2007, and is,  therefore, positive for Northern    Ireland?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  Certainly, I will concede that the Executive are moving forward in the right  direction: &pound;1&middot;4 billion is much more than has been spent previously. However,  it is not as much as the Executive&rsquo;s own documentation sets out. The issue is  whether capital is actually being spent. Obviously, a spend on capital can have  a major impact; it can not only improve Northern Ireland&rsquo;s infrastructure,  but provide people with jobs in the short term. Members must be mindful of  that. The Assembly has slipped back on social housing opportunities. Indeed,  that debate is probably for another place.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There has certainly not been any rhetoric, let alone  action, from the Executive on exploiting opportunities to develop the green  economy through energy efficiency and renewable energies. Energy costs are,  perhaps, the single biggest issue for households and businesses alike.  Certainly, although I recognise and support the &pound;150 winter fuel payments &mdash;  which, I hope, will be paid during winter, rather than spring &mdash; it is worth  recognising that moneys invested in energy efficiency in housing could save  money in the long term for vulnerable people, such as pensioners and others who  are fuel poor. Therefore, rather than focusing on a one-year initiative, a  longer-term view must be taken. Obviously, to make energy efficiency  improvements to homes will provide people with jobs, which is important.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Around 10% of the US stimulus is linked to the green  economy. The UK  stimulus also has a heavy emphasis on the green economy, but has been  criticised widely by several groups for being insufficient. Both of those  policies, however, are ahead of those of Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am critical of the Executive&rsquo;s approach towards tax  incentives, not only as regards opportunity costs for public expenditure that  arise from some of them, but also the danger that there is too much focus on  the spending power of individual households to stimulate the economy. In a  recession, the risk is that people will save money, rather than go out and  spend it. I am not sure that the right balance has been struck between  short-term consumer spending and the broader question of longer-term investment  for the good of the economy. The Alliance Party disagrees strongly with the  Executive on that issue. My party shares many people&rsquo;s concerns about overall  public expenditure and whether the Budget is capable of delivering.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We have not had fiscal stimulus on the scale of many of our  neighbours&rsquo;, and that is a pity. We have a very tight public expenditure  situation, which the Executive did not inherit. The cost of division and of  managing a divided society has constrained our ability to redirect public funds.  However, the Executive&rsquo;s actions and decisions have lessened spending  flexibility even further. They have taken a populist rather than a prudent  approach.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I note with regret the decision to defer water charges for  two years. That may, in itself, be the right thing to do, but, before that  decision was taken, no consideration was given to where the money that will  allow water charges to be deferred is to come from. Much criticism has been  levelled at parties that have made suggestions without outlining from where the  money will come, yet the Executive have done exactly that. They have taken a  decision that is not covered by the Programme for Government without saying  from where the money will come. There must be a single standard in the Chamber.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McQuillan</strong>:  I thank the Minister for bringing the Supplementary Estimates to the Assembly,  and thus providing the opportunity for this debate. We look forward to another  financial year with many opportunities, and we realise that some difficult  choices will have to be made. However, we must congratulate the Executive on  their accomplishments so far this year.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We are well aware that the Supplementary Estimates do not  depend on figures alone. They depend on delivery, together with a strong, sound  stewardship of the public&rsquo;s money. Those are our responsibilities as custodians  of the public purse. With the allocation of resources to the various  Departments, particularly the Department of Finance and Personnel, the  prioritisation of reforms and the modernisation of public services should  ensure that front line services are efficient and deliver the best level of  service for all communities in Northern    Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I place on record my thanks to the Minister for securing an  extra &pound;100 million from the Treasury to deal with public servants&rsquo; equal pay  dispute, which I hope can be brought to a successful conclusion in the near  future. We must improve transportation networks, but we also have a  responsibility to take great care to protect our natural environment and to  develop sustainable energy. That responsibility led to the recent establishment  of the Northern Ireland Environment Agency and the introduction of Planning  Policy Statement 21, which will help rural dwellers and rural businesspeople.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The investment to support the economy, and the development  and maintenance of transportation networks throughout Northern Ireland,  should improve economic productivity and prosperity when the economy recovers.  Members of our older generation can now avail themselves of the improved  transportation networks for free, but they need further encouragement to do so.  We also managed to reduce the number of road deaths in Northern Ireland  in 2008 to 106.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Reflecting on last year&rsquo;s Supplementary Estimates, I hope  that the capital investment issued to the Department for Social Development  during the past financial year will lead to more social housing&rsquo;s being made  available to the various communities that now live in Northern Ireland.  I am pleased that the Minister of Finance and Personnel has provided one of the  biggest health budgets that Northern    Ireland has ever had. Indeed, that has  allowed the Minister of Health to reduce prescription charges, and I hope that  prescription charges can be eliminated in the near future.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The implementation of the Programme for Government, the  Budget and the investment strategy can ensure that we have a strong local  economy, improved infrastructure and improved public services in future. Let us  vote unanimously on the spending priorities and work for all communities in Northern Ireland,  now and in future. I support the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure (Mr McElduff)</strong>: Go raibh  maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh dh&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht an lae  inniu. I welcome the opportunity to speak in the debate. The Committee for  Culture, Arts and Leisure heard from the Department of Culture, Arts and  Leisure on the spring Supplementary Estimates 2008-09 on 5 February 2009.  During the evidence session with departmental officials, the Committee was  updated on a range of adjustments that affected spending profiles as the year  progressed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee took an active scrutiny role throughout the  2008-09 budgetary year. The Department briefed the Committee on its position  before each monitoring round and provided detailed written responses to queries  that Committee members raised. On all occasions, the Committee robustly  challenged the Department to explain its reasons for making bids and  surrendering resources.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee notes that the DCAL spring Supplementary  Estimates detail the plan to decrease provision of the &pound;10 million that was  originally allocated to a multi-sports stadium. Of course, the Committee has a  particular interest in that issue. We have written to Minister Campbell to ask  that he appear before the Committee to explain his plans for disbursing that  money and his decision on the multi-sports stadium.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure will continue  to prioritise its scrutiny of the Department&rsquo;s budget management. In fact, the  Committee recently commissioned the Department to arrange a finance seminar in  order to explain all aspects of the Budget process, including the spring  Supplementary Estimates. That proved to be a useful exercise, and I encourage  other Statutory Committees that have not already done so to explore that  possibility.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As Cathaoirleach of the Committee, I want to declare that  the Committee still believes that the overall allocation to DCAL is inadequate.  The Department is still suffering from the legacy of the past, in which the  Government have consistently undervalued the contribution that sport and the  arts make to health, the economy, tourism, and so on.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In a personal capacity, I welcome the Minister of Finance  and Personnel&rsquo;s comments on the farm nutrient management scheme, which has  inherent environmental and agricultural value. People in the agriculture sector  have told me that it is an important initiative that will generate work for the  construction industry. I want to repeat my stance on the multi-sports stadium:  the decision represents a missed opportunity, has wasted huge potential for the  construction industry and suggests that the Minister lacks vision and a  long-term strategy for sport.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I invite other parties to support Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s call for  greater fiscal powers, including tax-varying powers, for the Assembly. In the  past, that has not always happened, and it is a matter of regret.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Paisley Jnr</strong>:  I will be absolutely clear: Northern    Ireland&rsquo;s economy comes first. That simple  remark trips off the tongue. However, a few years ago, the economy was not the  Government&rsquo;s priority, and most people on the opposite side of the House  claimed that Northern    Ireland&rsquo;s economy was a basket case that  could not be repaired.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the fact that all but one party in the Chamber  appear to recognise that Northern Ireland&rsquo;s economy is the priority and is &mdash;  and must remain &mdash; top of the agenda in the Programme for Government, not  because of an ideological need but because the people of Northern Ireland want  the economy to come first. I am delighted that the Government, through the  Budget and the Supplementary Estimates, are focused on channelling resources,  energy and priorities towards putting the economy and the needs of the people  first. That should be the Government&rsquo;s key priority.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am concerned at the isolationist view that was espoused  by the Member for Strangford Mr McNarry. I am disappointed at the suggestion  that we should isolate the issue and, rather than put the economy first, that  we should have different priorities. The Ulster Unionist Party wanted to table  an amendment that encouraged Members to vote against the Minister&rsquo;s proposals.  Although all Members accept the ping-pong nature of politics in the House, it  would be utter folly not to proceed with the Government&rsquo;s key priority &mdash; which  was agreed by all Executive Ministers who represent the four key parties &mdash; to  put Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  economy first. We must drive forward and deliver on the priorities that have  already been agreed. We must put our hands to the plough, push forward, not  look back and plough a straight and solid furrow for the people of Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the past, a bright idea was mooted to sell Stormont and  lease it back. I am delighted that that bright idea has been switched off.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A big claim was made this morning that the Minister has  lost control of the Budget. That is utter nonsense. The spending supplement  indicates control of the Budget, directed towards the key priority of making Northern Ireland  work.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">1.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Let us look at the facts. They speak for themselves, but  they should be spelt out loudly and clearly: over the next three years, &pound;612  million is allocated to road infrastructure and road building. That will create  employment, generate spend in the economy, and take the economy forward. Some  &pound;647 million is allocated to developing water infrastructure. That will create  jobs, drive the economy forward, and address some of the employment issues that  our country, like other parts of the United Kingdom, and, indeed, the  world, are facing today.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Some &pound;565 million is allocated to primary healthcare and  hospital modernisation, and &pound;855 million is allocated to schools and colleges.  That spells out a very impressive Budget; indeed, it is a plan for investment  of &pound;1&middot;4 billion to &pound;1&middot;5 billion for this year, and will rise to &pound;1&middot;7 billion  over the next year, and &pound;2 billion over the following year. That is an  impressive spending agenda over the next three years, aimed at putting the  economy first, driving employment forward, creating growth in the economy and  making sure that Northern    Ireland is a success.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is disappointing that some people want to pour cold  water on those efforts, and want to turn their eyes against them. It is  disappointing when people want to turn their eyes against spending that sort of  money, and allocating it to projects in our own constituencies, which will  affect us all. In the spending estimate, &pound;265 million in health and social  services will go towards building and improving health facilities at the Royal Victoria  Hospital, the Ulster  Hospital, Downe  Hospital, Altnagelvin Hospital  and Craigavon. That does not affect just parts of the Province; it covers every  bit of it, ensuring that we are seeing that money spent all over the Province.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Some &pound;127 million has been invested in the Belfast sewers  project; &pound;89 million in waste-water treatment projects; &pound;83 million in four  major projects delivered by the Department of Employment and Learning; and &pound;200  million in 14 projects being constructed by the education and library boards.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, I appeal to the Ulster Unionist Party to return  to the position that its own leader espoused less than two weeks ago on &lsquo;The  Politics Show&rsquo; &ndash; and I hope we are on air now &ndash; when Jim Fitzpatrick made the  point that the Programme for Government is barely a year old, and it is clear  now that it is dead in the water. Sir Reg Empey rightly replied that he would  not accept that. He said he believed that a lot of the priorities had been set,  such as putting the economy top of the list, which was the first time that that  had been done in a Programme for Government. That that was the right place for  it to be, that he did not accept Mr Fitzpatrick&rsquo;s position at all, and that he  was wrong.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Well, I hope that that becomes the position of the Ulster  Unionist Party today, and that it holds firmly to that, because otherwise it  would send out all the wrong signals to ordinary Ulster  men and Ulster  women who want to see political unity when it comes to creating employment and  driving the economy forward. I hope that the Ulster Unionist Party reflects on  the position that has been espoused this morning by the Member from Strangford  Mr McNarry and that it follows this particular leader of the party at this  particular time.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, it has been spelt out very clearly that the  Departments have indicated 60 new projects during the current financial year.  That is an aggregated value in excess of &pound;400 million. Those projects will be  advertised by the end of this financial year, and some will have commenced.  They include the South Eastern Regional  College in Bangor,  at a value of &pound;10 million; 10 schools, ranging in value from just under &pound;2  million to the Magherafelt   High School project with  a value of &pound;11 million. In addition to that &pound;400 million, Roads Service is  scheduled to commence the procurement of a new A5 western corridor from  Aughnacloy to Londonderry, which will  represent an investment of some &pound;600 million. That is an impressive work  programme. In fact, there is very little else that could be done.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I note that, even today, the SDLP got away from its mantra  of &ldquo;just build houses&rdquo;. I accept that housing projects are one key element of  moving things forward, but they are not the be-all and end-all answer. Judging  by its silence today, the SDLP has recognised the fact that it is those other  infrastructure projects &mdash; not the one-trick pony of building social houses &mdash;  that will make the lion&rsquo;s share of a difference to Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement and look forward to the  rest of the debate. I hope that it will be recognised that if what is proposed  in the motions is to go forward, all the parties that endorsed, voted for and  approved the Budget last year, and added to the value of this supplementary spending  programme, should walk through the Lobbies and support what the Minister of  Finance and Personnel is doing. They should get behind him and ensure that our  economy is delivered and that Ulster  comes first.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  It is indeed a privilege and an honour to follow the great Ian Paisley Junior &mdash;  former junior Minister, former Executive member and former lots of things. I  have previously recognised his expertise on land and property and all sorts of  things.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am not sure that we are dealing with the real issues  today. I fear that the wheels are about to come off the cart. I say that  because I was at a meeting last week with the Northern Ireland Council for  Voluntary Action (NICVA), which is an illustrious organisation that is full of  good people, all of whom are worried about money and whether there is enough to  keep its member organisations going. I hear concern from the private sector,  many parts of which are experiencing wage cuts and three-day weeks. There is a  real problem.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In an attempt to put things into perspective &mdash; and Mr Farry  encouraged us to look at the international example &mdash; I am told that if  President Obama&rsquo;s fiscal stimulus package were to be imagined as a stack of  $1,000 bills, it would be eight miles high. I was told by some illustrious  people at that meeting with NICVA that the Obama package is not nearly enough;  it is only 10% of what is required.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister of Finance and Personnel talked about people  working together; I am interested in that proposal, but if we are to do so, it  is important that we understand all the facts and figures. I am concerned that  when we look at the background of deteriorating public finances, those facts  and figures cannot help but have an impact. In his pre-Budget report in 2008,  Alastair Darling said:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;having carefully considered the extent and the limits  of efficiency savings, today I can announce the Government will now find an  additional &pound;5 billion of efficiencies in 2010/11.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">If we have to take our share of that, I am sorry to  say that there will be difficult decisions to make.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: Will you propose that?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Yes, but if it happens, it is a difficulty, is it not?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: For you.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Absolutely. The issue, since the Minister brings it up &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I will talk about public-sector spending, as the Minister has brought it to our  attention. The Government are now projecting much slower growth in public  spending over their next spending review than in any previous years; slower  even than that experienced during the 18 years of Conservative Governments from  1979 to 1997. In real terms, the increase in growth of 1&middot;1% a year would  represent a cut in public-sector spending. The squeeze on Whitehall Departments  may be even more severe, given plausible scenarios for security and tax-credit  costs.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">For those Members who have not yet talked about housing,  the Institute for Fiscal Studies, in its Green Budget 2009, said:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Capital-intensive departments, such as transport and  housing, are likely to suffer more than most due to the planned cash freeze on  investment spending.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There are some other issues for Westminster.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Paisley Jnr</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I will give way when I have finished this point.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Paisley Jnr</strong>:  Just on that point about the Estimates.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  That was not a yes, but as it is Mr Paisley Jnr.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Paisley Jnr</strong>:  I appreciate the Member giving way. It is clear that some of the issues that  the Member mentioned are not even covered by the Spring Supplementary  Estimates, because they are Northern Ireland Budget matters. Northern Ireland  Estimates do not cover the provision of the Northern Ireland Office on the  three matters that the Member mentioned. There should be some recognition of  what we are debating today.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  When a Member gives way it is, normally, for a helpful intervention, and I  suppose that that is stretching things a wee bit. The point of the matter is  that I fear &mdash; however it is dressed up &mdash; that we do not have sufficient money  to meet our obligations. I have asked &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  Will the Member give way on that point?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Please just let me finish.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I am sorry, Mr Speaker.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: He  is in bad humour today.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  The Speaker?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  No; you.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  The issue is about whether we have sufficient money to meet our obligations. I  look at the planned efficiency savings for the Department for Social  Development, for the Department of Education, and for the Department of Finance  and Personnel itself and I fear that they are not going to be met.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">All that I ask is that the Minister provides some sort of  steer about whether or not we have a problem. If we have a problem, it is incumbent  on all Members to identify the issues and to work together to try to resolve  that problem, because if tough decisions have to be taken, that can be done  only through consensus. Only if we all agree that there is a problem, and only  if we all agree that cuts have to be made, can cuts be made. However, if we do  not have to make cuts, that is great and let us say so.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I thank the Member for his honesty. He, at least, is a shining light on his  Benches in that he freely admits to the fact that the outworkings of what he  and his colleagues are suggesting are cuts to existing Budget lines.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Has the Member spoken to his party colleague the Minister  of Health, Social Services and Public Safety and worked with him to help to  identify lines for cutting? Furthermore, if the Member is talking now about  difficulties that are being faced with budgets, how difficult will it be for  Departments by the summer, if he and his colleagues persuade a majority of  Members to stop funding for Departments, which will be the consequence of their  voting against the motion today?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  The issue, as the Member well knows &mdash; and I can quote Gershwin; sorry, that is  a piano player. I mean the other guy. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: Does the Member mean Gershon?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I thank the House for its help on that. However, Sir Peter Gershon warned, in  2004, that there was a point at which front line public services would be  affected by efficiencies. However, the then Chancellor of the Exchequer vowed  that he would not go beyond the savings identified.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, let us be honest about this issue. If 80% of our  budgets are largely, so to speak, people-orientated, there comes a point when,  if efficiencies are driven home against a backdrop of rising costs and a  failure to take in those efficiencies, a situation will be created whereby the  ends of the rope do not meet. I do not want to get to that situation. I want to  understand the challenges that we face so that we can find a way to deal with  them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As part of my remit with regard to education, I note that  one of the Department&rsquo;s efficiencies is to reallocate or reduce staffing  numbers to reflect the demographic downturn. I also note that the strategic  stocktake places pressure on the Department to find money to do that. In other  words, we do not have the money to get rid of staff and we do not have the  money to keep them. That is a ridiculous situation and is grossly unfair on the  people involved.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">No Member has yet mentioned the Department for Social  Development. However, it is clear from the figures that the Assembly will not  be able to put in place the type of capital expenditure plans that it had  hoped. We must be honest about this issue. Perhaps it is time to work together  as a collective team &mdash; the Assembly and the Executive &mdash; and work out which  elements we can afford and which we cannot afford. It is just not sufficient  simply to put our heads in the sand and say that we think that everything will  be OK.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the past, Mr Hamilton and others argued about the  difficulties of the process, and that perhaps each Department must be left to  try to find its own efficiencies, and that, collectively, we might be OK.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">1.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">When one considers the numbers, however, I am not sure that  that could be done, given the challenges that face us and the likelihood that  the situation will get worse. More to the point, I call on the Minister of  Finance and Personnel to clearly and concisely explain &mdash; in language that  everybody understands &mdash; whether we have a problem. Are there issues on which we  could work together to try to resolve the pressures? Are there decisions that  although not being terribly palatable, must be made by somebody? I believe that  that is what the people of Northern    Ireland seek from us. They want genuine  leadership; they do not want to hear fudge, fuddle and a belief that everything  will be all right on the night. We should work together to defend the core  services on which people very much depend.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Enterprise,  Trade and Investment (Mr Durkan)</strong>: When Basil McCrea expressed a particular  interest in what Gershwin said, it led me to wonder whether we were witnessing  a &lsquo;Rhapsody in Tory Blue&rsquo; today as part of the new UUP position. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Obviously, the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Investment does not  have a view on the question of the spring Supplementary Estimates and the  Supply resolution. However, the Committee considered budgetary matters on a  number of occasions, including monitoring rounds, and several issues that arose  should be reflected in today&rsquo;s debate.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the context of the global downturn &mdash; which was not  predicted or anticipated when the Budget was set &mdash; perhaps there should be some  re-factoring of expenditure in relation to economic support. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. The Member has the Floor.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Enterprise,  Trade and Investment</strong>: Our Committee recognises that that does not just mean  re-factoring some of the priorities in the budget of the Department of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment, but in the Budget more widely. The Committee  recognises that matters of economic development extend to other Departments,  such as the Department for Regional Development, which deals with key  infrastructure; the Department for Social Development, which deals with housing  issues; and &mdash; very importantly &mdash; the Department for Employment and Learning,  which deals with the skills agenda and the challenges that we face as a region.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">When making a number of my points, I will not pretend to  confine them purely to DETI. I hope to reflect the spirit of comments that were  made by members of the Committee. In relation to the current economic  situation, there seems to be less of a demand on the budgets of DETI and Invest  Northern Ireland  in relation to foreign direct investment. That has given rise to questions  about whether that money could be better used in other ways, either in the  Department or more widely &mdash; by making economic interventions.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A number of issues that were identified by Committee  members involved last year&rsquo;s decision to withdraw the &mdash; albeit small &mdash; grants  for business start-up. In the current circumstances, people will question  whether that is a tenable decision and whether we should review it. In many  ways, we should revamp the whole notion of financial support for people who  start up businesses. Perhaps we should revisit whether a new menu of grants and  support should be available to businesses that are trying to sustain themselves  through the current difficulties and that have the potential to grow beyond  them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In particular, we should consider whether support should be  available to companies that have demonstrated that they can grow in current  circumstances. In some cases, those companies are suffering from tax being  demanded on the one hand, and credit being denied on the other. There is no  means of supporting those companies when the grants are gone. In the current  circumstances, we must consider whether we could make available a menu of  grants to allocate money that will not be used for other economic-development  purposes during the downturn.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Similarly, issues have been raised regarding Invest  Northern Ireland  and its performance. Many people have asked fundamental questions about whether  the project that was to be achieved through the merger of LEDU, the IDB and the  Industrial Research and Technology Unit (IRTU) has lived up to its promise. We  were told that it would operate at arm&rsquo;s length, outside the Civil Service  culture, and that it would be much more market facing and market orientated.  However, few people seem to have that perception or experience of Invest  Northern Ireland  as it currently operates. In the current circumstances, those questions are  being asked more sharply.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Of course, the Minister has established a review.  Initially, its terms of reference appeared to be centred on Invest Northern Ireland and  some related matters. However, those terms of reference have sensibly been  widened to consider not just the performance and structure of Invest NI&rsquo;s  engagement with DETI, but how well it meshes with other key Departments and  agencies in order to support economic development. The Committee for Enterprise, Trade and  Investment looks forward to the developing work of that review, and it has  already had some engagement with Professor Barnett and other members of the  review team. That engagement will continue, and the Committee will support the  Minister in encouraging the review to be radical, far-reaching and timely in  delivering by the summer.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee hopes that the review can offer longer-term  recommendations for the shape of economic-development policy, including a  strong, active and responsive support system for enterprise and business, as  well as ensuring that the Assembly&rsquo;s actions do not get in the way of business.  It is important that devolution provides the business community with the sense  that public policy and the Government are at their backs, rather than on their  backs, and that is why we must review the regulatory framework, which can  create burdens.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, the Committee hopes that the review will  produce some short-term recommendations, particularly in response to some of  the suggestions offered by its members.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">With respect to some of the wider issues that have been  mentioned, Ian Paisley Jnr pointed out the importance of investment in  infrastructure generally, and he emphasised the high level of investment to  which the current investment strategy is committed. Of course, I and the SDLP  welcome that commitment. As someone who attempted to put in place a platform  for an investment strategy, and having emphasised the need for significant  investment in capital programmes and the need for a central driver with which  to do so, I welcome the commitment, and the conversion of other parties, to  that concept. Initially, those parties railed against it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Nevertheless, our capital-expenditure programme still  suffers from delivery sclerosis. Some Departments have delayed investment  plans, and when investment plans have been produced, their target audiences  have been unclear, they have been incompatible and they have lacked a coherent  approach.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, there is a question about whether the  Strategic Investment Board (SIB) has the capacity to drive and marshal  capital-expenditure performance throughout Departments. In addition, there is  an issue with underperformance and under capacity in Departments, so, rather  than pumping up Departments to do that, we must consider ways in which the  Strategic Investment Board can be restyled and reshaped in order to carry out  the necessary tasks for the Departments &mdash; not behind their backs or in  opposition to them, but in order to deliver the investment strategy that has  been set out. If the Executive and the Assembly have been happy to endorse the  broad priorities and the key projects of the investment stategy, they should  have no problem with delegating the strategic management of that programme to  the relevant public body, rather than attempting to carve up bits of it for  Departments that are underperforming and failing to deliver.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the current economic circumstances, we make no apologies  for stressing the fact that capital investment in social housing is a key  economic primer. We are not saying that that should be at the expense of other  capital investments, but we are saying that it would provide a ready  multiplier; getting the work on social housing going will get wages flowing  throughout the region. Moreover, social-housing projects can be delivered much  quicker than other projects. If it is there as an early win or as an easy,  ready fruit for us to pick during this difficult season, we should avail ourselves  of it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Some Members have asked how the Budget will be changed if  it is re-prioritised or revised. I remind those Members &mdash; particularly those in  the DUP &mdash; that, recently, they have tabled a number of motions that call for  changes in the Budget. Last week, Iris Robinson, in her capacity as Chairperson  of the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety, tabled a motion  that stated that some parts of the Health Service should be ring-fenced from  the efficiency savings. That motion called for a change in the Budget, because  it imposed efficiency savings across the Department.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The DUP has also tabled a motion on home closures, which  will be debated soon. It follows the same theme; it is asking for a change in  the Budget. Previously, Sammy Wilson called for the Minister of Education to  change the Budget when she did not have the power to do so. Sinn F&eacute;in is also  calling for changes to be made to the Budget in relation to ambulances.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, Members should not ask questions of the SDLP  that they are not prepared to answer themselves.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Recently, the re-prioritisation of the  Budget, the Budget allocations and the Programme for Government have been a  source of debate inside and outside the Chamber. There are many outstanding  concerns about whether the priorities have changed. Some of those concerns are  genuine, but it must be understood that there will be no programmes or services  delivered unless Members support the two motions that are before the House.  Members must keep that in mind when they are making their contributions.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The fact that we have to work within the inadequate block  grant that we receive from London  is one of the main barriers to bringing forward anything, particularly in the  current economic climate. Furthermore, our lack of fiscal and tax-varying  powers means that we are working within certain parameters that confine us and  prevent us from developing the innovative measures that are required to offset  some of the issues relating to the financial difficulties that we are in.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The economic downturn presents the Executive with a number  of difficulties &mdash; in particular, the need to offset any further job losses, to  secure the jobs that exist and to create new jobs, as other Members and I have  mentioned already. Most people will agree that unemployment and poverty &mdash; and  the fear of poverty because of unemployment &mdash; are the real concerns facing  people and their families.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that we maintain our skilled workforce, and  we must look beyond the current economic downturn. We need to work together to  consider how we can maintain those employment levels. Mention has been made of  the way in which Invest NI looks at foreign direct investment. However, we must  build our local businesses and ensure that they are kept open and that people&rsquo;s  jobs are secure.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">At a time of economic downturn, it is important that a  Budget considers the people who need support. On 26 and 27 January 2009, the  Assembly debated the Financial Assistance Bill. There were delays, but it must  be remembered that many people need the &pound;150 to which they were entitled to pay  for their fuel. It is important to remember such situations when issues are  being debated, because we must be seen to provide leadership; that is what  people want us to do.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is an issue about the availability of finance and  credit, and the access to working capital, particularly for businesses here. As  many Members have said, it is imperative that banks and other lending  institutions are challenged about their current lending. That challenge must  come from the British Government and from local Ministers. Businesses and  consumers have not yet felt the benefit of the injection of public money that  was intended to steady the banks.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A lot of banks are now under public ownership, and many  others are being supported with millions of pounds of public money; therefore,  they have a responsibility to ensure that the money that they are receiving is  going directly into the local economy. We all know from people who have  contacted us that, currently, the biggest problem for businesses is securing  working capital and cash flow.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">1.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We need to work within our parameters. The fact is that  there is no new money; therefore, it is important that we find innovative ways  of spending the money that we have. The answer is good housekeeping and finding  initiatives that will help us to spend the money that we have in the best way  possible.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Recent initiatives that reduce the risk for banks &mdash; such as  the enterprise finance guarantee scheme and the small firms finance scheme &mdash;  need to be taken-up and rolled-out by the banks here. A lot of those schemes  are not having an effect on the ground, and we must ensure that they come into  place and are running smoothly.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As has been mentioned, Departments have a responsibility to  ensure that underspend is kept to a minimum and that their capital and revenue  projects are taken forward. Departments can, sometimes, be slow in doing that.  I know that planning is a big issue for some of the large capital projects,  particularly those funded by private investment. We must consider how planning  is holding-up that process.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Improving the delivery of public procurement by providing  good services and works can help the economy and local businesses and can also  secure jobs for people, which is an important issue. By ensuring that social  clauses are embedded into all public procurement contracts, we can help to  tackle poverty and need by sustaining current employment and by creating new  employment opportunities for people who may be wondering whether they are going  to have the money to meet the requirements of everyday living.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, public procurement is very important,  particularly in relation to small- and medium-sized businesses and  social-economy enterprises. As recently as last Friday, we heard a report about  the increase in house repossessions. Nothing has a greater impact on a family  than having a house repossessed. Therefore, we must bring forward initiatives  such as adequate mortgage-rescue plans. Earlier, it was suggested that Members  may be a wee bit concerned about mentioning social housing, but I am going to  mention it because it is very clear that a need for social housing still  exists. There is also a need for people who want to buy their own homes to be  able to secure the finance for a new mortgage.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that we think outside the box and roll out  initiatives that can operate within the existing constraints. Unless we do so,  it will simply be a case of same old, same old. Increasing the funding in areas  such as co-ownership schemes can encourage first-time buyers to take the risk  of buying. At the moment, people are afraid of taking risks and they cannot be  blamed for that. We need to drive forward the social housing programme and  deliver the investment strategy, and the way that we can do that is by ensuring  that Departments are bringing forward their planned capital projects.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The construction industry would be helped by such projects  being undertaken; we must remember that approximately three quarters of the  people who are becoming unemployed are from that industry. Therefore, that  would provide an overall level of help. We must regard the current economic  climate as a challenge to achieve the best possible outcomes in the here and  now.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We must also look beyond the current economic downturn. The  Programme for Government is good, but we must ensure that it is delivered in  the way that people are expecting. That is, it must provide for the delivery of  high-quality public services, the development of the economy, the building of  prosperity and the redressing of the inequalities and disadvantage that still  afflict substantial portions of our society.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is important to remember that people were in poverty  even before the economic downturn. We must ensure the best use and allocation  of resources in the short term and the long term towards that end.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is good to have a debate, and it is good that we are  able to come to a place such as this and have our say. In the current climate,  the best way forward is a united response from all the political parties in the  Assembly and the Executive. We must get away from narrow politicking and  debates and focus on real issues, which may be a matter of life and death for  some people. We are where we are; we may not like it, but we must push forward  together in a united way, and send people a clear message of leadership.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Social Development (Mr Simpson)</strong>: I wish to comment on  behalf of the Committee in respect of the Supply resolution for the 2008-09  spring Supplementary Estimates. The Committee scrutinised carefully the  Department for Social Development&rsquo;s submissions for each of the monitoring  rounds. Reviewing the Department&rsquo;s plans in these challenging economic  conditions has been illuminating, and something of an education for Committee  members. The Committee has asked many questions and where the Department has  answered satisfactorily, I thank it for that. However, there are a few issues  on which the Department has yet to provide complete answers. Budget scrutiny,  in these difficult times, tends to be a work in progress.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the monitoring round submissions, the Department has  identified serious challenges to its budgetary planning, not least in respect  of the social housing development programme. That programme has to deliver  1,500 new social housing starts in 2008-09, and it appears likely that that may  not be achieved. It also appears that Housing Executive home improvements and  maintenance programmes may miss their annual targets.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Behind those problems, and overshadowing the financing of  social and affordable housing for years to come, is the collapse in house and  land values. I do not know whether the Department could have anticipated the  extent of the collapse in land and property receipts. However, I know that it  warned consistently of the pressures on its budget throughout the financial  year, and the Finance Minister is aware of that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee has considered at length the mitigating  actions that the Department has adopted. It makes little difference whether  they are called surrenders or reallocations &mdash; the upshot is the same. The  budget for the Social Security Agency is around &pound;80 million less in 2008-09.  That reduction is mostly in capital areas, but includes some resource. Around  &pound;50 million was reallocated from the social security jobs and benefits offices  capital programme to rescue the housing programmes, and &pound;30 million went back  to the centre.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is a measure of the depth of the housing crisis that  that reallocation &mdash; or whatever one wants to call it &mdash; appears to have been  insufficient on its own to keep the social development housing programme on  track for this year. Indeed, the Department has already asked for additional  headroom of &pound;30 million in order to bring the new housing starts programme in  on target. The Department has also asked that &pound;10&middot;5 million be reallocated from  urban regeneration programmes to support the Housing Executive housing  maintenance and improvement programmes.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, the Department has asked for approximately &pound;8 million  extra for anti-fuel-poverty payments. The Committee supports the proposed  reallocation, the request for headroom and the bid for the anti-fuel-poverty  payment. However, the Committee has several concerns. First, that the social  housing development programme be supported and achieve its targets for this  year. The Committee believes that if that programme is sidetracked, or even  temporarily derailed now, it will be very hard to restart and reach its final  destination of 10,000 new social and affordable homes by 2013.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee&rsquo;s second concern relates to the programmes  from which money has been transferred. In particular, I refer to the jobs and  benefits office capital works and other social-security resource requirements.  Jobs and benefits offices have never been busier than they have in recent  times. The decision to use the capital and resources from social security to  support housing may have appeared to have been a good decision earlier this  year. However, the economic situation has thrown up more challenges than  expected. Some Committee members are concerned that there may be adverse  implications for the provision of essential social-security services just when  the need is greatest. As the Deputy Chairperson of my Committee said during the  debate on the strategic stocktake on 27 January 2009, the problems facing the  housing budget are significant, and not only for this year.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It could also be argued that the Department appears to have  stored up more trouble for itself for next year, in the shape of the  significant deficit in the social-security capital-project fund, which I  mentioned earlier. That issue has arisen at a time when there will surely be an  awful lot of demand for social-security services over the coming months, if not  years. That is a difficult budgetary situation. The Committee will continue to  scrutinise the Department for Social Development&rsquo;s spending plans. As I said,  it is a work in progress. Committee members will continue to challenge the  Department&rsquo;s decisions. We will look for method in its reasoning and prudence  in its choices.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Department for its improving responses to the  Committee&rsquo;s queries, and I also ask that the Minister of Finance and Personnel  note the Committee&rsquo;s concerns, as set out today.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. It was interesting to listen to Stephen  Farry talk about fiscal stimulation. I am not sure how that is possible when  one does not have fiscal control. However, that may be a matter for another  day.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive and the Assembly are confronted by many  political and financial realities, and all Executive policies must have at  their core fairness, inclusion and equality. We are faced with the economic and  political realities that prevail, and we must recognise that. Unfortunately,  because of the inadequate block grant from the British Government, we must  continue to try to deal with limited resources while having increasing needs.  As my colleague Jennifer McCann said earlier, there must be a united response  from all the political parties to the economic realities that we face.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is incumbent on us to deliver for the most disadvantaged  in our society. The Executive and the Assembly must ensure that regional  inequalities are eradicated. The decentralisation of public-sector jobs is essential  if disparities and imbalances are to be redressed and if balanced regional  development is to be supported. The Bain Report on the relocation of  public-sector jobs supports that decentralisation, yet the Social Security  Agency&rsquo;s strategic business review, which is under way, appears to ignore that  report. That issue must be confronted and addressed urgently.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Neighbourhood renewal, if properly resourced, is an  effective way in which to target social need and help the most disadvantaged  communities. The Department for Social Development is intent on transferring  neighbourhood renewal to local government. If that happens, proper  infrastructures must be put in place so that the transition can be seamless.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">An interdepartmental approach to implementing a sustainable  and effective anti-poverty strategy must be taken, and there must be a  continuation of the pledge to eradicate child poverty by 2020. It must be  recognised that the current economic downturn will have a much more serious  impact on those who are already in dire need, and the alleviation of their  problems must be a priority so that when recovery comes, they can enjoy the  benefits that come with it. There must be a continuing commitment to support a  social economy and sustainable community development. The provision of social  housing must continue to be a priority. Action can and should be taken, even  within current financial constraints, to provide social housing.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister for Social Development needs to stop blaming  the Executive and get on with the job with which she has been tasked. All Departments  want more money, but if it is not forthcoming, they have to get on with it and  make the most of their resources.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">2.00 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The regulation of private landlords must be a priority and  will go some way in alleviating financial hardship for those people who rely on  that sector for their housing needs.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Equality for people with disabilities must be delivered and  their rights must be protected. Those people have the right to education,  employment, housing, healthcare and adequate transport. The role of carers  needs to be recognised, and they should be properly recompensed for their vital  role.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Proper financial support for the community and voluntary  sector must be implemented, and their skills and expertise should be fully  recognised. In the long term, that will provide some money for Departments that  are involved in the delivery of similar services. Social justice needs to be  the key phrase, and its provision to everyone in our society will show that the  Assembly can be effective and make a difference to people&rsquo;s lives. Go raibh  m&iacute;le maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mrs I Robinson)</strong>:  I welcome the opportunity to speak in the debate. As the Minister of Finance  and Personnel explained, although there are two motions before the House on the  spring Supplementary Estimates and the Vote on Account, there is a single  debate.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The spring Supplementary Estimates reflect the cumulative  changes from earlier monitoring rounds, in which Departments either bid for additional  resources because of new pressures or release any excess funds when it was  clear that they will not be used. However, the Health Department is in a unique  position, because it was given first call on available in-year moneys of up to  &pound;20 million under the comprehensive spending review. Therefore, it has not  taken part in the monitoring rounds to date. The Department has received &pound;15  million and expects the remaining &pound;5 million from this exercise. The full &pound;20  million has been factored into the Department&rsquo;s spending plans for the year.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As other Departments have been through the various  monitoring rounds in the year, their respective Committees have, perhaps, had  more of an opportunity to examine their financial pressures and easements. The  slowdown in the growth of public-sector funding in recent years, which led into  the last Budget negotiations, has meant that all Departments have to manage  with less funding and are all feeling the pressure. The current financial  crisis has added to that pressure. As Members are only too well aware, all  Departments are required to achieve significant efficiency savings to make ends  meet.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Spending on health accounts for by far the largest portion  of public funding &mdash; around half of the total public expenditure or &pound;4 billion  from the &pound;8 billion total. However, it is worth remembering that although all  Departments are required to make the same percentage level of efficiency  savings &mdash; 3% per year &mdash; that is a significant sum for the Health Department and  has the potential to make a considerable impact on the level of health and  social care services provided through the community.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Over the past number of months, the Committee has taken a  keen interest in examining and challenging the efficiency delivery plans  throughout the Health Service. The Committee heard first from the Minister and  then from the main trade unions. Over the past few weeks, the Committee has  been hearing from individual trusts about their detailed proposals, which is an  exercise that will be completed in a couple of weeks. The Committee also tabled  a motion that was debated in the House last week, which called on the Minister  to ensure that implementation of efficiency savings will not result in cuts to  vital front line services. The motion, which also highlighted the need to  protect the most vulnerable in our community &mdash; children, people with  mental-health problems and older people &mdash; was, thankfully, carried.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members will agree that making efficiency savings is a  demanding and challenging exercise for all involved and it takes place in a  particularly difficult financial climate. Any reductions or cutbacks in  services are likely to add to the difficulties that our communities already  face. The Health Committee will continue to monitor that issue over the coming  months.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I will now change my hat from that of the Chairperson of  the Health Committee to that of the DUP&rsquo;s spokesperson on health. For the  record, I regret the attitude of my Ulster Unionist colleagues. If they do not  support the motion, they will prevent moneys from going to Departments after 31  March. It is a pathetic and childish attempt to undermine the work of the  Executive, bearing in mind that the Ulster Unionists are represented on that  Executive. It is one thing to disagree, but all concerns and issues are raised  and dealt with in the Executive. This is a mandatory coalition. It is perhaps  not the most perfect set-up, but, until we have a voluntary coalition, all four  parties are tied to the decisions that are made and signed off.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McGimpsey boasted that he could gain additional funding  after the draft Budget was signed off by all four parties, and it was open for  Departments to put in bids for additional moneys. Indeed, he has been heard all  over the airwaves boasting about how he could draw down and extract more money  from the Minister of Finance and Personnel.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Just over a week ago, Sir Reg Empey said on the radio that  we did not even need a debate today because the issue has been agreed, and it  has all been tied up. Therefore, I am wondering where the Member for Strangford  David McNarry is coming from and what support he has from his party. The leader  of the Ulster Unionist Party, Sir Reg Empey, is saying one thing, yet one of  the less prominent Members of the party is speaking out. I wonder whether it is  sour grapes or whether the whole party will put its hands up and oppose the  motion.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The country is in a dreadful situation &mdash; as is the rest of  the United Kingdom and the rest of the world &mdash; with the current economic  downturn, yet for the sake of a headline, the Ulster Unionist Party is prepared  to say that it does not support the Executive, even though it is part of that  Executive. It will leave the electorate scratching their heads and wondering  what sort of representatives they have in the Ulster Unionist Party.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If the Budget does not go through, we will face meltdown  because of the impact on Departments after 31 March. Departments will have no  money. What are they going to tell the electorate? I cannot wait to hear the  leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, Sir Reg Empey &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am speaking, Mr Speaker.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>A Member</strong>:  Calm down.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  They should calm down and perhaps take a pill.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Sir Reg Empey has one view, and I cannot wait to hear how  he is going to explain to the voters and taxpayers of Northern Ireland  &mdash; who are facing the credit crunch with great difficulty &mdash; that the Government  have no money. I support the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Regional Development (Mr Cobain)</strong>: The Speaker will be  glad to hear that I am not going to try to explain that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As the Chairperson of the Committee for Regional  Development, I am pleased to contribute to the debate on the spring  Supplementary Estimates for 2008-09 and the Vote on Account for 2009-2010.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister for Regional Development wrote to the  Committee last week setting out the main changes arising from the June,  September and December monitoring rounds, and they are reflected in the spring  Supplementary Estimates for 2008-09.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister also identified a number of areas where  additional headroom was included in the Department for Regional Development&rsquo;s  spring Supplementary Estimates. Those areas include &pound;2&middot;5 million for a possible  allocation to Roads Service for structural maintenance in the February  monitoring round; &pound;900,000 to allow a possible transfer from DSD to Roads  Service in respect of the neighbourhood renewal strategy in the February  monitoring round; &pound;38&middot;5 million for Northern Ireland Water&rsquo;s accelerated  programme facilities; &pound;55 million for Northern Ireland Water&rsquo;s revolving credit  facility; and &pound;400 million for adjustments that may arise following the in-year  reclassification by Her Majesty&rsquo;s Treasury of Northern Ireland Water.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee for Regional Development scrutinised the  quarterly monitoring rounds in 2008-09 and responded to the Department on the  specific bids and easements contained in each monitoring round return. Arising  from that work, the Committee identified several issues of strategic concern,  which, in my capacity as Chairperson, I want to raise.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is the responsibility of the Executive to resolve  pressures on the DRD budget arising from the ongoing deferral of charging for  the provision of water and sewerage services. Although the Committee awaits a  more detailed briefing from the Department on the consequences of Her Majesty&rsquo;s  Treasury&rsquo;s in-year decision to reclassify Northern Ireland Water, I am pleased  to see that headroom provision has been made to address that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">During monitoring rounds, and also on the Floor of the  House during debates on the Budget and on the Programme for Government, the  Committee raised the need to provide adequate and timely funding for structural  maintenance. Funding for structural maintenance must be adequate, in that it  approaches the funding levels that are set out in the independently audited  structural maintenance fund plan. This year, funding reached less than 60% of  the recommended level, and a slight improvement is due next year. In the  in-year monitoring rounds of previous years, DRD was successful in attracting additional  funding for structural maintenance and bringing spending on it closer to the levels  that are recommended in the structural maintenance funding plan. However, that  is not the case this year. I reiterate the Committee&rsquo;s view that light of  current budgetary pressures, it is no longer acceptable or prudent for the  Department to rely on in-year monitoring to fund structural maintenance  programmes.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Spending on structural maintenance must also be timely. At  the earliest possible point in the financial year, DRD has to ensure that the  structural maintenance industry has the capacity to deliver. The Committee&rsquo;s  arguments &mdash; based on road safety and the value-for-money benefits arising from  a proper level of structural maintenance &mdash; are well rehearsed. In addition &mdash;  and in the current economic climate &mdash; adequate and timely spending of  structural maintenance will go some way to assisting the hard-pressed  construction sector.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to make some further points as an MLA. The majority  of people who rely on front line services are socially and economically  challenged. In these increasingly difficult times, they continue to rely on  those services to provide for many of their basic needs. Pensioners, the  working poor and near-benefit-level families will be hit hardest if we continue  with the status quo.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I provide the following examples. All the authorities on  housing agree that we need between 2,000 and 2,500 new social homes to be built  each year in Northern    Ireland to meet increasing demand. With the  economic downturn and the job losses that will result, that figure will  increase. It was disappointing that in the Programme for Government, we were  promised only 1,500 new social and affordable homes each year; it is  unacceptable that there will be a 40% cut in that figure, which will result in  the building of only 800 to 900 social and affordable homes, which will  increase homelessness. More families will have to turn to the private sector  where, in order to get a house, they will have to subsidise their housing benefit.  That will result in more families living below the poverty line.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Continuation of the fiscal status quo will ensure that  there are other negative impacts on housing. The Housing Executive does not  have the available moneys to repair and maintain buildings. People are living  in deteriorating accommodation: kitchen replacements have stopped; units for  people with complex needs and those who require care in the community have been  shelved; and external cyclical maintenance schemes have been suspended, which will  have an unacceptable impact on older people and those with special needs and  physical disabilities.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">No one in the House can defend that position. We are  failing some of the most vulnerable people in society. The Minister for Social  Development has been hamstrung by the DFP decision, and people will continue to  suffer because of it. We are told that, each year, 1,000 people die of  cold-related illnesses, and vulnerable people are now marginalised simply  because the Executive &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">2.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  I do not disagree with what the Member has said &mdash; most Members would argue that  there needs to be an effective social house-building programme. Does the Member  agree that over the past two years, the majority of the social housing  programme has been made up of houses bought on the open market, or apartments  bought off the shelf? That does nothing for family housing.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Regional Development</strong>: Mr McCann makes a fair point. I  am not really concerned whether houses are bought or built; I am concerned that  there are sufficient homes provided by the state for people who need them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Programme for Government made a commitment to reduce  child poverty by half by 2012, and to eradicate it by 2030. I think that  everyone would agree that those figures are laughable. The number of children  living in severe poverty is increasing and under the current circumstances,  will continue to increase for the foreseeable future. OFMDFM&rsquo;s reaction to that  has been deplorable, and the priorities of the Minister of Finance and  Personnel do very little to relieve the plight of those people.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The recent Financial Assistance Bill promised &pound;150 for  pensioners who receive pension credit to help with heating through the winter,  and that was pushed through the House using the accelerated passage procedure.  We were told that that had to be done so that the money could be paid out in  time for Christmas. Committees were not allowed to hold the Department to  account.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson of  the Committee for Regional Development</strong>: Go ahead, Milton.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I note the reference to Milton Friedman; at this point in the day, I would take  any lunch, never mind a free lunch.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Can the Member tell me how the Financial Assistance Bill &mdash;  which provided for a payment of &pound;150 to people on pension credit or income  support &mdash; could be rushed through before Christmas, when the legislation came  before the House after Christmas? His friend the Chairperson of the Committee  for the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister can clarify that  for him.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Regional Development</strong>: The Member should talk to his  colleague junior Minister Donaldson.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If we do not hurry up and pay out, pensioners will be using  the money for their summer holidays instead of their winter fuel bills. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Regional Development</strong>: Water payments are now  inevitable due to the Government&rsquo;s placing of Northern Ireland Water back under  DRD&rsquo;s control. That will result in capital asset payments in 2011. Make no  mistake, if water charges are introduced, everyone will have to make a  contribution in the form of a payment for water, even those people who have  never before had to do so. People living on benefits did not have to pay for  water or for rates; however, if water charges are introduced this year, that  link will be broken &mdash; every individual will have to pay a charge for water. If  water charges are introduced, pensioners who receive pension credit, which the  Government say is a safety net, will have to pay water charges. The Executive  are saying that they know better.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member must bring his remarks to a close.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Regional Development</strong>: There was an intervention, Mr  Speaker.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  There is no extra time.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development (Dr W McCrea)</strong>: I  speak as the Chairman of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development,  and I speak for a community of which I am very proud. As always, the Committee  has been relentless in its robust scrutiny of departmental accounts, and we  endeavour to ensure that budgets are met in a prudent manner in accordance with  the departmental aims and objectives within the strategic plan.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">This year has been difficult for the agriculture sector,  and the farming community has found itself under mounting pressure to ensure  that it is compliant with the European nitrates directives. Previously, I have  presented to the House the Committee&rsquo;s thoughts on the severe accounting  failure of the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development in respect of  that matter, and the severe impact that that has had on the Northern Ireland  economy. I will not repeat those comments today.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, the Committee has been supportive of the  Department of Agriculture and Rural Development and the Department of Finance  and Personnel in their attempts to ensure that the Department of Agriculture  and Rural Development&rsquo;s original underestimate of the cost of the scheme has  been rectified. The Committee notes the previous increases of the budget and  the additional &pound;29 million that is noted in the Estimates. I thank the Minister  of Agriculture and Rural Development for that additional finance, which is a  fulfilment of the promise that was made by the previous Minister, who assured  the Committee that that finance would be provided.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee welcomes that additional money and calls on  the Department to ensure that it takes all necessary action to get the money  out to farmers as quickly as possible. A past failure has been that although  the money has been made available, the Department was slow in getting it into  the pockets of the farmers who faced the expenditure.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee recently received a presentation from the  Department on the February monitoring round and was surprised that the  Department had not identified any reduced requirement in respect of its budget.  The figures that the Department presented showed that it still had some &pound;90  million of its budget to spend from December 2008 to March 2009. The Committee  is concerned at that, given the Department&rsquo;s track record in surrendering  moneys too late in the day for other areas of the economy to make use of those  moneys. That is evident in the last provisional out-turn, when a total of &pound;31  million was returned by the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee will continue to monitor that closely and  ensure that the Department does not break the assurances that it has provided  to us and to the industry. The industry cannot afford for moneys that are  desperately needed for investment being returned because of the inefficiency of  departmental accountancy processes. The Committee genuinely hopes that the  Department achieves its budgetary targets and that its historical habit of  returning significant sums of public money out of the industry and the Northern Ireland  economy has ceased.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee notes the additional sum of &pound;12&middot;5 million for  the cull-and-disposal scheme, the hardship payments and animal disease  compensation. However, the Committee believes that the Department has lost the  opportunity to address the difficulties in each of those areas appropriately.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department&rsquo;s counterpart in the Irish  Republic acted immediately to the  dioxin scare by going to Europe to seek a  substantial hardship compensation package amounting to &pound;180 million. Although  the additional &pound;12&middot;5 million is welcome, it does not address the full cost of  the scare to the industry, and we must continue to pursue fervently whatever  avenue is open to us. That includes that of the Irish Republic,  where the problem originated and which has a duty to pay for the disaster that  came out of the dioxin scare and that which followed from it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee calls for a compensation package for those  who were severely impacted by the severe flooding of August 2008. The  Department&rsquo;s response was to put a business case to DFP that stated that there  was no economic case for compensating farmers who are now struggling to support  their families and their businesses. That was a despicable statement; instead  of providing appropriate compensation, the Department of Agriculture and Rural  Development suggested in its business case that it would be preferable to allow  those farms to go out of business since larger, stronger businesses would take  over the land.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department then plucked a figure of &pound;500,000 and  presented that to the Executive as being sufficient to cover costs that it  considered to be in excess of &pound;1 million. That has resulted in farmers with  losses approaching &pound;50,000 receiving less than &pound;7,000 as a hardship payment. I  am sad to say that it was not the Executive that were to blame for that, but  the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development. The &pound;7,000 is undoubtedly  welcome, but it falls far short of what is needed to support the sector.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In respect of animal disease compensation, at every  monitoring round, the Committee is presented with the spectacle of the  Department taking its begging bowl to DFP in search of more money. Disease  compensation for bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis costs the Northern Ireland  economy more than &pound;60 million a year, but what does that achieve? Departmental  figures indicate that the brucellosis level remains static and that the  incidence of TB is increasing. That is happening despite the Department&rsquo;s  defined disease-reduction target in the Programme for Government.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee recently considered the Diseases of Animals  Bill, and it will recommend to the House that the Committee undertakes an  inquiry into how to compel the Department to implement a TB-eradication  programme. In years to come, such a programme will allow for the positive  release of moneys back into the Northern    Ireland economy, instead of pouring them  down the drain in compensation for diseases that should, and could, be  eradicated.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We cannot continue to allow public finances to be wasted.  We must take action beyond spending money foolishly on studies into subjects  about which we already know the answer, such as the &pound;6 million that the  Department will spend on studying &mdash; rather than tackling &mdash; the prevalence of TB  in badgers. The farming community is not only alarmed, it is disgusted by the  inaction. The Department must use money proactively to protect the industry and  the public, and to enhance the Northern    Ireland agriculture sector and the wider  economy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I stated that the Department does not have a good record in  managing its budget. However, at this stage, the Committee gives it the benefit  of the doubt. The Committee notes and welcomes additional bids made in respect  of matters that are key to the industry, and calls on the Department to keep  its side of the deal by ensuring that those moneys are fully spent on supporting  the vital agriculture industry.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I will speak personally for the final minute of my speech.  We are living in challenging times. Issues relating to pensioners, people with  special needs or learning disabilities, and children who live in poverty must  be tackled. As a public representative, I find it appalling that the Department  of Health, Social Services and Public Safety is recommending the closure of  acute services at hospitals in Whiteabbey and in Mid Ulster; the closure of old  people&rsquo;s homes; and the closure of special homes, such as the one at Cherry  Lodge in Randalstown, with the loss of vital services for the most deprived  children.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We must be very careful. I want those in the House who  object to the Budget to answer a simple question. As members of the  Conservative Party, and in the midst of the difficulties that we face, where  would they make cuts? The cuts in services across the water that the  Conservative Party is recommending would have a major effect on the Northern  Ireland Budget and on the spending that is available to keep our residential  homes and hospitals open, and to maintain our services to the community.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  As Question Time commences at 2.30 pm, I suggest that the House takes its ease  until that time. The debate will continue after Question Time, when the next  Member to speak will be the Chairperson of the Committee for the Environment,  Mr Patsy McGlone.</p>

	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">1. <strong>Mr  McQuillan </strong>asked the Minister of Education what meetings she has had with  Autism Northern Ireland  in the last year.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2046/09>(AQO 2046/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education (Ms Ruane)</strong>: Cuirim b&eacute;im l&aacute;idir ar ghn&eacute; na riachtanas speisialta  oideachais go ginear&aacute;lta, an t-uathachas san &aacute;ireamh.

	      <p class="B3BodyText">Special educational needs, including autism, are a  particular priority for me. The ongoing review of special educational needs and  inclusion is of great importance as my Department strives to improve the  current special educational needs and inclusion framework.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As Members will be aware, my Department organised a  North/South conference on autism, which was held in Croke Park.  It brought together specialists, experts, professionals and parents from  throughout the island   of Ireland. A follow-up  conference will take place.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">On 16 May 2008, I met members of the south Down branch of  Autism NI in Newry for a wide-ranging discussion on matters that relate to  provision for autistic children and services that are provided by the  Middletown Centre for Autism. We had a very productive meeting, and I was able  to direct parents who were in attendance to the relevant education and library  boards.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">On 5 February 2009, I had a useful meeting with Eileen Bell  and Arlene Cassidy of Autism NI, who were able to provide me with an update of  their work with families and autism professionals and their plans for an  international autism conference.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In addition to those two meetings, Autism NI met Department  of Education officials on 3 December 2008, when it provided a comprehensive  outline of service developments in the organisation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am also glad to report that Autism NI has been working  actively in several ways with the Middletown Centre for Autism. The centre  provided Autism NI with places on its 2007-08 training programme and provided  staff to assist Autism NI in the delivery of training. The Middletown Centre is  currently in discussion with Autism NI in order to conclude a service-level  agreement to facilitate the transfer of the five-day Treatment and Education of  Autistic and related Communication-handicapped Children training model to Middletown.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McQuillan</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her answer. Will she tell the House whether she has  any plans to introduce a joined-up strategy on autism with the Department of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: My Department works closely with the Department of Health  because it is important that they work together at every level. We will  continue to do so. I thank the Member for his question. If a real difference is  to be made in the area of special educational needs and inclusion, it is  essential that the Department of Health and the Department of Education work  together.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Further to Mr McQuillan&rsquo;s question, does the Minister agree that she must  broaden the entire system and process of her response to autism? As a Health  Committee member, I have visited Wales to examine its response,  which is much broader and involves health, education, and employment and learning.  Does she agree that her approach must be much broader and get as many people on  board as possible in order to achieve the best response, which autistic people  need and deserve?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I thank the Member for his comment. I welcome people&rsquo;s  recognition of the importance of cross-cutting relationships. The broadest  possible approach must be taken towards autism and special educational needs.  As Members will be aware, I have presented a review of special educational  needs and inclusion to the Executive. I look forward to their discussion on the  matter.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire as an cheist a fhreagairt. Does the Minister  believe that autism services are best delivered on a cross-departmental basis  with maximum co-ordination between Departments and, indeed, that autism  legislation is the best way to achieve and ensure that level of co-operation?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: Thug m&eacute; freagra ar an ch&eacute;ad ph&aacute;irt den cheist. I believe that  Departments must work together, which is why my Department works closely with  the Department of Health. I look forward to the continuation of that work.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Middletown Centre for Autism is a wonderful centre of  excellence. In addition to our cross-party work in the North, we are working  with our counterparts in the South of Ireland. I note that the autism centre  there is funded by the Department of Education and Science and the Department  of Health and Children. To date, the autism centre in the North has been funded  only by the Department of Education. It is very important that all the  Departments work together. We can build an international centre for excellence  here.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The number of children with autistic spectrum disorder has  increased in recent years, and there are many other children with special  educational needs who daily face significant life challenges. A comprehensive  legislative framework on special education provision already exists. The review  of special educational needs and inclusion aims to improve provision and access  to services for all children who have special educational needs. The  introduction of new legislation is a lengthy process. Many proposals for  improving services, specifically for children with autism, could be progressed more  quickly through the existing legislative framework.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">English as an Alternative Language</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">2. <strong>Ms  Purvis </strong>asked the Minister of Education what are the reporting requirements  for resources allocated to schools under the English as an Alternative Language  scheme; and how the benefits of this scheme to each pupil are assessed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2047/09>(AQO 2047/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: The October 2007 census indicated that there were 5,665 newcomer  pupils who have English as an additional language (EAL) in the North of  Ireland. My Department provides funding directly to schools to allow them to  support their newcomer pupils. In addition, funding is provided to education  and library boards for the Inclusion and Diversity Service (IDS).</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The common funding formula is used to allocate funding  directly to schools. Schools receive an additional 50% of the basic  age-weighted pupil-unit cash value &mdash; &pound;983&middot;08 in 2008-09 &mdash; for each full-time  newcomer pupil that is designated in the school census as having English as an  additional language. During 2008-09, a total of &pound;5&middot;5million was allocated to  schools via the common funding formula. Members will be aware that there are  some children for whom we do not have exact numbers and that I recently decided  to include the Roma children in this programme.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Under local management of schools arrangements, it is for  the principal and board of governors of each school to determine how to spend  their budgets and plan their use of resources to maximum effect. However, the  support provided by the Inclusion and Diversity Service is also relevant. That  regional service was established on 1 April 2007, and it is operated by the  five education and library boards. It uses the Department&rsquo;s funding to support  schools with newcomer pupils who have English as an additional language.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The service received &pound;1,015,000 in 2008-09. That allowed  the IDS to establish a number of EAL support services, including diversity  coordinators, a multi-lingual website, interpreting and translation services  and a toolkit for primary-school teachers in Ireland, which I jointly launched with  the relevant Minister in the South of Ireland. There is a lot of work being  done, and the issue will be included in our review of special needs and  inclusion services.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Purvis</strong>: I  thank the Minister for her response. She said that more than &pound;5&middot;5 million has  been allocated for 5,665 pupils under the EAL scheme. Given that that money is  allocated under the common funding formula, how can we be sure that those  pupils are benefiting directly from the additional resources? How is their  performance and achievement measured? What assurance will the Minister give  that she will review and amend the common funding formula and introduce  reporting requirements for the scheme?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I welcome those very important questions. We must target our resources  on the basis of objective need. To do that, we need the most up-to-date  assessment, investigation and data for newcomer children, and that is why we  have brought forward the review of special educational needs and inclusion. I  look forward to an Executive discussion on that. I have it ready for tabling,  but I have not yet been given a date on which it will be discussed by the  Executive. It is very important that that discussion takes place, because it  concerns &pound;25 million of extra money that we fought for and achieved in the  Budget. There is a possibility of losing that &pound;25 million if the proposal does  not progress at the earliest opportunity. It is important to target on the  basis of need.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department is conducting a comprehensive review of the common  funding formula in order to ensure that money is targeted on the basis of need  and is allocated to the most disadvantaged children. The Member will have noted  the Department&rsquo;s decision on the Roma children. That was changed because school  principals brought the matter to the Department&rsquo;s attention.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Newton</strong>: I  thank the Minister for her answer. Will she outline how resources that are  allocated per pupil to teaching English as an alternative language compare to  those allocated for teaching English to local students?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: We must target on the basis of need and identify barriers to  learning, which we must address at an early age rather than as children progress  through school. Early intervention will increase all children&rsquo;s chances of  achievement. It should not be a competition between children from ethnic  minorities and children from the North of Ireland. The review of special needs  and inclusion will meet the needs of all children.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Hanna</strong>: I  thank the Minister for her answer. Will the newcomer policy propose support for  early-years provision? Will funds be set aside for that?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: L&eacute;ir&iacute;odh ar dhaon&aacute;ireamh Dheireadh F&oacute;mhair 2007 go raibh 5,665  dalta &oacute; th&iacute;ortha eile ina gc&oacute;na&iacute; i dTuaisceart na h&Eacute;ireann a raibh B&eacute;arla mar  theanga bhreise acu.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As the Member knows, the Department is going to bring  forward its important newcomer policy, and all our policies are, of course,  interlinked. Special needs and the newcomer policy are interlinked, as is our  review of the common funding formula. Therefore, the newcomer and early-years  policies will go hand in hand. As I said earlier, the Department&rsquo;s various  policies are like a jigsaw and are all interconnected.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Early-Years Strategy</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">3. <strong>Mrs  O&rsquo;Neill </strong>asked the Minister of Education when she will publish the  early-years strategy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2048/09>(AQO 2048/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: The question, appropriately, refers to the early-years strategy  that Carmel Hanna mentioned in her question.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">T&aacute; an Roinn ag s&uacute;il le dr&eacute;acht-strait&eacute;is a thabhairt os  comhair an Choiste Oideachais go luath sa bhliain 2009, agus beidh  comhairli&uacute;ch&aacute;n leathan cuimsitheach poibl&iacute; ina dhiaidh sin san earrach &mdash; beidh  comhairli&uacute;ch&aacute;n leis na hearn&aacute;lacha sl&aacute;inte agus oideachais n&iacute;os leithne agus le  p&aacute;ist&iacute; agus tusimitheoir&iacute; &mdash; sula mbeidh an strait&eacute;is cr&iacute;ochnaithe agus  foilsithe.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department plans to bring the draft strategy to the  Education Committee early in 2009. A broad and inclusive public consultation &mdash;  including consultation with the health and education sectors, and children and  parents &mdash; will follow in spring before the strategy is finalised and published.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs O&rsquo;Neill</strong>:  I look forward to receiving that document in the Education Committee. Does the  Minister recognise the importance of investing in early-years provision? Does  she recognise that early intervention is critical to investing in a child&rsquo;s  future and development?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: The early years of a child&rsquo;s life are critical. During the early  months and years, a high percentage of learning takes place. Children form  attitudes, make first relationships, develop concepts and form the foundations  for later skills and learning. As I said earlier, the strategy will recognise  that early intervention encompasses a wide range of issues, and that means identifying  and addressing specific needs in a timely manner. Those needs contribute to the  individual&rsquo;s ability to grow and learn and to develop and fulfil his or her  potential.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A hungry child will be unable to learn, and a child who has  suffered violence at home will have additional barriers to overcome. Without  early intervention, a child that does not speak English will experience much  greater difficulty. Without appropriate early-years support, a child who is  autistic, dyslexic or suffers from dyspraxia will struggle to be comfortable  and stimulated in school. Therefore, it is essential to ensure proper  early-years intervention for young people.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I call Mr Mervyn Storey, the Chairperson of the Committee for  Education.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  In case there is confusion, I ask the question as a Member, not as Chairperson  of the Committee. Sometimes, when the Education Minister brings forward  proposals and policies, it seems as though the children will have left school  by the time they are implemented, because we are still waiting on so many of  them. Will the Minister comment on speculation that the strategy for children  under six years of age will include comment on the ending of reception classes  &mdash; given that the Minister tells us that early intervention is paramount to her?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I look forward to having discussions at the Executive on my  review of special education needs and inclusion. I am very disappointed that,  to date &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  Answer the question.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: This is in relation to the first part of the Member&rsquo;s comment. I  am very disappointed that, to date, my proposals have not been tabled, despite  the fact that I sent them in July and gave responses in November. Despite that,  the issue is still not on the Executive agenda. I hope that it will be placed  on the Executive agenda very soon, because people who care about children with  special needs do not block proposals from being placed on the agenda.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In relation to early-years education, I will not comment on  the contents of a review that is under way, but I will say that I hope that,  when the review of early-years provision is ready, it will be placed on the  Executive&rsquo;s agenda very quickly.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Given the almost universal acceptance in the House of the importance of  early-years provision, perhaps the Minister can explain where it is placed on  her list of priorities. How much time has she spent on that issue in comparison  with the transfer issue, for example? Which factor does she think has the  greater influence on a child&rsquo;s educational attainment?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: The question shows a lack of understanding of the  interconnectedness of all the policies &mdash; the review of early-years provision;  the review of special needs and inclusion; the review of Irish-medium  education; transfer 2010; and the entitlement framework. None of those policies  is more important than any other &mdash; all are equally important. Anyone who has  listened to me in the House will know that I have always spoken about  interconnectedness. If intervention is not made at an early stage, or if the  education of our children is destroyed by ensuring that they spend their time  cramming for tests that they should not be doing at that age, it will distort  their early years, distort their literacy and numeracy, and distort the  education system.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Post-Primary Transfer: Executive Committee Discussions</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">4. <strong>Mr  Cobain </strong>asked the Minister of Education how many times she has discussed the  issue of post-primary transfer with the Executive Committee. <a name=AQO2049/09>(AQO 2049/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: Chuir m&eacute; p&aacute;ip&eacute;ir ar aistri&uacute; iarbhunscoile faoi bhr&aacute;id an Choiste  Feidhmi&uacute;ch&aacute;in ar dh&aacute; &oacute;c&aacute;id ar leith ag iarraidh pl&eacute; a dh&eacute;anamh ar an &aacute;bhar le  teacht ar chomhaont&uacute; ar mo mholta&iacute; chun creatlach reachtach d&rsquo;aistri&uacute; 2010 a  &eacute;asc&uacute;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have brought papers on post-primary transfer to the  Executive on two separate occasions, seeking a discussion with a view to  obtaining agreement on my proposals to facilitate a legislative framework for  transfer 2010. In May 2008, I brought proposals to a meeting of the Executive;  the DUP and UUP refused to discuss them. I offered to hold a single-issue  Executive meeting on the matter. Again, that was rejected by the DUP. I also  wrote to every Executive Minister, offering them the opportunity to discuss my  proposals on a one-to-one basis. No DUP Minister availed of that opportunity.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In January 2009, I produced a policy memorandum paper that  provided further detail in relation to my proposals and signalled my intention  to publish guidance if the Executive again failed in their duty to engage with  me. The Executive again refused to discuss the proposals, and that resulted in  the publication of guidance, including recommendations for admissions criteria,  on which consultation is under way until 27 April 2009.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">People on the Shankill    Road can ask the DUP and UUP very valid questions,  as can people in Kilcooley and in different parts of the North of Ireland,  particularly in the most disadvantaged areas. I will give three statistics on  which everyone should ruminate.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Last year, 10 children from the Shankill Road gained access to a grammar  school. No children from Kilcooley gained access to a grammar school. Sixteen  children from the New Lodge gained access to a grammar school. There is no comparison  between those figures and the statistics from some of the more affluent  suburbs. The DUP must, therefore, ask itself what it is doing to support  children in working-class areas.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Will the Minister clarify whether she intended to answer questions  4 and 7 together?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: Yes, I did. I am sorry; I should have said that.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cobain</strong>:  Perhaps the Minister will tell the House whether she tried to resolve the issue  informally before bringing it to the Executive? If she did, will she tell us if  she had any meetings with the DUP and, if so, what the outcomes of those  meetings were?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: As people will know, I have had many discussions with every  single party and with the Committee for Education. I attempted to have  discussions with the Executive, but some parties on the Executive refused me. I  have met educationalists, all stakeholders, the Churches, the trade unions and  the children&rsquo;s rights groups. I have left no stone unturned. I had many discussions  at different levels with all the political parties.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McFarland</strong>:  Does the Minister not understand that the way in which she has handled this  issue &mdash; by saying that she is engaging with all those concerned, but not really  engaging in any serious way &mdash; has done more damage than if she had dealt with  the matter in a sensible way and had engaged with people in order to have a  proper debate?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I respectfully suggest that the Member considers how his party  has engaged on the issue of post-primary transfer. His party has failed to  engage; it has failed to take into account how the existing system  discriminates against working-class children. I read out the statistics, which  are an indictment of our society. We need a system that is fit for purpose in  the twenty-first century. We need a system that does not test children at the  tender age of 10 or 11 and on which future pathways are determined.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am moving forward because parents and teachers want  clarity, and I am providing clarity. I have issued guidance because both  parties on the opposite Benches refuse to engage on the issue of post-primary  transfer. We cannot allow the current levels of underachievement to continue.  We cannot allow the system that is failing 12,000 people every single year to  continue. I am not prepared to allow that to continue. We have educational  apartheid, and it has to stop now. The best way to deal with that is for all  schools to adhere to the guidance so that we have a smooth transition in  transfer 2010.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire as  an fhreagra sin. I thank the Minister for her answer.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Ba mhaith liom a fhiafra&iacute; den Aire a n-aont&oacute;dh s&iacute; liom nach  dul chun cinn ar bith &eacute; an c&oacute;ras neamhrialta at&aacute; cruthaithe aici ar an  seach&oacute;ras a bh&iacute;odh ann.

	      <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister agree that the unregulated system that  she has created is no improvement on the former system of transfer, and that,  in fact, she has ensured the continuation of a selective system in which  children will have to sit not one test, but possibly two or three? Will she  further agree that children who are from a socially disadvantaged background  will be further disadvantaged by such an unregulated system?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I thought that the SDLP was opposed to academic selection. The  question that the Member asks obviously shows that they are not. That is very  disappointing.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If all post-primary schools adhere to the guidance, no  child will be required to enter any test. If schools depart from that guidance  and offer breakaway entrance tests, no parent will be forced to enter their  child for those. I have advised schools on the legal perils of doing that. We  have an opportunity to build a new system that, for the first time, is based on  equality and on giving every child an equal chance. That is what I will do. I  hope that the parties that claim to oppose inequality and academic selection  will join me in bringing about that change.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  Given that the Minister has failed in her efforts to introduce a bog-standard  comprehensive system, will she, at least, allow the Council for the Curriculum,  Examinations and Assesment to set the examination paper, or does she want to go  down the route of privatising education services?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I find some of the words that the Member used derogatory. I hope  that the Member can explain his comments to the many schools in the community  that he claims to represent. Those schools, such as Ashfield Girls&rsquo; High School  and Cookstown High School, ensure that all children  are welcome. The Member&rsquo;s use of offensive terminology &mdash; such as &ldquo;bog-standard  comprehensive&rdquo; &mdash; really shows where he is coming from in this debate.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Non-Selective Education Systems</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">5. <strong>Mr McKay </strong>asked the Minister of Education for her assessment of the effectiveness of  the performance of non-selective education systems in other countries.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2050/09>(AQO 2050/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: D&rsquo;amharc mo Roinn ar na tortha&iacute; oideachais a baineadh amach i  dt&iacute;ortha san Eagra&iacute;ocht um Chomhar agus Fhorbairt Eacnama&iacute;ochta, agus  bhreithnigh s&iacute; freisin feidhm&iacute;ocht choibhneasta na dt&iacute;ortha sin nach gcuirtear  taifid acad&uacute;la dalta&iacute; san &aacute;ireamh go ginear&aacute;lta maidir le hiontr&aacute;il ar  iarbhunscoileanna.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My Department has examined the educational outcomes  achieved across countries in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and  Development, and has also considered the relative performance of countries  where students&rsquo; academic records are not taken into account in admission to  post-primary schools. The data shows that many countries where academic  selection is not a factor are capable of outperforming the system here to a  significant degree.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The outcomes from the 2006 Programme for International  Student Assessment (PISA) in, for example, reading, show that we have a score  of 495, which represents average performance at Organisation for Economic  Co-operation and Development (OECD) level.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Compare that with, for example, Sweden, where the OECD  reports that only 2% of pupils attend schools where their academic record is a  prerequisite or high priority for admittance, and yet its PISA reading score  from 2006 stood at 507 &mdash; a performance significantly better than the OECD  average score. Consider Finland,  which has a score of 547 in reading and 548 in mathematics.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Other countries where the vast majority of young people are  admitted to schools without recourse to academic selection include Scotland, Canada,  Australia, New Zealand and Denmark. Those countries all significantly  outperform us in mathematics, and Canada,  Australia and New Zealand  also significantly outperform us in reading.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In Belgium,  three quarters of young people transfer to post-primary education, untroubled  by academic selection, and that country&rsquo;s performance also outshines our own &mdash;  it is significantly above the OECD average in reading, mathematics and science.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the rest of Ireland, academic selection is not  a feature of the education system, and yet, in the South, the performance in  reading &mdash; a score of 517 compared to our 495 &mdash; is significantly better than  ours and the OECD average. Let us learn &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: We must deal with our level of underachievement, not run away  from it.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McKay</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for her answer,  which clearly demonstrates how out of touch the education system in the North  is. It also demonstrates how out of touch some of the Members on the Benches  opposite are. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A bit of peace, please. The Minister touched on the issue  of PISA. Can  she outline how that is relevant to international best practice and to our  situation?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: As Members may know, PISA  is an assessment of the knowledge and skills of 15-year-olds in various  countries across the world. It runs every three years and uses a series of  tests based on real-life challenges that involve reading, maths and science.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.00 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The tests have undergone rigorous scrutiny to ensure that they  are robust. That allows us to have confidence when we compare the results of  participating countries or regions. The first round of PISAs took place in  2000, and each round has seen the number of participating countries grow. That  growth included an increase from 32 in 2000 to 57 in 2006, when 30 OECD member  countries took part. We have taken part in each study since the PISA was established.</p>
	      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="6"></a>Environment</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Planning Applications</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">1. <strong>Mr  McCartney </strong>asked the Minister of the Environment what action he is taking to  ensure that planning applications currently within the planning system, that  offer employment opportunities, are dealt with expediently given the economic  downturn.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2066/09>(AQO 2066/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment (Mr S Wilson)</strong>: The Programme for Government refers to a  six-month target being applied to large-scale planning proposals in which  pre-application discussions have taken place. Those proposals are considered to  have significant economic or social implications for the whole &mdash; or a  substantial part &mdash; of Northern    Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Two strategic project teams have been created to  specifically handle that type of application, including facilitating the  pre-application discussions. Applications that do not fall into that category  will still be given priority in the planning system in relation to their  processing, and measures are in place to that effect.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Guidance on the prioritisation was issued to all divisional  planning offices in July 2006. That clarified that priority should be given to  applications on which grant aid may depend, or to certain commercial,  industrial, social or infrastructure proposals that have clear strategic,  employment, community or public-interest dimensions.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCartney</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat. Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire as a fhreagra.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Minister for his answer. The Department of the  Environment recently recruited 34 people for professional and technical  reasons. Will those casual workers receive full-time positions, or does the  Minister envisage any redundancies?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: The Member is quite right: we have gone through a process,  and we are considering whether casual employees should become full-time  employees. The Member will also be aware that there are certain resource  implications for the Department in light of the economic downturn. Planning  applications have decreased by about 40%. Currently, there is quite a deficit  in the Planning Service as a result of reduced fee income. In light of that  deficit, officials and I are studying the current method of delivering the  Planning Service in Northern    Ireland. It is obvious that the number of  planning officers must be included in that consideration.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I assure the Member that my priority is to keep the service  at a high standard while dealing with the backlog and making sure that we have  the resources to quickly process planning applications. However, that means  that we must consider the resource implications and how we could obtain  additional resources to keep the current complement of planning officers in light  of the straightened financial circumstances.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burns</strong>:  Will the Minister tell us whether there has been a reduction in  business-related planning applications since the start of the economic  downturn?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: If the Member had listened to the answer that I just  provided, he would have heard me saying that there has been a reduction in  planning applications of some 40%. Given the current economic position, that is  understandable. I seek to make the best of that opportunity by ensuring that applications  that are in the system are dealt with quickly.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although we received 15,000 applications in the past year,  I point out to the Member that we dealt with 18,000 applications. We have tried  to use the current situation to ensure that we get rid of some of the backlog  of applications in the planning system, although we still have to deal with  some of those applications. There is a big backlog in relation to Planning  Policy Statement 21 (PPS 21), and I have guaranteed that we will have dealt  with that by June of this year.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There has been a reduction in the number of applications.  That reduction has had implications for the Department and for the resources  that are available to the Planning Service.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Neeson</strong>:  Does the Minister agree that the recent decision to decline planning permission  for the Aurora  building was a lost opportunity for job creation? Moreover, does he agree that  that decision flies in the face of the planning permission that has already  been granted for the Obel skyscraper, which is located beside one of Belfast&rsquo;s most historic  buildings, namely, the Custom House?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I do not often find myself in agreement with my colleague  from East Antrim; however, on this occasion, I do agree, and as one would  expect, I have already made my feelings about the Aurora project public.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Aurora project has  massive potential to regenerate an area of Belfast that is in need of regeneration. I  accept that it was to be built beside a listed building. However, as the Member  pointed out, planning permission has been granted to build other large  buildings beside significant listed buildings, such as the Custom House at the  docks. The management board is examining that planning application, and those  matters will be considered.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Belfast  City Council: Town Planning Committee</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">2. <strong>Rev Dr R  Coulter </strong>asked the Minister of the Environment what approaches he has  received from the Town Planning Committee of Belfast City Council since taking  up office.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2067/09>(AQO 2067/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: Since taking up office, I have received no formal  approaches from the town planning committee of Belfast City Council. I believe  that it is isolating and ignoring me, and I feel lonesome.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr Robert  Coulter</strong>: I thank the Minister for his answer. Has he reflected on his  previous commitment to resign from Belfast City Council, and does he not accept  that being simultaneously the Minister in charge of planning and a member of a  council planning committee is a conflict of interest, which is hugely damaging  to his credibility and, more importantly, to the credibility and structures of  Government?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: The majority of Members are also members of district  councils, and many of the matters that they deal with in the Assembly relate to  the affairs of those councils. Furthermore, many matters that Members deal with  in detail in Committees have implications for district councils.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Of course, Members from Dr Coulter&rsquo;s party who hold  ministerial office are also members of Belfast City Council, and they do not  feel that there is a conflict of interest. Consequently, his party leader might  not be too pleased that he asked that question. If he is criticising his party  leader and his party&rsquo;s Minister of Health because of the contradiction in their  positions and their potential conflicts of interest, he should take that matter  up with them. Nevertheless, I do not believe that the office that I hold and my  role in Belfast City Council have led to any conflicts of interest.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Browne</strong>:  Has the Minister met with Belfast City Council &mdash; in his role as Minister of the  Environment &mdash; to discuss tall buildings in Belfast? As an elected member of Belfast City  Council like me, he will know that the council supported the construction of  the Aurora  building. When will the draft policy and guidelines for tall buildings in Belfast be completed?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: In May 2008, a cross-party delegation from Belfast City  Council asked to meet my predecessor to discuss the matter of tall buildings in  Belfast. A date  was agreed before I became Minister, and I attended that meeting on 28 July  2008.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Given the number of applications for tall buildings in Belfast and the economic  potential that they hold, I have made it clear that it would be appropriate to  have a policy. Consequently, I have asked the Planning Service to prepare such  a policy. I do not have a date on which it will be finalised, although I  understand that consultants have been employed to begin work on guidance.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is hoped that it will be brought to fruition fairly  quickly, because the issue of tall buildings will not go away. Furthermore,  applications of that nature can bring great economic benefit to a city, and Belfast would benefit  from the impact that tall buildings, in the appropriate places, would have on  its well-being.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his answers. Does he agree that his failure to resign  from Belfast City Council leads to a conflict of interest in his present  position? His defence to Rev Coulter was that other Ministers in the House are  members of Belfast City Council and other councils. That is no defence; it  merely confirms the view that there is a potential conflict of interest. When  Arlene Foster was the Minister of the Environment &mdash; the position that Sammy  Wilson holds now &mdash; she resigned from her local council in order to avoid a  conflict of interest.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: As the Member knows, I will do my own thing on these  issues; I will not be guided by the actions of others. I make up my mind as to  how I believe I should discharge my duties. It is ironic that the accusation  comes from a Member who is also a member of Belfast City Council. On many  occasions, he has to debate issues in the Assembly that affect not only Belfast  City Council, but other areas. If he can remain objective, I believe that I am  more capable of the required degree of objectivity than the Member for North Belfast.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">PPS 21</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">3. <strong>Mr  McGlone </strong>asked the Minister of the Environment when the independent working  group on PPS 21 will publish a final report.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2068/09>(AQO  2068/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: The independent working group is required to report to my  Department by 26 June 2009.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  How many deferrals have been determined under draft PPS 21 at the Planning  Service&rsquo;s Omagh office? How many of those have been approved?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: The Member&rsquo;s memory must be short, because a letter that  he wrote to one of the local newspapers was published in today&rsquo;s edition. He  has quoted the figures in that letter, so I do not know why on earth he needs  me to remind him of them. Perhaps Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease has set in. I will remind  him of what is contained in the letter that he wrote to the newspaper. Some 280  applications have been deferred in the regional planning office that covers the  Omagh, Strabane, Fermanagh, Dungannon and Cookstown council areas, and 41 of  those applications have been approved. If Mr McGlone&rsquo;s maths are right &mdash; and I  hope that they are better than his memory &mdash; that represents 14&middot;64%. Therefore,  that is 14&middot;64% more applications than would have been granted under PPS 14.  There will be 41 people in those areas who will be happy that I have introduced  such a policy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Across Northern    Ireland, so far, there has been an approval  rate of about 37%.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McKay</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. May I be the first Member to welcome  the Minister&rsquo;s return following his being sent to the DUP sin bin by his party  colleagues last week. What guarantees are there that the recommendations from  the independent working group, which will report in June, will be implemented?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I know that the Member would love to get rid of me from  this position, but I assure him that I am here today, and I will be in this  position at the next Question Time and for the foreseeable future. To  paraphrase the Member&rsquo;s party leader, I am not going away, you know.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The independent working group&rsquo;s recommendations will come  first to me and then to the ministerial subgroup, in which we will consider  them and, at that stage, determine what happens with them.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>:  Before PPS 14, the Planning Service advised that the number of new houses in  the countryside exceeded the combined total of those in England, Scotland  and Wales.  Will the Minister advise the Assembly on what he thinks is a sustainable annual  figure for new houses in future?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: It would not be right for me to say what I believe to be a  sustainable annual figure. In fact, I would not like to think that the suitability  of planning applications would be determined on the basis of a quota. That will  be determined on the basis of whether those applications comply with the policy  that has been introduced. Applications that comply with PPS 21 should be  granted, but if they do not comply, they should not be granted. I have no idea,  and the Member could not reasonably expect me to have an idea, of how many  successful applications there should be.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I must emphasise that that planning policy is designed to  achieve two aims. The first is to ensure that those people who need to live in  the countryside have the opportunity to do so, and that rural communities are  sustained and are sustainable. The second aim is to preserve what I believe to  be a very important part of our natural heritage &mdash; the landscape of our rural  communities and our rural areas. The planning policy is designed to achieve  those two aims, and every application will be judged against them.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Planning Service: Overhaul</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">4. <strong>Mr Beggs </strong>asked the Minister of the Environment for a progress report on the  Programme for Government commitment to overhaul the Planning Service.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2069/09>(AQO 2069/09</a>)</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: A comprehensive programme of reform of the planning system  is well under way. Improvement is being made in the short term through various  process improvements, such as a streamlined council consultation scheme.  Parallel to that, officials have been working to develop detailed policy  proposals for reform in the medium to longer term. Those proposals take account  of the transfer of planning functions to the proposed 11 new councils in May  2011, under the review of public administration (RPA).</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Subject to receiving Executive approval, I hope to publish  the proposals shortly for a period of public consultation. That is a critical  next step on the path to meeting the Programme for Government commitment and  the PSA 22 commitment to ensure that a fit-for-purpose legislative framework  for the planning system is put in place by March 2011.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  Will the Minister account for the spiralling costs of ePIC &mdash; the electronic  planning information for citizens project &mdash; which increased from &pound;5&middot;5 million  to &pound;12&middot;8 million? Was that project re-tendered? Would the Minister not be  better spending his time controlling costs in his Department rather than  publicly criticising civil servants and espousing ridiculous views on energy  efficiency, renewable energy and climate change?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: When it comes to lectures on protecting the environment,  the last person to whom I will turn is a member of the Beggs family, whose  expertise when it comes to protecting the environment revolves around landfill  and illegal dumping. The Member might bear that in mind before he starts to  lecture me about my role as Minister of the Environment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As far as the spiralling costs of ePIC are concerned, I am  not trying to wash my hands of the matter, but most of those costs were incurred  during the very early part of the process. I inherited the current system, and  I have asked tough questions about the costs of the ePIC project. The project  was not re-tendered, because to start all over again would have led to  increased costs and could have left the Department open to court action by the  firm that held the contract.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I must also point out that some additional things were put  onto the system, making it a bit more complex than was originally intended.  However, I assure the House that I will keep an eye on the costs. I hope that  we now have a tender document that is much tighter than it was in the past, and  that we will deliver ePIC, which is an important part of planning reform, in so  far as it will give the public and developers greater accessibility to their  planning applications, and it should also cut down on much of the  administrative costs in the system.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Boylan</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I, too, welcome the Minister back.  No doubt, Stephen Nolan will be looking for him shortly. Perhaps he can also  make provision for the poor old polar bears now that they are an endangered  species in his constituency.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">What provision or new measures will the Minister provide to  ensure that councillors will be trained adequately to ensure that the new  planning procedures will be put in place when functions transfer to the super  councils? Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I want to correct the Member. Polar bears and polar bear  colonies are thriving; they are not in decline. I give him that piece of  information for nothing.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member asked about an important issue. For those who  wish to see local government functioning properly after May 2011, it is  important that councillors who take on planning responsibilities are properly  trained and have the capacity to deal properly with planning decisions. For  that reason, the planning reform proposals include actions that will help to  have councillors trained in that area.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in members on the strategic leadership board have  been helpful in preparing for RPA. However, the planning reform proposals are  being held up in the Office of the deputy First Minister &mdash; and I know that the  Chief Whip of the Member&rsquo;s party might not be too happy with him for raising  the issue. Nevertheless, we are reaching a deadline, and if we do not get the  proposals out for public consultation and start moving towards the legislative  requirements, we will find ourselves in a difficult position when it comes to  delivering that reform before May 2011. I will be more than grateful for any  help that the Member can give me in getting those proposals to the Executive so  that they can go out for public consultation.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  The Minister referred to the streamlining process, and we all agree that that  is a good thing. However, will the Minister comment on the fact that if  developers &mdash; particularly apartment developers &mdash; do not get approval for 40  apartments, they withdraw and defer and come back with proposals for 30  apartments, and if they do not get 30, they withdraw and defer, and the process  goes on and on. Does the Minister agree that that exercise defeats the purpose  of what we are trying to do, which is to push the planning process forward?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: Part of the Member&rsquo;s question is correct. The streamlining  process has had a dramatic effect where it has worked. Where it has been  introduced so far, for example in the Londonderry area, the average time for  applications that go through the streamlined process has been reduced from 89  days to 28 days, and 20% of applications are being not only processed but  decisions issued within 20 days. That is a remarkable turnaround, and it has a  big impact locally.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Nevertheless, the Member is right. I have told planning  officers that we should no longer be in a position where we work with  developers and negotiate down by increments. Apart from the fact that it messes  up the planning system, it also means that an officer&rsquo;s time is tied up in  those negotiations and looking at changed plans &mdash; sometimes with minor  alterations only.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Of course, the other issue is that objectors are kept on  tenterhooks, because they must constantly return to the matter to consider  amendments. One reason why we have introduced the front-loaded pre-application  arrangement is to try to get developers to understand, at the very outset, what  is likely to be acceptable and what is outside the ballpark. Then, if they  lodge an application, they have only themselves to blame if it is turned down  after one go. That is the way forward. The Member is right, we must free up  resources to deal with applications quickly.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  The report &lsquo;Foundations for the Future&rsquo; commented on the third-party right of  appeal. It made it quite clear that it should be considered only in  well-qualified circumstances, because, obviously, if there was a free-for-all,  it would make the planning process impossible.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Please ask a question.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  Do the planning reforms under consideration in the Department contain some  facility for a third-party right of appeal?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: The emerging findings paper will have already indicated  that I am not in favour of third-party appeals. Of course, the point of holding  consultations on planning reform is to give people the opportunity to make an  argument for third-party appeals. Despite the arguments that have been made in  support of third-party appeals, they are not a panacea. The way to get  community buy-in for planning applications is to have the community  consultation front-loaded, not end-loaded. Rather than giving people the right  to fight a decision once it has been made, they should instead be given an  opportunity to have input before an application has even been submitted.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to mention one issue that is contained in the  emerging findings paper and that will be dealt with in the planning reform  paper &mdash; indeed, it is an issue that will form part of the consultation. When  making an application, developers will be required to show not only that they  have consulted people, but how they have consulted them and how they have tried  to deal with the objections raised by the people who will be affected by the  development. To my mind, that is a much better approach: before anybody&rsquo;s mind  is made up, the public gets an opportunity to have their say, and, hopefully,  planning applications can be tailored to meet the needs of local people and to  take account of their views.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Aurora   Building</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">5. <strong>Mr  McFarland </strong>asked the Minister of the Environment for his assessment of the  planning application by McAllister Holdings for the Aurora Building,  Great Victoria Street,   Belfast.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2070/09>(AQO 2070/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: Belfast City Council has referred the application to the  Planning Service management board for consideration and reassessment, and I  have decided that it is best that the application is dealt with by that  process.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McFarland</strong>:  I thank the &quot;Minister for entertainment&quot;  for his answer. He is in  good form today as usual.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Does the Minister not find that there is a degree of  incongruity between, on the one hand, his duties as the Environment Minister,  and, on the other, his lobbying for planning applications and his criticism of  his own planning staff?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: That question has been asked time and again. The argument  seems to be that when someone becomes a Minister, somehow or other they cease to  have constituency responsibilities. I am in this Chamber because constituents  have elected me to it. I happen to have been given a post &mdash; in the meantime  anyhow &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Laughter.] </span>&mdash; as the Minister of a  Department. However, that does not mean that I no longer have an obligation to  represent my constituents. When I talk to planning officers about a planning  application, I am simply carrying out my constituency duty. The one occasion on  which it is not right for me either to listen to applicants or objectors or to  make representations is when I have to make the final decision on a planning  application that is subject to article 31 of the Planning (Northern Ireland)  Order 1991.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The record will show that, when dealing with such  applications, I have adhered to the requirement to remain separate from the  planning process until the officers submit a report to me with a recommendation  on which I must make a judgement.</p>

	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">1. <strong>Ms J  McCann </strong>asked the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure if his Department  actively encourages the use of Irish in the workplace.&nbsp; <a name=AQO2086/09>(AQO 2086/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure (Mr Campbell)</strong>: No.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his answer, even though it was somewhat sarcastic. Does  he accept that there is a greater onus on him &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">May I finish my question?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">&mdash; to recognise the Irish language now that it has secured  level-3 status under the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: I assure the Member that I was not being  sarcastic. The Member mentioned the use of Irish and its status &mdash; she is  correct about the status that it has attained. The requirements of the European  Charter for Regional or Minority Languages are being fully met by the  Department. I would hope that, in the workplace, we could concentrate on trying  to deliver better services for the entire community, rather than being  sidetracked on language issues such as that which the Member has raised.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  A report on the matter is published. Will the Minister confirm when the third  periodic report will be published?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: The Member is correct to say that periodic  reports are published. The third report is awaiting Executive consideration.  The deputy First Minister made substantive comments on the report, which, along  with the comments of others, were incorporated, as appropriate. The deputy  First Minister has been considering the report, including those comments, since  11 November 2008. I will bring the report to the Executive as soon as I can.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Ba mhaith liom ceist a chur ar an  Aire &mdash; agus t&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go dtabharfaidh s&eacute; freagra n&iacute;os fuide uirthi n&aacute; a thug  s&eacute; ar an ch&eacute;ad cheist: cad &eacute; at&aacute; d&eacute;anta ag an Aire leis an Ghaeilge a chur chun  cinn &oacute; rinneadh Aire de? I hope that the Minister&rsquo;s answer to my question will  be longer than the one that he gave to the initial question. What work has he  done to promote the Irish language since he became Minister?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: It is remarkable that Ministers and politicians  are criticised when they give fulsome and protracted responses, yet I am  criticised when I do the complete opposite and give a concise and specific  answer.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The honourable Member has taken a consistent line in his  approach to the issue. However, he has found that I have taken an equally  consistent line. There will not be an Irish-language Act; however, those who  choose to use Irish or Ulster Scots should be facilitated to do so. That was  the position, and it will remain the position for the foreseeable future.</p>

	      <p class="H5StageHeading">London  Olympics</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">3. <strong>Mr  O&rsquo;Loan </strong>asked the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure, given the timing of  his decision not to proceed with the multi-sports stadium at the Maze site, if  it is still possible for his Department to have an alternative stadium ready in  time for the London Olympics, as had been envisioned for the sports stadium at  the Maze site.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2088/09>(AQO 2088/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Sports Stadium</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">7. <strong>Mr Lunn </strong>asked  the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure if it is his Department&rsquo;s preference  to proceed with one multi-sports stadium or for three separate stadium projects  for the Gaelic Athletic Association, Irish Football Association and Ulster  Rugby.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2092/09>(AQO 2092/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: With your permission, Mr Deputy Speaker, I will  take questions 3 and 7 together.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In line with the commitment that I gave to the Assembly on  12 January 2009, I forwarded my conclusions on the proposed multi-sports  stadium at the Maze to the Executive on 27 January. In my paper to the  Executive, I advised that I had reviewed all the evidence available to me,  including meeting with the governing bodies involved, and I had come to the  view that the Maze proposal should not proceed. I also advised that I intended  to have a further series of discussions with the governing bodies of the sports  involved in order to explore alternatives. I have already had initial meetings  with the relevant governing bodies, and I have asked them to review their  options on stadia provision and to report back to me. Accordingly, there is no  preferred option at the moment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">With regard to stadium provision for use during the Olympic  Games and Paralympic Games in 2012, Northern Ireland&rsquo;s capability to  actively participate could only be fully determined once a decision is taken on  the preferred stadium option or options. However, I am considering the  possibility of supporting a limited remedial programme of work at Windsor Park, so that international football can  continue to be played there until a longer-term solution is found. Any support  will be subject to an approved business case and to satisfactory assurances  from the Irish Football Association and Linfield Football Club on future  arrangements for maintaining the venue. That interim work may allow for some  Olympics-related events to take place.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  How much money does the Minister have in his budget for stadium development?  How much have the Minister and his Department spent and, therefore, inevitably,  wasted on the Maze project?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: The Member posed a classic leading question when  he asked how much has been spent and, therefore, wasted. He knows the facts as  well as I do, and, I suspect, as well everyone else in the Chamber does, and  they are that the issue of the multi-sports stadium was exceptionally complex.  It was in the ether for many months and years preceding my arrival at the  Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure. Therefore, it was always going to be a  difficult choice. However, I have never shied away from taking difficult  decisions. Having taken that decision, removed the uncertainty and brought  clarity to the situation, we must now move forward.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am delighted that we are now in the position whereby  governing bodies can examine a very limited number of options. We are not going  back to square one. There are a limited number of options available, so  progress can be made quickly and practically in an attempt to bring clarity and  to ensure that football, rugby and gaelic are catered for in the stadia  provision. The 2007 budget gave capital provision of &pound;70 million to the  multi-sports stadium project over the period 2008-09 to 2010-11.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. The Minister will know that, since  29 January, officials from the Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure have  been in regular contact with his departmental officials to try to secure a  meeting between the Minister and the Committee on the subject of the  multi-sports stadium. As Chairperson of the Committee, I subsequently followed  up that request in writing. Will the Minister pin down with our Committee staff  a suitable date to discuss the matter? After all, it is a Government scrutiny  Committee, and one could be forgiven for thinking that the Minister is trying  to avoid the Committee.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: Four weeks ago, I said that I would undertake a  series of discussions with the governing bodies.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I did that within two weeks of taking the decision.  Unfortunately, a leak was made to the media about the document at that time. If  anyone has any information as to who was responsible for that leak, I would be  delighted to receive that information and to take the appropriate action.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member seems to think that I am avoiding a meeting with  the Committee. Since I took office in June last year, I have appeared before  the Committee on every occasion on which I was asked to do so. We will reach a  consensus on the best date &mdash; which I hope will be in the immediate future &mdash; and  I will be glad to answer any questions that the Committee may wish to put to me  in respect of this matter. I am sure that we will have a healthy and robust  debate, and I will stand over everything that I will say to the Committee &mdash; I  hope that the members can do likewise.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  In view of the mounting failure to find private sponsorship for the London Olympic venues, are there any opportunities for Northern Ireland?  Can the Minister say at what speed he will be able to move on the alternatives  to the Maze site, to facilitate access to such opportunities?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: I thank the Member for raising the question in  that way. I recall that other Members, both in the House and outside, indicated  that, had the opposite decision had been taken &mdash; had I decided to proceed with  the Maze stadium &mdash; it would, in some way, bring relief to the hard-pressed  construction industry which faces the economic downturn.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, even had a decision to proceed been taken, not a  brick would have been laid before 18 months had passed. Everyone ought to know  that. However, despite that, Members chose to make political capital. Their  comments were nonsensical. Building work could not have started immediately; it  could not have started within an 18-month to two-year period.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member asks how quickly we can proceed, and I want to  proceed very quickly. I have met the three governing bodies and have indicated  that I wish to receive their options within a matter of weeks. In the next few  weeks, I hope to have a tiny, finite number of options that represent the  governing bodies&rsquo; preferences, and I will get to work immediately. We can make  progress quickly now that the uncertainty has been removed.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  The Minister said that everyone knew that &pound;3&middot;8 million &mdash; nearly &pound;4 million &mdash;  has been spent, squandered or wasted on the Maze site. I hope that that is so.  Is it possible that some value can be salvaged in the preparation of an  alternative site from the lost consultancy fees and documents?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: I thank the Member for his question. I did not  mean that everyone knew that the expenditure had been of that order. My mention  of widespread knowledge was with reference to a different point.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I hope, and have told local representatives in Lagan Valley  and elsewhere, that, now that the uncertainty has been removed, other  developments &mdash; that can, should and must occur at the site &mdash; are able to  proceed on a more efficacious basis. That must happen now as a matter of the  utmost priority. I hope that some of the preparatory work for the multi-sports  stadium can be utilised in the development of that much-needed site. In the  short-to-medium term, we could then see progress in developing genuinely  world-class facilities at that site.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Creative Industries Fund</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">4. <strong>Lord  Browne </strong>asked the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure to provide details  of the take-up of the &pound;5m Creative Industries Fund that was announced last  autumn.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2089/09>(AQO 2089/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: Following its launch last October, there has  been a high degree of interest in the creative industries innovation fund. It  is administered by the Arts Council of Northern Ireland, and an initial call  for applications was made, to sectoral bodies only, in October 2008.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Arts Council undertook a competitive assessment process  and I will announce in the near future the outcome of the first call. A second  call for applications from creative enterprises opened on 5 January and closed  on 5 February. The Arts Council has advised that more than 350 applications  were received, considerably higher than the level that was expected. I believe  that that is due, in no small part, to the successful marketing campaign  undertaken by the Arts Council, which included presentations across Northern Ireland  and close liaison with all 32 local enterprise agencies.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Browne</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply. The strategic action plan  indicates that there are more than 2,500 creative enterprises in Northern Ireland  employing almost 35,000 people, and that there is a specific goal to grow that  sector by 15% by 2011. In light of that growth and planned development, will  the Minister tell the House what the Arts Council is doing to promote creative  industries innovations to ensure that all parts of Northern Ireland benefit from that  funding?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: I thank the Member for his supplementary  question. His rationale is one that is often utilised in the Chamber when  Members ask about the geographic spread. I am delighted to inform him that, in  so far as it has been possible, there has been a widespread number of  information seminars, at centres including the Ards Art Centre in Newtownards;  the Strule Arts Centre in Omagh; the North West Regional College, Limavady; the  Southern Regional College, Newry; Space Craft in Belfast; the Presidents&rsquo; Club,  Belfast; the Noribic Centre, Londonderry; the Craft Centre, Ballycastle; Work  West, Belfast; and Oxford Island, Craigavon.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, the 32 local enterprise agencies were provided  with copies of the presentation. I am sure that the Member will be aware that  Belfast City Council also promotes the fund by providing links on its website  to the appropriate pages on the Arts Council website. I hope that Members will  agree that there has been a comprehensive attempt to publicise the fund as  widely as possible. The take-up &mdash; as measured by the response so far &mdash; would  appear to indicate that that was money well spent.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Anderson</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I know that political manners and  leadership are not qualities of which the Minister displays a lot. However,  through the Deputy Speaker I will ask: what is the next step for those  applicants who made bids for funding, particularly in relation to the 5  February 2008 deadline?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: I made clear the closing deadline for  applications. The Arts Council will now look at all the applications. As I said  in response to a previous question, given the geographical spread of the  information, I am hopeful that there will be a broad spread of resources across  Northern Ireland.  I cannot prejudge the outcome because there are criteria to be met. However, I  am hopeful that people right across Northern Ireland will benefit from  the fund.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  I note that in the Minister&rsquo;s response to the initial question, and in his  geographical response, he omitted south and east Antrim, so I will make a bid  for those areas now. Has the Minister assessed the job-creating potential of  the creative industries fund spending, from the primary investments and the  knock-on opportunities?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: The Member raises a pertinent point. The total  amount of the fund is &pound;5 million, which is a considerable sum. I would have  liked there to have been more money available, but we have to work within the  current Budget. However, I am hopeful that there will be considerable  job-creation capacity within the limitations of the fund.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If that fund were to prove as successful as I hope, given  the initial interest in it, it would strengthen my case for going back to the  Minister of Finance and Personnel to say that a subsequent fund of a similar  type should be set up. I hope that such a fund would be as successful as the current  one, and, if more money were invested, a greater return might be made.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Theatre Funding</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">5. <strong>Mrs M  Bradley </strong>asked the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure if there will be  additional funding made available for (i) the Waterside Theatre; (ii) the Playhouse;  and (iii) An Gael&aacute;ras in Derry/Londonderry, to allow them to maximise the use  of their facilities when refurbishment is complete.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2090/09>(AQO 2090/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: The Waterside Theatre, the Playhouse and An  Gael&aacute;ras have all received funding from the north-west challenge fund towards  their capital arts projects. All three projects have subsequently received  additional funding beyond their original allocations from the fund.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Funding for the arts is dispersed through the Arts Council.  The Arts Council has advised that it is fully aware of the needs of the arts  venues in Londonderry, which have been  undergoing capital development. It is currently assessing applications under  the annual support for organisations programme, including applications for  increased funding from those venues. The Arts Council will make its decisions  in February 2009, and it will notify the applicants of the outcome during March  2009. Any further requests for additional capital funding will require the  completion of a business case and will be dependent on the availability of  funds.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his answer. The Waterside Theatre project has found  itself in difficulties through no fault of its own. Does the Minister agree that,  in order to optimise the capital investment, there will be a requirement for  ongoing revenue support?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: I thank the Member for raising the issue of the  Waterside Theatre. On a local level and on a ministerial level, I am aware of  those issues, which were well outside the theatre&rsquo;s control. People  representing the Waterside Theatre have been in touch with the Department, and  we are discussing what assistance we can offer to the theatre in the light of  the circumstances in which it finds itself.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gardiner</strong>:  Has the Minister assessed how many jobs have been created by his Department  through its overall investment of public money? What is the geographical  distribution of those jobs?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: I am a bit unclear whether the Member was  referring to the original question. If he was, I have not received any  information about the number of jobs that have been created, but the three  projects that were listed in the original question have total project costs in  excess of &pound;8 million. Although I do not have the figures, I am fairly certain  that there has been significant job creation. I will endeavour to establish a  precise number &mdash; if a precise number can be established &mdash; and I will write to the  Member with the details.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCartney</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire as a  fhreagra. I noticed that when the Minister said &ldquo;An Gael&aacute;ras&rdquo;, it did not burn  his lips. Perhaps speaking Irish is not always the end of the world. When  groups find out whether they are to receive funding, are the reasons for not  receiving it made clear? Sometimes, there is a feeling that some groups get  funding and others do not. The process of allowing more funding to be made is  not very clear.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: The Member referred to my use of Irish. I am  happy to use any one of a number of languages from any one of a number of  countries. I am quite content to do that, and we should all open up our minds  to other cultures and countries, where possible.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member referred to applications that, for whatever  reason, do not clear the system and are rejected. It is important that, where  it is possible and practicable, the applicants establish for themselves  understanding of why they did not receive funding so that they can see that the  criteria are fair, reasonable and applied across the board. On future  applications, therefore, they can ensure that, where possible, they might meet  the criteria, rather than falling short of it.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Robinson</strong>:  Will the Minister say what criteria were applied to applications for additional  funding?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: That follows on neatly from the previous  question. The applications for additional funding were individually assessed by  a steering group, with consideration given to the overall funding package for  the project as a whole, any potential shortfalls that might jeopardise delivery  of the project and the possibility of losing other funding sources. The steering  group supported the bids, and final amounts were determined and approved at  ministerial level, as was appropriate.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Foras na Gaeilge</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">6. <strong>Mr I  McCrea </strong>asked the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure to outline any  delays in filling Foras na Gaeilge posts which were approved in 2001.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2091/09>(AQO 2091/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: The total staffing complement for Foras na  Gaeilge was outlined in the agency&rsquo;s 10-year strategic plan from 2001, which  was agreed by both North/South Ministerial Council Ministers. A number of  issues have contributed to Foras na Gaeilge&rsquo;s failure to attain its agreed  complement of staff. Those issues include the Irish Government&rsquo;s  decentralisation policy, which has resulted in protracted negotiations with  unions about which posts should move to Gweedore in the Irish Republic.  I understand that Foras na Gaeilge has also had difficulties with the  recruitment and retention of staff.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his answer. However, is he able to specify why Foras na  Gaeilge has failed to fill those posts?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: In the same way as I was content to be specific  and precise in my answer to previous questions, I will endeavour to be so in  answer to this one.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Market forces have contributed to Foras na Gaeilge&rsquo;s  well-recognised staff-retention problems. I understand that the recruitment of  specialist staff, such as professional accountants and editors, with sufficient  Irish-language skills has been problematic. As I have stated, the posts in  Gweedore cannot be filled until Foras na Gaeilge and the trade unions resolve  their positions.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Does the Minister know whether the  issue of pay disparity between Foras na Gaeilge in the North and in the South  has been sorted out?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: I am unsure to which disparity the Member refers  &mdash; whether he means a disparity in wage structures or something else. I will try  to provide a written reply after I read the Hansard report.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr Robert  Coulter</strong>: Has the Minister considered job-sharing possibilities involving  Scottish Gaelic language providers and local minority-language providers that  make use of EU funding mechanisms and that may, consequently, save public  money?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: On the face of it, the Member&rsquo;s question makes  some sense. I must establish whether it is as straightforward as his question  makes it sound. However, I will certainly draw his suggestion to the attention  of the Ulster-Scots Agency, Foras na Gaeilge and associated bodies in order to  establish whether job-sharing is possible.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Question No 7 has been answered.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Irish-Language Groups</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">8. <strong>Mr  Brolly </strong>asked the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure how many meetings he  has held with Irish-language groups since taking up his office.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2093/09>(AQO 2093/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: I have received four invitations to meet  representatives and Irish-language groups to discuss the Irish-language  position, all of which I accepted. Those meetings were with Foras na Gaeilge on  8 July 2008, Pobal on 30 September 2008 and a delegation of the Irish Guild of  the Church of Ireland on 19 January 2009.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">On 20 October 2008, I also met a Sinn F&eacute;in Member for West Belfast and other representatives of that party for  an in-depth, comprehensive and robust discussion on Irish-language issues. I  look forward to any further such meeting.</p>

	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy  Chairperson of the Committee for Education (Mr D Bradley)</strong>: Go raibh maith  agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Mar is gn&aacute;ch, t&aacute; an-&aacute;thas orm p&aacute;irt a ghlacadh sa  d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht seo, agus beidh m&eacute; ag labhairt inniu mar LeasChathaoirleach an  Choiste Oideachais an Tion&oacute;il.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am pleased to participate in the debate as Deputy  Chairperson of the Committee for Education. In that role, I want to draw  Members&rsquo; attention to certain aspects of the Department of Education&rsquo;s 2008-09  budget and some of the pressures that it has registered to date for its  2009-2010 budget.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The spring Supplementary Estimates reflect changes that  have arisen during in-year monitoring rounds. I will focus at first on some of  the Committee&rsquo;s concerns about the Department&rsquo;s 2008-09 budget. The Committee questioned  senior officials on the impact of the removal of efficiency savings from the  schools budget with regard to reductions in the number of teachers and front  line school staff. Efficiency savings in the schools budget for 2008-09  totalled &pound;39&middot;5 million; &pound;72 million for 2009-2010; and around &pound;103 million for  2010-11.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee was concerned that the Department did not  have figures to hand on the number of teacher reductions as a result of those  substantial baseline cuts to the schools budget at classroom level, and it  pressed for a larger percentage of the education budget to be devolved directly  to schools.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee for Education takes particular interest in  the Department&rsquo;s underspend and reduced requirements from in-year monitoring  rounds. It was concerned by two recent examples that did not involve  substantial money: the surrender of money for science, technology, engineering  and maths (STEM) in schools; and the integrated development fund for  disadvantaged children under the west Belfast/greater  Shankill initiative. The Committee viewed that as poor monitoring and lack of  control over scarce and limited resources in those important areas.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee for Education, in conjunction with two other  Statutory Committees, has organised an event to promote STEM subjects, which  will take place in the Long Gallery at lunchtime on Wednesday 18 February 2009.  Members are most welcome to attend that event.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Turning to the Department of Education&rsquo;s 2009-2010 budget,  the Committee awaits the Minister of Education&rsquo;s proposed actions to deal with  a gap in resources of around &pound;60 million, much of which appears as inescapable  pressures, such as costs that arise from pay reviews, job evaluations, pensions  and redundancy costs. Clearly, re-prioritisation of elements of the education  budget must be considered soon. The Committee will examine closely the  Minister&rsquo;s proposals in that regard.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As I mentioned earlier, the Committee for Education has taken  particular interest in the Department&rsquo;s efficiency delivery plan. One important  element is the efficiency savings that will arise from the establishment of the  education and skills authority (ESA). Some &pound;21 million of savings are projected  in 2009-2010 and 2010-11. The Committee recently heard from senior departmental  officials and ESA&rsquo;s chief executive designate on the authority&rsquo;s outline  business plan. That basically suggests that &pound;50 million of the education budget  should be invested to save &pound;20 million per annum with further potential  savings.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The proposals given to the Committee state that the &pound;20  million of annual savings would be put into front line services, namely school  classrooms, to improve education standards. However, I regret to report to the  House that the Committee has distinct fears that any savings generated from the  establishment of ESA may very well be swallowed up in efficiency savings and never  make their way to the classroom to benefit pupils. I say &ldquo;any savings&rdquo; because  the evidence session on the outline business case, which was reported by  Hansard, identified many gaps and questions on where savings will be made.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee is awaiting the full business case and will  revisit its concerns and inform the House during its Committee Stage report on  the Education Bill, or earlier, if possible.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee scrutinises the education budget on a regular  basis and takes that role very seriously. We have at least one session with  senior departmental officials per month. Some weighty decisions on budget  priorities will have to be taken over the coming year. I assure Members that  the Committee will continue to examine those decisions closely and report to  the House as appropriate.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Thank you very  much, Mr Deputy Speaker. I appreciate the opportunity to participate in today&rsquo;s  debate on behalf of the Committee for Education.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  All Departments &mdash; and the Minister of Finance, in particular &mdash; have had to deal  with the rolling lack of finance. It has been difficult to match some of the  resources required, especially with the necessary efficiency savings being  demanded.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to refer specifically to a couple of issues  concerning the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development. I know that the  Department placed huge emphasis on completing the farm nutrient management scheme  by 31 December 2008. There was a major impasse along the way when there  appeared to have been agreement between the DFP and DARD over the sale of  Crossnacreevy. Indeed, I understand that the DFP guaranteed the DARD finance to  complete the scheme.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That scheme has been a success for the Department, and many  of us are hugely appreciative of that. However, it has not been without  difficulty, and, even though it has been completed, there is still a shortfall  in its finances. Bids have been made in both the December and February  monitoring rounds to try to complete the scheme&rsquo;s jigsaw of finance. I am  concerned that the money required may not all be available and that some farmers  who completed the scheme late on may have to wait some time to get their full  moneys.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am hopeful that that matter will be resolved; however, I  am concerned that it will not be.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to mention some immediate issues that arose  throughout the year and that had difficulty securing finance. In August 2008,  severe flooding affected many farmers, especially cereal and potato farmers. The  Department of Agriculture and Rural Development reacted slowly in providing  finance, even though not a huge amount was required to alleviate the hardship.  At that time, homeowners whose houses flooded received compensation within a  short timescale. However, although only small numbers of farmers were affected,  some lost their livelihoods for the entire year. They could not access the  support and financial assistance that they urgently needed. A quicker reaction  from the Department would have been more appropriate.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The dioxin scare in December 2008 resulted in similar  problems. I am concerned that it has taken representatives of the Executive  nine weeks to make a case in Europe, given that our neighbours in the Republic of Ireland  had their case sewn up early &mdash; almost before Northern Ireland knew about the  situation. I am hugely concerned about the slow reaction to a serious situation.  Removing some cattle and animals from farms more quickly could have helped to  alleviate the difficult situation internationally and to clear our products  without undue difficulty.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">When the Programme for Government and Budget were being  drawn up last year, I commented on the roads budget. I had huge concerns about  the amount of finance that was allocated, particularly for structural  maintenance. In the past couple of days, I have researched that matter and have  discovered that, in the 2006-07 financial year, one region received well over  &pound;2 million for structural maintenance, whereas this year it received only &pound;1&middot;5  million, which is 77% of its allocation from two years ago. Furthermore, that  figure does not take into account the increased cost of the products, which  have, in some cases, risen by 50%.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">People talk about introducing traffic-claming measures in  towns and villages. However, most roads in Northern Ireland have inbuilt  traffic-calming measures, because drivers must zigzag to avoid potholes and  poor surfaces. The rural communities, particularly those west of the Bann, are  concerned because they do not have public-transport systems similar to those in  the east of the Province. We do not have a train service or the same level of  bus service, and we are desperately dependent on those roads and on the car.  Therefore, more money should be allocated to roads in the structural  maintenance budget. It is important to the Province&rsquo;s economy. The west of the  Province will miss out badly on economic success if it does not have the funds  to carry out structural maintenance.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  Tom Elliott mentioned roads in the west of Province. When he is available, I  will take him to Strangford and Ards, where he will experience poor roads.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">At this time, there are no easy jobs in the Executive. All  Departments are under a certain amount of pressure to meet the needs that are  presented to them, especially during the economic crisis. However, some  Departments are undoubtedly under more stress, especially the Department of  Finance and Personnel. People who are struggling expect that Department to  implement changes and, at this time, more people look to the Minister, Nigel  Dodds, to help improve their lives.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Many middle-class families are struggling, losing their  businesses and face losing their homes. They are hoping for some kind of  intervention.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Thus far, the Minister has provided an extra &pound;400 million  to defer water charges and a further &pound;100 million to tackle a range of issues,  including the backdating of Civil Service pay.</p>

	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Titanic signature project, with a &pound;43&middot;5 million  investment as part of its own economic package, has been backed by the  Executive, and the Finance Minister has expressed his determination that the  devolved Ministers do whatever they can to help families, companies and the  economy. He has acknowledged that we are operating within the constraints of a  block allocation of money and that we therefore do not have the freedom of  manoeuvre that a national Government would have. However, that does not stop us  from taking positive steps to help the people of the Province.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We are all aware of the record to date and the major  decisions that have been made, such as freezing the regional rate from 2008-2011;  capping industrial rates at 30%, and freezing business rates in real terms.  Free prescriptions and free public transport for the over-60s have also been  introduced, and we know the pressure that that has relieved in homes with  illnesses around the Province. There is no doubt that the Finance Department  and its Minister have taken steps to make this hard time a little easier and  will continue to do so.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That is why I find it difficult to fully comprehend some of  the statements that have been made, one of which was made by a Member for  Strangford. I heard little or no positive ideas about what he would do  differently and what he would bring to the table. I heard only negative  comments and remarks, which will certainly not put heat into homes across the Province.  That is in contrast to his own leader, Sir Reg Empey, who acknowledged in  positive terms, on &lsquo;The Politics Show&rsquo;, that the Programme for Government was  working well. I find it difficult to understand what a rewrite of the Budget  would do, if such a rewrite were possible; there is no new money. Where should  the money be taken from? Should it be siphoned from different Departments? Who  do we rob, and who do we pay first &mdash; the Department of Health, Social Services  and Public Safety?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I ask the Ulster Unionist Party &mdash; and perhaps the next  Member to speak can respond &mdash; what its Members think of the Conservative  Party&rsquo;s plans to drastically cut public spending, even more so than the Labour  Party. Are they happy with their party &mdash; the &ldquo;Conservative Unionists&rdquo; &mdash; to be  associated with Tory financial policy? When people do not spend, businesses  cannot survive, and in time the Province will be in a worse state. I am more  than confident in the steps that our Finance Minister is taking. He has the  best interests of the Province at heart; that is his goal and his focus.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The steps that have been taken are not the end of our route  to prosperity. Despite the pressures, the DUP Finance Minister is continuing to  deliver. Action has been taken to reduce rates burdens on small businesses. We  will deliver over &pound;1&middot;4 billion on construction projects this financial year,  compared with &pound;676 million five years ago. Again, that is a very clear step  forward. That is helping schools, roads, hospitals, and many other areas.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Over the next 10 years, the Department will deliver &pound;20  billion of capital projects through the investment strategy, working closely  with the small and medium-sized enterprises. There have been unprecedented  levels of investment in key Departments, such as the Department of Health,  Social Services and Public Safety, which enjoys its highest ever budget &mdash; &pound;4&middot;3  billion. That is an area that most people agree is in real need of investment  no matter what else is happening.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">What is important now is for Departments to declare likely  underspend and not wait until it is too late to make a difference. Money that  is not allocated for some reason will not help anybody anywhere, whereas the  opposite is true &mdash; money can be allocated for projects with a short turnaround,  such as buildings, which will create construction jobs that would be permanent  fixtures. That will not be possible if Departments hold on to their underspend  until the twelfth hour, by which time it will be too late.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, the Department of Finance and Personnel has  done a sterling job thus far in a hard time. I lend my wholehearted support to  the continuance of the work that has been started by the Minister, Nigel Dodds,  and his Department, and I ask Members to do the same thing, and support the  motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Neeson</strong>:  The Executive&rsquo;s priority in the Programme for Government was to grow the  economy. Unfortunately, the Programme for Government was drawn up before the  current economic downturn began. The real question is whether the necessary  resources are in the Budget to deal with the current situation. In particular,  what are the Executive&rsquo;s plans for financing public-sector projects in areas  such as social housing, road and rail infrastructure, and the upgrading of  schools and hospitals, all of which can assist the construction industry in  these very difficult times?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Last week, representatives from the Confederation of  British Industry (CBI) appeared before the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Investment. Among other  issues, they emphasised the importance of expanding the tourism industry in Northern Ireland,  bearing in mind the current value of sterling against the euro. Will the  Minister of Finance and Personnel, and the Executive, give me assurances today  about the existing proposals for the signature projects, particularly those at  the Titanic Quarter and the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the current situation, my party is not convinced that  the Executive are focused enough on developing the green economy. As I said in  the House last week, President Obama has already shown leadership on that  issue. There is clear evidence that global warming is happening at an  accelerated pace, and we in Northern    Ireland should consider that to be an  opportunity rather than a threat. By the same token, the relevant agencies  should be encouraging the development of renewable-energy projects, including  wind power, tidal power and generation of electricity from waste.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I must question the commitment to improving public  transport in Northern    Ireland. In particular, I want a complete  commitment from the Executive to purchase new trains, which are urgently needed  on the Larne line. Furthermore, at a local level, I seek assurances that the  upgrading of the A2 Carrickfergus to Belfast  road and the A8 Larne to Belfast  road will proceed on schedule.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I appreciate that times are difficult, but it is vital that  the Executive and the Assembly get their priorities right. That is what the  community expects of us, and that is what devolution is all about. The  challenge is there in the Budget. We must show flexibility, and priorities must  be developed as the economic climate changes.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  The debate has been interesting thus far, having identified the range of  opinions that exists in the Broad   Church that is the Ulster  Unionist Party. We had Mr McNarry &mdash; &ldquo;Dave the brave&rdquo;, &ldquo;hatchet man&rdquo; McNarry &mdash;  who wants to cut all around him; Basil McCrea, who wants us all to work  together; Sir Reg Empey, who supports the emphasis on the economy; and Mr  McGimpsey, who thinks that the only thing that matters is the health budget.  The Broad Church of the Ulster Unionist Party has  produced a broad range of opinions &mdash; it is certainly not a very cohesive group.  Perhaps when it joins with the Conservatives, it will have a different range of  opinions, and it will support the Executive&rsquo;s implementation of even more cuts  than Mr McNarry wants to see.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Some people have suggested today that we should  re-prioritise the Budget. However, let us go back to what was contained in the  Budget at the outset. The Budget&rsquo;s key priority was the economy. Is anyone  suggesting that, in a global recession, when people all over the world are  losing their jobs and banks are going bankrupt, that we should shift the focus  away from the economy to other matters? We will only resolve the difficulties in  social housing, health, education and many other areas if we have a strong and  vibrant economy. Therefore, it is right that we focus on the economy and not on  other areas. Re-prioritisation would be madness.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I agree with leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, because  he did not accept the assertion of his spokesman on financial affairs, Mr  McNarry, that the Programme for Government, which is barely a year old, is dead  in the water. Rather, Sir Reg welcomed the fact that the economy is at the top  of the list of priorities &mdash; which is where it should be.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Sir Reg did not accept that the structures were wrong;  therefore, I am not sure where &ldquo;hatchet man&rdquo; McNarry is taking his leadership  from on this issue, whether it is from David Cameron or Sir Reg Empey; but I am  glad that Sir Reg Empey is playing his role and is being part of the Executive  team. I trust that his influence will come to bear whenever the vote on this  motion takes place this evening.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I also trust that my Lagan Valley colleague Basil McCrea &mdash;  with whom I do not always agree, but who on this occasion is absolutely right  about the need to work together &mdash; will use his influence to ensure that Mr  McNarry does not go traipsing through the &lsquo;No&rsquo; Lobby and divide the House as  part of some petty political point-scoring exercise. If Mr McNarry were  successful, there would be no money in April for any Department to spend. That  is the logic that Mr McNarry has applied in this instance.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">During these times, we are much better off being linked to  the economy of the United    Kingdom. Over the past 10 years, people have  looked enviously southwards and have said how much better Northern Ireland  would be doing if it were part of the great Celtic tiger. I remember an  advertisement for the ESSO oil company that used the slogan &ldquo;put a tiger in  your tank&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>:  The Member is showing his age.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: I  can barely remember the advert; I was in short trousers at that time. The  slogan was &ldquo;put a tiger in your tank&rdquo;; however, the tank appears to have run  empty for that particular tiger and could do with refuelling.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In January alone, there were as many people added to the  unemployment list in the Republic of Ireland as there are on the unemployment list in Northern Ireland.  That identifies the nature of the problems that exist in the Republic of Ireland.  I do not wish that country ill, in any respect, because I know that Northern Ireland  benefited significantly when the economy in the Republic was strong. However, I  am glad that Northern Ireland is not closely attached to the Republic&rsquo;s current  economic problems &mdash; being trapped in the euro zone and losing serious numbers  of jobs, which its Government&rsquo;s finances are unable to withstand. We, in Northern Ireland, do well from out attachment to  the United Kingdom&rsquo;s  economy, which, despite all its problems, is still the fifth largest in the  world.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A Member spoke earlier about the difficulties in  implementing the infrastructure programme and about how the Government had  failed because they were supposed to spend &pound;1&middot;8 billion but only spent &pound;1&middot;4  billion. Of course, some people tend to overlook the realities of life and do  not observe them particularly well. This year, &pound;1&middot;3 billion to &pound;1&middot;4 billion was  supposed to be spent on infrastructure projects, which is an increase of &pound;600  million from previous years. In reality, the figure of &pound;1&middot;8 billion was based  on additional money being gained from the sale of assets.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Is any Member recommending that this Government sell off  their assets now when the market is down? Any sensible, rational individual who  has an asset and wishes, but is not being forced, to dispose of it will wait  until the market levels out and there is a better opportunity to maximise the  income that he will receive from the sale. Therefore, the headlong rush to sell  that asset &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">4.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  I thank the Member for giving way. I understand his logic, and I agree that it  would not be prudent to sell assets at this time. However, does he agree that  the miscalculation in relation to the Crossnacreevy site was beyond belief and  had nothing to do with the fall in the market? All of a sudden, land that had  been valued at &pound;200 million was worth only a maximum of &pound;6 million. Does the  Member believe that that situation should and could have been avoided, and does  he agree that it was an embarrassment to this Government?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: I  certainly think that the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development got that  badly wrong. One can put development value on a particular piece of land only  when it has received approval for development. Therefore, valuing agricultural  land by placing a development value on it is a fraud. The Agriculture  Department has many questions to answer about that particular issue. I know  that Mr Elliott will work with the other members of the Agriculture Committee  to seek those answers, and I thank him for bringing that issue to the Floor  today.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We need to maximise the value of our assets. At present,  the sale of those assets would not be of any benefit to the people of Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There are many considerable projects that are of huge  benefit to the people of Northern    Ireland. I suggest to Mr McNarry that his  colleagues would not be particularly happy with him if, for example, we were  not to proceed with the redevelopment of the Ulster Hospital.  I am sure that the good people of Strangford would reject Mr McNarry&rsquo;s idea to  make those particular cuts. I am sure that his colleague Mr Gardiner would be  less than happy if we did not proceed with developments at Craigavon Area   Hospital.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am sure that Mr McNarry&rsquo;s colleagues in Belfast  would be less than happy if we did not proceed with the Belfast sewers project. I am sure that my Lagan Valley  colleague Mr Basil McCrea would not want the &pound;20 million project for the  development of the South   Eastern Regional   College to be scrapped.  Some of us worked very hard to secure that development.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  I thank the Member for giving way. While he is on that theme, could he respond  to the loss of the 6,000 potential jobs that would have been created by the  development of the Maze/Long Kesh site? How does he feel about the loss of  those construction jobs in his constituency?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: I  will tell the Member exactly how I feel. Six thousand jobs are not enough. I  have much higher expectations for the Maze development than a mere 6,000 jobs.  I suggest that the deputy First Minister&rsquo;s office should tidy things up very  quickly. If that was done, real developers could be brought in to develop that  site very quickly. We will create substantially more than 6,000 jobs, and our  economy will develop significantly, if we receive co-operation from that  particular office.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  How many jobs would the shrine have created?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: I  hear the hatchet man talking again. He does not seem to like the fact that  mention was made of his proposals to cut the development of the Ulster Hospital.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member should draw his remarks to a close.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: We  will reject his proposals to cut the development of the Ulster Hospital.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>: It  is very hard to follow the barnstorming contribution from Mr Poots. I will be  brief. A couple of issues have emerged that we, as an Assembly, should consider  in the long term. I  speak not as a representative of the Committee for  Regional Development, but as someone who has sat on that Committee in this  Assembly and in the first Assembly in 1999.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A theme that keeps coming back to bite the Committee &mdash;  which the Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone Mr Elliott raised &mdash; is the  vexed issue of the structural maintenance of roads. Unfortunately, a system has  developed over the years in which structural maintenance has depended upon  allocations in the monitoring rounds, and why that happened is obvious.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The very natures of the quarrying and road industries mean  that contractors connect very quickly when money becomes available, and they  fix roads at short notice. Therefore, it has become accepted that if the issue  of structural maintenance is left to the monitoring rounds, the contractors  will be ready, the tar will be hot, the engines will be revving, and they will  go straight to a country road to fix it. The problem is that the wheels have  come off the monitoring-round gravy train.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the past four quarters, a consistent pattern has  emerged, whereby the amount of available money has been reduced even further.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If ever the old grandmothers&rsquo; phrase, &ldquo;a stitch in time  saves nine&rdquo;, was true, it is true about the structural maintenance of roads. We  are reaching the stage at which some C-class roads in Northern Ireland  undergo major repairs only once every 83 years. That means that many people in  the Chamber will not be alive to see the one planned maintenance of some  C-class roads in their areas. Those of us who do not drink or smoke, and who  are vegetarians, have a greater chance of seeing it, but it may not happen for  the rest. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span> Although I was making a  humorous point, by using the present method for the structural maintenance of  roads, we are storing up huge problems for our society.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I think that everyone in the Chamber will unite in  congratulating the Minister for succeeding in bidding for large capital  projects, and when they filter through the system, Northern Ireland&rsquo;s infrastructure  will be radically changed. Already, duelling work has taken place on the main  Dungannon to Ballygawley road; plans are well advanced for upgrading the  Aughnacloy to Londonderry route, and that must  be welcomed; and work on the Westlink is almost complete. All those projects  will bring huge economic benefits to Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, there is little sense in having wonderful A-class  trunk roads and motorways, if one encounters the reality of what has been  happening when one drives into rural areas. I am not criticising any particular  Department, because this state of affairs is a legacy of our history, but it is  time that we had a fundamental review of our approach to the problem. The  monitoring-round route will no longer suffice, and if we do not do something  soon, some of our roads will simply collapse because of the lack of planned  structural maintenance &mdash; or even a coating of stones.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We should have learned lessons from water. For years under  direct rule, the water infrastructure was deprived of essential investment, and  when the books were opened following devolution, they told an extremely sorry  tale. We found that sewage treatment works throughout the country simply did  not meet modern standards and, therefore, we have had to spend vast amounts of  money to upgrade major sewage treatment works in places such as north Down,  Portrush and east Antrim. Had we spent money at the time, as part of a sensible  planned maintenance budget, we may well have avoided many of the huge problems  that we have faced since devolution.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the next couple of years, we must sit down and think  strategically about what we intend to do about the problem. If we do not, as I  said, we will cause enormous difficulties for future generations. It is no good  passing on a totally decrepit road system, simply because we are not prepared  to face up to the reality that we are not spending enough money. The last  monitoring round was particularly disappointing, and if we continue spending at  the present rate, there will not be enough money left in the kitty to carry out  that work.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">When the unemployment statistics were published recently,  the headline figure was dramatic and worrying. However, it is interesting to  note, and significant, that almost half the entire increase in unemployment in Northern Ireland was as a result of layoffs in  the construction industry, and reviving that aspect of our economy, particularly  road maintenance, is one way that we could quickly get people in Northern Ireland  back to work. We could have men back on the roads within weeks. Other  job-creation methods are much slower and longer term; however, in Northern Ireland,  many thousands of capable road workers &mdash; mostly men &mdash; would be ready to start  such work at the drop of a hat. Perhaps, we could kill two birds with one stone  by bringing our roads up to an acceptable level and by &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  Is that the first time that the Member has killed two birds?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>: As  someone who boasted about going to Argentina to kill 8,000 pigeons,  that statement is a bit rum.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I did not boast about killing 8,000 pigeons; it was rumoured that I killed  8,000 birds.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>:  The honourable Member has not informed the House whether he killed more than  8,000 pigeons or fewer, but, if I was an Argentinian pigeon, I would be  extremely worried if I saw him coming through Buenos Aires again.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We need to grapple with this problem. It is set in stone in  the incoming Budget, but we need to get together as an Assembly and work out  how to solve the problem in the long term. Should we regard planned maintenance  as infrastructure, and access SIB funds? Is there some radical way that we can  get this sorted out? If not, I predict that rural areas will face big problems  in the future. In 10 or 15 years&rsquo; time, we will look back and ask why we did  not tackle the problem before it was too late.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for the Environment (Mr McGlone)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a  LeasCheann Comhairle. The Committee for the Environment has considered the  Department&rsquo;s submission for the February monitoring round, and it has a major  concern that it has identified to the Minister. The Department of the  Environment has identified road safety as an area in which it can seek  reductions in its budget. The Committee has asked for more information on the  detail. Proposals include a reduction in spend for road safety education  officers, and members have been led to believe that that is due to a deliberate  delay in recruitment to save money.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members are concerned about the implications of that,  especially since it concerns the safety of children. Should we be making any  cuts or postponing spending in that area? Can we be confident that there will  not be an increase in the numbers of children and young people dying on our  roads or sustaining injuries, as a consequence of that money-saving exercise  and decision?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">When bidding for funds, the correlation between education  officers and child safety is made by the Department. The converse, therefore, naturally  suggests that reductions in that area will have a detrimental effect. The  Committee was so concerned about the issue that it felt unable to endorse the  submission to the Department of Finance and Personnel. The concerns did not  stop there.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee was also concerned about the ongoing problem  to which it was alerted regarding the reduction in fees from planning  applications and a further bid by the Department to fill the resultant gap. A  similar proposal was presented to the Committee at the last monitoring round,  and members are asking how long the public purse can be called upon to make up  the difference in the shortfall.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members also wanted to be informed of what the longer-term  implications would be for personnel in the Planning Service if &mdash; or when &mdash;  adjustments in budget forecasts have to be made to allow for that reduced  demand.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee for the Environment noted with consternation  the discrepancy between what appears to be an overstaffed planning unit and a  shortage of road safety education officers. The Committee sees that as  something of a no-brainer.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Concerns about the February monitoring submission did not  stop there. It seems that the Department is in a position to return over  &pound;500,000 as a result of a reduction in environmental protection spend and  farming-conservation practices. Considering that agriculture schemes are so  readily oversubscribed when administered by other Departments, members wanted  to know why there seemed to be an inability to spend the money that was budgeted  by the Northern Ireland Environment Agency. Were farmers unaware that the money  was available to them? How were such schemes advertised? How were farmers  advised of them? How were they delivered? Those are some key questions to which  the Committee is seeking answers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee learned also that there had been slippage in  the electronic planning information for citizens (e-PIC) project that had been  so eagerly awaited. In previous monitoring submissions, that had been  attributed to difficulties in recruitment. However, in this February monitoring  round, the Committee was told that in its efforts to save money, the Department  had sought deliberately to delay planned expenditure on filling vacancies where  there had been no contractual obligations to pay in this financial year. We  will have to wait for a while before the e-PIC project becomes fully and  completely alive.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I reiterate the Committee&rsquo;s overriding concern that in a  bid to save money in the short term, the Department is &mdash; and will be &mdash; putting  children&rsquo;s lives at risk in the longer term.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As we come to the end of this budgetary period and make  preparations for the next one, I urge the Department to ensure that any  monetary sacrifices that are made now do not result in lives being sacrificed  tomorrow.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A LeasCheann Comhairle, sin a bhfuil le r&aacute; agam.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker; that is all that I have to  say on behalf of the Committee.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">4.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy  Chairperson of the Committee for Employment and Learning (Mr Newton)</strong>: I am  pleased to speak in the debate. The Chairperson of the Committee spoke earlier  and outlined a number of the issues that the Committee raised, but perhaps I  can place a slightly different emphasis on some points.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Committee members noted the proposal that the Department  for Employment and Learning made to DFP, and I have composed some brief remarks  about the Department for Employment and Learning&rsquo;s reduced requirements. In  this monitoring round, Committee members noted that underspend for particular  projects and programmes was not large. In fact, underspend appeared to be  comparatively small-scale when one considered the total amount that was  allocated to the Department. However, the percentage that the underspend represents  in specific budgets for projects or programmes can be vital.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Committee members have already established that shortfalls  in spending on demand-led programmes &mdash; skills and preparation-for-work  programmes &mdash; are a result of problems associated with time lags, ahead of when  involvement in those programmes became obligatory for eligible clients. The  Chairperson of the Committee mentioned that point in her contribution.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As a case in point, in this monitoring round, the Department  for Employment and Learning is confirming a reduced requirement of circa  &pound;700,000. That is because take-up of the New Deal/Steps to Work programme has  not reached the levels that were forecast. The programme is not mandatory for  those aged 18 to 24, and it is not possible for people in that age bracket to  enter the programme before they have been registered for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance  for a minimum of six months. For those aged over 25, that period is 18 months.  Committee members have previously queried the requirement for an 18-month  qualifying period.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Given that the Committee has queried that time lag, and  bearing in mind that the numbers of people who are out of work has shot up, it  might be time for the Minister to give that matter consideration. There is  every expectation that funding levels for that scheme and other demand-led  skills-training programmes, which are directly related to the increasing levels  of unemployment, will need to be increased. Committee members wish to draw that  to Minister Dodds&rsquo;s attention, and we implore him to be accommodating with  funding for those essential schemes when demand for them increases.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Committee members have emphasised to departmental officials  the need for a highly skilled workforce and for investment in the upskilling  and reskilling of all our young people, and, indeed, all those who need  retraining. Failure to do that will mean that we are not ready for better  economic times, when we shall need a well-qualified, motivated and highly  skilled workforce, which will be attractive not only to foreign investors but  to the most progressive of local firms, as they exploit business opportunities  for growth.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Those skills gaps cannot be allowed to continue &mdash; they must  be addressed. I believe that I am right in saying that Committee members will  support bids that the Department submits for funds for such training programmes.  We ask the Minister of Finance and Personnel to bear that in mind when it comes  to the future upskilling and reskilling of the Northern Ireland labour force.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I will now take off my Deputy Chairperson&rsquo;s hat and speak  as a member of the Committee. It is probably the case that the worst-hit sector  of industry is the construction sector. Hundreds of apprentices have now been  paid off and, as such, are unable to complete their apprenticeships.  Unfortunately, the company fostering scheme that Minister Empey developed has  not been taken up by the sector. We will lose those young people from our  skilled workforce if they are not given the opportunity to gain their full  apprenticeship qualifications. Members have expressed concerns on that matter,  which the Minister must address. Funding will be required to deal with that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Again, I implore the Finance Minister to consider funding  for the increased quality of apprenticeship schemes overall. I have no doubt  that when the Committee completes its work on the review of apprenticeship  training, it will recommend a higher quality of apprenticeship training through  every sector of industry.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee for Employment and Learning has always taken  a responsible position in its relationship with the Department, and it will, I  believe, be supportive of the Department in its work over the coming months.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  am, possibly, the last Member, other than the Minister, to speak in the debate.  At this late stage in the afternoon, it is difficult to provide anything that is  new, inspiring or interesting, so I shall try my best to stick to that promise  and bring nothing that is new, inspiring or interesting to the debate. Indeed,  a heckler on my right has said that that has never stopped me in the past.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Not only towards the end of a debate is it difficult to  introduce anything new, to those who have been involved in Budget debates &mdash;  and, along with several colleagues in the Chamber, I have been involved in some  of the Budget or finance debates since about 1999 &mdash; there is a tremendous sense  of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu about the subject. Mr Wells, one of the previous Members to speak,  was probably debating the subject when there were pounds, shillings and pence.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, for those of us who have been involved in Budget  processes over the past 10 years or so, there is often a great similarity in  these debates. Despite our current financial position, I suspect that if one  plucked this debate, or one of the other debates, at random at any stage over  the past 10 years and said that it was today&rsquo;s debate, plenty of the same  issues would be coming up again and again.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Not unsurprisingly, and with a fair level of merit, we  heard representatives of the various Committees read the key demands of their  Department, and it is perfectly reasonable for Committee Chairpersons to defend  their bailiwicks. One of the problems of any Finance Minister is that there is  rarely a choice between good spend and bad spend, or between things that are  completely unworthy and things that have a full degree of merit. Quite often,  it is a choice between expenditure on various good projects. Therefore, the  position of the various Committee Chairpersons is understandable.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, we have seen a few novel actions today. As regards  competing for priorities, we have seen the need to have everything focused on a  business or a right-wing agenda, a need to have health as a top priority, and a  need to have child poverty and tackling the poverty of the lowest in our  society as a priority. Those competing priorities can be found in the speeches  of simply the Ulster Unionist Party, who are still not quite sure on the one  hand whether they are with the &ldquo;Cameroons&rdquo;, who are willing to slash and burn  everything, or whether they are in the Fred Cobain mode, trying to defend an  old Labour-type agenda.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Unfortunately, we have also seen a high level of  misunderstanding in the debate, particularly from the Ulster Unionist Benches.  The debate is not about the future long-term direction of the Budget. There  will be an opportunity tomorrow to debate the wider bits of the Budget and for  the longer-term position to be examined. Today&rsquo;s debate, however, is about  ensuring that money goes to front line services. When the tap gets turned off  on public money, those Members who will oppose today&rsquo;s debate must tell us how  they will explain that to all those front line services that have not been  given enough money to survive physically, and I look forward to that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Of course, we do not always have the calm, erudite  presentation of an alternative way forward in the Budget debate, as was done by  Mr McNarry, and today was no exception.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Instead, we got some &ldquo;stuntery&rdquo;, whereby, at one stage, an  attempt was made to table an amendment to leave 1p in the Consolidated Fund.  Some of us with long memories will remember the great cry of the now Liberal  Democrats in the 1980s for a 1p increase on income tax. Suddenly, there was a  massive range of things that they could do with that 1p increase &mdash; it must have  been spent several times over. That 1p increase was spent on education, health,  and so on, yet even the now Liberal Democrats did not have the inventiveness to  spend a single penny over and over again, &agrave; la Mr McNarry. We must acknowledge  his inventiveness when it comes to fiscal responsibility.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I heard mention of the black hole. Not only do some Members  seem obsessed with the world of finance but others have become amateur astronomers  in their spare time, and they appear to be spotting black holes all over the  place. Let us be honest: on inspection, the argument does not hold up. Yes,  there is an examination of wish lists of &pound;1 billion in future expenditure.  Again, I must point out that that matter is not directly relevant to today&rsquo;s  business. To deal with the issue, a number of those wish lists relate to energy  costs, job evaluation and departmental prioritisations, but that is not expenditure  to which we have committed. Consequently, they are potential future pressures.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am sure that if given enough money, all of us involved in  drawing up the Budget could spend it on worthy causes two or three times over.  However, that does not constitute a wish list. As everybody knows, we are  living in tough financial circumstances. Those who seek a radical  redistribution of the Budget are very quick to tell us where they think things  are wrong and where they believe vast additional amounts of money should be  spent, yet there is silence when they are asked to identify which programmes  and departmental budgets are to be cut to finance those additional investments.  For example, should &pound;500 million be taken out of the health budget to fund  those programmes? Again, when that question is asked, we are met with silence.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I will now speak about capital investment. Some &pound;1&middot;4  billion in net capital is projected to be spent. The difference between that  projection and earlier projections is that it is net of capital receipts. Those  who decry the &pound;1&middot;4 billion of capital investment should remember that that  figure represents a record spend. It was only as recently as 2003 that the  amount spent on capital receipts was &pound;676 million, which is less than half the  projected spend now. Indeed, last year, the figure was &pound;1&middot;1 billion. Again,  what we are witnessing represents not simply an increase or a record level of  expenditure but very much a step change and a sea change.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is abundantly clear that all Departments must examine  their budgets to ensure that their capital expenditure is right and that  projects are not being unnecessarily delayed. In particular, those Departments  with large capital projects must ensure that projects are being progressed as  quickly as they should be. A distinction must be made between capital projects  that have been put on the long finger and those that will be progressed in the  next financial year &mdash; the delay of a month or two or into the next financial  year is not a major problem.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that the spring Supplementary Estimates  fulfil the Executive&rsquo;s priorities of putting the economy and business first and  of ensuring that front line services are delivered. I urge Members to think  about what they are voting for in this debate. Moreover, I ask those who oppose  the motion to consider whether they want to stop front line services being  delivered to all our constituents. I support the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: The debate has been wide-ranging. I was going to say  that it was a pleasure to sit through it all, but that might be gilding the  lily a little. Many issues have been raised, although, as Peter Weir said, some  were not always relevant to the Supply resolutions under discussion.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Some Members touched on the wider economic and Budget  considerations that they felt were important to reflect upon and discuss. In  the course of my closing remarks, I hope to try to address some of those  issues. However, to understand that, a certain level of financial, or at least  numerical, literacy will be required. Although that will rule out one or two  Members, most of those who spoke will be able to follow the gist of the Budget  procedure. I gave up long ago on certain Members having a rational approach to  financial matters.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">5.00 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for Finance and  Personnel, Simon Hamilton, confirmed that there has been appropriate  consultation with the Committee on the spending plans outlined in the motions.  The Supply resolutions and the Budget Bill provide legal authority for the expenditure  of moneys for this year and for the first couple of months of 2010. Therefore,  when we list the projects that would be stopped if they had their way, those  Members who announced that they will vote against the motions will have to  explain to everyone in their constituencies how such action will help with the  restoration of economic confidence in Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I will address one or two of the other crackpot schemes  that were announced by Mr McNarry, who I think is the official finance  spokesperson for the Ulster Unionist Party. He mentioned freezing the pay of  public-sector workers. That was slipped into his speech, and I will examine  that in more detail shortly.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The House should be familiar with &mdash; although I know that  some Members are not &mdash; the logistical need for the Budget Bill to have  accelerated passage and to receive Royal Assent by 31 March 2009. I appreciate  the assistance of the Committee in that matter. I assure Members that strict  conditions have been applied to the headroom built into the Supplementary  Estimates. Any resources allocated at this stage will be used only for the  agreed purpose, and virement approval will not be given later to cover excess  spending in any other areas.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Hamilton raised the issue of the review of in-year monitoring.  Although the most significant spending allocations to Northern Ireland  Departments are made as part of the Budget process, it is equally important  that there is sufficient flexibility to make changes subsequently as part of  the in-year monitoring process. Although the current process has generally  worked well, it is essential that we seek to continually improve all of our  programmes and processes, which is why my Department is reviewing the in-year  monitoring process. That review will examine in particular the bureaucratic  burden on Departments as well as how engagement with Committees can be  improved. The review will be completed by the end of the financial year, and I  look forward to the outcome of the Committee&rsquo;s deliberations on that matter.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Chairperson of the Committee for Employment and  Learning, Sue Ramsey, mentioned more funding for demand-led skills programmes.  I agree with her and the deputy Chairperson of that Committee, Robin Newton,  about the need to continue supporting the local economy and workers,  particularly with regard to skills. As was mentioned, we need to be ready for  the time when the upturn in the economy arrives. It is very difficult to  predict the level of funding required for demand-led programmes, which is why  the quarterly monitoring process is so important in providing the Executive  with the flexibility to respond to those issues. Some people decry that  process, but at the same time make pleas for extra resources to be freed up  from money not spent elsewhere in the in-year monitoring process. The  Department for Employment and Learning will want to monitor funding  requirements for programmes as we move into the next financial year.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Sue Ramsey and Stephen Farry both mentioned capital  projects. Given the nature of such schemes, there will always be some slippage  in capital projects, which is another reason why we urge all Departments to  identify slippage early in the year and surrender it as reduced requirements,  thus enabling the resources to be reallocated. Any acceleration of capital  projects is dependent on the level of resources available in that year. Again,  that is basic financial common sense, which will be lost on one or two Members.  However, I make that point for the benefit of most Members.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As part of the recent December monitoring round, the  Executive agreed to avail of the opportunity provided by the Treasury in London to accelerate &pound;9&middot;4  million of capital investment from 2010-11 into the 2008-09 financial year.  Representatives of the construction industry in particular welcomed that. If  the Executive so decides, there is also an opportunity to accelerate &pound;76  million into 2009-2010 from 2010-11. However, it must be borne in mind that we  need to take all factors into account when making that decision and that acceleration  of funding has implications in terms of the year in which it is being  accelerated from. However, we will keep that matter under review.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Some Members raised the issues of Crossnacreevy and  Workplace 2010. In the light of changed circumstances, the position in both  cases is being reviewed before recommendations are made on how to proceed.  Edwin Poots made the point about Crossnacreevy. It is important that the  Department of Agriculture and Rural Development takes that issue on board as a  matter of priority. It is a matter essentially for that Department.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I will now turn to a number of other matters that were raised  regarding the Executive&rsquo;s capital investment plans. As Peter Weir, Simon  Hamilton and other Members pointed out, the Executive&rsquo;s plans regarding capital  investment will be higher this year than they were last year. In fact, they  will be double what they were under direct rule. Therefore, when we talk about  ensuring that jobs are protected, particularly those in the construction  industry, it is important to remember the level of investment this year and the  level that is planned not only next year and the year after, but over the  10-year period of the investment strategy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If we did not have that strategy in place, everyone would  ask what we are doing to put more money into capital expenditure. References  were made to what Scotland  and Wales are doing, but, in  proportion, Northern Ireland  is doing what Scotland and Wales are  doing. In fact, when I met the Finance Ministers for Scotland  and Wales,  we agreed on the commonality of our approach to investment in capital projects.  In fact, we were going further with issues such as rates relief to help  hard-pressed families. There was a large degree of commonality, for instance,  on the issue of ensuring that Government receipts and invoices were paid as  quickly as possible, in order to ensure that there was cash flow to industry  and to businesses.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Given that Mr McNarry raised the issue of a review of  budget allocations, it surprised me that he then opposed moves by the Executive  to reprioritise funding to projects that will have the largest immediate impact  on the economy. Another matter of concern, which I raised at the outset, was  his suggestion about public-sector pay freezes. I am sure that the 200,000 public-sector  workers in Northern Ireland,  as well as shopkeepers and local firms who rely on those salaries for business,  would have been shocked when they heard the suggestion from the official  spokesman &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: No, you have had your say. I am taking my  opportunity now to reply.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  Are you going to tell fibs?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: They will be shocked at his call for a public-sector  wage freeze. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">You had plenty of time to speak, Mr McNarry. You will now  be able to listen to my response.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  But you are not telling it right.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: Calm down.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: Does the Member not realise &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I ask the Member to withdraw his remark.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  Whatever the remark was that gave offence to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, I withdraw  it.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: It has to be said that during a time of downturn in  the private sector, public-sector wages provide essential support, and that a  pay freeze would have serious consequences for the economy. I do not know  whether the rest of the Member&rsquo;s party agree that hard-working public-sector workers  and their families who have experienced rising costs over the past year should  be faced or threatened with a further penalty at this time &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member is getting all excited now, because we are  dealing with some of the points that he made. We remember Mr McNasty &mdash; sorry,  Mr McNarry &mdash; dubbed &ldquo;the hatchet man&rdquo; by my colleague, or &ldquo;Slasher&rdquo; McNarry,  was at odds with Mr McCrea on this issue, and he was clearly at odds with Mr  Cobain and Sir Reg Empey on this issue.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">When Reg Empey was asked on &lsquo;The Politics Show&rsquo; a  week-and-a-half ago, he made it clear that there should be no fundamental  reprioritisation of the Programme for Government &mdash; he defended it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McNarry was sacked by Reg Empey as Chief Whip. We know  his views &mdash; he talked about policing and justice. He once said that it had to  be recognised that there would be a Sinn F&eacute;in Minister for policing and  justice. He went on to say that he did not understand the use of the word  &ldquo;easement&rdquo;, as though it was a new invention that we rely on. Then Mr Cobain  spoke, and he talked freely about easements, so he knew all about easements and  reduced requirements. However, to Mr McNarry, it appeared to be a new concept.  He really does need to get a bit of financial literacy into his head. The black  hole that is in his imagination needs to be filled with a bit of financial  accounting understanding.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Just before Christmas, Mr McNarry came out with a brilliant  suggestion. He has never since repeated it in this House, or anywhere else. He  came out with the idea that we should have what he called an &ldquo;equity release  scheme&rdquo;. In this brilliant crackpot scheme, he said that we should tot up all  that the Executive and Government hold in valuations of assets in Northern Ireland.  We should then seek from the UK Government an immediate interest-free advance.  Later, if the valuations rose, we would repay the loan and pocket the rest. It  was laughed to scorn in Treasury, and I have not heard it mentioned since. What  has happened to that idea? Has it disappeared into the black hole? We have  never heard him mention it since, yet it was put forward as a means of trying  to rescue our economy. That is the level of financial literacy that was on  display.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Then Mr McNarry was going to table an amendment to knock a  penny off the Budget. That was his solution. His amendment was not even  accepted. It beggars belief that, at a time of serious economic consequences,  Mr McNarry should make such a ludicrous, pathetic, laughable suggestion,  instead of making serious suggestions.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McNarry said that we rely on the hope that there will be  inefficiencies in the system, in order to meet pressures and so on. He should  have a word with his colleague Reg Empey, Minister for Employment and Learning.  If Mr McNarry believes that reduced requirements are inefficiencies, then Reg  is one of the most inefficient Ministers. The fact is, however, that reduced  requirements come about because of the exact opposite of inefficiency. Very often,  there are reduced requirements from Departments because they have been more  efficient than they would have been otherwise. Sometimes, that is because  Departments have overbid for funds in the first place. Sometimes, it is because  of changed circumstances and money cannot be spent as originally intended and  must be returned. That happens in all Departments. However, to Mr McNarry, this  is mind-boggling stuff, unknown to him &mdash; though it is known to all the other  Chairpersons and representatives of his party.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McNarry&rsquo;s view runs totally contrary to what his  colleague Mr Beggs said when a statement was made about the December monitoring  round. Mr Beggs said that in extending the level of overcommitment and then  dealing with it through the in-year monitoring process, the Minister:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;will be implementing one of the ideas that was  suggested by the Ulster  Unionist Party in its submission on the draft Budget&rdquo;. &mdash; <span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; ">[Official Report, Vol 36,  No3, p115, col 2].</span></span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">So, Mr McNarry is at odds with his party colleague  Mr Beggs on that very issue.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The other issue that has to be dealt with is the proposal  to reprioritise the Budget. It has been acknowledged by several Members &mdash; and I  have acknowledged it as well &mdash; that during the in-year monitoring process,  changes are made to the Budget. Additional funds are put in various areas in  response to bids. For example, the fuel-credit payment is a change to the  Budget. Mr Durkan acknowledged that we make changes as we go along; of course  we do. However, what is suggested by those who put forward the idea of  reprioritisation is that we have a fundamental look at what is in the baseline  allocation of each Department.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">5.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That can only mean taking money out of one Department and  putting it into another. That is a fundamental attack on budgets such as that  of the Health Department and the Education Department. There is no other way to  find the money to fundamentally reprioritise than through reallocation among  Departments. Do Mr McNarry and others who put forward that suggestion live in a  parallel universe? They need to get it into their heads that the Budget has  been fully allocated along departmental baselines.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Almost half of the Budget goes to the Health Department.  Has Mr McNarry asked his colleague the Health Minister whether he is prepared  to give up any of that money? Mr McGimpsey has made it clear, in the Executive  and elsewhere, that he wants more money. I have listened to representatives of  the various Committees say that they want more money. Once again, Mr McNarry is  clearly at odds with his party colleagues and with other Assembly Members.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Apart from his crackpot idea of mortgaging Government  assets &mdash; including, no doubt, this Building &mdash; to try to secure an interest-free  loan from the Treasury, Mr McNarry is silent. Importantly, Basil McCrea made  the point that the threat emanates from Whitehall.  In his pre-Budget report, the Chancellor of the Exchequer signalled that there  could be &pound;5 million of so-called efficiencies; the difference is that he does  not intend to plough those back into spending. I have spoken to my Welsh and  Scottish counterparts and we intend to resist that; we have made it clear that  we will raise that matter with the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, the Prime  Minister and the Chancellor. When I challenged Mr McCrea, he agreed that we  should oppose that. However, when I challenged him to oppose what his own party  &mdash; the Conservatives &mdash; will be doing, with cuts that go further than Labour&rsquo;s  and that will begin in April 2010, there was silence.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McNarry talked about a black hole in the Budget. That  black hole will be created by Whitehall  changing the allocations under the block grant. Mr McNarry&rsquo;s new leader, David  Cameron, is proposing even greater cuts to the Northern Ireland block grant than  Labour, and both proposals are unacceptable. Will Mr McNarry and his party  oppose those cuts? It is very clear that they are in bed with those who are  going to lead an even greater attack on services than anything that he could  even imagine. Mr McNarry has nothing to say because, unless he decides to  renege, he is part and parcel of that attack. He is at odds with his party.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McNarry has spoken up and railed against those who urge  a full-scale line-up with the Tories&rsquo; views on the Orange Order, etc, and that  has caused him some difficulty. However, as financial spokesman, Mr McNarry will  have to answer a question: does he agree with the Conservative Party attack on  funding in the block grant &mdash; an attack that will go even further than the Labour  Party proposals? Both proposals are unacceptable and will be opposed by my  party and, I hope, by all parties in the Executive.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As far as financial literacy is concerned, I do not hold  out any hope whatsoever that Mr McNarry will learn anything as a result of the  debate; however, I hope that other Members in his party, particularly his party  leader, will be aware of the inconsistencies in his approach.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to deal very quickly with a number of matters that  Declan O&rsquo;Loan raised. Mr O&rsquo;Loan talked about funding for PFI projects coming from  the banking sector and from PPPs; however, as Mr O&rsquo;Loan knows, PFI deals  account for less than 25% of the total investment strategy for Northern Ireland.  If there are specific problems in PPP delivery, we will look at alternative  methods of ensuring that contracts are fulfilled. That could include working  with alternative banking consortia or delivery through conventional procurement  vehicles.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr O&rsquo;Loan was concerned that the &pound;900 million was not new  money; however, at no point have I said that it was.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, in minimising the impact of the additional cost  pressures that face the Executive, the package of support that is provided by  the Treasury is of equal value to the funds that are available for local public  services. That included &pound;800 million to cover the deferment of water charges  and &pound;100 million for wider pressures, including equal pay. If that support had  not been forthcoming, the Executive would have been faced with the option of  addressing those pressures from a reduction in existing departmental budgets.  That money was secured to ensure that that would not have to happen.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Stephen Farry and Iris Robinson raised issues on the  approach that some Members have taken to the Budget Bill. The suggestion that  some Members would go through the Lobbies to vote against the Supplementary  Estimates and the Budget Bill is incredible. I will be clear on what a vote  against those would do. The Members who talk about a black hole in the Budget  would immediately create an unimaginable abyss, because no funding would be  available for any front line services anywhere in Northern Ireland from 1 April 2009.  Those Members have put that forward as responsible economic policy at a time of  economic recession and hardship. That is the level of responsibility from  certain quarters.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I note the criticisms that the Alliance Party and the SDLP  made and the issues that they took, but at least they have the responsibility  to realise that such a crazy approach would be totally detrimental to the  interests of the people of Northern    Ireland. I leave it to the Ulster Unionist  Party to decide whether it is prepared to be led by Mr McNarry in that way or  whether it intends to assert some degree of financial responsibility after all.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Farry mentioned the shortfall in capital expenditure. It  is, of course, the primary responsibility of Ministers and Departments, working  with the Strategic Investment Board, to implement the Executive&rsquo;s capital  investment programme, rather than that of the Department of Finance and  Personnel. However, it must be recognised that, as house prices have fallen,  external factors have meant that delivery against the &pound;1&middot;8 billion in gross  capital expenditure plans is no longer a meaningful indicator of performance by  Departments.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As Simon Hamilton, Peter Weir and others have pointed out,  the net capital expenditure plans of &pound;1&middot;3 billion, which Northern Ireland  Departments will not only meet but will exceed comfortably according to the  latest forecast, is a better measure. That compares with last year, when Departments  underspent by some &pound;300 million against net capital investment plans.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is important to put on record the level of expenditure  and the sorts of projects that are being funded as a result of the investment  strategy and the capital investment that is being made this year. Seven major  projects are being funded in the Department of Health, Social Services and  Public Safety, totalling some &pound;265 million. That includes developments at the Royal Victoria  Hospital, the Ulster  Hospital, the Downe  Hospital, Portadown Community  Treatment and Care Centre, Altnagelvin   Area Hospital  and the regional adolescent child psychiatric unit. That is only a number of  the projects that are taking place in the Department of Health, Social Services  and Public Safety.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Roads Service has spent some &pound;125 million on the Westlink  and the widening of the M2. The A4 from Dungannon to Ballygawley has received  &pound;115 million of investment. At Newry, the A1 has received &pound;180 million.  Northern Ireland Water has received &pound;127 million to spend on the Belfast sewer project,  and Northern Ireland Water has 10 waste-water treatment projects under  construction with an aggregated value of approximately &pound;89 million. I could go  on to list the projects that are being carried out by the Department for  Employment and Learning, the Department of Education, the Department of  Culture, Arts and Leisure and the Department for Social Development, and so on.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">All that points to the fact that a considerable amount of  investment is being made in capital expenditure this year. That is expected to  grow next year and extend into the following year, 2010-11. It is essential  that those projects proceed and are not derailed in any way. Therefore, in  December 2008, I announced that any projects that were using the frameworks  that were being held up by legal challenges will move forward by conventional  procurement. I said that that would allow &pound;115 million worth of projects to go  to the market. Between December and 1 April, capital projects worth &pound;400  million will go to market.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">When we talk about what is happening elsewhere, about  fiscal stimuli and all the rest, it must be recognised that &pound;18 billion worth  of investment &mdash; over the period of the investment strategy for Northern Ireland  &mdash; represents a significant boost to our construction industry, and lays the  groundwork and foundation for a modern infrastructure for the people of  Northern Ireland in the years ahead. Capital expenditure is projected to be  some 26&middot;4% higher than last year, providing a significant benefit to the  construction industry and the delivery of better public services as part of the  Programme for Government.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Stephen Farry raised a point about the current economic  downturn. As was pointed out by other Members &mdash; including Ian Paisley Jnr &mdash; the  economy was, and continues to be, the first priority of the Programme for  Government. Sir Reg Empey was right to say that no fundamental reprioritisation  or review is required, because the Programme for Government has it right.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I know that Sir Reg is away, but he might be surprised to  hear what was said by some Members from his own Benches. In an economic  downturn, growing the economy must be put first, which is what the Programme  for Government does. As I have said, that is consistent with the approach of devolved  Administrations elsewhere. I will continue to work with colleagues in the  coming months to explore every possible opportunity, and to provide as much  support as possible to struggling families and hard-pressed businesses, as the  precise impact of the economic downturn continues to unravel.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I believe that the Budget puts in place a strong foundation  of support for families and businesses in Northern Ireland over the next  three years. That support includes the decision to freeze domestic regional rates  over the Budget period, which marks a clear break from direct rule when rates  bills increased by an annual average of around 10%.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Over the past six months, further measures were put in  place to support local families. In December, I announced a package of measures  in response to the economic downturn, including the &pound;150 fuel credit payment;  and &pound;20 million for the farm nutrient management scheme, which &mdash; as Tom Elliott  and other Members pointed out &mdash; has proved extremely useful by benefiting the  agricultural sector and providing valuable work for construction firms. Help  has also been given to schools, roads maintenance and public transport works.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Measures that we announced about the small business rates  relief scheme, on which further details will be forthcoming &shy;shortly and which  will come into play from 2010, have been widely welcomed by businesses,  particularly small- and medium-sized enterprises. The decision to freeze  interest rates for businesses will also help them at this difficult time. It is  essential that we do everything in our power, within our limited remit, to  protect as many jobs as possible, and to help businesses. We brought forward  measures to help councils in relation to rates relief, and introduced planning  reforms. I am delighted that planning changes to PPS 21 announced by the  Minister, and other planning reforms, will speed up the planning process.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The issues of increased efficiency savings and the risk of  Departments not achieving targets were raised. I believe that Mr Basil McCrea spoke  about the &pound;5 billion in 2010-11 that was mentioned in the Chancellor&rsquo;s  pre-Budget report. I already referred to that in challenging other Members in  Mr McCrea&rsquo;s party to recognise that the threat comes not so much from within  the Assembly Budget than from outside with regard to what the Treasury plans to  do to the block grant if it proceeds with the &pound;5 billion in efficiency savings  for Whitehall Departments for 2010-11 &mdash; and what the Conservative Opposition  plans to do to make that situation even worse. We intend to challenge that, and  I hope that we will have the support of all parties.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A number of other matters were raised. Mr Durkan questioned  the delay in investment-delivery plans. We must focus on what is important,  which is that Departments deliver their planned capital investment programmes.  The latest forecast outturn figures from Departments for this year indicate  almost full spend on net capital investment, which demonstrates that  Departments are delivering on their capital programmes.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">5.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McElduff raised the issue of the multi-sports stadium. I  must remind him and other Members that the accounting officers in both OFMDFM  and DCAL concluded, as he well knows, that a value-for-money case had not been  demonstrated for the scale of public expenditure that was involved in those  proposals.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Transfer of fiscal powers was also raised in the debate. In  order to consider the case for the Northern Ireland Executive and the Assembly  to have greater fiscal power, people who espouse such a view must first set out  clearly what they want to do with that power. Would they raise taxes and thus  place further burdens on local families and businesses? Would they reduce  taxation and thus starve public services of funding? The simple fact is that Northern Ireland benefits significantly by  billions of pounds each year from being part of a fiscal union with the rest of  the United Kingdom.  That is the case now more than ever, as the experience of smaller nations  throughout Europe has shown.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I accept the point that has been made by several Members  about the challenging times to come in the years ahead. One of the strategic  stocktake&rsquo;s aims was to highlight all of the pressures that are faced by the  Executive. I have been clear and open about our financial position. The debate  has emphasised external factors &mdash; and one of its benefits has been the  acceptance of them by several Members &mdash; particularly the threat that is posed  to the Executive as a result of the announcement in the pre-Budget report of Whitehall efficiencies.  We must take close recognition of that matter and challenge it at every  opportunity. I look forward to working with parties and Members on those issues  in a reasonable and mature way.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Durkan raised the matter of reshaping economic policy.  The fact is that, throughout the world, there is no clear agreement on the  correct approach to economic interventions. He mentioned the ongoing review by  the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment, chaired by Professor  Richard Barnett of the University   of Ulster, which will be  important in setting the longer-term economic development strategy. I agree that  the Government&rsquo;s role is to support local businesses and not to try to control  the economy. That must be considered with regard to the Executive&rsquo;s role at this  time.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The detrimental impact of rising unemployment on  individuals and their families and the threat of job losses have been stressed  during the debate. There was some suggestion that Invest Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  approach to foreign direct investment (FDI) should be reconsidered. It must be  ensured that local, indigenous firms have long-term growth. As Members are  aware, the immediate need for job creation must often be focused on FDI from  larger firms.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Bain Review was also mentioned &mdash; it was debated on 21  October 2008 &mdash; and I am currently considering its consequences. The matter will  be brought to the Executive for discussion in the near future.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Chairperson of the Health Committee, Iris Robinson,  mentioned the first call on savings by that Department. It was provided with  the dispensation as part of the 2007 Budget process: it would receive the first  &pound;20 million in allocations as part of the in-year monitoring process. To date,  &pound;15 million has already been allocated to the Department during the current  year. I am sure that the Health Minister would be extremely interested to hear  members of his own party talk about reprioritisation of the Budget when the  clear implications of that for departmental baselines is that that money would  have to come largely out of the health budget.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As regards structural maintenance, several Members raised  the issue of continued maintenance of the roads network. That is important, not  only to sustain the quality of that important element of the public  infrastructure, but also for the support that it offers the local construction  industry. It is for that reason that the Executive agreed an additional  allocation for structural maintenance as part of the 2008-09 in-year monitoring  process. Going further, the structural-maintenance budget will increase by  28&middot;6% in 2009-2010, while the overall roads capital-investment programme will  be 77&middot;5% greater than in 2007-08.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Of course, that will only be the case if Members decide not  to reprioritise and take money out of that Department to put it into another  Department. However, none of the Members who talked about the issue suggested  where the money should be taken from.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Simpson, the Chairperson of the Committee for Social  Development, raised the issue of the shortfall in capital receipts from house  and land sales and the impact on the housing programme. We are fully aware of  the pressures facing the housing budget due to the shortfall in house and land  sale receipts. The additional allocation of &pound;20 million during the 2008-09  in-year monitoring process is evidence that we recognise those pressures.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It must be recognised that a number of Departments face  pressure. The Chairpersons of the various Committees &mdash; for Employment and  Learning, Education and so on &mdash; all said that the needs of their Departments  must be recognised in the allocation of any available in-year funds. Bearing in  mind all the competing bids, it is important that all those matters are  considered by the Executive as a whole. However, ensuring that jobs are  maintained and created in the construction industry in Northern Ireland  remains a priority.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am pleased that the Northern Ireland Co-Ownership Housing  Association was allocated &pound;15 million grant funding this year. Added to  external finance, that sum will be sufficient to ensure that the target of 500  applicants can be met. I am sorry that I do not have time to deal with all the  issues that were raised during this wide-ranging debate.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Tom Elliott spoke about the farm nutrient management  scheme. I re-emphasise that there is no link between the sale of the  Crossnacreevy site and the availability of funding for the farm nutrient  management scheme. Any shortfall in funds that results from the sale of land at  Crossnacreevy will impact on the Department&rsquo;s budget for 2010-11, but the farm  nutrient management scheme is an issue for 2008-09. The importance that we  place on the farm nutrient management scheme was indicated by the &pound;20 million  allocation that was made in December. Our ability to respond to any request for  additional funding is entirely reliant on the level of resources at our  disposal.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Dominic Bradley talked about the pressures in education.  The pressures that have been identified in the Department of Education, and the  other Departments, all need to be assessed carefully. For example, one bid  related to &pound;18 million in energy costs. However, that must be questioned in the  light of the dramatic fall in the price of crude oil. I welcome Mr Bradley&rsquo;s  view that the Department must look first to its own &pound;2 billion budget and the  6% increase in funding that will be available next year.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Neeson raised the issue of the green economy. It is  important that local firms are encouraged to take advantage of all possible  growth opportunities &mdash; including those relating to sustainability &mdash; but that  must be based on business potential. Local firms know their own businesses  better than civil servants do, and we should not tell them where or how to  invest.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Chairperson of the Committee for the Environment, Mr  McGlone, talked about the Road Safety Council of Northern Ireland. The funding  mechanism of road safety committees has been amended following a recent review,  but that funding is not being cut. Instead, funding will be directed away from  central administration and into front line road-safety activities that will be  carried out by local committees.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Robin Newton raised the issue of the economic downturn&rsquo;s  impact on apprenticeships. I welcome the actions that are being taken by the  Department of Employment and Learning to allow apprentices to complete their  training. However, I share Mr Newton&rsquo;s disappointment about the number of  apprentices, who were training under the apprenticeship programme, who have  been made redundant in 2008.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">This has been an important debate. I thank Members for their  contributions; some of them have been enlightening, and others have not been so  enlightening. I also thank Members for the contribution that they make through  the Committees, correspondence and questions posed in the Assembly and on other  occasions. It is important that we debate such matters and that we deal  robustly with views that clearly fall short of the challenges of the times.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In that respect, some Members&rsquo; suggestions are out of  kilter with financial reality. Most Members appreciate the basic concepts of  budgeting and balancing the books. Other Members do not. I question the level  of financial responsibility of Members who request additional spending without  any clear steer as to the source of that funding.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive and the Assembly carry a heavy responsibility  to manage public expenditure in Northern    Ireland prudently on the behalf of  taxpayers. We must face future challenges with finite resources, and,  therefore, it is essential that the Assembly passes the resolutions. Members  who vote against the resolutions will, in effect, vote to remove Departments&rsquo;  authority and ability to spend money. That is unthinkable in the current  difficult economic times. Indeed, it is, in any circumstances, unthinkable to  prevent hospitals, schools, housing and other areas from receiving the public  money that they require in order to provide front line services for families  and businesses. I question the financial responsibility and political maturity  of any Member who votes against such a proposition. I commend the resolutions  to the House.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Before the Questions are put, I remind Members that the votes on  the motions require cross-community support.</p>
