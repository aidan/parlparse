                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first five motions on the Order Paper
                concern amendments that were recommended by the Standing Orders
                Committee, which no longer exists. They will be moved by the
                Members who were the joint Chairmen of that Committee.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Should the Assembly so wish, all five motions
                will be discussed in a single debate, after which we shall vote
                on each in turn.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All changes to Standing Orders require
                cross-community support. As I have previously ruled, if on
                collection of the voices there is no indication of dissent I
                shall assume that cross-community support has been achieved. If,
                however, there is any dissent we must move to a Division. I
                remind Members — and particularly the party Whips — that,
                since we are now operating under the new Standing Orders which
                were approved by the Assembly in March and determined by the
                Secretary of State prior to devolution, Divisions shall require
                the use of the Division Lobbies and, thus, slightly different
                procedures.</p>

                in order for an Assembly Member or a member of the Assembly
                staff to sign into this Building a member of the public whose
                sole purpose is to disrupt and harangue the First Minister and
                the Deputy First Minister when making statements, as happened
                last Thursday? If it is out of order what action will be taken
                against the person responsible?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the signing in of any visitor,
                it is not possible to judge in advance what anyone’s motives
                are. What is very clear is that if anyone introduces disorder,
                either on the Floor of the House or in the Galleries, that is
                not proper and not acceptable. I appeal to all Members to
                co-operate in this regard. I think I made it clear at the last
                sitting that if there is disorder in the Galleries they will be
                cleared.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, I should point out that the Committee
                on Standing Orders no longer exists. Mr&nbsp;Cobain and I are
                proposing these motions because we were the joint Chairmen of
                that Committee and there are one or two matters to be tidied up.
                We agreed to present these matters to the Assembly to provide
                for the smooth running of business.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We would like to propose the items en bloc.
                However, if you want us to take them in turn we shall be glad to
                do so.</p>

                </font></b><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I cannot deal with the second motion — the
                setting up of a Standing Committee on European Affairs —
                without referring to the third, which is for the setting up of a
                Committee on Equality, Human Rights and Community Relations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Standing Orders Committee expressed
                concern that the legislation did not provide for the type of
                scrutiny of the functions of the Office of the First Minister
                and Deputy First Minister which has been provided in respect of
                the other Government Departments. It was felt that there were
                major issues which need to be thoroughly scrutinised. Two issues
                — European affairs, and equality, human rights and community
                relations — were identified as having sufficient breadth and
                scope to merit having separate Committees.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other functions of the Office of the First
                Minister and Deputy First Minister not covered by these two
                motions will need to be scrutinised, but we did not agree how
                this might be done, and a motion about this will be put before
                the Assembly in the future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee considered the Westminster
                practice of the Government’s providing the Opposition with
                supply days. That is to say the Government provide space in the
                timetable of the House of Commons for the Opposition to raise
                issues of concern to it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the kind of structure that has been
                established for us, there are no formal Government and
                Opposition sides to the House. For that reason the Committee
                felt that individual parties would, from time to time, have
                priorities on their own agendas which were not provided for in
                the Administration’s programme of business. It was therefore
                decided that it would be useful to provide each of the parties
                represented in the Assembly with a period of time, each month
                perhaps, when such matters could be raised. For that reason we
                propose to insert in paragraph (1) at subparagraph (g) the words
                &quot;party business&quot;.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The final business concerns the powers of
                Statutory Committees. We want to ensure beyond all doubt that
                the Statutory Committees are empowered under both the agreement
                and the terms of the Northern Ireland Act, and this change is
                being proposed following legal advice.</p>

                whether these Committees will have the right to raise any matter
                of their own volition and within their remits which has not been
                referred to them by the Assembly or any other body, and

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to address the motion concerning the
                establishment of a Standing Committee on Equality, Human Rights
                and Community Relations. The fact that this Committee is being
                established suggests that the Assembly and the all-Ireland
                institutions, of which it is a part, are built on an authentic
                commitment to human<b> </b>rights. If that is not the case, the
                consideration of this motion today is little more than an
                exercise in pretence and hypocrisy, so it is absolutely crucial
                to establish whether the Assembly can really be considered as
                being built on the solid foundation of respect for equality and
                human rights.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The domain of human rights — those rights
                which we possess by virtue of our being human — is a matter of
                philosophical dispute. However, what is not a matter of dispute,
                short of denying that there are any human rights, is that the
                most fundamental human right is the right to life<b>.</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The right to life is fundamental in the
                crucial sense that all other human rights are derived from it.
                The most immediate human right derived from the right to life is
                the right to be protected from violence and the threat of
                violence, both in public and private life. This is the moral
                basis of democratic practice.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The implementation of the Belfast Agreement
                has politically institutionalised the very opposite of
                democratic practice. The outworking of the agreement has secured
                for Sinn Féin a central role in government backed by the
                terrorist arsenal of the IRA. This means that the threat of
                force has been fully incorporated into the Government of
                Northern Ireland. The outcome of the Mitchell review has, in
                fact, fully legitimised this state of affairs because it
                established that decommissioning, if it ever occurs, has to be a
                voluntary act on the part of the terrorist organisations. That
                is absolutely incompatible with democracy. The core of democracy

                voluntary nature of decommissioning within the Mitchell review
                is absolutely incompatible with democracy. The core of democracy
                lies in the conduct of politics, free from the threat or use of
                violence. Democratic practice is therefore ultimately rooted in
                respect for the most fundamental of human rights. Democratic
                government must be based entirely on electoral support. This
                means that no political party in a democracy can claim a right

                considering a motion for the establishment of a Standing
                Committee on human rights, when we cannot actually explore the
                fundamentals of the issue and consider the question of to what
                extent this Assembly can authentically commit itself to the
                protection of human rights. That is the issue I was exploring.
                The implementation of the agreement has institutionalised the
                combination of the Armalite and the ballot box into the
                Government of Northern Ireland. It is entirely incompatible with

                In the recently published book ‘Lost Lives’, entry 487
                describes the death of Robert Gibson on &quot;bloody
                Friday&quot;. It is a horrendous account of what happened that
                day. &quot;Bloody Friday&quot; was the work of the IRA, but who
                within the IRA was responsible? Patrick Bishop and Eamonn&nbsp;Mallie,
                in their book ‘The Provisional IRA’, state that the bombings
                were planned by Seamus Twomey. They add that he was assisted by
                a leading Provisional who is now a senior member of

                Committee to scrutinise an aspect of the work of the Office of

                in the light of other events, particularly the elevation of some
                to ministerial posts last year, I will withdraw my reservations.

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the Standing&nbsp;Orders debate I,
                among others, raised the point that the Office of the First
                Minister and the Deputy&nbsp;First&nbsp;Minister was not to have
                an appropriate level of scrutiny. Each of the other 10
                Departments is scrutinised by a Statutory Committee. How those
                Committees will work out in practice is another matter, but
                there will at least be some scrutiny. However, no Committee was
                established to scrutinise the work of the First and Deputy First
                Ministers. I consider that to be a missed opportunity, and it
                has left a hole in the scrutiny procedure that we apply to the
                Government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Subsequent to the debate a Committee for
                Equality, Human Rights and Community Relations was proposed,
                which would cover a large part of the brief of the First and
                Deputy First Ministers. Although my preference is for a
                Committee to look specifically at the full remit of the First
                and Deputy&nbsp;First&nbsp;Ministers’ responsibilities, we
                should take this opportunity to introduce some level of scrutiny
                to an area that may be under the control of a junior Minister.
                This would ensure that the First and the
                Deputy&nbsp;First&nbsp;Ministers’ activities were kept under
                the spotlight in the same way as those of the other Departments.
                Notwithstanding the reservations held by some Members with
                regard to the human rights issue — and I understand those at a
                philosophical level — there are practical reasons for our
                agreeing to the establishment of the Committee. On this occasion
                the practical reasons should result in the whole House’s
                supporting the creation of such a Committee.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Women’s Coalition welcomes the setting
                up of these important Committees. Members are aware that the way
                forward for Northern Ireland is to create a role for itself in
                Europe and the European&nbsp;Union. It is vital that a Committee
                be set up to ensure that links to the European Union are
                established or, where they already exist, strengthened.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The very fabric of the Assembly — the basis
                of all its work — is equality, human rights and community
                relations, so it is vital that a Committee be set up to this
                end. We would also like to see the creation of an additional
                Committee to scrutinise the Centre.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, the Women’s Coalition would like
                to ensure — and we seek clarification here from Mr&nbsp;Haughey
                — that the Committee on Equality, Human Rights and Community
                Relations will also be able to raise issues concerning European
                affairs and equality.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Haughey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Maskey referred to the powers of the
                European Affairs Committee and the Committee on Equality, Human
                Rights and Community&nbsp;Relations. Their powers will be
                extensive, though not as extensive as the powers of the
                departmental Committees. The main distinction relates to
                legislative initiatives. I refer Mr&nbsp;Maskey to paragraph
                2(b), which enables the Committee on European&nbsp;Affairs and
                the Committee on Equality, Human Rights and Community Relations
                to raise any other related matter or matters determined by the
                Assembly. I also refer him to paragraph (3), which states</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The committee shall have powers to call
                for persons and papers.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is the standard constitutional formula
                which enables the Committee to call any person within the
                jurisdiction of this House, to call for papers produced at any
                level within the Administration in order to examine those papers
                and to interrogate the persons responsible for the conduct of
                the Administration. Those are very extensive powers and will
                enable the Committee to conduct its business with a good deal of
                influence and power.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In relation to the issues raised by
                Mr&nbsp;Roche, there is nothing that requires any response by me
                regarding Standing Orders.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;Molloy raised the interesting
                question of whether an adequate translation of &quot;Member of
                the Legislative Assembly&quot; would be the term &quot;Teachta
                Dála&quot;, which, as Members will know, is the designation
                used by Members of Dáil Éireann, giving rise to the letters
                &quot;TD&quot; after Members’ names. I do not know if that was
                Mr&nbsp;Molloy’s intention, but I am not an adequate enough
                Gaelic scholar to determine whether &quot;Member of the
                Legislative Assembly&quot; and &quot;Teachta Dála&quot; mean
                exactly the same. To me they do not seem to mean the same thing,
                but I would not be opposed to the use of the term &quot;Teachta
                Dála&quot; as a translation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;Weir raised the issue of the
                designation &quot;MPA&quot;, which was used in the 1982-86
                Assembly. That was considered by the Committee on Standing
                Orders, and it was decided that &quot;MLA&quot; was a better
                designation in the current circumstances. Mr&nbsp;Weir also
                urged Members to support the creation of the Equality Committee,
                as did Ms&nbsp;Morrice, and I welcome their support.</p>

                My only experience of this was in the Chamber in 1975, when a
                Member from the DUP, it being late in the evening and he having
                dined well, made a mistake about which Lobby to vote in and had
                to go through both Lobbies. The Chairman of the Constitutional
                Convention then asked him to indicate how he had intended to
                vote so that it could be recorded.</p>

                Members can vote twice, but their second vote will cancel their

                your name will be called. The Clerks may wish you to hesitate
                for a second, for when your name is called, your photograph will

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We now proceed to the First Stage of the
                first Bills to be brought to the House. As these are the first
                Bills to be presented, it may be helpful to Members if I briefly
                explain the process. The First Stage of a Bill is entirely
                formal and simply allows for the introduction of the measure.
                There is no debate, but Members will have an opportunity to
                debate and amend later.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><a href="#top">TOP</a></p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the First Stage I invite a Member
                proposing a Bill formally to move that the Bill be laid. The
                Clerk will read the long title of the Bill. Once established,
                that cannot be changed or amended. For that reason it is
                important that this be completed at First Stage. The Clerk will
                read the title of the Bill, as required under Standing Order
                28(5), and that shall constitute First Stage. The Bill can then
                be ordered to be printed. The measure will be available to
                Members the following day or shortly afterwards.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the first three Bills deal with the
                Commission, we are altering the procedure slightly in that those
                proposing the measures will come to the lectern. We have
                established that Members speaking for the Commission are acting
                for the House and, therefore, take a slightly different
                position. Otherwise Ministers and private Members speak from
                their places.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are no votes, and there is no debate
                — a First Stage is purely formal. There will be an opportunity
                to vote on a Bill in principle at the Second Stage. The
                Committee and Consideration Stages will provide opportunities
                for discussion, and any amendments will be made at the
                Consideration Stage. At the Final Stage there will be a vote on
                the measure as a whole.</p>

                to present to the Assembly the Determination on Members’
                salaries. I would like to preface my remarks by saying that for
                the last 18 months the Shadow Assembly Commission has met
                regularly — 35 times, I think. Mr&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;Robinson
                presented a report on behalf of the Shadow Commission on 22
                February. We have enjoyed widespread support and help from
                Members of the Assembly. It has been hard work, and I would like
                to put on record that I have enjoyed working with all of the
                Shadow Commission’s members.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I had the unique experience of working with
                people like Francie&nbsp;Molloy and Peter&nbsp;Robinson, with
                whom I would not normally have worked. I was impressed by their
                contributions; the House owes them a very deep debt of
                gratitude. I am also looking forward to working with the new
                members of the Commission, Dr&nbsp;Dara O’Hagan and
                Mr&nbsp;Gregory&nbsp;Campbell. We have a job to do, and I hope
                that the new Assembly Commission can retain the confidence of
                the House.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members will recall that, in February, the
                Shadow Commission recommended to the Assembly that we follow the
                recommendations of the Senior Salaries Review Body (SSRB) in
                respect of remuneration for Members and office holders. Today’s
                Determination largely reflects that undertaking as well as the
                provisions in Section 47 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998, which
                states</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;</font><font SIZE="1">(3) A

                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The salaries for the First Minister,
                departmental Ministers and the Presiding Officer are as
                recommended by the SSRB. Members will recall that the Prime
                Minister, on the Floor of the House of Commons, recommended that
                the salary of the Deputy First Minister be established as equal
                to that of the First Minister. The Shadow Assembly Commission
                accepted that recommendation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Shadow Commission has agreed all other
                salaries for office holders. The Senior Salaries Review Body
                recognised that there would be a need for extra remuneration for
                certain office holders post-devolution, and the Shadow
                Commission recommended that those increased salaries should be
                paid. The posts to which we refer are junior Ministers, members
                of the Assembly Commission, and Chairmen and Deputy Chairmen of
                the Statutory Committees. The Review Body’s recommendation in
                respect of a daily rate for the Deputy Presiding Officer has
                been translated into an annual amount. At this stage, the
                Commission makes no recommendation about remuneration for
                Chairmen and Vice-Chairmen of non-statutory Committees.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another recommendation of the Senior Salaries
                Review Body was that salaries should be raised each year in line
                with the average increases at 1-1 mid-points of the nine Civil
                Service pay bands below permanent secretary. This has been done
                so that the salaries that are now presented differ from those in
                the Senior Salaries Review Body Report solely by the increase.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The SSRB also recommended that all salaries
                should be reviewed independently in the year 2001 and every
                three years thereafter. The Commission recommends that the
                Assembly adopt that recommendation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those who hold double or even triple
                mandates, as Members of the Assembly, of the House of Commons
                or/and of the European Parliament, will have their salaries as
                Members of the Assembly abated by two thirds. The Schedule will
                have to be amended should any additional office holders of the
                House who are entitled to be appointed. The Standing Orders may
                also need to be amended.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I regret that, although we are now
                implementing the recommendations of the Senior Salaries Review
                Body, the new salaries will be backdated only to the date of
                devolution.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A Chaothaoirligh. Ar dtús, mo bhuíochas
                leis an Choimisiún seo agus leis an Uasal O’Fee agus leis na
                daoine eile a rinne obair chruaidh thábhachtach air. Ach tá
                achainí agam ar an Uasal O’Fee agus ar an Uasal Coulter, nó
                ba mhaith linn an cheist seo a chur ar athlá. Molaim go
                gcuirimid ceist seo na dtuarastal agus cúrsaí eile airgid siar
                agus go bhfillimid orthu ag an chéad suí eile den Tionól.
                Idir an dá linn, beidh an Coimisiún ábalta comhairle a
                thabhairt dúinn.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, I pay tribute to Mr Fee and the other
                Commission members for their work. Sinn Féin asked John Fee and
                Robert Coulter whether this issue might be deferred to the next
                meeting of the Assembly so that the new Commission could
                consider the whole question of salaries and other financial
                matters. We asked for that because, while I believe that
                politicians should be paid properly for the sacrifices that they
                and their families make, I have a huge problem with this
                increase of £7,000, which is almost three times the amount paid
                in a year to a person on social welfare.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At a time when students cannot get decent
                grants and when old people are not being awarded proper benefits
                we need to think about the matter again. The issue is bigger
                than any party, and it even has to do with the credibility of
                the Assembly. For those reasons I have asked that action be
                deferred and put to the new Commission.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, and on a lighter note, I
                congratulate the Antrim senior football team on winning a
                historic all-Ireland ‘B’ final yesterday. I ask other
                Members and perhaps the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure to
                extend congratulations to the team’s management and to all who
                are involved in Cumann Lúthchleas Gael in County Antrim.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a member of the Commission, I wish to
                support my colleague Mr John Fee. I also wish to pay tribute to
                the former Commission members with whom I have worked. The
                Commission is a hard-working body, and I found it satisfying to
                operate alongside people with whom I had not worked in the past.
                I look forward to co-operating with the other people on the new
                Team. Commission members aim to achieve consensus for the
                benefit of all Assembly Members.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The SSRB recommendations were accepted by the
                Assembly earlier in the year, and I wish to make it clear that
                we have not given ourselves a fat-cat pay rise. I am led to
                believe by others, including trade union representatives, that a
                Member’s basic salary is equivalent to that of the principal
                officer grade in the Civil Service, so it would be unfair to
                accuse us of trying to feather our nests. It is also worth
                noting that a Member’s average working day could be up to 20
                hours and — <i>[Interruption]</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have not seen Mr McCartney here very often,
                so I do not know how long his working day is.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many Members have been present every day
                working and lobbying. &quot;Democracy must be paid for&quot; —
                those are not my words but the words of a number of trade union
                representatives. If we are to do an adequate job, we must be
                paid an adequate wage.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Performance-related pay — pay by results
                — is not favoured by any member of the trade union movement.
                The unions realise, however, that it would be difficult, if not
                impossible, to gauge standards of performance. The public will
                be able to judge Members during their time in office, and any
                Member with whom people are unhappy may be thrown out.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This determination should be approved to
                enable us to become effective Members of the Assembly and get on

                Northern Ireland equitably and responsibly.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is sad that one of the Assembly’s first
                acts — if not the first — is to vote its Members a very
                hefty increase in salary. For the past 18 months the Assembly
                has sat — to say the least — very intermittently.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not often agree with Sinn Féin, but
                there are fundamental principles with which one is bound to
                agree, whatever one’s political predilections. The suggestion
                that the Assembly should vote through a rise of the comparative
                nature that Mr Adams pointed out is nothing short of a disgrace.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Under these arrangements Mrs Bell will
                receive around £50,000. As far as families go — and I am
                speaking generally here — a number of Members are employing
                relations and paying them out of the £34,000 that they are
                about to get as a constituency allowance — a very, very
                healthy sum for those families indeed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have heard that some Members employ their
                wives at salaries of between £15,000 and £18,000 a year. I
                have also heard of Members who have not opened any constituency
                office to serve their constituents. My constituency office is
                open from 9.00 am to 5.00 pm five days a week and handles more
                than 3,500 constituency matters a year. In some places in North
                Down, such as the Kilcooley housing estate, there are people who
                need the services of someone who can help them. North Down is
                not all &quot;gold coast&quot;.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When people look at this Assembly, which was
                supposed to bring them more efficient, more accountable, more
                sensitive and more human government, what do they find? They
                find Members voting themselves big, big salaries — increases
                of 25%. <i>[Interruption] </i>I hear murmurs from some Members.
                However, I believe that 30 of the 108 people elected were
                unemployed on the date of their election. Many of them have
                never contributed a single penny to this state by way of income
                tax, but they have taken plenty from it in benefits.</p>

                salaries, and that number rises to 54 if I include the Whips.
                First, we have to explain to the public how we voted ourselves
                an increase of £9,000 a year on the basic salary. Secondly, we
                have to explain how we voted all of these additional moneys to
                more than 50% of the Members. According to my calculations,
                salary costs will be in the region of £9&nbsp;million a year,
                and that is before we have even started to do anything. People
                are going to question why there was such an enthusiastic clamour
                from so many Members for the establishment of the Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People will question the bona fides of those
                who were enthusiasts for the establishment of this body, and
                these salary increases will give them very good grounds for
                doing so. Mr&nbsp;Adams, shrewd politician that he is, has
                clearly pointed the finger at what his party thinks will be the
                public’s reaction to this sort of money being voted to
                Assembly Members. There is much wisdom in the suggestion that,
                before everyone puts their snout well and truly into the trough
                at this time, they should carefully consider whether it will be
                to their ultimate benefit. The Assembly was established on
                questionable principles, by the use of Executive power, to
                undercut the principles of democratic procedure.</p>

                order are technical matters in respect of the debate. If, for

                present an inaccurate or disagreeable view of what that Member
                has said, that is not a point of order which can be taken up. It
                is a point of disagreement, and the Member who has the Floor
                would have to be asked to give way. He or she would then decide
                whether to accept an intervention.</p>

                cautious about doing so, but I want to be as open as possible
                — that the 10-minute rule applied only under the Initial
                Standing Orders. Therefore Members have less need to worry about

                fairness — and I do so with some caution. Under the new
                Standing Orders the 10-minute rule which was in the Initial
                Standing Orders no longer applies. However, I hope that Members
                will forget that and proceed under the previous arrangements.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At no stage in my address did I suggest that
                Members had assessed the salaries attributable to their office,
                either as ordinary Members or as people exercising ministerial
                power. However, it is for the Assembly to vote to accept them.
                That is the point I am dealing with. The intervention is
                irrelevant, since the Assembly will decide what salaries it will
                give itself, whether on the recommendation of some other body or
                of its own volition. To spend £9 million on salaries out of a
                total budget, which, I understand, is getting on for
                £40&nbsp;million per annum seems to me to be gross
                extravagance. During the week I listened to a contributor to a
                radio phone-in programme suggesting that Assembly Members should
                receive the same salary and constituency allowance as a Member
                of Parliament.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.00</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the face of it, if they were politicians
                doing their job one could say that maybe that was reasonable.
                However, one then has to point out that a Member of Parliament
                is responsible for an entire constituency — one of 18 in
                Northern Ireland. There are six Members of the Assembly for each
                of those constituencies, so in relative terms one would be
                paying six times the amount in salaries and six times the amount
                in constituency allowances that a Member of Parliament receives
                for doing the same job for the entire constituency. That would
                be gross overpayment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I return to the issue of what Members are
                doing with their constituency allowances. To my knowledge there
                are many Members of the Assembly who have not yet opened a
                constituency office. And some of those that have done so run
                their places intermittently. I know of one office that is open
                two mornings a week and deals not only with Assembly
                constituency business but also with parliamentary constituency
                business. That Member will be in receipt of £45,000 per annum
                for his parliamentary place and £34,000 for his Assembly place
                — almost £80,000 a year for an office that is open two
                mornings a week.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is not a point of order, and I am
                surprised that you are taking points of information, Mr Speaker.
                However, I will answer.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I did complain. I certainly did, and I think
                it is totally wrong. When I talk about Members of this Assembly
                not providing the proper facilities and services for their
                constituents I do not care if they are members of the NIUP, Sinn
                Féin, the SDLP, the Ulster Unionists or, for that matter, the
                DUP. If they are not serving their constituents to the best of
                their ability then they are not discharging the duties they
                imposed upon themselves when they stood for election.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not know how many Members have opened
                constituency offices; I do not know how many Members are
                employing wives, sons, daughters or other relations to whom they
                are syphoning off part of the money they are, being paid for
                running their constituencies. Of course, one cannot make a
                blanket criticism. I know of one or two relatives employed in
                such a position, and if their fathers or mothers were not
                employing them I would be happy to do so because they are
                discharging their duties with great care. I am not saying that
                relatives are necessarily failing to perform the functions of
                the job; what I am saying is that this practice raises a
                question. Just as in the law, justice must not only be done but
                also be seen to be done. Anyone who employs relatives and pays
                them Government money, invites the obvious question. It must
                make people suspicious.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The whole of Northern Ireland is looking to
                the Assembly. Are we setting the best example by voting for an
                increase of £9,000 — over 25% more — on what we received
                over the last 18 months when, relatively speaking, very little
                was being done here? Does that present an image of disinterested
                service? The situation is compounded because, in addition to
                their basic salaries, more than half the Members will receive
                substantial further sums. Does that present an image of service
                or dedication? Or does it raise the suspicion that in the
                ululations from some parties about this great Assembly there is
                a large dollop of greed and self-interest?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Adams’s remarks addressed this issue.
                Why do I say that? Because he compared the increase in the basic
                salary of an Assembly Member with what is available to those on
                the margins of society: the flotsam and jetsam of the ghettoes;
                the people who are unemployed or otherwise disadvantaged. There
                are questions that everyone here should be asking: are we doing
                right, and are we seen to be doing right? If the House
                rubber-stamps these proposals without further consideration, the
                people of Northern Ireland will judge it accordingly. I include
                all parties in this — not just Nationalists or Unionists or
                those of indeterminate orientation. Every Member must consider
                this issue and vote according to his conscience — not
                according to his pocket.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr C Murphy:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A Chathaoirligh, in suggesting that this
                matter be referred back, we do not denigrate the members of the
                Commission and their hard work. The Assembly was entirely right
                to hand the determination of its salaries and allowances to the
                Senior Salaries Review Body (SSRB). However, the proposal for a
                substantial increase needs to be debated in the Chamber. If the
                SSRB had recommended a £10,000 cut in Members’ wages, there
                would definitely have been some debate. The Assembly should not
                run away from this. I notice that the DUP has absented itself,
                by and large, today, but that is its stock-in-trade on issues
                such as these.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The proposal for such a substantial increase
                when so many people live under huge disadvantage must be looked
                at very seriously, especially as this is the first sitting of
                the Assembly since the transfer of powers. If the Assembly’s
                first act on receiving those powers is to vote itself a
                substantial pay rise, that will send out entirely the wrong
                message. Many people are living on less than the proposed
                increase, so it is only right that the Commission deliberate
                this matter further.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A number of points relate to my party and to
                pay increases. Sinn Féin Members did not take the salaries
                allowed during the shadow period. They took an allowance from
                the party, and no increases are planned for party members, even
                if salary increases are agreed. There is no difference between
                the treatment of Ministers and that of Back-Benchers, and when
                setting up constituency offices, which provide an excellent
                service, the party decided that no family members would be
                considered for posts in them.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I started by saying that this was a poisoned
                chalice, but I did not think that I would have to drink so much
                from it. Members need to be clear on a number of issues. The
                Northern Ireland (Elections) Act 1998 has been superseded, and I
                understand that the Assembly has no authority, without further
                action, to pay the salaries of Members.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members need to resolve this matter, or they
                will not be paid. The level of remuneration has not been set by
                the Assembly. Members, quite rightly, unanimously decided on
                22&nbsp;February&nbsp;1999 that the level of remuneration would
                be set by the SSRB. Indeed, it was Mr&nbsp;McCartney who said
                that it would be prudent to let an independent body decide on
                future increases.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was explicitly on the basis of that advice
                that the Assembly Commission, in exercising its duty under
                section&nbsp;47 of the Northern&nbsp;Ireland&nbsp;Act&nbsp;1998,
                recommended to Members in February that the opinion of the SSRB
                be accepted, and every Member who attended that meeting agreed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is therefore with some personal annoyance
                that I find, at the last minute, that Members are not just
                asking the Commission to disregard its legal obligation to make
                provision for Members, the Secretariat, and everyone else —</p>

                Assembly not decide to continue to pay the salaries at the
                existing rate and agree to debate this matter again when the
                appropriate salary will be determined?</p>

                taken back. It is not possible for the House to make an

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ervine:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like Mr Fee to clarify a couple of
                points. Mr&nbsp;Adams — identified by Mr&nbsp;McCartney as a
                shrewd politician — asked for a deferment because it would not
                look good, given the social difficulties, to have this as the
                first item of business. How long a deferment does Mr&nbsp;Adams
                believe to be necessary? How long will it be until the social
                circumstances of the people outside are such that Assembly
                Members consider it wise to vote for an increase in their
                salaries?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCartney, without realising it, has
                insulted more Members today than he normally does. And when I
                say &quot;insulted&quot; I mean insulted. There are nuances that
                you may have to look at from the point of view of the greater
                protection of Members here.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, Mr&nbsp;McCartney said that the
                Assembly was created under dubious Executive authority. If I am
                not mistaken, the Assembly was created by the will of the people
                of Northern Ireland. Of course, Mr&nbsp;McCartney is entitled to
                his opinion, but when he talks about unemployed people and about
                the flotsam and jetsam, I wonder what he really means. In the
                past, Mr&nbsp;McCartney’s forte was to ensure that, for
                example, a person who had lost a leg got the minimum
                compensation from those whose moral responsibility it was to pay
                out. That is what Mr&nbsp;McCartney did, for he is an exalted
                barrister.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I cannot give way, for I am being given way
                to. Mr&nbsp;McCartney is an exalted, learned man who does not
                know that an amendment must be put down one hour before the
                sitting.</p>
                <b>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with Mr&nbsp;Ervine that today
                Mr&nbsp;McCartney has insulted more people than usual. That he
                used my remarks to do so, I take as a compliment of sorts.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Official Report will show what I said. It
                is not a matter of its not being nice to have this as the first
                item of business. It is a matter of its being socially wrong for
                us to draw such huge salaries — even though we may deserve
                them for the work that we do — when others down the line are
                being treated so badly by the system. How long will it take to
                rectify this? It probably will not be rectified until we are

                Members want us to personalise this debate we will do so, but
                they should remember that when they slander or insult another
                Member, they will be treated likewise.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Maskey has made a very clear, rational and
                important point. The rules of procedure are set in place to keep
                a degree of proper decorum. When Members transgress those rules
                by making direct and personal remarks, some of which, though not
                ones I have heard this morning, are unparliamentary and
                therefore out of order, other Members inevitably respond in like
                fashion, and that does not improve the proceedings at all. Mr
                Maskey’s point is valid and ought to be borne in mind.</p>

                what extent did the SSRB decide the differential between the
                salary for being a Member of the Assembly and what is received

                Finance and Personnel and the Secretariat, and after
                consideration of the payments made to officers of other

                representative of the smaller parties and the Initial Presiding
                Officer, and which existed up to this morning, agreed this
                unanimously and reported it in February, when the Assembly also

                I want to draw to a close. I have great sympathy with many of
                the Members who have spoken, but it appears, somehow, to have
                fallen to me personally to make a judgement on how to proceed.
                The Assembly must decide either to accept or to reject the
                Determination.</p>

                duties of the Assembly Commission. There has been no controversy
                about the provision we are making to pay the staff — from the
                Doorkeepers to the Committee Clerks. However, the Commission has
                a responsibility to the Members to set the salaries recommended
                by the SSRB, having taken professional advice. We can do no

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Before presenting the Determination on
                Members’ allowances, I would like to endorse the points made
                by Mr Fee. In his opening remarks he welcomed the new Commission
                members and expressed his appreciation of the work done by those
                who have left the Commission. The Commission is the Assembly’s
                body corporate, and it is charged by the Northern Ireland Act
                with responsibility for ensuring that the Assembly is provided
                with the property, staff and services it requires. Over the past
                14 months the shadow Commission met on 35&nbsp;occasions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Mr Fee has reminded us, the two
                Determinations and the three Bills which have just been ordered
                to be printed are not about advancing the interests of Members.
                They are about the Commission’s fulfilling its corporate
                responsibility. Staff are entitled to secure a wage and to
                contribute to a pension scheme, and elected Members and their
                staff are no different. The Commission has no legal basis on
                which to pay Members or establish a pension scheme. That is why
                these Determinations need to be made and the Bills introduced at
                this early stage.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now let me move to the business in hand —
                the determination of Members’ allowances. In his address,
                Mr&nbsp;Fee emphasised the centrality of the SSRB’s report to
                the salaries Determination. For the most part the SSRB’s
                recommendations were followed in the allowances Determination,
                though current practice at Westminster and in Scotland and Wales
                also provided useful reference points. Close examination of the
                report shows that the figures in the Determination are slightly
                higher to reflect the recommended rise to allow for the increase
                in the retail price index over the previous year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At first glance Members may think that the
                allowances Determination is rather too short to deal with a
                range of complex issues. It contains the basic provisions for
                the scheme, though no detail on its operation and
                administration. Staff in the finance office are currently
                drawing up guidance for Members on what is and what is not
                allowable and on how staff should handle claims. Members will
                have an early opportunity to comment as the guidance will have
                to be formally adopted by the Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I propose to take the various allowances in
                the sequence in which they appear in the schedule to the
                determination. All travel allowances are in accordance with the
                SSRB’s recommendations. Subsistence allowances are in line
                with those in Scotland and Wales, while the rates for meals
                mirror current Civil Service allowances, which are not liable to
                income tax. The total office cost allowances as recommended by
                the SSRB, though the determination does not apportion those
                allowances between salaries and other expenses. Arrangements
                have been put in place to enable the allowances to be
                front-ended. Members will be able to draw down what they
                require, provided that commitments to staff salaries, rent and
                rates for the year are met.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This should allow for better financial
                planning and ease some of the cash-flow problems that a number
                of Members&nbsp;have had under the current arrangements. During
                the shadow period, when office cost allowances were&nbsp;paid
                monthly, the Commission made representations to the Minister
                asking for them to be paid on a six-month block basis.
                Unfortunately, because of the political uncertainty, the
                Minister was unable to accede to our request.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The SSRB recommended that</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;the Scottish Parliament, the National
                Assembly for Wales and the Northern&nbsp;Ireland Assembly each
                determine the financial or other assistance to be available to
                Members with disabilities.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Determination reflects the same level of
                assistance as exists in Scotland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recall expenses are in line with those for
                Westminster, Scotland and Wales, and travel arrangements for
                Members’ employees are as recommended by the SSRB, with the
                allowances payable mirroring Civil Service rates, which do not
                attract a tax liability.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The allowances for staff pensions and
                redundancies follow the SSRB’s recommendations, but it should
                be noted that there is no provision for the Assembly to run a
                dedicated pension scheme for Members’ staff. Temporary
                secretarial allowances are in line with those at Westminster and
                in Wales, and Members holding a dual mandate will be pleased to
                note that the SSRB recommended that all allowances be payable to
                Members who are also MPs and/or MEPs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This has been a detailed presentation, but it
                is important to assure Members that the Commission has tried to
                account for every eventuality using the SSRB report as its base.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I commend the Determination to the Assembly.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ford:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to refer to paragraph&nbsp;4 — the
                disability allowance section. So far as I know, none of us are
                eligible for the additional allowance for disability. The last
                person in this place who was eligible was Eileen&nbsp;Bell’s
                predecessor, Bertie&nbsp;McConnell, who was an Assembly Member
                for North&nbsp;Down in the 1970s. Mr&nbsp;McConnell was totally
                blind. Notwithstanding what Mr Coulter said about the Scottish
                allowance, £10,000 is a modest sum for the professional
                services that would be required by a fully disabled Member,
                whether the handicap were physical, visual or auditory. Can the
                Commission re-examine whether that sum is an appropriate maximum
                before we come to a time when it might cause personal
                embarrassment?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The National Assembly for Wales has paid for
                some additional equipment for a Member’s employee who suffers
                from a handicap. Can the Commission assure us that it will look
                at such a situation in a similarly favourable way should it
                arise here?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ervine:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I had problems with the previous
                Determination, but I have little difficulty with this one, and I
                commend the work of the Commission. This Determination will
                ensure that parties such as the PUP can have full-time, fully
                operational offices staffed by people who are not members of our
                family. It is our party policy that such should be the case.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have some concerns. I should like to look
                at the services that are funnelled through Members to
                constituency officers and, via their workers, to the broader
                populace. Whether we are dealing with Members’ remuneration or
                Members’ allowances, the Assembly is about the delivery of
                service.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There will be many cheap shots, and the
                newspapers will be full of comments about the large amount of
                money that is going to be paid to Assembly Members. However, we
                should not get upset. In jail every Christmas dinner menu was
                printed on Christmas Eve, as if to say that bad people like me
                should not have much time to anticipate a reasonable meal.
                Members must face the fact that their salaries and allowances
                will be brought to public notice. However, they will get over
                it, especially when they are spending the money.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Colleague Billy&nbsp;Hutchinson and I have
                stated that we have full-time offices with full-time staff,
                which is beneficial and delivers a consistent service. Although
                we have three offices, we achieved only two portions of Members’
                allowances for office costs. That contrasts with
                Mr&nbsp;McCartney, who, by his own admission, has one office and
                complains about the costs that are drawn down by Westminster MPs
                and Members of the Assembly. Will he and the fat cats with
                Gallic holiday homes, who castigate us for wanting reasonable
                remuneration, lay their account books before us?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am very conscious of the unemployed because
                I have been unemployed at times through illness. Many of those
                who have disparaged the unemployed in the past are cute on the
                subject of finance, especially when their bank balances are
                bulging.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I can now earn £38,000 a year, and I have to
                pinch myself to remind myself not to spend it all. Unlike many
                others, we are very much like Sinn Féin Members. It is not a
                case of &quot;ourselves alone&quot; because we have to help to
                keep others. We get an industrial wage and do not get the full
                benefit of the £38,000. Would that we did, for then I could
                speak to Mr&nbsp;McCartney in France and the many other places
                where he may be found. The media will go on the attack, and some
                of the cute attitudes and the empty Benches show that there is a
                certain doubt and a feeling of guilt.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am a member of Belfast City Council, for
                which I am remunerated. I do not wish to make public the
                earnings of the directors and the chief executive, but I can say
                that the chief executive receives close to what we pay our two
                Prime Ministers. That is the amount paid to someone who makes no
                decisions but simply implements those that are made by others.
                Members of Belfast City Council had to determine his pay, and we
                had to ensure that he was properly remunerated.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Would we suggest that the chief executive of
                Belfast City Council should earn more than the Prime Minister?
                If we hope to attract into politics those who have avoided all
                the issues in the bear pit of political debate, pious attitudes
                about money will not work. We have to make it worth their while.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have been unemployed, mostly through
                sickness, but I am convinced that my abilities could earn me far
                more than £38,000 a year. Had I not gone to jail but joined the
                Bar, perhaps we would have more than one exalted, wonderful
                black crow about the place.</p>
