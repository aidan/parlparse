                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have always been opposed to fundholding
                because of the inequalities associated with it in respect of
                patient care. As I have already said to the Health Committee, I
                have been in general practice for many years. I retired not very
                long ago, but nevertheless I still have a slight link with a
                practice in west Belfast that in turn is linked with a multifund
                — a large conglomerate of over 200 doctors. The link is very
                slight; I am paid for what I do, but I do not receive any
                pecuniary gain as a result of the fundholding aspect of that
                practice.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nominally, this debate is about GP
                fundholding, but it is really about the future of primary care
                services in Northern Ireland. The Prime Minister,
                Tony&nbsp;Blair, told us not all that long ago that the National
                Health Service should be primary-care-led. That is what all
                senior health personnel were saying. What we wanted in these
                islands was a primary-care-led Health Service starting at the
                coalface from the bottom up, not from the top down. The former
                direct rule Health Minister, John&nbsp;McFall, produced the
                document ‘Fit for the Future — A New Approach’. It was
                addressed not only to the people of Northern Ireland but to the
                Northern Ireland Assembly. It emphasised a primary care service
                but left it to the Executive and Members of the Assembly to
                progress.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Committee was familiar with that document.
                It certainly had a vision for the future of primary care. It
                expressed a vision of health and personal social services as a
                single integrated service centred around primary care, directed
                by and accountable to the Assembly, where the needs of the
                people came first and the needs of organisations came second —
                and I want to emphasise that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must build on the present strengths of the
                Health Service. There are many things wrong with it, but there
                are some strengths, and we should build on them. The structures
                should be simplified, and the number of separate organisations
                should be reduced. Dr Maurice&nbsp;Hayes’s acute hospitals
                review is due to report in the spring, and I hope that it
                suggests a rethink of management principles and how the health
                and personal social services can be restructured to make a deal
                with patients in a meaningful way. Dr&nbsp;Brian&nbsp;Patterson,
                who is on the GP committee of the British Medical Association,
                states that</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;the establishment and maintenance of
                ego-building empires must give way to patient-centred service.
                Primary care relies on a vibrant and effective hospital sector
                to facilitate the delivery of safe and quality care for
                patients. This is another reason why any hiatus in the delivery
                of primary care would be counter-productive. The future of
                primary care services is much more complex than simply
                abolishing GP fundholding and pilot commissioning schemes. To
                abolish fundholding and pilot schemes before new arrangements
                are in place is wrong and counter-productive.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr John&nbsp;Simpson, former chairperson of
                the Eastern Health and Social Services Board, was reported in
                the ‘Belfast Telegraph’ of 23 January as saying that to
                transfer responsibilities for delegated decision making back to
                health boards would be equivalent to putting the clock back.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have always been opposed to fundholding
                because of the inequities it caused. Patients of fundholding
                doctors did better than those of non-fundholding doctors in
                accessing secondary care. If fundholding were to cease on
                31&nbsp;March without specific and appropriate primary care
                arrangements being in place, there would be a massive hiatus.
                Furthermore, the considerable expertise gained by commissioning
                pilot schemes would be lost.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There have been many such schemes in Northern
                Ireland, and they have all been successful. The Minister would
                accept that point. Let me give one example. The Lisburn primary
                care commissioning group was able to develop an integrated care
                pathway across primary and secondary care for terminally ill
                patients. It was also able to develop a model of community
                consultation that brings health and social care professionals
                and statutory and voluntary agencies together with service users
                to identify local needs and the action required to address them.
                It also improved the quality and standard of care that patients
                received through an agreed programme of clinical governance at
                practice level, where information and good practice is shared
                between GPs in respect of, for example, patients with diabetes.
                I emphasise this, because this involves many people — doctors,
                nurses and various people at community level. Primary and
                secondary care professionals have developed jointly prescribing
                guidelines for ulcer-healing drugs, antibiotics and analgesics
                and hormone replacement therapy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Armagh primary care commissioning pilot
                scheme developed a significant range of patient-centred services
                through a partnership of professionals, users, the local
                community and other statutory and voluntary sector
                organisations. It delivered the first community-based cardiac
                rehabilitation programme in Northern Ireland. It is important
                for Members to appreciate that point. Since that programme was
                launched in April 2000, more than 70 people have benefited from
                that vital service, compared with only six in the previous year.
                Its nurse-led Heart Wise clinics are in all local GP practices
                and provide a high quality of evidence-based secondary
                prevention service for cardiac patients. The pilot scheme has
                also provided a primary-care-based counselling service for
                people who are depressed or have suffered a bereavement and a
                fall prevention programme for the elderly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I could also go on about pilot schemes
                commissioned in mid-Ulster, Ballyclare, north Down, Antrim,
                Ballymena and north, south, east and west Belfast, all of which
                have been substantial achievements. I saw those schemes as the
                nuclei of a future primary-care-led health service. It is
                important, therefore, to build on the benefits. What are they? A
                higher quality of patient care; greater access with improved
                local service; a better response from hospitals; a reduction in
                waiting times and lists; greater choice for patients; highly
                motivated primary care staff; patient involvement; computerised,
                easily accessible clinical information systems; and the
                development of nurse practitioners. I am sure that the Minister
                would not want to be responsible for withdrawing the following:
                cardiac rehabilitation services based in leisure centres in
                Armagh; enhanced delivery of diabetes care in Newcastle,
                Whiteabbey and Magherafelt; screening of people with learning
                difficulties in Antrim, Ballymena and north and west Belfast;
                and community development initiatives in the Hillhall estate in
                Lisburn and in south Down. Nor, I am sure, would she want to be
                responsible for the closure of primary-care-led hospital beds in
                Whiteabbey and Castlewellan, which will further increase
                pressure on our hospitals.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is vital that the achievements of the
                present arrangements be preserved and carried into a new
                framework. A top-down approach will not work. Effective and
                efficient management of new primary care structures cannot be
                enhanced by increasing the power and influence of health boards.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly is unlikely to have another
                chance to create major initiatives in primary care in the
                foreseeable future. That is why this debate is so important.
                Giving more power to health boards makes any future review of
                such a structure much more difficult. The Minister has said on a
                number of occasions that the Executive will carry out a major
                review of public administration. I accept and support that, but
                the Health Service cannot wait for it. A review of the Health
                Service, which examines looking at boards and trusts, is needed
                within the next year and a half.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The draft Programme for Government states
                that we must</p>

                people.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Former President Bill Clinton said recently
                that to stand still is to go back. What the Minister is
                proposing for primary care is, de facto, a return to the days
                before fundholding, with the inevitable loss of expertise gained
                by staff involved in pilot commissioning schemes and fundholders
                in general. In the draft Programme for Government, one of the
                actions to be taken is to</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;finalise a strategy which will replace
                the GP Fundholding Scheme with fairer, less bureaucratic
                arrangements in primary care designed to strengthen structures
                for delivering high quality primary care services in local
                communities&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Giving more power to health boards will not
                strengthen those structures. After all, they are the ones who
                are looking after GPs in Northern Ireland who are not
                fundholders. It is ludicrous, therefore, to put everyone in the
                charge of the boards. In the past it has been a failure.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Brian Patterson said that going back eight
                years to health board management would undo much of what has
                been achieved. What we have always asked for is a seamless
                transition. It is not just fundholding; the commissioning pilots
                are also being told to down tools. The Royal College of Nursing
                has said that it welcomes the primary health care document,
                especially the abolition of GP fundholding in Northern Ireland.
                However, if GP fundholding is abolished in April, with no
                infrastructure in the interim, many problems will emerge for
                nurses and nursing.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">10.45 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Royal colleges have been inundated by primary
                care people, both doctors and nurses, expressing their deep
                concerns about job losses. General practitioners have been
                funding nurse-prescribing roles from fundholding savings. They
                have already informed nurses that their employment will be
                terminated in the future due to a lack of funding. We are deeply
                concerned about this latest development and would like to
                express our support for the amendment proposed by the Health,
                Social Services and Public Safety Committee on Wednesday 24
                January 2001.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The mere mention of the words &quot;royal
                colleges&quot; results in some Members becoming annoyed. While
                surgeons and physicians may have played some role in the
                downgrading of Dungannon, Magherafelt and Downe Hospitals, one
                cannot have a blanket condemnation of all the royal colleges. Mr
                Speaker, you will appreciate the point. We are talking about the
                Royal College of General Practitioners and the Royal College of
                Nursing. Dr Peter Colvin, Chair of the Northern Ireland faculty
                of the Royal College of General Practitioners, as said:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;I think the hiatus in the
                organisational structures is very detrimental to primary care.
                It is demoralising for health care staff and frustrating for
                those trying to deliver a quality service to their
                patients.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He added that the resource implications for
                the overhaul of primary care structures must be addressed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister’s document contains a list of
                aspirations for the development of primary care services. There
                is no commitment to resources and no timetable to put these
                aspirations in place. Dr Colvin further declared that he was
                concerned that the quality of patient care would be affected
                gravely by the hiatus.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must give the people of Northern Ireland
                the best primary care service possible. Our people deserve that.
                It is what this debate is about. We are not likely to have
                another chance for some time. The future of primary care will
                affect every family in Northern Ireland. It will affect every
                man, woman and child. It will affect the elderly, children, the
                mentally ill, the disabled and the socially deprived. Therefore,
                we must get it right. We all know about the poor health of
                people in this part of the world. Life expectancy in Northern
                Ireland is among the worst in Europe. We have the third-highest
                death rate in Europe from coronary artery disease. Female lung
                cancer rates are the highest in Europe, as are those for breast
                cancer and teenage pregnancy. Young male death rates from
                accidents and suicide are the highest in the EU.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to health inequalities, sickness
                and death hit the poorest worst and first. The death rate for
                the unskilled is three times greater, and the poorest are twice
                as likely to die prematurely. The Health Service in Northern
                Ireland, as in the rest of the United Kingdom, is in a poor
                state, with huge hospital waiting lists and delays in the
                treatment of cancer and cardiac surgery. These factors all add
                to the great confusion. Our patients deserve better.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given the will, there is more than enough
                talent in primary care in Northern Ireland to enable us to
                develop a primary care service that is fit for the twenty-first
                century. Before Members vote, I ask them all to consider the
                positive proposals in John McFall’s document ‘Fit for the
                Future — A New Approach’. Members should consider this and
                then look at the main section of the document, titled ‘Building
                the Way Forward In Primary Care’, and ask themselves whether,
                if fundholding and, above all, the GP commissioning groups,
                finish on 31 March, structures will be in place not only for the
                smooth development of primary care but also for the provision of
                the best possible service for the people.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McFarland:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">GP fundholding is wrong in principle, and it
                must be changed. It is an inequitable system. Members will be
                aware that some 90% of medical care is carried out at primary
                care level. Sixty per cent of GPs — 600 — in Northern
                Ireland are fundholders. They cover 65% of the population. Two
                thirds of the Northern Ireland population come under GP
                fundholding. It is fair to say that fundholding has been, by and
                large, a success. There have been some failures. Some doctors
                have not handled it well. However, those doctors who are in
                fundholding believe that it has been a success. Their patients
                are happy that they get a better service. This is where the
                problem arises, because that situation is inequitable for
                patients who are not in fundholding practices and whose
                commissioning is done by the boards. They do not get as good a
                deal. That is unfair, and that is why there has to be change.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Over the past few years, a substantial
                expertise has been built up in fundholding. Professionals deal
                with the money and commissioning matters. There is a great
                danger that, if fundholding is ended precipitously on 31 March,
                many people who are not NHS staff but who are contracted to GPs
                will be lost. They will find jobs elsewhere. The future plan for
                primary care, as you are aware, is to bring GP commissioning
                into being at a slightly higher level, not with individual
                doctors but with groups of doctors. Those organisations will
                need the expertise which currently exists in fundholding, but by
                the time we get round to it — in a year, perhaps — and we
                are then looking for such people, they will have obtained work
                elsewhere.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What is the hurry about all this? We are
                being asked to end fundholding on 31 March and to give
                commissioning back to the least successful commissioners in the
                current system — the boards.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members will be aware that a primary care
                review is taking place. Dr Maurice Hayes is carrying out an
                acute hospitals review. The object of the exercise is to produce
                a new system, a seamless robe of medical care that is the best
                we can design for our patients. The primary care review does not
                report until 2 March. It seems that, regardless of its findings,
                we will chop fundholding by 31 March. We have had no opportunity
                to look at what the proposals might be, nor to devise an
                equitable and suitable system that we all like. Regardless of
                our choice, fundholding is to be chopped. That is not right.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee has spoken to the British
                Medical Association, the Royal College of General Practitioners
                and the Royal College of Nursing. Those organisations are happy
                that GP fundholding should go but are very unhappy at the speed
                with which it is taking place. This morning I received a letter
                from my north Down primary care organisation that said,
                &quot;Please do not do this until you have something to put in
                its place.&quot; My point is that I do not understand why this
                is being rushed, why a decision to chop this is being taken
                before there is something better — which we hope will come out
                of the reviews — to put in its place. It makes no sense. We
                will lose the expertise, and how will we get it back? What is
                the hurry? We need time to put the new system in place.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The professionals are against stopping GP
                fundholding on 31 March. Patients will lose out until there is a
                better system. I urge Members to think carefully, because we are
                in serious danger of throwing the baby out with the bath water.
                We need time to allow these studies to take place, and to allow
                the Department to bring forward something sensible with which
                Members and professionals are happy. I urge Members to support
                the amendment and buy us that time.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Berry:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the amendment. Many discussions
                have taken place in the past few weeks in relation to the repeal
                of GP fundholding. It was expressed time and time again — Mr
                McFarland and Dr Hendron have covered it very well — that many
                professionals argued before the Committee that they had no
                problem with the ending of GP fundholding. The problem they
                found was that there was nothing to replace it, and they asked
                why we should rush through the whole process. We should give it
                a year and then go for the ending of GP fundholding. If this
                measure goes through as it is, our Health Service will become
                nothing more than a joke.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Like many others, I find it hard to
                understand how anyone could come up with such a measure without
                first asking a few simple, common-sense questions. What have
                others done about this issue? What will replace the present
                system? What will be the immediate effect of abolishing that
                system? Most importantly, what vital services will close as a
                result of ending GP fundholding? If the Minister had been
                briefed properly she would have asked herself these questions.
                Are there any excellent things we ought to keep? Should this
                matter be phased in along a set timetable? These and other
                simple questions were never asked, and perhaps never answered.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The English model says that whatever is good
                will be retained. As Mr McFarland said, we are throwing the baby
                out with the bath water. Many would say that we are not even
                keeping the bath. GP fundholding was not in itself a disaster,
                which is why it is being retained in England. Rather, the fault
                lay in the fact that not every GP was a fundholder. That is why
                so many have come to oppose it: it brought division to a
                once-unified service.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly is faced with a choice of
                whether to act like vandals or like responsible politicians. The
                vandal will abolish without replacement; the responsible
                politician will replace and abolish as a unitary act. Since we
                have nothing to replace GP fundholding, we cannot abolish it.
                Discarding the system is the work of a philistine with no
                comprehension of the effect and impact on patients, services and
                GP morale. If a person were to fix a vehicle in the way that the
                Minister proposes to fix the Health Service, it would be akin to
                abolishing the petrol engine and going back to steam, while
                waiting for an inventor to come up with a replacement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many people and professionals in the
                community do not want to see the continuation of GP fundholding,
                but they want something credible in its place before action is
                taken. I support the amendment, and I trust that Members will
                stand behind the Chairperson and Deputy Chairperson of the
                Health Committee in support of it.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Ramsey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat. I oppose the amendment.
                I am a member of the Health Committee, and we had a number of
                frank discussions in the Committee. In fact, some Members have
                said more today than they said at the Committee meetings.
                Perhaps it has something to do with having speech-writers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My colleague on the Committee, John Kelly,
                and I felt that we could not support the amendment. Our views
                were placed firmly on the record. Sinn Féin is on record as
                saying that GP fundholding has been wrong from its inception.
                Every party in the Assembly has said, at one time or another,
                that GP fundholding is wrong and that it welcomes the ending of
                that system.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Committee, Dr Hendron,
                said that pilot schemes will be lost. It is my understanding
                that pilot schemes will not be lost. Extending GP fundholding
                for another year would not give us time to put in place a proper
                replacement. The expertise and staffing mentioned will not be
                lost; they will just be reintegrated into another part of the
                service. Keeping GP fundholding would send out the wrong
                message, because for years it has created uncertainty, not only
                among staff but in the service as a whole. This amendment would
                just add to that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">GP fundholding is wrong. It created
                inequalities and a two-tier system in the Health Service, and it
                must go. Mr McFarland said that GP fundholding is wrong but that
                it has been a success. I do not know where he got that from. If
                something is wrong, how can it be a success? He also mentioned
                expertise. As I have said, that expertise will not be lost.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.00 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The professionals are against change. They do
                not want to lose control of GP fundholding. We need to point out
                that the overspending within fundholding has led to large
                deficits that have had to be met by the boards. Those deficits
                are taking money away from front-line care. The Minister told
                the Committee last week that, because of this overspending, some
                45 GP fundholders will be legally required to leave the scheme
                this year. That adds to the uncertainty.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">GP fundholding is unfair. It has created a
                two-tier system. Continuing it for another year will tie up
                much-needed resources and will only add to the delay in delivery
                of primary care. The Committee Chairperson was also told that GP
                fundholding will not end right away; there will be a phased
                rundown over six months, while at the same time implementing
                primary care. Members need to take that on board. If we delay it
                for another year, and there is then another phased rundown,
                where will we be going? We will be two years down the road.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The services provided by GP fundholders will
                not end. The delivery of the service will continue. The only
                difference will be in who commissions that service. This
                fightback by fundholders be stopped. The sectarian, anti-Sinn
                Féin politics of the DUP must not be allowed to dictate this
                amendment. I find it worrying that some members of the SDLP are
                prepared to support maintaining fundholding, even though —</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Beggs:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Member accept that this is a matter
                of judgement on health issues? It is totally false to introduce
                sectarianism. This is a matter of looking after patients in all
                Northern Ireland.</p>

                clearly saying is that anti-Sinn Féin sectarian attitudes
                should not be allowed to dictate this amendment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some members of the SDLP are prepared to
                support maintaining fundholding, even though the Chairperson of
                the Health Committee, Joe Hendron, has said time and time again
                that fundholding is wrong. Fundholding created inequality in the
                Health Service. For the first time, this Bill gives us the
                opportunity to tackle the inequalities in the Health Service and
                the inequalities created by GP fundholding.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I cannot support the amendment.</p>

                question that Alan McFarland asked: what is the rush? We must
                get it right this time. Many important points have been raised
                this morning, particularly by the Chairperson of the Health
                Committee, Dr Joe Hendron, whom I consider to be more expert on
                the subject than many Members.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fundholding was interesting and, perhaps,
                useful in certain circumstances. However, a decision has been
                made to leave fundholding behind, and we in the Alliance Party
                and many other parties in the Assembly support that. The extra
                time outlined in the amendment will give all concerned the
                opportunity to put in place something that will benefit both the
                patient and the GP. Using the experience of fundholding and
                other practices during recent times can only help us all to
                provide a more equitable way forward for the Health Service.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Alliance Party supports the amendment.</p>

                party that has been totally opposed to GP fundholding and
                recognises that it creates a two-tier system. We believe that it
                should be taken out of commission. Our big difficulty is that
                nobody has convinced us that this money will not go back to the
                boards when the time for doing away with GP fundholding arrives
                at the end of March.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We all talk about how we will spend this
                money on primary care. In my view, if the money goes back to the
                boards it will not be spent on primary care. It will be spent
                where it is always spent — in acute hospitals, particularly
                the Royal Victoria Hospital. That is where the inequality is. We
                allow the Health Service to take money from primary care and put
                it into acute services. We continually must ensure that whatever
                we have in place is primary care, and that it recognises the
                nurses and the health visitors in the areas where we live and
                work. That is what we need to do. To date, nobody has convinced
                me that primary care will be a winner when GP fundholding is
                removed. We want fundholders to remain for another year, until
                such care is in place.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We could argue about where the money will be
                spent, but when GP fundholding goes, the boards will be left in
                control of their money. In recent years, I have watched my area’s
                board spend that money as it pleased. It spent it on the
                deficits for which it, rather than the GP fundholders, was
                responsible. It has done away with the people we need, such as
                physiotherapists and occupational therapists, who have been
                taken out of my area and not replaced. Despite this, there are
                still elderly people in my community, some aged 84, who have to
                wait at least two years before they can even get a consultation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us make sure that we get this right. Let
                us hold on to the GP fundholding for one more year until we have
                an alternative primary care service in place. Let us not leave
                it to the boards, because they will put the money into acute
                hospitals and not into primary care.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms McWilliams:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is a time of uncertainty, but it is also
                one of major change. The ongoing reviews of acute hospitals,
                acute care and primary care and investing for health signal a
                period of hope. That should be seen as a period of opportunity
                and not as a period of threat.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The extent of people’s concern that we may
                move backwards rather than forwards is disappointing. In my
                opinion, the reverse is taking place, and the announcement that
                GP fundholding is to end marks an opportunity for us to move on
                to something different.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am very concerned, and I have a number of
                questions for the Minister about the closure of fundholding and
                the role of the boards. It is also important for us to remember
                the members of other multidisciplinary teams in primary care.
                &quot;The Invisible Army&quot; was the title of a conference
                held last week by community nurses, district nurses and health
                visitors, who believe that their voices have not been heard in
                this debate. We must remember that it is not just GPs who should
                have a major vote in deciding the way forward.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The removal of fundholding has been presented
                in a very negative light, even though many GPs and other health
                care and social care professionals welcome such a move in the
                light of the inequities and the perverse incentives it created.
                We should be made accountable for deficits. In the Eastern
                Health and Social Services Board alone, fundholding has created
                a deficit of £4·1 million. According to empirical evidence,
                five fundholding practices in the North Belfast and West Belfast
                constituencies had £2·7 million savings, of which £1·47
                million went back into the practices for structural improvement.
                Only £117,000 was spent on services to the community. This is
                taking place not just in South Belfast but also in extremely
                deprived communities, of which there are also many in South
                Belfast.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We who hold others accountable for how they
                spend their money should be making decisions on such inequity
                and deficits. Is that what we want to continue over the next
                year?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fundholders have also expressed concern to
                Members of the Assembly and Health Committee members that
                innovative practices will not be protected or continued. I ask
                the Minister to address that point.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">According to the departmental officials who
                addressed the Committee, it seems that they will build on good
                practice and incorporate its various elements rather than just
                end them. I pay tribute to the excellent practice that has
                emerged from the commissioning pilot schemes, including the
                pilot scheme on the care of the elderly which took place outside
                my constituency in the Down Lisburn Trust area. And if we can
                build on the innovative practices now in place and mainstream
                them, we will relieve some of the alarm, anxiety and fear of
                those working on that pilot scheme.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Savings on prescriptions have been made, and
                that is probably the area flagged up most by GP fundholders.
                However, it is unfair to suggest that non-fundholders have not
                saved on prescriptions also in the past years. On some future
                occasion we may debate the distribution of generic rather than
                specialist types of drugs to some people. Nonetheless, whether
                or not patients’ needs are best served by the way in which
                doctors have had to address themselves to the prescription
                charge debate, it remains laudable that both fundholders and
                non-fundholders have made substantial savings on prescriptions.
                The main worry for GP fundholders is that any savings they have
                made to date may be dispersed after 31 March. That will
                obviously be an anxiety for people who have gone out of their
                way to make savings. If these economies are taken from doctors
                and given to the boards, the doctors may feel that all their
                hard work has been to no avail. On the contrary, I believe that
                where savings were made, they were benefited from. Perhaps the
                Minister could address that issue in her response.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is also the matter of redeployment.
                What is to happen to the staff who were part of the pilot
                schemes and those who work in fundholders’ practices? We are
                not heartless individuals. The boards have been asked to address
                that task. The debate must continue about whether or not those
                staff can be redeployed elsewhere and whether some of the best
                practices can be mainstreamed. Otherwise, we will wake up on 1
                April and suddenly discover that everything has changed and all
                the best has been thrown out.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Even if we had gone down the road of ‘Fit
                for the Future’, as opposed to the road of the current
                consultation document, we would still be going through a period
                of transition. Transition is something that we know about. As we
                are often told, we are in a period of transition with
                devolution. Clearly, there is going to be a massive public
                administration review, and we are heading towards that in this
                period of transition. In the end, we will be focused and fixed
                on agreed best services for primary and community care, and all
                Assembly Members will have been part of that decision-making
                process. We do not want to move away from providing services to
                the community. Those models are the options we must consider.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would also like to mention data systems. GP
                fundholders tell us that they have the best data systems and
                that those who are not in fundholding practices have poor
                systems. This is not an issue of GP fundholders versus non-fundholders;
                it is an issue for the whole country. We should have a regional
                strategy on accurate data systems. We need a database across the
                country that records waiting lists and tells us accurately when
                patients went into hospitals, how long they were there and when
                they came out. To date, it has been possible for patients to
                fall through the system, and they have neither been tracked nor
                traced. We should now attempt to redress this problem as part of
                our strategy on the way forward rather than leave efficient data
                equipment a premium available only to GPs who benefited from the
                fundholding system.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need to focus on clinical practice. The
                best clinical practice should not be lost. Concerns have been
                voiced that the innovations implemented there did not show the
                best way forward. Dr Hendron said in his introduction that he is
                concerned about expertise. I have experience of restructuring
                and major change in universities. We built on the best expertise
                and made progress. The last thing anyone wants to do is
                marginalise good expertise; rather we must continue to
                centralise it and thus dispel fears.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.15 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is why we need to move forward quickly
                from a system based on those GPs who showed an interest in
                change and a pilot system toward mainstream organisation in
                primary care with a view to raising standards everywhere. It is
                time to end that uncertainty and move forward.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am concerned about this issue in relation
                to the boards. Clearly, there is great unease about the role of
                the boards and a worry that if local health and social care
                groups are established as subcommittees of boards it will be
                more difficult to review and change their role following a
                review of public administration. Members have already said that
                it will be difficult to take that power away. I am also
                concerned that not everyone takes an interest in this issue and
                that Members attack boards unnecessarily. Different parts of the
                administration have different roles to play.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The community service is an excellent public
                service. The Minister and I saw it last week when the South and
                East Belfast Trust was handing out awards for home-care
                packages, which are delivered by a multidisciplinary team
                working together in the interests of individual patients to
                ensure that the patients remain at home, or are discharged
                earlier from hospital, or never have to go to hospital in the
                first place.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members have voiced fears that boards want to
                give themselves even more power. That may happen in the
                transitional stage, but my understanding is that the opposite
                will happen once a decision has been made on the best strategic
                model, which is currently out for consultation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There should be no special pleading for
                boards, but they are a key building block in the current system.
                In the transition period they may be the glue that holds the
                different elements together. When the jigsaw pieces are
                eventually put together the glue will no longer be needed. My
                understanding is that the boards do not want to be in that
                position any longer than is necessary.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A central thrust of the proposed new
                arrangements is not about adding to bureaucracy. However, it is
                when Members think that an additional tier is being added that
                we get the longest speeches. The arrangements are about creating
                opportunities for integration and partnership with the health
                and personal social services. In Northern Ireland we have been
                commended for our integrated family that encompasses the social
                services on the one hand and the Health Service on the other. We
                aim to drive forward the different components of that service.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Primary care professionals and trusts have
                important roles to play in working with boards to develop the
                new plans. I am very heartened by the action, health, well-being
                and implementation plans in ‘Investing for Health’, and the
                contents of that document need to be incorporated.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let me also give voice to those least heard
                — community nurses, district nurses, school nurses and health
                visitors. More than 150 of these health care workers have
                written to me. Their conference was held on Friday 26 January
                2001, and I have tried to circulate a letter I have received to
                as many Members as possible. The letter states:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;GP fundholding has curtailed innovative
                practice and staff development in the community. One example is
                that many GPs have been very reluctant to support the
                development and extension of practice of community nurses and
                health visitors, even though such developments are beneficial
                both to patients and to staff.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am appalled by the injustice of this
                two-tier system which allows inequity of service provision
                within the communities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Limitations have been placed (both financial
                and professional) on community nurses and health visitors. The
                latter especially have lost a large part of their public health
                role that they are trained and skilled to deliver.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If GP fundholding is extended, health
                visitors will be unable to effectively deliver the public health
                agenda which has been proposed in the ‘Investing for Health’
                consultation document. Because of the payment system to
                GPs&quot; —</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;health visitors are commissioned by
                them to meet their targets in relation to immunisation
                programmes and development surveillance of pre-school children.
                Community nurses and health visitors are trained to work using a
                holistic approach to patient/client care. GP fundholding has
                served to disempower nurses by focusing on a medical model of
                intervention and a task orientated model of practice. This
                scenario exists largely because GPs are trained to treat disease
                rather than to prevent it.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those are pretty harsh words. However,
                community nurses and health visitors are concerned that, if this
                remains in place for another year, they will continue to be
                treated as people who simply carry out immunisation and
                surveillance programmes because of the payments given for that
                work. Rather, they should be viewed in a holistic way, given
                that they have been trained to carry out the public health role
                of preventative care.</p>

                than any of the other Members — including Dr&nbsp;Hendron, who
                moved the amendment. In fairness, I ask all Members to try to
                make their points as concisely as they can. That would allow
                everyone to join in the debate and prevent our postponing to the

                I can so that an informed decision can be made. However, I will
                take on board your views and draw my remarks to a close.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Having asked the Minister to address a number
                of anxieties and fears, we should make a decision on how we are
                going to vote on this serious issue. In the end, the focus on
                improving services for those in the community is what should
                drive us forward. This decision will lead us to that decision.
                The sooner we consult and decide on the models, rather than
                endure uncertainty for another year, the better for all of us.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is time to promote equality of access and
                service across all our communities. We know the inequities and
                the deficits that exist when we do not do that. It is time to
                build on partnership and get clear and simple lines of
                accountability.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the amendment. The Health Service
                has been subjected to a multitude of changes over the past
                number of years. The past 10 to 15&nbsp;years has been an era of
                almost constant change that has proved most unsettling for all
                involved — administrators, employees and the patients
                themselves. Insecurity and uncertainty have been the main
                characteristics of the Health Service for too long. The many
                reviews and recommendations have been an enormous waste of time,
                finance and resources, especially when so many of those
                recommendations have not been implemented. People today expect
                the Health Service to be professional in every respect, and that
                includes those who make decisions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Society wants a service that delivers the
                appropriate care at the right time, in the right place and by
                the right people. As the Chairperson of the Committee for
                Health, Social Services and Public Safety has said, there must
                be a seamless service for a patient from his first contact with
                his GP through to primary care and on to whatever treatment is
                required afterwards. Many points have been made, which I will
                not repeat. Questions, however, must be asked. One question that
                has been raised concerns the level of deficit in certain GP
                fundholding practices. The amount quoted was approximately
                £5&nbsp;million. Why is this being raised as a problem when
                groups such as the Royal Group of Hospitals Trust are over £13
                million in debt? The use of this kind of argument indicates a
                lack of consistency.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Prof McWilliams said that best practice
                should not be lost. Is there any guarantee that it will not be
                lost, particularly as specialists have been brought in and
                expertise has been gathered in the fundholding system? Is there
                any guarantee that, if fundholding is cut off and there is staff
                disruption — and we have been told that staff will be
                reintegrated — these people will be prepared to change again
                and come back to the co-operatives or whatever system replaces
                fundholding?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We agree that fundholding must go. It is
                inequitable. The question before the House is when will it go.
                Why proceed now when a consultation process is taking place? As
                has already been asked, what is the hurry? It is regrettable
                that the Ms Ramsey said that opposition to fundholding is a Sinn
                Féin prerogative. It is not — we are all against fundholding.
                Why introduce sectarianism to the debate when we should be
                concerned with getting the best for all patients in our country?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As has been mentioned, the cutting of
                fundholding now would be a regrettable step. We are going
                backwards. John Simpson is right when he says that</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;to give back the whole of the
                fundholding control to the boards is a backward step&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are supposed to be making progress, but we
                are going back 10 years. The Assembly is here to progress every
                aspect of life in this community, but in one step our attitude
                is regressing at least 10 years. If the Health Service is to be
                restructured, we must question the need for a Department, four
                boards, four health councils, five agencies, 19 trusts and five
                health co-operatives. These are the questions we should be
                considering. It would be unprofessional to cut off fundholding
                now without waiting for the results of the consultation. I ask
                Members to stop and think about what we are doing, and I ask
                them to give the consultation an opportunity to succeed.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This debate would not have taken place if it
                were not for the attitude of the Minister and her Department. I
                want to place it on record that the SDLP is opposed to the
                principle of fundholding. I want that on record in order to
                avoid anyone making political capital of it. The issue is too
                important for that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fundholding introduced differences in the
                treatment of patients. It discriminated between patient
                categories. The SDLP believes in a National Health Service in
                which services are free at the point of delivery. The Minister
                and her Department refused to extend the consultation period to
                develop more radical options for primary care. That
                short-sighted approach will waste money in the long term. The
                Minister and her Department want to go backwards to the failed
                system that was recognised as such in documents such as ‘Fit
                for the Future’ and ‘Fit for the Future — A New Approach’.
                The same Department wrote those documents. ‘Fit for the Future
                — A New Approach’ was presented to Assembly Members almost
                two years ago by the then Minister for Health and Social
                Services, John McFall. We are now being presented with a far
                more conservative option than that of two years ago.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to see real partnerships on the
                ground, involving GPs, nurses, social workers, physiotherapists,
                occupational therapists, pharmacists and podiatrists
                commissioning services for their patients. It is the
                professionals and the practitioners working on the ground who
                best know the needs of their patients. I have talked to many
                practitioners. I can assure Members who are worried that the
                nurses have not been consulted that I have talked to many
                nurses. They have deep concerns that the Department and the
                Minister are going backwards.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need to see the results of the review of
                acute hospital services in place if we are ever to make the
                fundamental changes required. We talk about an integrated,
                interdependent health care system. How can we create that
                without all the pieces of the jigsaw? I want to see fundholding
                ended, but I want real primary-care partnership at the heart of
                whatever replaces it. We need to build on the innovative
                practices and pilot schemes that have evolved in the past few
                years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The main urgency for ending fundholding now
                appears to be a monetary one — an overspend of approximately
                £5 million by fundholding practices. Of course, much primary
                care has been under-resourced, and it is essential that money be
                spent where it is needed. I need to know the real cost of going
                back to where we were before fundholding. Surely it would be
                more cost-effective to make some radical decisions at this
                stage, rather than taking retrograde steps that will move us
                further away from the ideal of an integrated and interdependent
                health care system. Ironically, we will now need additional
                resources for primary care to go backwards. I urge the Minister
                to listen and to take a more radical approach to the future of
                our health care.</p>

                is predicated on the view developing here that those of us who
                oppose the amendment are uncaring about primary care, the health
                of our constituents or ensuring that we make provisions for a
                health service that is delivered at the point of need.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have listened to everyone arguing for the
                ending of fundholding. No Members have said that they are for
                the continuation of fundholding. All that they say is &quot;We
                want fundholding ended, but why the hurry?&quot; Why then the
                hurry on this amendment? Why bring to the Floor of the Chamber
                an amendment that is divisive in our attempts to create a
                proper, caring Health Service, particularly in the area of
                primary care? It puts people such as Sue Ramsey and myself in a
                position where, by opposing the amendment — and opposing it in
                Committee for four and a half hours or more — we are somehow
                seen as backward-looking people who are not in favour of a
                Health Service that is socialist in its content and direction.
                That is why this amendment is unnecessary and divisive.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a suggestion that fundholding will
                end completely on 1 April. In fact, the statement from the
                Minister says that there will be a six-month, or perhaps longer,
                winding down of fundholding. To suggest that ending fundholding
                in this way is somehow detrimental —</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the Member would give us some
                understanding of what it would wind down to, perhaps those who

                what it would wind down to. It is winding down to the wind-up of
                a primary health care. That is why I am opposing the amendment.
                If I thought that the winding down of fundholding was not going
                to be in line with arrangements ensuring that we were making the
                beginnings of a primary care service that is radical and will
                deliver care to those who need it, I would not be opposing the
                amendment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I oppose the amendment because it is divisive
                and unnecessary. I received a letter from members of the
                mid-Ulster commissioning pilot scheme this morning. It went
                through all the various things that we have already discussed.
                While they are not in favour of ending fundholding in what they
                call a transitional period, they are saying that the scenario
                whereby GP fundholding is extended for another year would be
                worse. Even they are aware of the fact that fundholding has not
                delivered an equitable health service. It has delivered a
                two-tier system of health.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member will recall that we had extensive
                discussions about how we might find some way through this. It is
                fair to say that the Committee did not wish to extend it for a
                year, but the Committee had no option because there would be no
                system in place if it went through. We are interested in having
                something to replace the present system. If the Minister could
                produce something to replace it, and find a way of altering the
                timescale, I am quite sure that we would all be happy enough
                with that. The problem is about the replacement.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us hear what the Minister has to say
                about that. I am confident that this Minister will attempt to
                deliver — and will deliver — a primary health service that
                will be worthy of her own political and social philosophies. I
                will look forward to that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree that there are difficulties in the
                interim and in the transition. However, those difficulties are
                exacerbated by the amendment. They could have been better
                overcome had we adopted a more consultative approach. I do not
                take on board that the winding down of fundholding will hinder
                the beginnings of the delivery of a proper primary care service.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the question of costs, there is no doubt
                about it. We talked to the boards in relation to the present
                position. Who will pay for the deficit of the fundholders,
                except the boards? Who will pay for the deficit of fundholders,
                except the Department? If fundholders get an extension for a
                year, they will surely say at the end of that year that they
                will not be paying the deficit — whatever it might be. It will
                then be open season as regards what happens within fundholding.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I oppose the amendment because it is divisive
                and unnecessary. I would not oppose it if I thought for one
                minute that we were not all saying the same thing. We are
                singing from the same hymn sheet — for a change. We all want a
                proper primary care service and a proper health service for the
                people we serve. The only dispute is about how and when it
                should be delivered. This hiatus that we talk about might not be
                as big a chasm as some are making it out to be.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I listened to Dr Hendron’s list of doom as
                to what might happen. I would not oppose him if I thought that
                the things he suggested would come to pass. I have just been
                handed ‘Building the Way Forward in Primary Care’, in which

                forward, not in a divisive way, but in a united way, so that we,
                as Ms&nbsp;de&nbsp;Brún said, might deliver the best possible
                health service to our constituents and the people we serve, a

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs I Robinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is obvious that the Minister’s stance
                has more to do with politics than the good practice of providing
                the best care to the public. Sixty-five per cent of GPs chose
                the fundholding alternative, and 35% opted to stay with the
                boards. The so-called inequality of the present system is down
                to a matter of choice, not direct or indirect discrimination
                against those GPs who decided of their own volition not to
                become GP fundholders. That is a matter of fact. The &quot;them
                and us&quot; scenario that has been painted is due to choice
                alone.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The relevant facts were well put by the
                Chairperson of the Health Committee, Dr&nbsp;Hendron, Mr
                McFarland, Mr Berry and Billy Hutchinson. We wish to see an end
                to GP fundholding. However, during the Health Committee’s
                deliberations, it accepted that there would be a void if
                fundholding ceased by 1 April 2001. The Health Committee’s
                vote on this issue last Wednesday reflected these concerns —
                it was six to two in support of this amendment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need to take account of the expected
                reviews of primary care and the future of acute hospitals.
                Sensible and informed decisions can be taken with all of that
                information to hand. The bogeyman of the £5 million deficit run
                up by several GP fundholders was held up as a good reason to end
                the practice. That seems strange to me, bearing in mind that it
                costs an additional £90 million a year to run the 11 Government
                Departments, whereas only six were required before the Assembly
                was established — there was no concern about that. An extra
                £20 million is required to service the North/South bodies —
                again, no concern.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We will get only one chance to make the
                Health Service work for all of Northern Ireland’s people. I
                urge caution and ask the SDLP to remove its three-line whip so
                that it can join the Health Committee’s Chairperson and the
                majority of its members in support of the amendment.</p>

                welcome the Minister’s decision to end GP fundholding. I
                welcomed that decision before I listened to this morning’s
                debate. After listening to everyone else say that fundholding is
                wrong, I want to put that point across strongly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Before the establishment of the Assembly and
                the Executive, all the political parties were clearly calling
                for the end of GP fundholding. I cannot understand the argument
                behind this morning’s debate. In my opinion, the amendment is
                madness. GP fundholding has created an unequal, two-tier health
                system at primary care level. Delaying the end of GP fundholding
                will result in the waste of millions of pounds in propping up a
                system instead of developing new arrangements.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given that primary care is so important, and
                given that the delivery of primary care services has major
                ramifications for every other aspect of the Health Service, it
                is critical that the Assembly get this issue right. The
                inequalities created by the GP fundholding system cannot be
                perpetuated because we do not have the bottle to change it. GPs
                lobbied me before the Executive was set up and during the
                suspension period because of uncertainty in the Health Service.
                That fact illustrates how demoralising this issue was.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need to use resources wisely to put a
                credible system in place that treats everybody equally. Health
                should not be used as a political football. The Assembly should
                use this opportunity to create a fair and equitable system. I
                oppose the amendment. Go raibh maith agat.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I strongly oppose the amendment, the effect
                of which would be to continue the GP fundholding scheme for at
                least a further year. There are strong grounds for ending the
                scheme on 1 April 2001, as I have announced it is my intention
                to do. Continuing fundholding would perpetuate the acknowledged
                inequities of the scheme, and the bureaucracy and high
                administrative costs associated with its operation. It would be
                damaging to the development of new arrangements in primary care
                and could contribute to overspends in health and social services
                budgets which would affect services adversely.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fundholding is the mark of the old internal
                market in health and social care, and it must now be consigned
                to the past. I want to move forward to develop arrangements in
                health and social care that will be based on partnership and
                co-operation, not confrontation and fragmentation. My proposals
                for new arrangements in primary care will be more inclusive than
                fundholding is. They will involve a wider range of primary care
                professionals and commission a broader range of services.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For a number of practical reasons it is
                necessary to end fundholding at the end of the financial year.
                At the end of the year, fundholders’ overspends will probably
                be higher than last year. That should not be the case at a time
                when we are actively trying to get to grips with the problem of
                deficits and overspends in the health and social services
                budget. If fundholding continues for a further year, the
                overspends may be even higher next year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fundholders’ overspends create budget
                pressures elsewhere in the health and social services. The
                overspends are paid for by the health and social services
                boards. They have to set aside resources for that purpose,
                resources that might have been better spent on other services.
                The Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety is
                required, under fundholding legislation, to be satisfied that
                fundholders manage their budgets effectively. If fundholding
                continues, the Department may therefore be obliged to remove a
                significant number of overspending practices from the scheme,
                thereby hastening the disorderly disintegration of the scheme.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mention has been made in the debate of the
                differences that exist between legislation for trusts and
                legislation for fundholding. The legislation is different, and
                that is why the approach is different.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Managing fundholding places considerable
                demands on fundholders, boards and trusts. Investing all that
                effort in sustaining an obsolete scheme for another year would
                divert effort and resources from the formidable agenda involved
                in developing new arrangements in primary care. Moreover,
                continuing the scheme for a further year would prolong the
                uncertainty under which fundholding has been operating. It would
                exacerbate the problems that fundholders have had in retaining
                fundholding staff.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since April 1998, 28 GP practices have left
                the fundholding scheme. In many cases, that was because there
                were problems with retaining or recruiting fundholding staff and
                with managing within the budgets. Prolonging the scheme would
                simply increase the problems of retaining expertise and
                undermine fundholders’ ability to manage the scheme
                effectively during its final year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Much of the money that I need to invest in
                new primary care arrangements is currently tied up in the
                administrative costs associated with fundholding. If fundholding
                continues for a further year, I will have to look elsewhere for
                the resources needed to develop new arrangements in primary care
                in order to bring them forward. That could mean having to use
                some of the money that I intend putting into front-line primary
                care services next year. My proposals envisage using some of the
                money currently tied up in the administrative costs of
                fundholding to invest an extra £2·5 million in front-line
                primary care services. Extending fundholding would delay the
                release of that money.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am very aware of the need to manage the
                transition period between the end of GP fundholding and the
                start of new arrangements carefully and sensitively. On 1 April
                2001 — the intended date for the ending of fundholding — the
                health and social services boards will assume responsibility, at
                least on an interim basis, for commissioning the full range of
                health and social services for all their populations and for the
                resources currently managed by fundholders. Boards already
                commission the majority of services for fundholders as well as
                all the services for non-fundholders. They will resume the
                commissioning of all services once fundholding ends.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These arrangements would continue under my
                proposals until such time as the proposed new local health and
                social care groups, subject to the outcome of the consultation
                process, are in a position to take over some of the boards’
                commissioning responsibilities. GPs would continue to provide
                services, as they do at present.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Guidance issued by my Department has
                instructed boards to urgently consider, with fundholders and
                trusts, the impact of ending fundholding on services put in
                place locally by fundholders, and to ensure that these are
                maintained where possible. In order to provide boards with
                greater flexibility in managing the transition from fundholding,
                I have proposed that they should get additional resources for
                primary care in the next financial year. As a result, there will
                be no vacuum in the delivery of services when fundholding ends.
                Services will continue to be provided, and only the commissioner
                will change during the interim period.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am aware of concerns raised in some
                quarters — and I have heard them in this debate — about the
                transition to new arrangements. I believe that these problems
                can be managed. As elsewhere, it will not be necessary to create
                new statutory bodies, and this, as I have said, has not
                happened. In developing new arrangements in primary care, health
                and social services boards will be given an explicit remit by
                the Department to support the new groups actively and
                positively. They will be held accountable for their performance
                in this regard, and will be expected to work in close
                partnership with primary care professionals so that all involved
                have real ownership of the process.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we are to move forward, as we envisage, to
                a primary-care-led service, everyone in the health and social
                services at all levels will be expected to facilitate and
                support whatever emerges from the consultation process. The
                consultation period on the new arrangements will end on 2 March
                2001. There has been a suggestion that I was asked to extend
                that period. I have not been asked to do that. After that date,
                I will take decisions quickly on the way forward in order to
                enable the service to turn its attention to putting in place the
                new arrangements early in the new financial year. The intention
                is to build up as quickly as possible to the implementation of
                the new arrangements.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the six-month period that will be
                required after the end of fundholding to wind down and close
                fundholders’ accounts, the new arrangements will be built up.
                The resources needed to invest in new arrangements are currently
                tied up in fundholding, and investments in the new arrangements
                will be able to be made only as those resources are released.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There was also the issue of pilot schemes.
                This is a separate question and is not tied to this legislation.
                I want to look at how the services put in place by the pilots
                can be maintained during the transitional phase. However,
                maintaining the work of pilots is a different issue to the
                matter of ending fundholding.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A number of other issues have been raised,
                principally by Committee members, about the health and social
                services boards. As I said, everyone throughout the service will
                be expected to facilitate and support whatever emerges from the
                consultation exercise. I believe, therefore, that the transition
                from fundholding to the establishment of new arrangements can
                take place without disruption to services or detriment to
                primary care, provided that fundholding ends on 1 April 2001.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Resources for primary care will be addressed
                as part of my announcement about next year’s financial
                allocations for health and personal social services. The boards
                have been explicitly instructed to examine how services put in
                place by fundholders will be maintained. It is true, as Prof
                McWilliams said, that non-fundholding GPs have made savings in
                prescribing costs — and some of these have been substantial
                — through the prescribing incentive scheme which will be open
                to all GPs after fundholding ends.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Information technology systems and a new
                information and communications technology strategy for health
                and personal social services — which will embrace primary care
                — are being developed. Following the repeal of existing
                legislation, new regulations will be introduced outlining how
                any fundholder savings remaining at the end of the scheme will
                be used. Guidance on this will be issued with clear ideas of how
                savings will be used. The key issue here, however, is that
                fundholding savings are currently used, and will be used after
                the scheme ends, for the benefit of service users. In fact,
                fundholders who are permitted to use savings for a variety of
                purposes set out in the legislation have used them to improve
                premises, and in some cases there have been complaints that this
                represents a personal asset to the GP.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The proposal for change, as I have said, will
                not increase the power of boards. They will have to include all
                primary care professionals in the new arrangements that are up
                for consultation. They will also all be tasked with improving
                primary care for their populations and with the work of
                commissioning services for them. I can therefore give an
                assurance that the position of boards will not be copperfastened
                by arrangements whereby new groups would operate as board
                committees, nor will this have a bearing on the outcome of the
                forthcoming review of public administration. Members would not
                want me, at any stage, to bring forward proposals that would
                pre-empt that review. I am only one member of a larger
                Executive, and my proposals need to fit in with the wider
                arrangements being made by that Executive.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The establishment of the proposed new local
                health and social care groups as committees of the boards is to
                provide a legal and accountability framework within which to
                operate. My proposals are designed to be accommodated within
                existing health and social care services structures in order to
                not prejudice the outcome of the Executive’s planned review of
                public administration. However, they will be sufficiently
                flexible to be able to be adapted to any changes to health and
                social services structures that emerge from that review. My
                proposals in no way rule out radical changes to health and
                social services structures in the future, depending on the
                outcome of the public administration review.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I can give an assurance that staffing issues
                associated with the ending of fundholding will be dealt with
                sympathetically. Action is currently being pursued on a number
                of fronts to ensure that redundancies can be avoided and that
                the skills and expertise of fund management staff are not lost
                to the service.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Health and social services boards will
                consider sympathetically bids from practices to retain former
                fund management staff permanently in other posts. In making
                financial allocations to the health and personal social services
                bodies for 2001-02, I propose to provide additional resources
                for primary care to allow boards more flexibility in considering
                the staffing requirements of practices.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that this will also extend to a
                redeployment facility, which currently exists in health and
                personal social services for staff who are employed in
                fundholding. This will enable those staff members to be matched
                with suitable vacancies arising elsewhere in the health and
                personal social services field as well as with vacancies in any
                new primary care arrangements set up after the consultation
                exercise. Some fund management staff will continue to be
                employed for several months following the end of the scheme to
                close fundholding accounts, by which time I expect fresh
                employment opportunities to be available within the new primary
                care arrangements.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This amendment, if accepted, will extend the
                life of a scheme that already experiences difficulties and is
                inherently inequitable. Depending on the outcome of the current
                consultation on the ‘Building the Way Forward in Primary Care’
                document, I hope to press ahead quickly with developing new
                arrangements in primary care that will end the uncertainty that
                has existed in this area for a number of years. To extend
                fundholding for a further year is unnecessary. It will damage
                all progress that has been made towards the new arrangements and
                create greater problems for the service than it is designed to
                resolve. I urge that this amendment not be accepted.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Hendron:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to thank the Minister and my
                Colleagues who have spoken in the debate. The Minister has
                mentioned the matter of one year. I told the Minister on behalf
                of the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety
                that a period of six months had been suggested but that the
                Committee had decided that a six-month period would not work
                because it would end in the middle of the financial year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to refer to a few of the points raised
                by my Colleagues. Alan McFarland spoke about the GP staff and
                about how we are losing expertise in these professions. That is
                the burning point of the debate. Paul Berry said that there is
                nothing in place to deal with the need for a unified service,
                but something credible must be in place. That is the key to the
                debate, and it has not been dealt with, in my opinion. Sue
                Ramsey said that it is the policy of Sinn Féin to oppose
                fundholding. That has also been the policy of the SDLP from the
                very beginning, as well as the policy of most Members. However,
                the debate is concerned with what will replace the arrangements
                that the Minister has proposed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCarthy said simply that we should get
                this right because it concerns the future of primary care. That
                is it in a nutshell — we must get it right. Mr Billy
                Hutchinson pointed out that the money would go to the boards
                rather than into primary care. He made a valid point regarding
                these funds being taken away from occupational therapists and
                physiotherapists. The boards will use the money in whatever way
                they deem necessary, but there is a lot to be desired of it by
                the community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Monica McWilliams spoke at great length on
                many issues. First, she talked about a period of opportunity to
                move forward and said that in all of this the nurses’ voices
                are not being heard. I have not said that the nurses’ voices
                are not being heard — I have spoken to many community nurses.
                Although I mentioned the Royal College of Nursing and the fact
                that I have spoken to its leadership, I have spoken with
                ordinary nurses as well. We will not move forward if this
                amendment is not accepted; we will move backwards. On behalf of
                the Health, Social Services and Public Safety Committee and
                given my wealth of experience in primary care, I can safely say
                that that would be a backwards move.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Monica McWilliams also talked about building.
                Building on what? If the fundholding and the primary care
                arrangements disappear — and the Minister has not indicated
                that the pilots will stay — what is there to build on? That
                will be a backward move. Most doctors — certainly the younger
                ones — use generic prescribing and therefore save on
                prescriptions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have nothing but the most profound respect
                for community nurses. Most health visitors are employed by
                trusts, but some are employed by fundholders, and they are worth
                their weight in gold.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Robert Coulter said that we needed a
                seamless service. That point has been made over and over again
                by many people in the last few months. As we move along, we
                should remember that John McFall’s ‘Fit for the Future’
                document has been around for a couple of years. That was
                addressed to the Assembly and to the people of Northern Ireland,
                and it seems that its findings are being pushed aside. The
                Minister’s suggestions bear some very vague similarities to
                that document.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Carmel Hanna made the point about being
                against fundholding — which we all are — but she highlighted
                the problems of going back to a failed system. That is exactly
                what would happen on 1 April — we would go back to the 1993
                situation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We all want a first-class primary care
                service. I accept that the Minister wants that — way down the
                line. However, I have already made the point that we have every
                reason to be concerned about the whole transition period. That
                point was certainly not answered.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">John Kelly said that Members were all against
                fundholding, and he also mentioned the deficits. He asked what
                we would be winding down to. I have already made the point that
                we would be going backwards, and I will come to the deficits in
                fundholding shortly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Iris Robinson talked about inequalities and
                the fact that doctors have a choice. That is true, although some
                practices in Northern Ireland might have wanted to go to
                fundholding but were not allowed to. She is quite right,
                however, that others chose not to. The review of acute hospitals
                is coming up shortly, and there is an ongoing review of primary
                care. Those reviews should be interwoven.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Michelle Gildernew said that she wondered why
                the amendment was put forward. That was explained over and over
                again. She asked why fundholding should be propped up. I think
                that she was missing the point there, and she did not suggest
                what might take the place of fundholding.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister’s key point, made again and
                again, concerned the financial aspects of the issue, and the
                perpetuating of inequalities. What she is doing, however, is
                going back. I accept that non-fundholder patients were at a
                disadvantage, and that the majority of patients under
                fundholders — generally speaking — were advantaged. It is
                now being suggested that we move a step backwards to where the
                boards were in control of non-fundholders. Surely we should be
                taking a step forward for everybody in Northern Ireland. I spoke
                of that earlier, as did my Assembly Colleagues who are
                supporting the amendment. That is what it is all about — for
                everyone to move forward. We have heard nice, but vague,
                aspirations for the future, but we have not been told
                specifically what will happen in the transition.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister greatly emphasised the matter of
                overspending, and some Colleagues mentioned it. One should
                understand how fundholding works. When it was first introduced,
                amounts of funding were given to run the practices. If savings
                could be made of, say, £50,000 or £60,000 — not for personal
                gain, but from a practice’s point of view — the board would
                permit the savings to be used to develop that practice. That was
                good — perhaps another clinic could be run, or an extra nurse
                employed. That is fair enough. However, the following year, that
                money is taken off. Each year they are given a smaller budget.
                Any savings gained are taken from them. So, you can see how they
                would get in trouble.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister did not comment on the four
                points I am going to raise on the spending issue. No additional
                money has been given to elective surgery in the last four or
                five years. Therefore, extra demand affects GPs and primary
                care. Elective surgery has been cancelled over and over again in
                hospitals across Northern Ireland. To consider the debate
                sensibly and positively, one must take that point into account
                when talking about fundholding.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second point is that there are fewer
                hospital procedures — meaning operations and other types of
                procedures — with increased, higher-than-inflation costs. That
                puts more demand on primary care. The Minister has tried to
                reduce waiting lists, but only with token money. The main money
                went into acute services, and we understand the reasons why.
                However, that put more pressure on fundholders.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the question of overspend in hospitals,
                the Royal Victoria Hospital was mentioned earlier as having a
                massive overspend. Belfast City Hospital is in the same
                situation. Almost all the hospitals have overspent.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us take the Eastern Health and Social
                Services Board as an example. Let us say that it has a contract
                with a main hospital and things get to the stage where the
                hospital has overspent. The board will then state that no more
                money will be forthcoming. However, GPs are buying per item of
                service — that is not normally the way it is expressed, but
                factually that is what the situation amounts to. Therefore, if
                the hospital is overspent it will use fundholders to bail it
                out.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To look at the problem from another angle, if
                someone presents themselves at hospital with chest pain or with
                acute symptoms of cancer, can a general practitioner tell a
                patient that his budget does not allow for the patient’s care?
                There is no way that that can happen. The Minister did not
                address those points. It was all about pushing at the primary
                care people and it is costing money. The hospitals are costing
                money. The way they are run — by trusts and boards in Northern
                Ireland — is what is costing money.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The acute hospitals review is coming up
                shortly. With respect to acute hospitals, the Health Service is
                in a mess and the situation goes back for many years. Hospitals
                and primary care are interwoven.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister mentioned overspend and she also
                spoke about perpetuating inequalities. I think I have addressed
                those points. There has been chaos in many hospitals, with
                people lying on trolleys. If the amendment is defeated there
                will be chaos in primary care. I do not want those who are
                opposing the amendment, including the Minister, to wash their
                hands and walk away from that responsibility.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Health Service boards have been around
                for years and have been running practices as non-fundholders.
                Have they succeeded? No, they have not, and we are moving
                backwards instead of forwards. This is not a sectarian debate,
                it is one about the future of primary care affecting every man,
                woman and child in Northern Ireland. The proposals are top-down,
                not bottom-up. The Prime Minister and others talked about a
                primary-care-centred Health Service. That is not happening here,
                but was in the ‘Fit for the Future’ document.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister put great emphasis on the point
                that she would give a remit to the boards. However, we know a
                wee bit about remits going to the boards. Remits were made to
                children’s services — we discussed them in the Health
                Committee. I wrote to the Minister about the fact that money
                that should have been ring-fenced was being earmarked for
                children’s services. This is a criticism not of the Minister
                but of the system. In her reply, she said that the applicable
                word was &quot;earmarked&quot;, not &quot;ring-fenced&quot;. If
                the Minister is going to give remits and funding to the boards,
                she may advise them on what they should do, but the boards will
                do what they feel is necessary if their hands are tied
                financially. Most of the money is given to acute hospitals, but
                I will not repeat that point.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister said that pilot schemes are a
                different issue. That is correct in the context of the debate on
                this legislation, but they are very much part of the issue. I
                believed — and most people in primary care believed — that
                the pilot schemes in Northern Ireland were to be the centrepiece
                for a new primary-care-led health service. Therefore they are
                very much part of this discussion. It would have been a positive
                move if the Minister had indicated that the pilot schemes, which
                have had outstanding results, were to be continued.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is not a sectarian debate; it is about
                the future of primary health care. The people of Northern
                Ireland deserve the best — for heaven’s sake, let us give
                them the best.</p>

                </font></b><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During a statement by the First Minister and
                the Deputy First Minister at the Assembly sitting of 22 January
                2001, Mr Ian Paisley Jnr put forward a reason for the
                non-attendance at a meeting of the North/South Ministerial
                Council of the Minister for Regional Development. Mr Paisley
                indicated that the Minister’s non- attendance was in line with
                his election commitment to oppose &quot;North/Southery&quot;.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Subsequently, Mr Maskey raised a point of
                order, asking whether the Minister would be in breach of the
                Pledge of Office by adhering to party manifesto commitments
                rather than to the Pledge of Office. I undertook to give a
                ruling.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ministers are legally bound by the Pledge of
                Office set out in schedule 4 to the Northern Ireland Act 1998.
                Once nominated as Ministers, and having accepted the nomination,
                they must, under section 18(8) of the Northern Ireland Act 1998,
                affirm the Pledge of Office before taking up office. The
                obligations contained in the Pledge of Office are therefore
                legally binding and override any contrary political commitments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I remind the Assembly that to date I am
                unaware of any situation in which a Minister who has been
                nominated to attend a meeting of the North/South Ministerial
                Council has declined to do so. In such circumstances the
                Minister is likely to be in breach of the terms of the Pledge of
                Office. Comments from Members who are not Ministers cannot be
                taken as an indication of a Minister’s intention, irrespective
                of the party affiliations of the Members involved.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I understand that the High Court recently
                ruled on North/South Ministerial Council attendance, and I shall
                be studying this ruling with interest.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, with regard to the remit of the
                Speaker, I should remind the House that, while it is open to any
                Member to challenge a Minister’s alleged failure to attend if
                he or she so wishes, it is not a matter on which the Speaker
                will rule. The move can be made in a number of ways. A Member
                may table an Assembly question, written or oral, to ask the
                Minister about his or her alleged non-attendance and/or his or
                her future intentions; a Member may apply for a judicial review
                for it to be determined whether the Minister’s alleged
                decision not to attend is in conflict with the obligations of
                the Pledge or Office; or a Member may initiate the procedure for
                exclusion provided for in section 30 of the Northern Ireland Act
                1998.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I trust that that clarifies the position.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That this Assembly calls on the Minister of
                Health, Social Services and Public Safety to give due weight to
                the determination of both the Health, Social Services and Public
                Safety Committee and the Northern Ireland Assembly on maternity
                service provision in Belfast in light of the decision of 29
                November 2000 of the High Court.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Maternity service provision has been an
                important issue for some time. The debate on this issue began in
                1994 with the acute hospitals reorganisation project under Dr
                McKenna. Out of that exercise came the 1996 maternity services
                paper, which looked at the two options — location at Belfast
                City Hospital or at the Royal Victoria Hospital, with either
                refurbishment or a new block. The recommendation was that
                maternity services should be located at the tower block of
                Belfast City Hospital for clinical reasons — and I want to
                stress that point, for the clinical arguments have become
                somewhat clouded of late. Those clinical reasons were that the
                key services, namely gynaecology, neonatology and obstetrics —
                and other related services — would be kept together.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This was accepted by the then Health
                Minister, Mr Malcolm Moss, and finalised in 1997. Unfortunately,
                management at the Royal Victoria Hospital adopted a typically
                self-centred and empire-building attitude and raised a row over
                this decision, and the result was that a review was undertaken
                under Liam Donaldson in 1997. From the start, it was evident
                from both the membership of this committee and the fact that its
                remit was widened — after some petty lobbying — that this
                review would reach one conclusion only: location on the Royal
                Victoria Hospital site. Every argument, either fair or foul,
                which could be used to back the Donaldson line has been and is
                being followed, and that has been the difficulty with this issue
                since 1997.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For example, the ridiculous argument has been
                put forward that sick babies would die if maternity services
                were to go to Belfast City Hospital. That allegation is not only
                unfounded, but completely and utterly untenable. If it were
                true, there would be no maternity services in Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Instead of decisions being made on sound,
                logical and clinical grounds, other criteria are being used, and
                the decision to locate maternity services at Belfast City
                Hospital has thus been overturned.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, the flawed nature of that decision
                meant the matter’s being taken to the High Court by Mrs Claire
                Buick, and the court ruled in her favour that the decision had
                been procedurally unfair.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the course of making his ruling, the judge
                quoted Donaldson’s view that on clinical arguments, Dr McKenna
                was right. The judge that said it was &quot;understandable and
                justifiable&quot;. That point also needs to be emphasised,
                because we are given the impression that neither Dr McKenna nor
                anyone else knew what they were talking about. The result was
                yet another consultation exercise that began in July 1999, and
                another report was published — and if ever there was a slanted
                document, this was it. Every possible red herring was dragged
                into it, while obvious issues were ignored. There were
                references to other linkages that were never spelt out. In
                short, it was a cover-up — and an expensive one at that. This
                was a consultation exercise that did not consult. This was a
                document that was short on hard evidence.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was, and remains, extremely disconcerting
                that the entire consultation process was interfered with by
                clinical blackmail. I use those words deliberately. The decision
                by paediatricians to withdraw cover from the City Hospital was a
                deliberate move to coerce the Department and circumvent the
                overwhelming clinical evidence that favoured the City Hospital.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As clinicians have done elsewhere to good
                effect, they demonstrated that the only thing that matters is
                the policy of a clinical group — everyone else can go to pot.
                They wanted the Jubilee closed and decided that the way to
                achieve that was to go on a form of strike.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Following the equally flawed consultation
                process, we were then treated to the rather bizarre situation of
                a new Minister of Health, using all her narrow sectarian bias,
                deciding that maternity services were to go to the Royal
                Victoria Hospital. Unfortunately, it has been a ministerial
                decision that was wrong — clinically, socially, politically
                and legally. The Minister’s decision to close the Jubilee, in
                the face of every rational and clinical argument, has resulted
                in a shambles that has turned our maternity services into what
                could be termed a joke, if it were not so serious.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was a bad decision for our mothers across
                the country — hence the enormous campaign against the closure
                of the Jubilee. The Jubilee philosophy was an enormous benefit
                that has been destroyed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was a bad decision clinically. The
                Minister was unable to furnish a single rational, coherent and
                intelligent clinical argument in favour of her decision.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was a bad decision politically. The Health
                Committee, on which I serve, voted overwhelmingly to retain the
                Jubilee. The Assembly also debated the issue and voted to retain
                the Jubilee. Yet, the Minister of Health, Social Services and
                Public Safety chose to ignore that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, it was a bad decision legally. A
                High Court challenge to her decision rightly followed. That
                demonstrated once again that the decision was flawed. Twice
                there has been a High Court decision on this issue. Each time,
                the Department has been found guilty, though in the recent case
                it was the Minister who was found guilty.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion calls on the Minister, in view of
                the decisions of the Assembly Committee and the Assembly itself,
                to give due weight to the High Court ruling that overturned her
                decision. I remind the Assembly of the need to obey the law, the
                need to give due respect and regard to the Health Committee and
                ultimately to those mothers and clinicians, all of whom argued
                in favour of the City site from the beginning of this process.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a growing body of evidence that this
                Minister has only one objective — to ensure that any service
                that can be relocated to the Royal Group of Hospitals will be
                placed there. It seems that we are going to see the very same
                wrangle over dermatology. I make that statement about the
                Minister on hard evidence. The Minister, in announcing her
                decision on maternity services, said that it was done on the
                best clinical advice. Some questions need to be asked of the
                Department. Where is that advice at present? What was that
                advice? Who gave the advice in the end? All of this remains
                hidden. I challenge the Minister and the Department to give the
                public the information that she and her Department have so far
                refused to divulge. We all wonder why.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is decision-making by fiat, not
                decision-making following the normal rules of clinical,
                democratic and rational debate. Let us not ignore the cost of
                this decision. Forty staff have left the Royal as a result of
                the closure of the Jubilee. Services are continually being
                closed because of staff shortages. The wards are filthy, and
                mothers who are used to the level of care at the Jubilee are
                finding themselves treated increasingly as nothing more than
                clients who are to be moved out as quickly as possible.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some warned not only that the closure of the
                Jubilee would be a disaster but that the short-term decision
                would also become a long-term millstone. Where is this new
                building that was promised? Where is the excellent service that
                was promised?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What we get instead is money slipped into the
                budget of the Royal Victoria Hospital to try to help it out with
                its wild spending spree. We get fobbed off with more and more
                reviews that never seem to come to any conclusions. We get
                public money squandered on bad health decisions that are
                defended in court — public taxes defending the indefensible
                — when it ought to be spent for the benefit of those from whom
                that tax was lifted.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Jubilee should never have been closed.
                The Assembly needs to regain control of the situation to see
                that every step is taken to send all services to the City tower
                block or to see that a new block is built at the City Hospital
                for the right clinical reasons, not for narrow political
                self-interest. The current Minister of Health has become the
                &quot;monster of health&quot;, fully evidenced in her irrational
                decision to close the Jubilee without any firm replacement, in
                the face of every sound argument.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, I want to return to a statement from
                the Belfast City Hospital consultants. They quite clearly say:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;It is our opinion that the evidence
                presented to the Minister was incompetent, clinically unsound
                and biased against the Belfast City Hospital site. The so-called
                advice was produced by a group of people with no relevant
                expertise to enable them to give the advice they did — this is
                one reason why it is clinically unsound.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important that we listen to the words
                of those professional people and the consultants, who know more
                than, possibly, everyone in the Chamber. They also went on to
                say:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;We fail to understand how a Department,
                which has been involved in this process for so long, could have
                proceeded with such a flawed document and tried to pass it as
                clinical advice.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion calls on the Minister to act in
                accordance with the Assembly Health Committee, the Assembly
                itself and, ultimately, with the High Court. I commend it to the
                House.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Birnie:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This morning the Chairperson of the Health
                Committee said that the matter being discussed then should not
                be treated in a sectarian manner. That applies to this debate
                equally. The priority, as all Members in the House would agree,
                is the interests of the baby and the mother. That can and should
                transcend both Unionism and Nationalism, and particular
                constituency interests.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The fact that we are returning to debate this
                motion, which was considered almost exactly a year ago in the
                House, suggests major problems both with the content of the
                Health Minister’s decision and with the manner in which she
                carried out that decision — as ably described by the proposer
                of the motion. The Minister on that occasion managed to override
                both the majority preference of the Health Committee and what
                was shown subsequently to be the majority of opinion in the
                Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Over a century ago a particular Prime
                Minister, Lord Salisbury, said that we should never trust
                experts. In this case, since most of us, including myself, have
                no particular medical expertise, we have had no alternative but
                to listen to the many experts in this field. They have, of
                course, sometimes given conflicting advice. It has to be said
                — I suppose I differ a little from Mr Berry — that strong
                clinical cases were made in favour of both options, which were
                an integration of the services on the site of the Royal Hospital
                or, alternatively, at the Belfast City Hospital location.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should also recognise and pay tribute to
                the high quality of the service previously offered at both the
                Royal Maternity Hospital and the Jubilee, though there were some
                distinctive elements between the two locations in the manner in
                which maternity services were provided.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nevertheless, and notwithstanding all that, I
                considered the so-called expert advice, and I found that the
                most convincing arguments were those which said that maternity
                services should be beside a major centre for women’s health
                care, including cancer, rather than being physically beside a
                children’s hospital. As the proposer noted, that principle was
                recognised in the 1997 McKenna Report. It was not really
                challenged in the subsequent Donaldson study. Indeed, it is
                consistent with practice elsewhere in the United Kingdom.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Both options have their attractions, and
                neither is ideal. However, I believe that the balance lies with
                the City Hospital, because of the likely flow of mothers
                requiring other medical services, as opposed to the probably
                smaller movement of babies between a maternity hospital and the
                Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will conclude with two general points.
                First, Ministers must not be allowed to become feudal lords,
                exercising unaccountable power in their own fiefdoms. The
                outcome of the debate on the Further Consideration Stage of the
                Health and Personal Social Services Bill is perhaps significant
                in this context. Secondly, it is right to give attention to the
                issue of the distribution of maternity services. However, we
                must recognise that the House will have to move on to consider
                what can be done about other medical specialisms and activities,
                which by all reports are facing pressure and are close to
                breaking point.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion. It is a marker, which
                indicates that when the Assembly comes to finalise or approve
                the building of a new integrated, modernised maternity service
                in the city, that it should be on the Belfast City Hospital
                site.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Hanna:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion. One year ago, less a
                day, we were debating the siting of Northern Ireland’s
                regional maternity hospital. We are back debating the same issue
                today. What a waste of time and resources. Is there any point in
                further consultation?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister stated that it was her decision
                that the regional maternity hospital would be located at the
                Royal Victoria Hospital site, adjacent to regional paediatric
                services and near to the accident and emergency department. I
                did not agree with her then, and I do not agree with her now.
                More importantly, the judge in the most recent judicial review
                of the case did not agree with her decision either.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This time, it is essential that there be an
                open and accountable decision-making process. That was not the
                case previously. The judge said that it was somewhat unusual for
                the Department not to create minutes, notes or any other records
                of meetings held with medical, nursing, economic and legal
                advisers. Furthermore, the consultant obstetric staff at the
                Jubilee Maternity Hospital asked to see the clinical evidence
                upon which the Minister made her decision. However, this request
                was refused. The information only came to light in the judicial
                review.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister emphasised that the choice
                between the Royal Victoria Hospital and Belfast City Hospital
                sites was a close one. In the final analysis, she concluded that
                maternity services would be more clinically effective if located
                adjacent to regional paediatric services and the accident and
                emergency department on the Royal Victoria Hospital site.
                Despite the prolonged consultation process, the Minister allowed
                the advocates of the Royal Victoria Hospital site to introduce a
                new factor at the last moment — proximity to accident and
                emergency services. However, those advocating the Belfast City
                Hospital site were not given the same opportunity. The proximity
                of accident and emergency appeared to have perhaps become the
                deciding factor.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, if a woman requires emergency
                admission while pregnant, she does not go to the accident and
                emergency department for treatment. Instead, she goes to the
                early pregnancy unit for specialised care. The proximity or
                otherwise of an accident and emergency department is fairly
                irrelevant.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Central to the Belfast City Hospital’s case
                was the proximity of the majority of gynaecological services and
                gynae-oncology. The Donaldson and McKenna Reports also agreed
                that that was an important factor. That is also the view of the
                Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. However, the
                Department’s advisers did not think that it was a strong
                argument.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There also seemed to be a presumption that
                gynaecological services would eventually go to the Royal site.
                The clinicians in the field — practising obstetricians and
                gynaecologists — believed that proximity to the adult
                intensive care unit was very important for critically ill
                mothers. On the other hand, the Minister’s advisers thought
                that high-dependency beds, which would be in the maternity unit
                on either site, would suffice. The clinicians in the field would
                certainly take issue with that. The latest report by the Royal
                College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists nowhere states that
                paediatric services need to be beside maternity services.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This time last year we had two maternity
                hospitals that were both excellent, though perhaps different in
                ethos. Where do we go from here? We are on a merry-go-round of
                reports, consultations and judicial reviews, which are all
                sucking up funds that should be used for women and babies. This
                time round, I ask the Minister to listen and approach the issue
                with an open mind. We want the best regional maternity services
                for all women and babies.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs I Robinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I commend my Colleague, Mr Berry, for tabling
                this motion down for debate. The decision to close the Jubilee
                ranks as one of the most ill-thought-out decisions a Minister
                has made so far in this Assembly. The High Court decision makes
                very sad reading. In fact, the more I read it, the more amazed I
                am that anyone could have been so blinded as to actually defend
                the closure of the Jubilee.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The judge noted that it is the Minister,
                Barbara Brown, to whom Parliament has entrusted this decision.
                The judge repeated the view that the three key services of
                maternity, neonatology and gynaecology should be kept together,
                that Donaldson had agreed to that, that it was a central issue,
                and, further, that the Department itself had accepted that very
                point, only to come back later on and say that it did not
                consider that it was a strong argument. That demonstrates that
                it knew that it was a very strong argument but, in order to back
                the Minister’s decision, it had to reverse that view and say
                that it was not.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Even more interestingly, it transpired that
                the origin of the idea of separating obstetrics from gynaecology
                came from the Royal in order to justify its intention to have
                maternity on its site. To make matters worse, gynaecology has
                been thrown into confusion as to where it ought to be. Hardly
                good medical practice. The judge put it much better. He said:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The Minister was not informed that the
                process of separately considering the location of maternity and
                gynaecology services had its origin in a decision by the body
                charged with responsibility for overseeing preparation of the
                business case to support the construction of a new maternity
                hospital on the Royal site.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Here we have either a Minister making
                decisions based on half of the facts or a Minister being
                deliberately misled by her Department. What heads have rolled
                over that? Who was responsible for failing to tell the Minister?
                The judge said:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The Minister did not have the relevant
                information to ask and correctly answer the question.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To make matters worse, we have an argument
                based on accident and emergency services thrown into the
                equation. We were told that that was the clinching argument.
                Nowhere else in the world and in no other clinical body of
                evidence has that argument ever been used. However, here we have
                it, and it came from the management of the Royal. When it comes
                to specious arguments, the management of the Royal can do it in
                a style that no one else can. It is no wonder that the judge
                said that</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;the Minister committed the same breach
                of the requirements of procedural fairness&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Royal was allowed to introduce a new
                factor without giving Belfast City Hospital any opportunity to
                consider it. Had the Minister understood what was happening she
                would have immediately thrown it out or extended consultation on
                the point. However, she failed to do that, and we all know why.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Had that been all, it would have been bad
                enough, but what follows is quite extraordinary. A letter about
                maternity services from Dr Hendron on behalf of the Health
                Committee created a frenzy in the Minister’s mind that a
                decision had to be reached as soon as possible. The judge drew
                attention to the &quot;unusual decision&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;not to create notes, minutes or other
                records of the Department’s meetings with the Minister’s
                medical, nursing, economic and legal advisers&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How can that be? What prompted such a
                decision? Could it be that there was information that the
                Minister did not want recorded, knowing full well that her
                decision was suspect, illegal, immoral and clinically unsound?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The judge also ruled against the Department
                on the intensive care unit argument, saying that</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;more reflection might have produced a
                more accurate analysis of this factor&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What a damning indictment of the Minister and
                her entire Department as it scratched around for something —
                anything — that would get the Jubilee closed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Even that is not the end. The judge summed up
                by saying that the Minister</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;did not appreciate the nature of her
                discretion in relation to the linkage between gynaecology and
                maternity services&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister was persuaded</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;by a linkage that was not previously
                featured during the long history of the decision-making
                process&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thus the Minister’s decision was quashed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is imperative that the Minister undo the
                damage that she has inflicted on maternity services. She has
                destroyed the best maternity centre in Belfast — the Jubilee
                — which had a philosophy that is found nowhere else. It was a
                mother’s dream. Mothers had choice and control, but that has
                been taken from them. The Jubilee’s breastfeeding programme
                was the best in the Health Service. Its ethos of childbirth
                ensured that, unlike elsewhere, mothers were mothers and not
                machines. Now nurses are demoralised, staff are leaving by the
                score, and what have we got so far? Nothing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If it were any other Minister or party, I
                would feel confident that the lessons learned from the judicial
                review would allow the proper outcome to be realised: a
                first-class maternity service based at Belfast City Hospital.
                However, given the nature of the individual and the party she
                represents, she will totally disregard the judge’s findings,
                the Health Committee’s majority vote in favour of the Belfast
                City Hospital site and the Assembly’s support for the City. So
                much for a new beginning.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Undoubtedly, the Minister’s party will be
                demanding reinstatement to the &quot;North/Southery&quot;
                following the court decision in its favour today. Likewise, we
                demand that she and her party — in light of the recent
                judicial ruling against her decision — immediately act and
                redress that decision. I support the motion.</p>

                I listened attentively to what Dr Birnie said, and I agree that
                this ought not to become a sectarian or political debate.
                However, when I hear words like &quot;the monster of
                health&quot; being mouthed by a member of the DUP I find it
                difficult to come to any other conclusion than that this is a
                politically motivated debate entertaining a degree of
                sectarianism from that party. I cannot explain in any other way
                why that kind of language, which we are unfortunately too
                familiar with, should be reiterated in the Assembly. I do not
                intend to play sectarianism with the DUP or its representatives
                here today.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is a year since we discussed this matter
                — a year that has been spent in the courts battling over an
                issue that, as I said at the time, Belfast is fortunate to have.
                Coming from a rural constituency where we do not have maternity
                services, or at least we have a very meagre maternity service, I
                find it astounding to see people arguing over the siting of two
                hospitals within kicking distance of one another, and whether
                they should have a maternity service.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The judicial judgement that overturned the
                Minister’s decision was based on the process and not the
                actual decision. I listened to the radio this morning and was
                reminded that Baroness Denton made one decision and Tony
                Worthington made another decision. The Belfast City Hospital
                versus the Royal Victoria Hospital has been kicking about for a
                very long time. Perhaps we thought we had resolved it at last.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We heard talk about the overwhelming majority
                in the Committee, but there was not an overwhelming majority in
                the Committee. The Committee voted 7 to 4. A year ago the
                Committee Chairperson, Dr Joe Hendron, said:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;We are talking about a regional
                hospital service for Northern Ireland: maternity services for
                Belfast, but a regional service for Northern Ireland, and I want
                to put great emphasis on that. If we were just talking about
                Belfast, we could toss a coin between the Royal or the City. But
                we are talking about a regional service for Northern Ireland; we
                are talking about a regional neonatal unit for Northern Ireland
                to care for sick or premature newborn babies; and we are talking
                about a regional paediatric service for Northern Ireland. There
                is only one major regional paediatric hospital in the North of
                Ireland, and it is not my fault if that happens to be in west
                Belfast.&quot;</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To suggest that there was some kind of
                overwhelming unanimity about the location of this hospital is to
                be totally misleading about the debate that ensued over the
                provision of such a critical area in the lives of mothers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To use words like &quot;filth&quot; about the
                Royal Victoria Hospital can only have the most detrimental
                effect on the mothers who go there. It can only have a
                detrimental effect on the people of west Belfast to insinuate,
                comment or make a statement that somehow the Royal Victoria
                Hospital is a second-class service; it is redolent of days that
                we thought were behind us. It is, in many ways, a political
                debate clothed, as usual, in the kind of sick hypocrisy that we
                get from the DUP. I said that I was not going to get involved in
                mixing it with the DUP but unfortunately one is led tentatively
                off the path — c’est la vie.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A LeasCheann Comhairle, I said that this is

                of wrangling and the Minister pledged on taking office that any

                the care of mothers and babies first.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to think that that is still the

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As other Members have done, I remind the
                Assembly that tomorrow it will be one year since we last debated
                this issue. One year on, it seems that little progress, if any,
                has been made towards the creation of a central maternity unit
                joined with a specialised paediatric unit. In fact, we seem to
                be going backwards. Who suffers because of our inaction? Mothers
                and children, of course — and, indeed, fathers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This saga has been going on for at least
                eight years and has been subject to widespread consultations,
                numerous reports, and now several judicial reviews. In a sense,
                the motion is meaningless and superfluous. The Minister cannot
                do anything other than comply with the rulings of the courts
                and, to be fair, she has not indicated that she is going to do
                anything differently. It could be said that the motion is little
                more than a pathetic attempt by the DUP to score political
                points against its opponents — namely, Sinn Féin. If we had a
                DUP Health Minister — and that could have been the case had
                the DUP had the courage to accept the portfolio — would there
                be the same opposition? I very much doubt it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the Alliance Party voted on the issue,
                it sided with the Minister’s decision to relocate maternity
                services to the Royal Victoria Hospital. However, every Member
                of the Assembly labelled Nationalist voted to support the
                Minister, while every Member labelled Unionist voted against the
                Minister. If every debate in the Assembly on major
                socio-economic issues becomes polarised along
                Unionist/Nationalist lines, what kind of —</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. I want
                to put it on the record that, although perceived as a
                Nationalist, I did not support the siting of maternity services
                at the Royal.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCarthy:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I accept the Member’s comments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If every debate in the Assembly on major
                socio- economic issues were to become polarised along Unionist/
                Nationalist lines, what kind of message would we be sending to
                the wider community about how the Assembly is going to conduct
                its business? Fortunately, there was cross-party support this
                morning. That is to the Assembly’s credit.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The original vote on maternity services did
                not have cross-community consensus and could not pass the
                safeguards created under the agreement. If we keep going in this
                way the potential for deadlock is clear. Most issues facing the
                Assembly are about the future. They do not, and should not, have
                anything to do with our ancient tribal squabbles. The health of
                our people must come first, be it our newborn babies or people
                coming to the end of their lives.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In a sense, the debate has now moved on. It
                is now recognised that maternity services have been consolidated
                elsewhere in Northern Ireland. That has to take place in
                Belfast. The Jubilee site is no longer an option for maternity
                services. Indeed, it has been earmarked for a new cancer unit
                for Northern Ireland. I say to the Assembly that the sooner that
                vital facility is in place, the better for everyone.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Notwithstanding the court’s decision on the
                procedures adopted by the Minister, Alliance still believes that
                the Royal Victoria Hospital is the best site for the Belfast and
                regional maternity unit. We are fed up with review after review,
                consultation after consultation, without anything being done to
                improve our health facilities. The main reasons are clinical.
                The existence of a full range of specialised paediatric services
                on the Royal site must be the decisive factor. Maternity
                services can be concentrated in Belfast, adjacent to and
                connected to the Belfast Hospital for Sick Children. Expert
                opinion suggests that maternity, neonatal and paediatric
                services should, ideally, be located on one site. A panel of
                independent experts, led by Prof Liam Donaldson, suggested that
                course of action. I take exception to the accusation made
                earlier that the outcome of their deliberations was
                predetermined.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For 90% of women, pregnancy is relatively
                straightforward. Significant problems arise in about 10% of
                pregnancies. One to 3 per cent of babies require neonatal
                intensive care. When complications arise, speed is of the
                essence. Transport from other hospitals not only adds time, but
                can create further complications.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Not every woman will give birth at the Royal,
                but surely it makes sense to maximise the number of births by
                providing easy access to specialised paediatrics? The United
                Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child states that
                decisions affecting children should be taken with their best
                interests at heart. That is central to our thinking when
                advocating a children’s commissioner for Northern Ireland, as
                my Alliance Colleagues here will be doing later. Women require a
                service in which they feel safe and in control. Regional and
                national policy guidance for maternity and related services
                emphasises the need for woman-centred care, continuity of care
                and the provision of choice. A full range of gynaecology
                services can be found on the Royal sites. The Royal Maternity
                Hospital has the appropriate woman-centred service. It should
                therefore be possible to create on the Royal site a specialised
                maternity unit linked to paediatrics. I understand that the main
                reason for granting a judicial review of the Minister’s
                decision was the failure to consult adequately with respect to
                gynaecological services. However, the point was missed that such
                services were available on both the Royal and the City sites.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, there are some non-medical reasons
                for supporting the Royal Victoria Hospital. One is its
                relatively easy access to the road network. That, as has already
                been mentioned, is very important indeed. Another is the
                provision of parking. Policy appraisal and fair treatment (PAFT)
                analysis also suggests that the Royal option would increase the
                prospect of antenatal appointments being kept by women from
                deprived areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I must express disappointment at some of the
                phrases used and accusations made by Mr Berry, who moved the
                motion. In view of my party’s earlier stance on that
                provision, we cannot support the motion and will abstain. We
                must be realistic. The Jubilee Maternity Hospital is no more.
                The new provision on the Royal site must go ahead. No more
                time-wasting — action is needed now.</p>

                the merger should not happen until we had a new purpose-built
                hospital, not solely for the women of Belfast, but a regional
                hospital with a neonatal unit. I remain very concerned.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not want to go over the arguments that I
                put to the Minister at Question Time two weeks ago, but it is
                important that we keep in mind that the process needs to be
                moved forward rapidly. There is overcrowding. Six thousand
                mothers and babies have been put into an old hospital, whose
                chief executive would agree that refurbishing it in order to
                bring it up to the standard for accommodating such numbers was
                all that was done. He was never in favour of it being a
                permanent solution. From speaking to him and his counterpart in
                the City Hospital, I know that they want a decision to be made
                on the siting of a new hospital.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Uncertainty creates many morale problems and
                there is an issue of morale attached to this decision at the
                moment. Having visited Ward D in the Royal Victoria Hospital, I
                never believed I would see such conditions. I gave birth myself
                in that hospital many years ago. The present conditions do not
                reflect the dedication of the wonderful midwives; they reflect
                the standards under which these people have to work. There used
                to be 17 beds. There are now 15 beds sitting alongside each
                other. There was no room to move. The beds were along the middle
                of the ward and there was one bathroom. I saw that for myself
                and it cannot be disputed. I have since been told that the
                midwives have to tear up blankets in order to have enough for
                the newborn babies. This is a new century, and no mother should
                have to watch that going on in a ward.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I remain deeply concerned that unless we move
                forward on this issue all we are doing is overburdening and
                stressing an already demoralised staff. We do not need a lengthy
                consultation process because many of the arguments are already
                there.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members have reiterated the arguments on
                paediatrics versus gynaecology and obstetrics. Unfortunately it
                seems that the paediatricians had a very strong voice in the
                last consultations. One of the senior midwives tells me that
                they have visited brand-new, purpose-built maternity hospitals
                elsewhere in the UK and it is not the case that they have been
                located next to a paediatric unit. Consultants tell me that it
                is dangerous to move a sick baby. They say that one should
                stabilise the baby’s condition and then carry out whatever
                surgery is necessary. They say that it is much more dangerous to
                move a sick mother and that intensive care facilities should
                always be where the mother is, particularly if urgent
                gynaecological surgery is required.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to pay tribute, as my younger sister
                almost died as a consequence of needing an urgent gynaecological
                operation, which was carried out speedily because the intensive
                care facility was close to the gynaecological ward. The evidence
                continues to point to the fact that gynaecology and obstetrics
                should remain close to mothers and the maternity unit.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not want this to be a debate about
                buildings; it needs to be about mothers and babies in Northern
                Ireland and their needs. The development has already gone ahead.
                Any location on the Royal Hospital site would not be close to
                the intensive care facilities and urgent transfers would have to
                be made across considerable distances. None of us wish to see
                fatalities rising as a consequence, particularly those during
                pregnancy, when we have done such wonderful work in reducing the
                numbers of deaths during childbirth.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have heard from the oncologists — and
                there cannot be anything worse than being told that one has a
                gynaecological-related cancer problem and that treatment will be
                given at different sites. A leading consultant in Northern
                Ireland on gynaecology was asked whether it would be possible to
                provide the same quality of service to patients if all
                gynaecological surgery were to be performed on the Royal
                Victoria site rather than the City Hospital site. His answer was
                an emphatic &quot;No&quot;. He said that such patients need
                efficient and fast treatment from a physical and psychological
                point of view. He added that a move from the City Hospital to
                the Royal Hospital would be a retrograde step.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We heard a great deal about a &quot;seamless
                service&quot; in the debate on the Further Consideration Stage
                of the Health and Personal Social Services Bill. The plea is
                being made here for a current seamless service, which would not
                be obtainable if the two units were to be separate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I introduce that because when the project
                board sat down to look at maternity services, it found the issue
                of gynaecology so difficult that it left it for a future date.
                However, we cannot do that. All of us know and understand that
                if you need surgery, you should try to have as many of the
                people who are involved in those decisions as possible located
                on the same site.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are talking about a women’s hospital.
                Let us not concentrate on the small number of babies who are
                sick but on the large number of women who give birth under
                normal circumstances and whose outcomes are predictable. It is
                clearly the case that there are a number of unpredictable
                outcomes in relation to pregnancy, and that is when you need
                neonatal services to be at their best. I remain concerned about
                the neonatal services at the moment, having been told that they
                were closed to outside admissions on three occasions in
                December. One woman was transferred to the Royal Victoria
                Hospital from another hospital on Christmas Eve. There were
                insufficient cots, and so she had to be moved again to the
                Craigavon neonatal unit. That is not good for our regional
                neonatal services, as they are being told that they are simply
                taking the overload. Why can they not take women with babies at
                other times of the year? We are sending very bad messages to the
                regional services outside the centre, which is supposed to be
                the centre of excellence.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is no reflection on those working in the
                Health Service. It is because we do not have sufficient neonatal
                nurses. They are having to try to be innovative in the way that
                they deal with very sick babies in the intensive care unit at
                the moment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Medical negligence cases remain an awful
                issue. Let us not have a Health Service that has to pay out huge
                sums of money for medical negligence. We saw in the budget for
                health and personal social services last year that over £3
                million was paid out. Let us be forwardthinking and try to plan
                for these emergencies so that we have services in place where
                surgery can take place effectively and efficiently.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Carmel Hanna has already outlined the
                issue of accident and emergency departments. It was extremely
                unfortunate that this was brought in as a separate issue and, as
                the judicial review pointed out, a rather irrelevant issue in
                the end. The consultants make the point that since accident and
                emergency has remained on the City Hospital site, and since
                gynaecology services are also located on that site, we should
                integrate and co-ordinate them, and that it would be a disaster
                if we were to create isolated units elsewhere.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another question is the biased and
                non-independent nature, not of the consultations but, initially,
                of the project board. If another one is ever established, it
                needs to be independent. There were three representatives from
                the City Hospital and nine representatives from the Royal
                Victoria Hospital, and it was chaired by the chief executive of
                the Royal Victoria Hospital. I am not at all disparaging of the
                roles of professionals in the Health Service. All I am
                suggesting is that there is a conflict of interest if you are
                the chief executive of one hospital and are attempting to make a
                decision on any site, move or merger. You cannot possibly be
                asked to do that if you are simultaneously putting in a business
                case for that to be on your own site. It is unfair to ask anyone
                to chair such a board and try to remain independent at the same
                time, never mind the fact that the numbers speak for themselves.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have had the mistakes. Let us address
                them. They say that the meaning of silliness is to do more of
                the same and expect a different outcome. We cannot afford to do
                more of the same.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The other question is how much the judicial
                review of the Buick case and the more recent Hindes case cost.
                The figures are not based on any empirical evidence — I have
                asked those questions and am awaiting an answer. We know that it
                is expensive to take cases through the courts — those cases
                cost over £1 million. I am still waiting for a response from
                the Department. The Chairperson can confirm that when officials
                from the Department came to address us over a month ago, I asked
                for the figures. How often have we been taken to judicial
                review? We should not be letting the courts make these
                decisions. We should be attempting to be independent and basing
                decisions on clinical evidence and evidence from women, women’s
                groups, community groups, midwives and many others who are
                working at grass-roots level in the Health Service.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not just making a plea for an integrated
                service, which is the most important priority. We also need to
                avoid following the project team’s suggestion of separating
                pre-natal gynaecological services from post-natal services. That
                cannot be allowed to happen, because many gynaecological matters
                must be dealt with together. During the training of specialist
                surgeons in this field, no distinction is made between pre-natal
                and post-natal patients. Their expertise is derived from their
                experience in dealing with problems right across the spectrum.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When I read the judicial review I was also
                concerned about the breach of the need to be fair. This is a
                fairly damning indictment, and the issue must be addressed.
                There were neither notes, minutes nor records kept of crucial
                meetings. When we got devolution we promised that we would be
                accountable and transparent. Without transparency, how can we
                expect action groups to be well-informed? We need women to be
                active in our constituencies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, we should move quickly down this
                road, because the issue does not just affect Belfast City
                Hospital and the Royal Victoria Hospital. It has implications
                for the Mater Hospital, Lagan Valley Hospital, the Downe
                Hospital and the Ulster Hospital as well. In response to Mr
                McCarthy’s final points, I must say that the vote should not
                have been described as being split between Nationalists and
                Unionists. I also voted in the Lobby, as I did on the Committee,
                for the Jubilee to remain open, yet Members know that I am from
                the Catholic community and am so perceived. It is time to move
                forward on this issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will be concerned if the private finance
                initiative is to play a predominant part in this
                decision-making. As Members know, on previous occasions I have
                spoken out about introducing private finance into the National
                Health Service. If that is to be a part of the decision on a new
                maternity unit, I would like a debate on the matter to take
                place now rather than at the very last stage.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Carson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a representative of a rural constituency
                without a maternity service, I support the motion, which calls
                for the retention of, or improvement work on, maternity services
                in Belfast. It should be carefully noted by the Minister, since
                the issue of Belfast’s maternity services will not go away
                until it is addressed in a consistent manner. Northern Ireland
                and Belfast need a good maternity hospital. The saga of
                maternity service provision in Belfast will continue following
                the Minister’s decision to issue a directive in favour of the
                Royal Victoria Hospital and her claim that the decision was her
                prerogative, which she said could not be challenged. This
                decision flew in the face of the recommendation of the Health
                Committee, which favoured the Belfast City Hospital as a site
                for the maternity hospital. The decision also highlighted the
                derisive way in which the Committee was treated by the Minister.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, it transpired that the Minister’s
                prerogative could be challenged in the High Court. I am not
                surprised by the Department’s and the Minister’s shabby
                treatment of Belfast’s maternity services, for my area of
                South Tyrone has also been treated shoddily on this subject. My
                constituents in Fermanagh and South Tyrone received countless
                promises that the removal of services was merely temporary, yet
                every single promise to restore services was broken.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">South Tyrone Hospital was promised a
                midwifery-led service, and it is still waiting for it. The
                Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety has
                failed to address this very important part of the Health Service
                quickly, and this failing must be addressed immediately. The
                Department and the Minister are failing in their duty to ensure
                the equality of treatment envisaged in section 75 and
                schedule&nbsp;9 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.00 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The relationship between the Department, the
                health boards and the trusts is called into question — it has
                always been rather too convenient in the past to keep passing
                the buck. The Minister must take responsibility for the failure
                to provide adequate maternity services for the people of
                Northern Ireland, in the Belfast area and, particularly, in my
                area of South Tyrone. I would welcome the return of maternity
                services there.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This sorry affair of the problems of the
                Belfast maternity service is merely the tip of the iceberg, and
                it must be resolved quickly. This is too important an issue for
                the Minister to make a decision on it without referring to her
                Committee, the Executive and the Assembly. She and her
                Department are not infallible. I support the motion.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I call Dr Hendron, who, I think, will be
                speaking as a Back-Bencher rather than as Chairperson of the
                Health Committee. Is that correct?</p>
                <b>

                Speaker.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, I apologise for not being here for the
                beginning of the debate. I understand and respect the motion put
                forward by Mr Berry. I have spoken on this subject on many
                occasions in the Chamber, in the House of Commons and in other
                places over the last few years. I have not had an opportunity to
                study the judgement that this debate is really about.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This debate is a very important one, and the
                matter should have been resolved long ago. People talk about
                empire-building, and I do not want to point the finger at any
                one person or hospital. However, the senior staff of the Royal
                Maternity and City Hospitals could have had this resolved years
                ago. Nevertheless, as this important matter will be coming
                before the Health Committee, I shall make no further comment
                until then.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Ramsey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, Mr Deputy Speaker. Dr
                Hendron has caught me unawares — he was so quick. I was trying
                to concentrate on the next debate. I am getting a beating for
                this morning, Joe!</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The decision on the site for a new hospital
                for women and babies throughout the North has been due for a
                number of years, and the building of a new site will delay that
                decision. As a member of the Health Committee who voted in
                favour of the Royal Victoria Hospital, I believe that my
                decision then was the right one, and I uphold it. I based that
                decision on much evidence mentioned earlier today but also on
                presentations from a number of groups, in particular those from
                the Shankill Women’s Centre and the Falls Women’s Centre.
                They all pointed to the need for proper maternity services, and
                they indicated that the Royal was the best option.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister made her decision based on what
                were the best options for parents and babies and on the clinical
                evidence which was presented to her. I would like to point out
                that the judicial review and the judgement were based on the
                consultation process and not on the decision on where maternity
                services should be placed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After taking up her role in the Department,
                the Minister visited both the Royal and the Jubilee. We must
                give her credit for the consultation process she was involved
                in, because she did speak with interested parties herself.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A Member spoke earlier about the report and
                the recommendations from Dr McKenna and Prof Donaldson. It was
                pointed out that this acute hospital reorganisation project,
                which was set up in 1994, and headed by Dr McKenna, made 28
                recommendations, 27 of which were accepted by both the City
                Hospital and the Royal. A second report was commissioned,
                chaired by Prof Donaldson, and he concluded that to provide the
                best possible services, maternity and paediatric centres should
                be side by side.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Mrs Carson and John Kelly pointed out, we
                need to emphasise that this is the new regional maternity centre
                for everyone. We are talking about hospitals whose sites are
                1·5 miles apart, and rural people do not have such a luxury.
                Not all Committee members endorsed the recommendations; the vote
                was 7-4.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members have already spoken about confusion
                in the Health Service. This ongoing saga of maternity services
                in Belfast has added more confusion, not only to the staff but
                also to mothers and babies and families. As Monica McWilliams
                said, this comment is not intended as an attack on staff. Staff
                should be spoken of highly and congratulated at every
                opportunity for the work they do in maternity services.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I ask the Minister to take on board not only
                the views of the Assembly and the Health Committee but those of
                everyone involved in the consultation exercise. I am confident

                rinne Mr Berry tagairt dó sin nuair a bhí sé ag moladh an
                rúin.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nuair a rinne mé an cinneadh ní raibh ar m’aird
                ach leas na mban, na máithreacha agus na leanaí. Tuigim go
                maith an tábhacht a bhaineann leis an chinneadh seo a dhéanamh
                mar is ceart. Tá an t-ospidéal máithreachais cónasctha

                seo a rinne mé i mí Eanáir seo caite gan machnamh a bheith
                déanta agam ina leith.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is é a bhí ar intinn agam mo chinneadh a
                bhunú go daingean ar bhreithniú cúramach gairmiúil ar gach
                — gach — eolas cuí. Agus mé ag cuimhneamh air seo, bhain

                den bhabhta mór comhairliúcháin a rinneadh i bhfómhar na

                ábhar faoi mo bhráid agus labhair mé leo; agus thug mé
                cuairt ar an dá ospidéal.</p>

                bhreithmheas eacnamaíocha a coimisiúnaíodh go speisialta;
                agus bhain mé leas as a lán anailíse agus comhairle
                gairmiúla mionchruinne ó mo Roinn féin. I ndeireadh na dála,
                bhí sé de bhuntáiste agam go bhfuair mé comhairle ón
                Choiste Sláinte, Seirbhísí Sóisialta agus Sábháilteachta
                Poiblí a tháinig le chéile dhá uair i mí Eanáir le freagra
                a ullmhú ar iarratas uaim go gcuirfeadh sé a thuairimí ar an
                bhealach chun tosaigh faoi mo bhráid.</p>

                — eolas a bhí ar fáil agam agus mé ag teacht ar an
                chinneadh a rinne mé. Is í sin an fhreagracht atá orm mar
                Aire. I ndeireadh na dála is é a bhí mar threoir agam nuair a
                rinne mé an cinneadh measúnú eolach a bheith déanta agam ar
                cad é ba sábháilte agus a b’fhearr do mháithreacha agus do
                leanaí.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I need not remind Members that this issue has
                been running unresolved for a number of years. Indeed, it
                predates the establishment of the Assembly, and Mr Berry made
                reference to its being a long saga during his opening speech. In
                taking this decision, my sole focus was the welfare of women,
                mothers and babies. I well understand the importance of getting
                this decision right. The combined maternity hospital is vital
                for Belfast and as the regional maternity centre for the North
                as a whole. When I made this decision in January of last year I
                did not make it lightly. My intention was to firmly ground my
                decision on a careful and professional consideration of all the
                relevant information. With that in mind, I drew on the detailed
                responses to the major consultation exercise undertaken in
                autumn 1999 — an exercise that was completed before I took
                office as Minister.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I met the main support groups for both
                maternity units; I received presentations from, and spoke to,
                the staff of the two trusts; and I visited both hospitals. I
                also took careful account of the findings of an independent
                policy appraisal and fair treatment (PAFT) analysis. I
                considered two specially commissioned economic appraisals, and I
                had the benefit of a great deal of detailed, professional
                analysis and advice from my Department.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, I had the advantage of the advice of
                the Health, Social Services and Public Safety Committee. The
                Committee met twice in January 2000 to draw together a response
                to my request for its views on the way forward in that year. We
                agreed that a decision was urgently needed; we agreed that a new
                maternity hospital was required, rather than a refurbished one;
                and we agreed that, in the interim, the only practical option
                was to combine maternity services at the Royal. We also agreed
                that the interim solution must not become the final solution.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The location of the new hospital was the one
                significant area in which there was disagreement. The Committee
                advised me that it could not reach a consensus view, but it
                reported a majority vote in favour of the Belfast City Hospital
                site. In reaching my decision, I measured and weighed all the
                available information — that is my responsibility as Minister.
                In the final analysis, my decision was guided by my informed
                assessment of what was safest and best for mothers and babies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Immediately following my decision, the Royal
                Group of Hospitals began work on a business case for a new
                maternity hospital on the Royal Victoria Hospital site. The
                trust had intended to bring its outline business case to the
                Department by the end of this month — January 2001 — but,
                following the court’s ruling, work on this has been suspended.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When an issue such as this ends up in court,
                it is inevitable that plans will fall behind schedule and that
                there will be delays. In the debate today, Members have
                repeatedly spoken of the delay. I appreciate the problems
                arising from the continuing uncertainty over the location of the
                new maternity hospital, and I want to take this important
                development forward as quickly as possible. That is why, on 18
                January, I announced that I have initiated work on the
                preparation of a further consultation process to help me bring
                about the required new maternity hospital, and, once again, I
                will be guided by what is best for women, mothers and babies. I
                have asked that this work be taken forward as a matter of
                urgency, with a view to getting further consultation under way
                in the spring.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have some reservations about the basis of
                the judgement that overturned my decision, and I have thought
                long and hard about taking this matter to appeal. I am, however,
                particularly concerned, as are those who spoke today, about
                there being further unnecessary delay in developing the new
                maternity hospital, and I have concluded that to appeal that
                court ruling would not be in the best interests of those who
                rely on these services. I accept the advice given by Members in
                this debate that a new maternity hospital is needed soon. It is
                my responsibility, as Minister, to take this matter to a
                successful conclusion, and that is what I intend to do. That is
                important.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It has been suggested during the debate that
                the letter from the Committee to me in January 2000 led me to
                make an early decision. However, the need for an early decision
                had already been signalled well in advance of the letter.
                Everybody I met, including the Health, Social Services and
                Public Safety Committee, pressed me for an early decision. There
                is also a suggestion that the gynaecology issue has been driven
                by a decision of the Royal Victoria Hospital committee. That was
                not the case, as was made clear in the course of the judicial
                review. The decision to separate gynaecology had been taken by a
                previous Minister.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The separation of obstetrics and gynaecology
                was also raised. There was talk of the separation of pre- and
                post-pregnancy gynaecology and references to the proximity to
                intensive care and the factor of accident and emergency. In
                essence, obstetrics and gynaecology, although provided by the
                same individuals, are provided to largely separate groups of
                women. Gynaecology services are provided to women when not
                pregnant — or during the early stages of pregnancy — and
                obstetric services are provided to women who are pregnant.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Regarding the reference to separate
                populations of non-pregnant women, some will never become
                pregnant but may require gynaecology services. Others may
                require post-pregnancy treatment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As regards the proximity to intensive care,
                both sites have access to that and this factor could not weigh
                in favour of either. With high-dependency beds in a combined
                maternity unit, it is thought that very few women would require
                an intensive care bed.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms McWilliams:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Minister agree that the point about
                high-dependency beds was raised during the judicial review? A
                distinction was made between a high-dependency unit and an
                intensive care unit. The judge argued that there had been a
                slight bias in the Department suggesting that a better option
                might be put forward and, indeed, that a high-dependency unit
                could have been provided on either site. The judge suggested
                that, with the use of the word &quot;better&quot;, there was a
                bias and we would be better concentrating our attentions on the
                potential of some women dying, even though it is a small number.
                Hence the requirement for intensive care as opposed to
                high-dependency care.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms de Brún:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As both sites have access to intensive care
                services, and will therefore be able to cater for people who
                need those services, the factor could not weigh in favour of one
                site or the other. The high-dependency beds in a combined
                maternity unit would be able to cater for the larger number of
                women who would not need access to intensive care services.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the question of the new factor of accident
                and emergency, I am committed to real consultation and I do
                expect that issues will arise out of the process. The suggestion
                that accident and emergency was the overriding factor, as
                opposed to just being a factor, is not correct. Its inclusion
                reflected that it was a factor and that it could make a
                difference to some women.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A significant number of serious conditions in
                early pregnancy, particularly ectopic pregnancy, may give rise
                to problems before a woman is aware that she is pregnant. Many
                women will present at an accident and emergency unit and not an
                early pregnancy clinic.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The link between gynaecology and oncology is
                important, as are other linkages. The care of women with cancer
                involves urgent, but planned, treatment in the main, involving
                multidisciplinary teams. These cases are quite different from
                the emerging gynaecology cases that are presenting through the
                accident and emergency department and coming in as emergency
                gynaecology cases.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As regards the urgency of maternal versus
                neonatal conditions, the availability of relevant expertise and
                facilities for mothers differs little between the two sites. The
                availability of the relevant expertise and facilities for sick
                newborns, however, differs significantly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the withdrawal of neonatal
                services by paediatricians, the neonatal service at the Jubilee
                was inspected by the relevant Royal College, which determined
                that the service was not suitable for training junior medical
                staff, thus rendering it non-viable. That drove the change. It
                was not and cannot be for me as Minister to challenge the
                clinical advice of the Royal College.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms McWilliams:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Surely that same decision could have applied
                to the Mater and to many other hospitals. We do not have a new
                maternity hospital, and it might have been expensive in the
                interim to pay for the extra services to be placed at the
                Jubilee, but surely that would have been a better solution than
                closing the Jubilee at that stage.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Had the Minister finished?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms de Brún:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No. I gave way to Prof McWilliams on that
                point.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the Royal College’s decision
                at that particular time, Prof McWilliams will be aware that,
                following that inspection, the Belfast City Hospital made
                significant efforts to make good the difficulties that had
                arisen and to overcome the points raised, and was not able to do
                so. Had it been able to do so, there might have been a different
                outcome.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As regards the question of private finance,
                as with any major capital development, the first stage is the
                submission of a business case for approval by the Department of
                Health, Social Services and Public Safety and the Department of
                Finance and Personnel. I have already dealt with what has
                happened with that in the interim.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a comprehensive business case
                approval process in place that ensures, as is demanded in this
                case, that there is no presumption that private provision is
                better than public or vice versa. Objective assessment of all
                available options is required. Any agreement for the building of
                a new hospital will be subject to this process.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In setting in motion a new consultation
                process, it is important that I state publicly for the record
                that I am approaching this issue with an open mind. I will
                approach this decision as I would any other: in a totally
                professional manner. I am determined that the new process should
                be both open and transparent. It must take careful account of
                the legitimate concerns of all those with an interest in this
                development.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With that in mind, the team developing the
                new consultation process is arranging to meet the interested
                parties in the coming weeks to listen to their views and ideas
                on how the consultation should be carried out. My intention is
                to issue a fresh consultation document in the spring. This
                document will provide an opportunity for all those with an
                interest in this matter to register their views and contribute
                to the shaping and development of the new service.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of course, the process will be the subject of
                detailed equality proofing in accordance with the current
                legislation. In taking this matter forward, I am more than happy

                and Public Safety Committee and to the Assembly itself,
                alongside all the other inputs that, as Minister, I must
                consider.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In summary, my aim is to arrive at a decision
                that will provide the best and most sustainable maternity
                service for the women, mothers, and babies of Belfast and the
                North in the years to come. I am sure that Members here today

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Berry:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This has been an interesting debate on a
                serious issue. Members raised many points and issues. One of the
                first Members to speak, Dr Esmond Birnie, made a good point. He
                said that the mother’s interest and well-being was most
                important. We all agree with that. That is why I proposed the
                motion. I did not do it on a political basis, which some have
                accused me of, but for mothers’ interests right across this
                country and because of the seriousness of the issue. The
                well-being of mothers is certainly not advanced if 40 staff have
                left the Royal Victoria Hospital and services continue to close
                because of this decision. Mothers, children and babies are not
                being dealt with properly. Ms Carmel Hanna, who supports the
                motion, clearly said that, at times, it has been a waste of the
                consultation period. We can all recall the hours that the Health
                Committee spent debating this issue. Many good points and
                arguments were put forward.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, I want to remind Members across the
                Chamber that a majority on the Health Committee voted in favour
                of siting maternity services at the Belfast City Hospital. It
                was not a one-party issue. Some Members, particularly Mr
                McCarthy from the Alliance Party, said that it was a
                Unionist/Nationalist argument. Carmel Hanna and Monica
                McWilliams said that that was not the case. Perhaps it would be
                worthwhile to remind Members that Ulster Unionist, DUP, SDLP and
                Women’s Coalition party members all voted in favour of the
                Belfast City Hospital site. Those Members who said that it was a
                Unionist/Nationalist argument were totally and utterly wrong.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Carmel Hanna said, the new process must be
                completely open and accountable. Members such as Mrs Robinson
                asked why there were no notes or minutes concerning this
                decision. What are the Minister and the Department trying to
                hide? The Department, and the Minister in particular, will have
                to answer these questions, because she did not answer the
                questions raised in the Chamber today. Mrs Robinson said that
                the decision was suspect, immoral and clinically unsound. Those
                who support the Belfast City Hospital site stand by that
                conclusion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the most interesting statements came
                from IRA/Sinn Féin Member Mr John Kelly. He said that I should
                not have said that there was a &quot;monster of health&quot;
                instead of a Minister of Health. I stand by those words. I would
                have so called any Minister who had made that decision. It came
                across quite clearly that some of these Sinn Féin/IRA Members

                the use of the word &quot;monster&quot; to depict another

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It came across clearly in the Health
                Committee and in today’s debate that Sinn Féin/IRA Members
                are nothing but glorified spokespersons for the Department of
                Health, Social Services and Public Safety. On every decision
                made, they jump behind their Minister and say &quot;Yes,
                Minister. No, Minister.&quot; It has come across quite clearly
                time and time again.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr John Kelly, the Sinn Féin/IRA
                spokesperson, was concerned that I raised the serious matter of
                filth in the Royal Victoria Hospital’s corridors. That comment
                did not come from me; it came from the nurses who are working in
                the Royal Victoria Hospital. I will give you an example.</p>

                the Member had intended to quote from some source, he should
                have named the source in the course of his address. He should

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I cannot accept that point of order. As the
                Member is making his winding-up speech he is entitled to make a

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For security reasons I will not give
                information about the source, especially as it concerns the
                Royal Victoria Hospital. We are all well aware of what happened
                to my Colleague Mr Dodds and his children while in the Royal
                Victoria Hospital.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will return to what I said about the filth
                in the Royal Victoria Hospital — I would say the same about
                other hospitals across the country if they were in a similar
                situation. Only last week a nurse informed me that a patient had
                vomited on the hospital corridor and that the vomit lay there
                until it was caked into the floor. I am not blaming the nurses
                or the medical staff, for I know they are under extreme
                pressure, but more must be done to deal with this problem. Those
                matters must be addressed and taken up with the Royal Victoria
                Hospital.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Once again, Mr Kieran McCarthy talked about
                the Nationalist/Unionist agenda and the arguments that were put
                forward. I spoke about that earlier and about the representation
                that was on the Committee at that time. Ms McWilliams said that
                decisions must be made as soon as possible. I agree, as, I am
                sure, do the majority of Members. Low morale is a great problem
                in both hospitals at present, and that must also be addressed.
                There are great pressures on the staff.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Joan Carson talked about the treatment of the
                Health Committee at the time the decision was made. I again
                state that the majority of the members of the Health Committee
                felt betrayed by the Department when the decision was made.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have not heard the Minister say anything
                beneficial to this debate today. Her decision was bad for
                mothers and was bad clinically. The Minister is still unable to
                furnish a single rational, coherent and intelligent clinical
                argument in favour of her decision. It was bad politically, as
                the Health Committee and the Assembly voted for the Jubilee to
                remain open and for the maternity services to remain at the
                Belfast City Hospital. It was bad legally, because the High
                Court challenge on the Minister’s decision, which rightly
                followed, demonstrated again that it was a flawed decision.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have one firm conclusion today, and I will
                state it again. The Jubilee should never have been closed. The
                Assembly needs to take every step to regain control of the
                situation. This is a very important situation and it is not a
                political situation in the way it has been accused of being
                today. I tabled the motion today for the well-being of all
                mothers across the country, and I trust that every Member will
                support it.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important to look at the historical
                background to the motion. Over many years, serious allegations
                have been made that members of the Garda Síochána have
                actively colluded with Republicans, particularly Republicans in
                the Provisional IRA. Evidence of that is emerging from books by
                respected journalists, Northern Ireland authors and individuals
                living in areas in which incidents such as the murder of RUC
                officers — many high-ranking — and the attempted murder of
                RUC, RIR and UDR officers have occurred. There has also been the
                murder and attempted murder of officials of the Northern Ireland
                judiciary system and private individuals. Those collusion
                allegations will not go away until they are properly dealt with.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not want to individualise cases. That
                would be improper given the heartfelt cases involved, and it
                would rekindle the pain felt by many families. I am not
                interested in politicising items of this nature. Those events
                have taken place, and they must be investigated.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is clear that incidents of this nature
                could not have taken place without the involvement of Garda
                Síochána officers at some time. There is very clear evidence
                that garda stations in the north County Louth area and their
                operational material were used to pinpoint the movements of RUC
                officers, security personnel, officials of the Northern Ireland
                judiciary system and individuals, which ultimately led to their
                murder.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important to state the necessity to
                hold an inquiry into the activities of rogue garda officers who
                have stained the reputation of that force. I am not making a
                call for the abolition of the Garda Síochána. I want to place
                on record that I recognise the attempts made by garda officers
                at local level to help and assist the RUC and the security
                forces with murder inquiries and other investigations and
                incidents. Had it not been for political interference by
                Government people in Dublin, there might have been more success
                over the years in getting information on many of these
                incidents. I know from personal experience about the willingness
                of garda officers and their dedicated attempts to eradicate IRA
                terrorism in the border area. Those attempts failed to get
                proper political support from the Governments of the day.
                Successive Dublin Governments and Irish politicians, at the very
                highest level, have much to answer for. With the recent release
                of cabinet papers in relation to the arms trial, we saw that
                very prominent senior politicians in the Republic had been
                involved in the establishment, arming and funding of the
                Provisional IRA. Arms were procured, and Republicans were made
                ready to wage war on the Unionist people of Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We might usefully ask for an independent
                inquiry into that disgraceful chapter of Irish history. Of
                course, I, amongst others, remain completely astonished at the
                hypocrisy of the Irish Government and Irish Government Ministers
                in their unending demands for public inquiries into events that
                have taken place in Northern Ireland. I think they should clean
                their own barrel out in relation to events of this nature
                instead of insisting and ordering public inquiries into the
                affairs of another jurisdiction — this part of the United
                Kingdom.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is clear that internal inquiries conducted
                by garda officers, who would, after all, be investigating their
                colleagues, will not satisfy public opinion, especially in
                Northern Ireland, particularly in the border areas. Therefore, I
                believe that this Assembly should call for a full-scale,
                independent and international commission to investigate these
                matters on an open, impartial and transparent basis. Let us have
                the truth — warts and all.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It appears that corruption is almost a way of
                life in the Irish Republic, certainly within the political
                class, with senior politicians constantly being investigated for
                unlawful and illegal actions. We have witnessed tribunals
                investigating irregularities in respect of land and property
                deals, beef and all manner of illegal behaviour by politicians
                there, yet they have the effrontery to lecture us on standards
                of policing here.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Allegations have been made — many of them
                by a very well-known and respected author, Mr&nbsp;Toby&nbsp;Harnden,
                in his recent book ‘Bandit Country’. They have not been
                dealt with, and I think they warrant a full and impartial
                investigation. In view of the importance of this matter, such an
                investigation should be undertaken by a panel of international
                law experts, either from Northern Ireland or from other parts of
                the United Kingdom — perhaps even someone from North America.
                If it can be proved that there was collusion, as I believe it
                undoubtedly will be, then prosecution must follow. Let the
                Republic of Ireland authorities prove that they will not stand
                for illegal behaviour on the part of their security forces. Let
                them prove that there is no hiding place for murderers,
                especially those motivated by sectarian hatred.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I believe that unless and until there is such
                an inquiry, it is not, and will not be, possible for the very
                open wounds suffered by Northern Ireland’s people —
                particularly those who live in the border areas who are
                pro-Union and who have felt most keenly the murder campaign
                directed against them from people in the north Louth area and
                other parts of the Irish Republic, helped in some way by rogue
                garda officers — to heal. They will never be able to have a
                proper relationship with the Irish Republic or to trust the
                Irish Republic and its authorities.</p>

                I contrast that with their recent demands on aspects of policing

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr A Maginness:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I beg to move the following amendment: Delete
                all after &quot;Assembly&quot; and add</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;notes the current investigation into
                allegations made against certain Garda Síochána officers and
                that a report arising from the investigation is to be submitted
                to the Irish Government in the near future.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was disappointed by Mr Kennedy’s opening
                speech. I had expected much more detail on the allegations
                forming the basis of the motion. In fact, the motion itself is
                vague. There are no details or dates given, and the nature of
                the allegation has not been specified beyond simple collusion.
                It is fair to say that, while he has made sweeping allegations,
                he has been very short on detail. That is disappointing, because
                one would have hoped that Mr Kennedy would provide details for
                some of the arguments he put forward. Furthermore, he called for
                an international public inquiry. That is absent from the
                substantive motion. He said that he finds the present garda
                investigation to be unsatisfactory and he is critical of
                internal investigations, as, indeed, the SDLP would be. I
                support his view that they fall short.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nonetheless, let us look at the totality of
                the situation and attempt a reasoned debate based on that. The
                SDLP’s position is quite clear. In no way does it condone any
                cover-ups, nor would it be party to them. It wants to see the
                truth exposed and it wants to see those who are guilty of any
                crimes of collusion or co-operation with terrorist organisations
                brought before the courts, convicted and sentenced. The SDLP has
                nothing to hide, and it supports the most rigorous examination
                of collusion. It has always been committed to human rights and
                non-violence, and it views any collusion by any police force
                anywhere — including the Garda Síochána — with abhorrence.
                It regards any collusion as monstrous, deplorable and quite
                unacceptable.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the past, it has been alleged of two garda
                officers that they colluded in some way with the Provisional IRA
                in the murder of judicial figures, their families, at least two
                senior RUC officers and some other serving members of the RUC.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This forms the basis, the kernel and the very
                centre of the present motion. These allegations have been
                brought to the attention of the Irish Government and, in
                particular, to the attention of the present Minister for
                Justice, Mr O’Donoghue. It is a matter of public record,
                particularly inside Dáil Éireann, that he views these
                allegations with deep concern. His attitude has not been one of
                dismissal or of cover-up. There has been an intensive
                investigation by the Garda Sióchána.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I might add that that investigation involved
                not only the garda but the RUC. The RUC investigated allegations
                made in respect of incidents that took place in Northern
                Ireland, and the Garda Síochána investigated those which took
                place in the jurisdiction of the Republic. Those allegations
                related to incidents that occurred in the 1980s and the 1990s.
                The two police forces, therefore, co-operated closely on the
                investigations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a result of those investigations there was
                no — I use the term advisedly, and it was used by the Minister
                — tangible evidence uncovered to show that information was
                passed by a garda informant, or informants, to the Provisional
                IRA.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Subsequent to that internal investigation by
                the Garda Síochána, similar, or the same, allegations emerged.
                Once again, these were raised in Dáil Éireann and, once again,
                the Minister for Justice viewed them with deep concern and dealt
                with them very seriously indeed. As a result of representations
                made inside and outside the Irish Parliament, he ordered fresh
                investigations into the allegations. He regarded them as raising
                issues of the utmost seriousness. He said that their repetition
                in the media caused understandable concern, North and South, and
                he was committed to finding the truth in relation to them. He
                said — and repeated — that, even though there was no
                tangible evidence to substantiate the re-emergence of these
                allegations, every effort must be made to assure, and to
                reassure, the public, both North and South, that they had been
                thoroughly investigated. The Garda Commissioner was therefore
                asked to appoint a senior officer to examine the files and to
                further investigate the allegations. That appointment was made.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should await the result of that
                investigation from the Garda Síochána before calling for what
                is central to this motion today — a public inquiry into those
                allegations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My party and I hope that the investigation
                will be successful in establishing either that there is nothing
                to the allegations or that there is substance to them. If there
                has been collusion between members of the gardaí and the
                Provisional IRA, we hope that evidence sufficient to bring to
                prosecution those people who committed such offences — and
                offences they are — can be established and that those people
                will be brought to court and prosecuted for their crimes. That
                is my hope in relation to that investigation, and I hope that,
                ultimately, it will be successful.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the investigation does not unearth
                sufficient evidence to establish the basis for a prosecution,
                yet does establish that there was an element of collusion that
                needs to be properly and further investigated, then at that
                stage we should consider taking the course of action contained
                in the motion. We should consider the establishment of a public
                inquiry to examine at those allegations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That position will be reached when there is
                at least prima facie evidence to indicate that some collusion
                took place in the 1980s and 1990s. The SDLP’s present position
                is that, in the absence of tangible evidence of collusion
                between the gardaí and the Provisional IRA, it is premature to
                call for a public inquiry. We are therefore not in a position to
                recommend one.</p>

                does say that we should wait for the gardaí’s report and the
                result of the reinvestigation before calling for a full public
                inquiry.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Having considered the number of Members
                wishing to speak, I ask Members to restrict their remarks to no

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ian Paisley Jnr:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I congratulate Mr Kennedy for tabling this
                motion. It is right and proper that he call on the Secretary of
                State to insist that the Irish Government conduct an independent
                public inquiry into the murder of individuals and into the
                allegations of collusion between the Garda Síochána and the
                Provisional IRA.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we want to have justice issues in the
                Province and across the world addressed, someone has to drive
                the matter forward. All that Mr&nbsp;Kennedy’s motion asks is
                that the Secretary of State take up the reins and press the
                Irish Government. That is perfectly right and proper.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What is appalling is the woeful statement
                from the SDLP to the effect that its amendment is reasoned.
                Reasoned amendment my foot, Madam Deputy Speaker. What we heard
                from the SDLP today was sanctimonious claptrap. Its amendment
                just about notes that the sun rises in the morning and sets in
                the evening. It does nothing else. The amendment does not
                address the issue in any proper or scrupulous way. If that is
                what Mr Maginness calls an intensive investigation, I should
                hate to see what he would call a failed investigation. The SDLP
                has today washed its hands of the human rights of people who
                have been murdered and butchered on this island by the
                Provisional IRA. That is the action that the SDLP has taken.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some time ago a journalist by the name of
                Kevin Myers wrote in ‘The Irish Times’, in the ‘Irishman’s

                moving a wrecking motion. It is sanctimonious claptrap for it to
                refuse to allow this motion to go forward and to attempt to wash
                its hands of it, taking inaction as opposed to action.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Toby&nbsp;Harnden has been mentioned, and I
                mentioned Kevin&nbsp;Myers, who wrote at length about
                well-placed moles within the Garda Síochána. He indicated that
                one individual betrayed sensitive security details to the IRA
                for 12&nbsp;years so that it could murder members of the RUC,
                judges and families travelling to Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I understand your ruling,
                Madam&nbsp;Deputy&nbsp;Speaker, and I will try to stick
                scrupulously to it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The details of the mole are well documented.
                Essentially, he has acted with impunity since 1985. In
                May&nbsp;1985 four officers were killed, one of whom was a
                21-year-old woman named Tracy&nbsp;Doak. The extraordinary thing
                about this murder was that the Garda Síochána alone could have
                known about the movements of the RUC vehicle that day.
                Subsequently, there was no investigation or internal inquiry —
                there was nothing but public procrastination by the Garda
                Síochána.</p>

                care to avoid prejudicing the outcome of any proceedings that

                betrayed material to the IRA. There were 12 specific cases —

                SDLP’s commitment to human rights has been found desperately

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Maskey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat. I will make a few brief
                points. I do not want to detract from Mr Kennedy’s reasons for
                moving the motion, but I will not be supporting it because it is
                a very narrow one. Mr Kennedy has presented absolutely no
                evidence to back up his arguments, other than the kind of
                dubious speculation to be found in certain cheap books and
                magazines. Nevertheless, I have no doubt that Mr Kennedy and
                other representatives have very serious concerns about what has
                happened in and around their constituencies. They have every
                right to raise these concerns.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My concern is that the proposed amendment is
                of no substance, for it does nothing but affirm that we note
                that an investigation is taking place. Over the years, quite a
                number of members of the Garda Síochána have not only been
                charged and convicted but served time in prison for passing on
                information. That is a matter of public record. My main concern
                about today’s motion is that it does not go nearly far enough.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There has been clear and compelling evidence
                over the years — and in more recent times — in relation, for
                example, to the Dublin/Monaghan bombings, which obviously rank
                as one of the greatest tragedies on this island. Compelling
                evidence has been produced, and it suggests that, at the very
                minimum, there was at that time, and subsequently, collusion
                between senior members of the Garda Síochána, the RUC and
                Loyalist paramilitaries. We raised this matter with the new
                Secretary of State yesterday morning.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My only real point is that I would prefer it
                if we were dealing with a motion which called for a full,
                independent, international inquiry into all these allegations of
                collusion on this entire island which have involved Governments
                from both the Irish and the British sides of the border.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This cannot and must not be allowed to escape
                the public’s attention. Therefore, I will not be supporting Mr
                Kennedy’s motion. I respect his right to move the motion, but
                it is far too narrow. I would be more in favour of an
                opportunity to debate the whole range of allegations of
                collusion, which has caused untold damage and has taken the
                lives of untold numbers of people across this island. I would
                like to see an inquiry into these allegations.</p>

                incident highlights the continuing threat from dissident
                Republicans.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion illustrates Members’ genuine
                concern about incidents in the past. Collusion on the parts of
                the security services with terrorists, and even suspected cases
                of such activity, north or south of the border, is a very
                serious matter.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There have been many calls over the years,
                and in recent times, for independent and international inquiries
                into the events of the troubles as a whole. But it must be
                remembered that there have been over 3,500 fatalities during the
                troubles, and many more thousands have been maimed for life,
                including civilians, police and Army personnel and even the
                Garda Síochána. We must ask ourselves where we draw the line.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is vital that every victim of the troubles
                be remembered. It is important that truth and justice prevail,
                but we must also look to the future of Northern Ireland and the
                island of Ireland. Over the years the Government of the Republic
                of Ireland have lectured us in Northern Ireland on the subject
                of police accountability. I look forward to the day when the
                Assembly can debate the issue of police accountability in the
                Republic of Ireland. For many years Northern Ireland has had the
                Police Authority, which has provided substantial accountability
                when dealing with difficult issues in very difficult
                circumstances. While some groups have refused to take their
                seats on the board of the authority, the gardaí are simply
                accountable to the Republic of Ireland’s Minister for Justice.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Good Friday Agreement and the Patten
                Report have provided structures that will make the new police
                service even more accountable, particularly through the new
                police board. A new police ombudsman has also been appointed.
                The thrust of my argument is that there should be similar
                accountability in the Republic of Ireland. That is very
                pertinent to this debate. The bottom line is that if meaningful
                structures of accountability are in place, public inquiries,
                such as demanded today, would be superfluous.</p>

                specific, when you, Madam Deputy Speaker, quite rightly ruled
                that the nature of the subject matter that we are discussing

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will not give way.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In opposing the motion, Mr Maginess proposed
                such conditional requirements for investigations which, if
                applied to the RUC, would never result in an inquiry. At the
                same time, the SDLP proposed an amendment in the House of
                Commons to what is now the Police Act 1997. If that amendment
                had been incorporated into the Act, it would have given a police
                board, containing members of Sinn&nbsp;Féin/IRA, virtually
                unlimited scope for indefinite investigations and, therefore, an
                indefinite witch-hunt of the RUC that stood between decent
                citizens in Northern Ireland and the terrorists who would be on
                that police board for 30 years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Without being able to be specific on these
                matters, I want to go on to consider the background relationship
                between the political, judicial and security establishments in
                the Republic. That relationship, as it developed over 30 years,
                renders the sort of collusion Mr Kennedy wants investigated not
                merely probable or likely but virtually inevitable.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are three main aspects to the
                relationship that developed between the Southern state and the
                Provisional IRA. The first is that the Provisional IRA was
                financed and established by the Fianna Fáil Government under
                Jack Lynch. There are two things of significance about the
                Government’s role in establishing the Provisional IRA.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, how far did responsibility penetrate
                into the Cabinet? How high did it go? That was discussed in the
                most recent book by Justin O’Brien, ‘The Arms Trial’. The
                point that I think O’Brien is making in the book, though I
                have not had time to read it exhaustively, is that contrary to
                many perceptions that this activity within the Cabinet was
                confined to Mr Haughey, Mr Boland and Mr Blaney in conjunction
                with an elected Member of this Assembly who represents Sinn
                Féin/IRA, it was actually done with the knowledge if not the
                sanction of Jack Lynch, who was the Taoiseach or Prime Minister.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, why was it done? It has been well
                established for some considerable time — and this was very
                clearly stated by Conor Cruise O’Brien in his introduction to
                Martin Dillon’s book ‘The Dirty War’ — that there were
                two basic considerations in the mind of those who manoeuvred
                this organisation and split the IRA at that time. One of them
                was the concern in the Republic about agitational politics,
                which were a characteristic feature of the IRA of the late 1960s
                under the leadership of Cathal Goulding. The idea was that if
                they could split the IRA and finance the armament of a section
                of the IRA, they could return it to the old physical force
                tradition that it had effectively abandoned or put into abeyance
                in the 60s.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This was one of the most cruel and cynical
                operations you could think of. The plan was to finance the
                physical force tradition and to focus that tradition on Northern
                Ireland in order to lift the weight of agitational politics and
                the possibility of instability — a real concern to the
                security forces in the Republic in the late 1960s — regardless
                of the consequences. That was the point.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The other point is that within the judicial
                establishment in the Republic there was a total aversion to the
                extradition of terrorists for 30 years. For example, one warrant
                was regarded as invalid because a full stop was omitted at the
                end of a sentence. Margaret Thatcher is on record in her memoirs
                as saying that one of her reasons for signing the Anglo-Irish
                Agreement was to get further support on security from FitzGerald.
                However, she then realised that she would never get it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have to draw my speech to a close. Finally,
                I note that an enormous amount of arms was brought in and
                shifted around Ireland, which the security forces in the South
                never seem to get.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ervine:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is quite a shock to me; I agree with
                much of what Mr Roche has just said. I think that he has focused
                his mind on what the motion should have been focused on: the
                political attitudes of the Republic of Ireland.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And it should have been focused not only on
                the political attitudes of the Republic of Ireland but also on
                the ambivalence of the Republic of Ireland. Anecdotally, it is
                very powerful to listen to IRA men talk about phone calls from
                Dublin asking &quot;Did you get the sewing machines?&quot; These
                phone calls were from Dublin to Derry.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There have been two instances of serious
                collusion involving the Government of the Republic of Ireland.
                And remember that every institution in the Republic of Ireland
                is under Government control. How could it be otherwise? The
                Republic’s relationship with the Catholic Church must also be
                considered. Mr Roche alluded to one of the reasons for collusion
                but did not expand on it quite as starkly as I am about to.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">IRA members were socialists, and because they
                were socialists they were dangerous, and they wanted to do away
                with them. So they armed the ones who bit the altar rails,
                appealing on the basis of the &quot;pogroms&quot; in Belfast and
                elsewhere in Northern Ireland. The Irish Government and the
                Catholic Church thought it legitimate to involve themselves, but
                the underlying reason was the destruction of a socialist
                movement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Alban Maginness says that there is not
                enough evidence to examine what might have happened in the
                Republic of Ireland. He probably has the same view about the
                United States — another good friend of his — which would
                never ever have abandoned a legally constituted and democratic
                Government to install the Shah of Iran. The United States would
                never have abandoned the perfectly legitimate Government of
                Salvador Allende in Chile to replace it with their own people
                and all the subsequent trauma and tragedy. Perhaps he is unaware
                that Governments are inclined to do these things. When he looks
                at an ordinary RUC man he immediately thinks collusion — much
                the same as members of Sinn Féin do. I was disappointed that
                Alex Maskey did not come clean, own up and tell us truth about
                these circumstances. Sooner or later, the truth will out.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Back to Mr Maginness. When he looks at an RUC
                man he sees collusion, but he cannot imagine seeing that in the
                nice little Republic — the decent, nice little Republic. The
                Republic has more faith in itself than he has. In the Republic,
                a Government fell because of a paedophile priest. The Government
                have had their nightmares with a litany of public commissions
                and inquiries — and we laugh at them. Unionism says &quot;Look
                at them, they’re very bad people. Look what they’re up
                to.&quot; The people in the Republic get a bit fed up with it,
                but in effect what we are seeing is a nation coming of age, a
                nation where it is no longer sensible, rational or reasonable to
                sweep things under the carpet. It is an attempt to convince the
                world that they are the nice little people that undoubtedly Mr
                Maginness considers them to be. They tell some modicum of the
                truth, and then they build that modicum of truth into the whole
                truth. We have seen it played out with the brown envelope
                culture and land development issues. It was also to be seen in
                governmental and institutional attitudes in the Republic
                throughout the troubles. It can happen.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Maginness and others need to come to terms
                with the fact that Unionism is perhaps saying &quot;You know
                what it feels like&quot;, because kindred spirits, whether we
                like it or not, often help each other. Since there is one
                encompassing entity called &quot;Irish Nationalism&quot;, how is
                it irrational for a Unionist policeman or soldier to think that
                it is in the best interests of his people to pass on a piece of
                information, whether it is legal or not? They have done it, and
                they have been found guilty. But the Nationalist Benches tell us
                that that would and could not happen in the Republic of Ireland,
                that there is no evidence of it. Are they not human beings,
                human beings unwillingly trapped in a conflagration? If it is
                fair and reasonable to presume that many Governments have
                behaved badly, why does Mr Maginness defend a Government that
                presumably has behaved as badly as any other?</p>

                have suffered a great deal at the hands of the IRA. Our

                re-examine the files on terrorist incidents in the border area
                in the 1980s and 1990s and to specifically investigate

                like Mr Maginness to answer that question. I do not believe that
                a senior garda officer should be investigating these
                allegations. These are serious allegations of collusion between
                the gardaí and the IRA, and I think that means that the
                investigator should be independent. Collusion is not neutral,
                and the Irish Government should appoint someone neutral and
                independent. I would like Mr Alban Maginness to say whether he
                agrees with me on that.</p>

                the troubles. We hear much of the investigations that Republican
                so-called politicians continually pursue. The unjust goings-on
                between the Southern Government and the security forces should
                be cause for an inquiry into these allegations. I support the

                I support my Colleague Mr Maskey in saying that Mr Danny Kennedy’s
                motion does not go far enough. There should be an all-Ireland
                inquiry into the involvement of both the British and Irish
                Governments. It is ironic that Unionists should, at this time,
                make allegations of gardaí and IRA collusion when no shred of
                evidence has been produced to substantiate them. Ordinary
                gardaí have been charged and sentenced, but it has never been
                proven that the Garda Síochána hierarchy has ever been
                involved in collusion with the IRA.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, an array of newspaper articles
                published in the course of recent months clearly points to
                collusion between the British Army, the RUC and Loyalist murder
                gangs. Unionists would do well to focus on these, rather than
                running off on flights of fancy.</p>

                former British intelligence operations, it is clear that the
                undercover British Army unit — the Force Research Unit, better
                known as FRU — infiltrated, restructured and rearmed Loyalist
                gangs. Working in conjunction with the RUC, it made information
                relating to personal details of Nationalists available to
                Loyalists. It directed Loyalist murder gangs to specified
                targets in the Nationalist community and regularly ventured into
                the Twenty-six Counties on surveillance operations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We then have the Dublin and Monaghan
                bombings. Nobody has ever been made accountable for those. These
                matters deserve our undivided attention and need to be properly
                investigated. Given the inability of Stevens’s team to protect
                witnesses and their lack of authority in instructing former FRU
                operatives to give evidence, it is clear that important
                inquiries cannot be left to them.</p>

                Where is the matter of the jurisdiction of the Irish Republic
                referred to in my Colleague’s commentary? There has been a lot
                about FRU and the RUC, but none of it, or very little of it, has
                been about the jurisdiction of the Irish Republic, in which, of
                course, the Garda Síochána function. Any inquiry could only
                take place in that jurisdiction.</p>

                It is a well-known fact, and recent newspaper articles say that
                FRU was part and parcel of the Monaghan and Dublin bombs.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have listened with interest, and I welcome
                the fact that Mr Kennedy has given us the opportunity to discuss
                this, but the motion could have been deepened and made more
                widespread in its context.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I listened with interest to Paddy Roche and
                to David Ervine, who were trying to give us a revisionist view
                of history and of what happened in 1969 and subsequently. I hold
                no brief for any Irish Government which, I believe, behaved in
                the most disreputable fashion in relation to the Nationalist
                community in the Six Counties over that time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People talk about government, but let us go
                back to the 1960s, to the collusion there was then in the old
                Stormont Government, when Loyalist paramilitaries tried to
                depose and bring down Terence O’Neill, ChichesterClarke and
                the late Brian Faulkner. Let us remember that the bombs that
                were exploded throughout the Six County area at that time were
                blamed on the IRA, when the IRA was non-existent.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, now we know, by word of mouth, or to
                use the words of Mr Kennedy’s motion, that there was
                &quot;suspected collusion&quot; between Members of the then
                Government and Loyalist paramilitaries. There is nothing new
                about collusion in the history of this part of Ireland or in any
                other part of Ireland. It was called co-operation at one time.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am coming to the motion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For years, the Stormont Government and
                Unionist politicians asked for — pleaded for — co-operation
                between the security forces on both sides of the border, much to
                the disgust of Irish Republicans, and they got that
                co-operation. We were scathing of it; we condemned it; we asked
                that it should not happen, but it continued throughout the
                1970s, the 1980s and the 1990s. However, no Member on the
                Unionist side is talking about the level of co-operation — or
                collusion, as we might call it — between the security forces
                and the various branches of Government throughout that period.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They are isolating one or two incidents and
                turning those into — in the words of the motion —</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;suspected collusion between members of

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The only members of the Garda Síochána whom

                the courts, charged and put in prison. They were not suspected
                but arrested and put in jail.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a bit of a flight of fancy in all of
                this. People want to revise history. However, Mr Ervine cannot
                just write off what happened in 1969 as being the responsibility
                of the Catholic Church. It would be a travesty of history to
                write off the Catholic Church as placating those in the
                Republican movement who were eating the altar rails.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second great conflagration was a division
                between the IRA and the Provisional IRA. At that point the
                decision was made to be anti-socialist, and the Irish Government
                and the Catholic Church had an involvement in the creation of
                the Provisional IRA.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is a serious matter, however, and the
                debate and the remit ought to be more widespread. It should
                cover all aspects of what has happened in this part and the
                other part of the island, perhaps not in the last 30 years, but
                certainly since partition.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Poots:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is interesting to speak after the previous
                Member. The Member often speaks for Sinn Féin/IRA. They appear
                to have difficulty getting Members to speak. The Member from Mid
                Ulster seems to be the spokesman on everything and the expert on
                nothing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support this motion. It is important that
                the public’s attention be directed towards this matter. Many
                people, particularly in the Nationalist community, are living in
                a world where they like to believe that nothing wrong has ever
                been done in the Irish Republic — everything is good and above
                board. However, north of the border everything suddenly turns
                bad — for example, the police force and the Civil Service.
                Everything is under the terrible, corrupting influence of
                Protestants.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I went to a meeting once involving companies
                that were in competition with businesses in the Irish Republic.
                The businessmen said &quot;They are better at telling lies than
                we are at telling the truth.&quot; With regard to this issue,
                the Republic of Ireland’s Government and police force are
                better at telling lies than the Government and the police force
                in Northern Ireland are at telling the truth.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Along the border, there has been case after
                case of Protestants being murdered. Where did the perpetrators
                of those murders go? They went to the Irish Republic. How did
                they get to the Irish Republic? They went over a free border.
                Apparently, the Irish Government did not have the resources to
                man that border. However, when the BSE crisis broke out in 1996
                the Republican movement in south Armagh was really upset because
                it cut down on their smuggling activities. They found it more
                difficult to smuggle oil, livestock and whatever else it was
                that they smuggled. The Republic can stop truckloads of cattle,
                but it could not stop the truckloads of gunmen who used to
                murder people and then cross the border to their safe haven in
                the Irish Republic.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must also re-examine the Irish Government’s
                position on extradition. The British Government signed the 1985
                Anglo-Irish Agreement on the basis that there would be greater
                co-operation from the Irish Government on extradition. That
                co-operation was not forthcoming. It was farcical, and it did
                not act in the best interests of the community in Northern
                Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There was also an incident when the gardaí
                discovered arms in Donegal. However, instead of announcing that
                they had uncovered the arms, they placed them in smaller arms
                dumps so that they could announce a series of arms finds. They
                wanted the general public to think that they were more proactive
                in hunting down IRA terrorists than they really were.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Madam Deputy Speaker, you said at the start
                of the debate that Members could not name individuals. However,
                there are a number of cases that must be looked at. The murder
                of Lord Justice Gibson has to be looked at seriously, as do
                those of Ch Supt Harry Breen and Supt Bob Buchanan.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Madam Deputy Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I made the ruling that, in the interests of
                caution, there should be no reference to specific cases. I rule
                the Member out of order.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Poots:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was referring to specific cases, as opposed
                to individual gardaí who were allegedly involved. Although I
                have names, I was not going to go down the route of naming those
                people.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A senior gardaí officer has been appointed
                to examine some of these cases. I find that strange because when
                a senior member of the RUC is appointed to investigate a case,
                that is not good enough. In the case of Rosemary Nelson, for
                example, others from outside the RUC were brought in. However,
                that still is not good enough for the SDLP. It wants a public
                independent inquiry. Yet when we raise a case in the Irish
                Republic that concerns us, it is all right for a gardaí officer
                to conduct the investigation. It is not necessary to bring in
                outsiders, because it is satisfied with what the gardaí will
                report. The SDLP is being hypocritical and it has double
                standards on this issue, though, of course, this is not the
                first time.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This has not been the Assembly’s finest
                hour, in terms of debate. In many ways Members have not
                addressed the substance of Mr Kennedy’s motion. I do not think
                that he intended the motion to be as wide-ranging as Members
                have made it, despite my initial criticism of his vagueness in
                framing it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There has also been an element of tit for
                tat, particularly on the Unionist Benches, in addressing the
                motion and addressing the sort of arguments that I have
                presented, and I regret that. We have had, of course, the usual
                rant from Ian Paisley Jnr — we are used to that. He mistakes
                abuse for substantial argument in many of his contributions.
                However, I am not deterred by his abuse of me or of my party,
                for we are used to that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I regret that we have not received the
                support of Sinn Féin on the amendment. Mr Maskey has told us
                that the amendment is of no substance. I believe that it is,
                because it points out to the House that an investigation is
                ongoing and that a report is awaited. On the basis of that
                report, I believe, and my party believes, that we can make a
                decision sometime in the future. That report should not be long
                in coming to fruition.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I have said before, I hope that the report
                is successful in identifying people who can be prosecuted. If
                they can be prosecuted, that is the right way in which to deal
                with the matter — as it is in the Hamill, Nelson and Finucane
                cases. Prosecutions are more important than anything else.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to Paul Berry’s point, the
                Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland is investigating the
                Hamill case, which we welcome. It is important for that case to
                be investigated. There is evidence in the Hamill case that —
                and I do not want to put it any stronger than this, activities
                — were going on within —</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All I will say is this: in relation to Hamill,
                there are matters that require investigation, and those matters
                are more than mere allegations. In this instance, the Garda
                Síochána is investigating allegations which to date have not
                produced tangible evidence. And one requires tangible evidence
                in order to form a prima facie case for setting up a public
                inquiry.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The SDLP has never asked for public inquiries
                in cases where there has not been some prima facie evidence of
                something wrong that requires to be investigated further, over
                and above a simple police investigation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the South we currently have a number of
                inquiries that are open, transparent and thorough. It is to the
                credit of the Southern political system that matters that have
                caused great public concern should be openly and transparently
                investigated in the most thorough manner possible. We should be
                crediting, and not ridiculing, those in the South who have
                brought that about. That is the type of political culture that
                we should have here.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If there is any substance to the allegations
                that have been made, and if it is merited, there will be a
                public inquiry in the South. However, the first point that I
                make is that the matter should be thoroughly investigated, and
                if there is evidence, there should be prosecution. If the
                evidence is insufficient to allow a proper prosecution, a public
                inquiry should be conducted.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The ebb and flow of this debate has not been
                an edifying experience. Allegations have been cast from one side
                to the other. Mr John Kelly seems to be stuck in an historical
                time warp.</p>

                also made by other Members, some of whom are members of the
                Republican movement. If references to the Shah of Iran and
                Salvador Allende constitute historical nonsense, I do not know
                what is not historical nonsense. The suggestion that they were

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In spite of what Mr Maginness said, Members
                have had a reasonably informed debate. I am grateful to those
                Members who made contributions endorsing the motion. I wish to
                make a number of points about them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;Maginness criticised the motion
                because there was no specific detail. I was conscious that,
                given the confines of this important debate, it would be unwise,
                and not permissible, to engage in naming individuals and
                referring to specific cases, so it was written in general terms.
                I do not share Alban&nbsp;Maginness’s faith in John&nbsp;O’Donoghue,
                or in any Minister for Justice in the Irish Republic, who is
                clearly quite unwilling to authorise a fully impartial and
                independent review of these matters. The Irish Government
                clearly stand in the dock. Those who endorse their position
                stand in the dock with them, and it would appear that the SDLP
                wants to be there.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An internal inquiry is not an acceptable way
                to deal with these matters. Mr&nbsp;Maginness said he did not
                rule out an inquiry and he left it open that at some stage,
                perhaps the SDLP may press for an inquiry. That is at odds with
                his party’s mandate as the defenders of human rights in
                Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This party of defenders of liberty and of
                saints and scholars — and all manner of things — is clearly

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker.
                This day has been disrupted continuously by mobile phones going
                off. I ask for a ruling that mobile phones be left outside in a
                pigeonhole — with the guns.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mobile phones ought not to be in the Chamber.
                They ought to be taken out of service —
                &quot;decommissioned&quot; is another word for that — and we
                look forward to that and other matters too.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ian&nbsp;Paisley Jnr did bear out the point
                — and the representations made by Nationalists here also bear
                it out — that they are in denial. Nationalism and the
                Nationalist political viewpoint are in denial of much of what
                took place over the last 25 to 30&nbsp;years. Republicans remain
                silent, or at least grudgingly acknowledge their role. If there
                is criticism of the SDLP — and I must say this very firmly —
                it is that it appears to be in serious denial of the events that
                took place in border constituencies. It was mass murder,
                assisted by rogue members of the Garda Síochána, yet the SDLP
                will not acknowledge it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;Maskey tried, in some way, to
                introduce other elements and appeal that there had been
                wrongdoing for everybody, and so that would have to be
                investigated. It is a curious irony that any member of Sinn
                Féin should want an investigation, given their active
                participation in the murder campaign. I welcome and acknowledge
                Mr Neeson’s acceptance of the concerns raised by the motion,
                and Mr&nbsp;Roche made a very good case that collusion was
                ultimately inevitable because of the actions of senior
                politicians. I can remember the words of Jack&nbsp;Lynch when he
                said that the Irish Government would not stand idly by. Those
                words clearly gave a mandate to individuals and members of
                organisations to put into effect a campaign that resulted in
                murder, particularly in the border area.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I must warmly commend Mr Ervine’s speech.
                It was a very compelling and valuable contribution, and I
                suggest that Nationalists and Republicans read and inwardly
                digest it. I am also grateful for the contribution of Mr Berry;
                he is aware of the issues in his Newry and Armagh constituency.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mick Murphy’s speech was astonishing. He
                contradicted not just me but Alex Maskey, his party Colleague,
                and Hans Christian Andersen would have had difficulty with some
                of the arguments he brought forward.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">John Kelly’s confession was even more
                astonishing. They say that confession is good for the soul. I
                was not gratified by the confession of his membership of the
                IRA; that was very regrettable indeed. It is a new departure in
                boasting, and it is unacceptable that a Member of the House
                should proclaim — with some pride, it appears — that he was
                a member of the Provisional IRA, given its contribution to
                society over the past 30 years. I just wonder whether the
                register of interests that all Members are required to complete
                will include that, because it was a very clear admission and was

                While they have found arms and ammunition on many occasions,
                they have apprehended few terrorists, and that has been a
                concern for many years. They were happy enough to find the

                the SDLP’s continuing interest in the findings of John O’Donoghue

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to say one thing regarding Mr Alban
                Maginness’s reference to the Hamill case. It was an
                unfortunate contribution given the legal position of that case.
                Alban Maginness wanted prima facie evidence. I can produce no
                greater evidence than the blatant murder, with the collusion of
                rogue garda officers, of RUC men, UDR men, RIR men, senior
                members of the Northern Ireland judiciary and private citizens
                from both the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland. That seems to
                be enough prima facie evidence to warrant a full independent
                inquiry. I believe that a compelling case has been made.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clearly the evidence is available, and it
                must be seen to be dealt with in an open and impartial way. We
                should endorse the call for a full public inquiry, an
                international inquiry, headed by acknowledged experts. That
                should be established quickly, and it should be a priority for
                the new Secretary of State. In framing this motion, I am glad
                that I did not name the Secretary of State. That would have been
                unfortunate, given the run of events this week. It is incumbent
                on the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland to address this
                issue seriously. Until this matter is fully exposed, it will
                never be possible to trust completely the security authorities
                in the Irish Republic.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker. At
                the beginning of this debate you made a ruling about sub judice
                matters, which set out the parameters for this debate. Are you
                interpreting the words &quot;all courts&quot; in the Standing
                Order as referring to courts beyond this jurisdiction, or are
                you saying that the sub judice rule applies to courts in the
                United Kingdom only? From what appears to be your interpretation
                of the sub judice rule, Members were not allowed to cite cases
                that are under discussion in another jurisdiction. By your
                interpretation of that Standing Order, Members were deliberately
                prevented from raising certain matters. Perhaps you would
                comment on that.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Madam Deputy Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was referring to all courts in this

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Perhaps you could then tell us why Members
                were prevented from raising cases that are not before any court
                in this jurisdiction. The motion does not ask for them to be
                brought before a court in this jurisdiction; it simply seeks to
                have an inquiry into issues in another jurisdiction.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Madam Deputy Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That ruling was made in the interests of
                caution. At some stage those issues may be brought before a
                court in this jurisdiction.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker.
                Surely the ruling you have just given about what might happen in
                a court has nothing to do with any debate in this House or with
                any other debate in any other Parliament. This Parliament — or
                this Assembly, or whatever you want to call it — has only to
                take care with the sub judice rule when a matter might come to
                court in this jurisdiction, not anywhere else. For anybody to
                say that this House cannot discuss what happens in a court of
                law in France is absolute nonsense.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The rule refers to this jurisdiction.
                However, there are certain offences — for example, in border
                areas — which could be brought before this jurisdiction. I
                will make enquiries and make a ruling later today, or tomorrow

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Alliance Party, and other parties, have
                campaigned for this appointment for some time now — as have
                nearly all the organisations which deal with various children’s
                issues. Alliance first brought the subject up in 1988. We
                approved a motion at our party conference last year that urged
                the Assembly to make such an appointment, and we have asked
                numerous questions in the House on the topic, as have other
                parties.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Last year, after an initial meeting with
                several organisations that deal with children’s issues,
                including Save the Children, the National Society for the
                Prevention of Cruelty to Children, Children Need Fathers and the
                Parents Advice Centre, we became involved in the establishment
                of an all-party Committee on children’s issues.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That Committee’s first meeting was held in
                early January and was attended by various Assembly Members and
                representatives from relevant organisations. It was a useful
                meeting in which we agreed to draw up a plan to lobby on the
                many issues concerning children that have an impact on the 10
                Northern Ireland Departments. We agreed that our eventual target
                must be a commissioner for children. We pledged to concentrate
                on a number of priority issues, such as funding and promoting
                children’s basic rights. It was hoped that there would be a
                programme of essential topics for consideration when the
                commissioner was appointed. My Colleagues in the Assembly and I
                are delighted that after only one meeting, there is a good
                prospect that the commissioner will become a reality.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Why is it imperative to focus on children’s
                rights? First, it is clear that we are failing our children, at
                all levels, on their quality of life.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the years of the troubles, there were
                major efforts to protect children and help them a lead a
                violence-free life, but this was at times impossible.
                Nevertheless, a very effective network of children’s welfare
                organisations developed. We can now expect these organisations
                to continue that commitment to ensure fair treatment for all
                children.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We can see the aims of the new commissioner
                as being: to promote the full implementation of the UN
                Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Children (Northern
                Ireland) Order 1995; to ensure that children’s needs are
                prioritised in central, regional and local government, civil
                society, and to improve public attitudes to children; to
                influence law, policy and practice, both by responding to
                Governmental and other proposals and actively proposing change;
                to promote effective co-ordination of Government for children at
                all levels; to promote effective use of resources for children;
                to provide a channel for children and to encourage Government
                and the public to give proper respect to children’s views; to
                encourage the Government to collect adequate data on the
                situation of children and to publish this data. The way forward
                must be based on the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child
                and the Children (Northern Ireland) Order 1995.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It must be remembered that the United Kingdom
                has an abysmal record of compliance with UN Directives on
                children’s rights and has largely ignored the many European
                reports that have noted its shortcomings. Hence the need for an
                independent, non-political position. Legislation must include
                childproofing, and this must be done after child impact studies
                on all proposed legislation, so that priority is given to
                childhood needs by all Government Departments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am heartened by the Minister’s statement
                that Northern Ireland children deserve no less than those in
                other countries, including those in the rest of the United
                Kingdom and in the Republic of Ireland. It has been recognised
                throughout the civilised world that the safeguarding and
                upholding of children’s rights is absolutely essential to the
                fabric and future of any community, and we cannot lag behind.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Legislation must be clear and transparent in
                this respect and should allow Government as a whole the
                flexibility to oversee individual Departments and their
                performance. The commissioner must be able to respond to
                individual complaints and be ready and able to deal with the
                many varied issues that will emerge from those consultations —
                child poverty, child abuse, children’s health, education,
                housing conditions, and so on.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The new regime must include the role of an
                ombudsman for dealing with complaints and comments from children
                and young people, as well as their parents. In short, any
                legislation drawn up must be effective, caring and
                comprehensive. Children must be prime players in informing the
                commissioner’s work and agenda, so that our aim of joined-up
                government can work in their favour.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Children (Northern Ireland) Order 1995
                represents significant legislative change, and is one of the
                most important pieces of children’s law in Northern Ireland.
                It brought together, for the first time, the law relating to the
                care, protection and raising of children and addressed a wide
                range of issues from protection from sexual and physical abuse
                to providing support to keep families together in particularly
                difficult times. The Order is primarily concerned with the
                welfare of children and the help that state intervention can
                bring. Any new legislation should be drafted to complement this
                Order.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unfortunately, Westminster has been slow in
                taking action, but has made some lofty comments. It said that
                the Government agree that it is desirable to have mechanisms
                that will keep issues of children’s rights and safeguards
                clearly and firmly on the collective agenda, and that they will
                ensure that this important dimension continues to be emphasised
                in the policies of local authorities and all other agencies with
                responsibility for children, particularly when they are living
                away from home. In spite of those wonderful words, they went on
                to say that it would not be desirable to create a separate
                mechanism for children. Dare I say it again — Tony Blair and
                his Government are all mouth and trousers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A Private Member’s Bill for a children’s
                rights commissioner has been introduced twice in Westminster,
                and I hope that that will be successful. The Scottish Parliament
                is considering a commissioner, and we are hopeful of that
                outcome, and similarly with the Welsh Assembly. In the Republic,
                the Dáil has drawn up a national strategy for children which
                calls for an independent commissioner and ombudsman.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Funding is important with any legislation. It
                is essential that the commissioner should have sufficient
                resources to carry out the many tasks within his or her remit.
                Up to now children’s services have been short-changed. Moneys
                were not ring-fenced and were used to fund other schemes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The children’s fund has been mentioned, but
                it is hoped that specific funds will be allocated in line with
                the remit of the commissioner and the policies and actions that
                will have to be agreed. A comprehensive and relevant national
                agenda should be drawn up and the policies of that agenda should
                allow for the input of children. A formula for drawing up
                recommendations to the Executive should also form part of the
                commissioner’s responsibilities, and the development of
                policies and practices for children should be clearly outlined.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I appreciate the First Minister and the
                Deputy First Minister’s statement yesterday. It was
                significant, and it is hoped that the consultative process will
                be in line with proposals outlined in their statement and not
                take too long. It is also hoped that the consultative process
                will include the all-party Committee’s comments on children’s
                issues, as I detailed earlier. That would be a good way to start
                the consultative process.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must ensure that children and young people
                form part of our vision for the future government and that their
                rights and needs are included in all Government Departments’
                programmes. I am sure that the Assembly will press and
                influence, as the statement said, the direction that the
                Executive take on this issue, and today’s debate is the first
                part of that exercise.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Alliance Party has always considered that
                children are citizens from the moment they are born. It is hoped
                that the Assembly and the Executive will also hold that belief
                and ensure that the legislation is enacted as soon as is
                practically possible.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like the Member, and indeed the
                proposer of the motion, to know that the Business Committee did
                have this motion on the agenda for today. At no stage was
                anybody informed that it was withdrawn. The First and Deputy
                First Ministers, in their absence, could have asked the junior
                Ministers to stay for this debate. It was on the Order Paper and
                was not withdrawn.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I think — and I assume that the Member
                feels the same way — that although there was an announcement
                by the Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister
                yesterday, it was a very limited debate. Undoubtedly, given that
                announcement, Members wanted to take the opportunity to put
                forward their views. It is extremely disappointing that the
                junior Minister is not here for the end of this debate. The
                Member might agree that that sustains the argument that we
                should have appointed a minister for children in the first
                place.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Poots:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Members for their contributions.
                I think that we are all singing from the same hymn sheet. I ask
                the Business Committee to look at this in general, because there
                is a problem with all Ministers not being available to respond
                to the different motions coming forward on various issues. The
                fact that there are four Ministers in this Department, yet not
                one of them is available, highlights that particular issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We all want to give our support to the
                proposal and the amendment on the basis that we are supporting
                the weakest and most vulnerable in society. The Programme for
                Government identified equality issues in relation to children
                and to older people. Children are certainly liable to be abused.
                They are the weakest, in the sense that many people will not
                listen to them. If a child makes an accusation against an adult,
                people tend to believe what the adult says before they believe
                what the child says.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not going to go into cases of sexual,
                physical and mental abuse. We hear it all on the television and
                read it all in the newspapers. What we hear and what we read is
                only the tip of the iceberg. A lot of abuse goes on that is not
                reported and that nobody is charged for. Those children suffer
                throughout their lives. Many children are being brought up in
                intolerable conditions. The more we move away from the family
                societies that we had in the past towards situations where many
                couples are cohabiting, there is different parentage for the
                children. Young children are being brought up in homes where the
                father is not their father; the man of the house is not their
                father. There are more and more cases of abuse as time goes on
                because of that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like the children’s commissioner to
                have extensive powers. This debate gives Members an opportunity
                to set out what they believe the role of the children’s
                commissioner should be. Yesterday we had a discussion, and I
                believe that the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy
                First Minister actually moved to pre-empt this debate because
                they knew that there was a general demand across the parties for
                a children’s commissioner. I believe that they moved to
                pre-empt it and that not much thought has been given to it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What was put forward yesterday was that there
                would be a study of and a report on the appointment of a
                children’s commissioner, and that the Office of the First
                Minister and the Deputy First Minister would be looking at that
                situation with a view to appointing a children’s commissioner.
                There was no substance as to what they themselves actually want
                to see. They are in listening mode, and have not actually
                developed anything themselves.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now is the opportunity for Members of the
                Assembly to indicate what they want: what resources they want,
                what role and what powers the commissioner might have. I suggest
                that the commissioner should have an advisory role to the
                Ministers. He would have a pre-consultation role, both on
                legislation and on policies that are being devised by the
                different Ministers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Such issues could include adequate play
                facilities; youth provision; child road safety, including
                traffic-calming measures, which would fall into the remit of the
                Regional Development Minister; school transport and safety,
                which is the responsibility of the Environment and Education
                Ministers; the amount of baggage acceptable for schoolchildren
                to carry, as often their health is abused by carrying so much
                equipment; social services, including paedophile registers and
                policies on child protection, fostering, adoption and children’s
                homes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need to have a voice for children and to
                provide them with adequate resources. We need to give the office
                of children’s commissioner some teeth — some power. We need
                a commissioner who will not be taken lightly by the Ministers
                and whose advice they have a duty to act on. Obviously there are
                financial implications for the Government of Northern Ireland,
                but we must investigate how we can provide resources and
                implement the suggested policies. I commend this amendment and
                this motion to the Assembly.</p>

                the start of this debate the junior Minister — the Member for

                benefit of the doubt that perhaps he had to nip out to deal with
                a message, and that he would return to listen to the rest of
                this debate. It is quite obvious that both he and Mr Nesbitt are
                within the precincts of this building but that neither of them
                has any intention of returning to the Chamber to listen to the

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am delighted that the Executive have
                demonstrated the high priority they place on the care and
                protection of young people in Northern Ireland with yesterday’s
                announcement about the children’s commissioner. Judging by the
                favourable public reaction, there is little doubt that this
                measure has been welcomed across the length and breadth of
                Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am also heartened that this announcement
                has been welcomed by all the main non-governmental organisations
                specialising in child protection in Northern Ireland. Like many
                of the parties here, the SDLP has been calling for a
                commissioner for children for some years. Northern Ireland has a
                population of approximately 500,000 people under the age of 18.
                We need to have an independent body to look after their health,
                education and housing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is an unacceptably high level of child
                abuse here, and the number of young people affected by mental
                health problems is increasing. Children are entitled to the
                highest level of protection that society can offer, and the
                appointment of a commissioner would ensure that children’s
                rights are given the utmost priority, by acting as a watchdog
                and compiling statistics specifically on issues affecting
                children. It is essential not only to ensure the proper
                protection of our young people, but to protect their human
                rights and promote their right to equality. The commissioner
                must be independent of the Government and must have a broad
                mandate to protect children’s interests, thus making them more
                visible in Government policy structures.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Commissioners for children are common in many
                European countries. One is being established in the South as

                establish a commissioner in Northern Ireland can only be seen as
                an investment in the future of our children and young people. We
                have the opportunity to promote cross-border co-operation on

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In relation to the present discussion, does
                the Member agree that it would be an excellent idea for the
                paedophile register to include people who have been convicted of
                paedophile activity in the North and the South of Ireland?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Lewsley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I certainly agree. I hope that a commissioner
                in the South and a commissioner in the North could work together
                to help in that matter.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Confidence in the protection of children in
                care has been severely undermined throughout Northern Ireland,
                following some of the horrific crimes that have taken place
                here. This new commissioner for children, with the enhanced role
                as laid out in the legislation, will have a pivotal role in
                renewing that confidence for future generations of our young
                people. I quote the First Minister. Yesterday he said:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The children of Northern Ireland
                deserve no less.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Under the United Nations Convention on the
                Rights of the Child, the state is obliged to promote the
                development of, and to protect, the rights of children in the
                community and in the family. Because of the ratification of the
                convention by 191 states, the scene has been set for the
                prioritisation and implementation of a framework of standards
                for the treatment of children. Children’s rights have to be
                built into the system to develop a human rights culture for the
                future, and a commissioner for children will help to ensure
                this.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The commissioner should also act as an
                ombudsman for children and an advocate for children’s rights
                and concerns. Children and young people are vulnerable, and
                there is a need for an independent agency to monitor, protect
                and promote their rights proactively. The commissioner should be
                independent, should represent children’s rights, and should
                have clearly defined powers and duties. The commissioner would
                act as a watchdog. He or she would have responsibility to act as
                adviser to the Government — submitting recommendations and
                proposals on future legislation, collecting data and producing
                reports. The effect would be to encourage good practice and to
                improve the co-ordination of children’s services, putting
                emphasis on the user of a public service, rather than the
                provider.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In short, yesterday’s announcement that
                Northern Ireland will have a commissioner for children marks
                another step in the equality and human rights agendas. However,
                as the Deputy First Minister, Séamus Mallon, pointed out, the
                establishment of a commissioner for children is not enough. More
                must be done to ensure that our Administration delivers for
                young people. That means looking at how the Government can best
                take into account issues affecting the young. The Administration
                is already equality-proofing all its policies to ensure that
                they promote equality for young people.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, we must also look at the integral
                workings of the Executive and the Assembly to see how they can
                best deal with children’s issues. The forthcoming strategy for
                children must do this. We also need to examine how the views of
                children can best be obtained, and how we can commission
                research on children’s issues.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All these actions contribute to addressing
                the concerns that Government structures are failing children and
                to ensuring that the needs of children are met through these
                structures and permitting the active, responsible participation
                of children, giving them the opportunity to develop their full
                potential.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The effect would be to integrate into the
                overall structure of Government child-friendly policies and
                cross-departmental co-ordination on issues affecting children.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Choice and involvement of children in
                decisions that affect them are important to promote social
                inclusion and also to show them that their opinions and beliefs
                are respected and will be taken into consideration at the
                planning stage of Government policy and legislation, thus giving
                them parity of esteem.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The initiation by the Executive of a
                wide-ranging consultation process on a strategy for children is
                a positive way to promote the issue and develop public debate.
                Yesterday’s announcement will give children and organisations
                that represent them the opportunity to present their views and
                make their voices heard. We have the opportunity to break new
                ground and establish a precedent by putting the protection of
                children and young people and the upholding of their rights
                firmly at the forefront of the political process. It deserves to
                be welcomed by all.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although society will never be able to
                guarantee the complete and total protection of the most
                vulnerable children and young people in society from being
                targets of those intent on committing sexual and physical abuse,
                this legislation now provides the children of Northern Ireland
                with a fresh start. It also sends a clear signal to those who
                prey on our children that their evil ways will not be tolerated.

                to get into the issues because I do not think it is deliberate,
                but it is the message of empty promises that they are sending to
                our children and us. In registering my disappointment I point
                out that the motion has been on the Order Paper since last week,

                through with the debate? There is no one from the Office of the

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not think it is fair to put that
                pressure on the Minister. It is probably the first time Sinn
                Féin has defended a DUP Minister.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Eileen Bell and David Ford for
                tabling this motion. Yesterday’s announcement by the Executive
                on the need to establish a children’s commissioner for the
                North could have ended the debate. What it did was to prompt the
                Alliance Party to table an amendment. My party and I fully
                support that amendment. I was going to say that I thanked them
                for ensuring that children’s rights are put centre stage, but
                as you can see there is no one here to answer that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The need for a children’s commissioner has
                been endorsed and supported by all the parties in the Assembly.
                Ms Lewsley pointed out the need for it well. I am not going to
                go over all those arguments. I place on record my thanks and
                appreciation. I also congratulate those organisations which have
                been involved and which have lobbied strongly over the last few
                years to ensure that the rights of children are to the fore.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During yesterday’s debate a number of
                questions were raised which were relevant to the role and remit
                of the consultation process and the commissioner. As I pointed
                out earlier, there is nobody here to answer them, but I hope to
                get answers in the post over the next couple of days.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the questions was about whom the
                Executive will consult and how quickly we can have a list of
                those to be consulted. Who will be in the working group? Why
                will the community/voluntary sector not be included in this
                group? That concerns me. We should be using the knowledge and
                expertise that has been gained by workers in this sector over
                the years, especially in the complex field of children and young
                people. We should be using that experience instead of ignoring
                it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Also mentioned was the importance of the
                commissioner’s powers to investigate and subpoena — unlike
                the Deputy Speaker, who cannot subpoena Members to come here.
                Sinn Féin, along with all the other parties, has endorsed the
                need for this. We endorsed the Putting Children First project,
                which campaigned on a number of key issues for children. One of
                these was the need for a commissioner; another was the need for
                a junior Minister. For the record, during the negotiations that
                led up to the Good Friday Agreement we lobbied for a Minister
                dedicated to children alone.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In its first report, the Health Committee
                dealt with children and young people in care. We heard all sorts
                of stories and got statistics from everyone. There were many
                concerns. One of our last, and key, recommendations was for the
                appointment of a commissioner.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also pointed out yesterday that there is a
                need to include the NIO in the remit of this working group,
                because juvenile justice is a reserved matter. We need to ensure
                that children in this system come under the remit of the
                children’s commissioner. We also need to point out that the
                children in the juvenile justice system are missing out on
                health services and education because they do not fall under the
                remit of either the Department of Health, Social Services and
                Public Safety or the Department of Education.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yesterday I asked the First Minister and the
                Deputy First Minister about the Executive’s children’s fund.
                I asked when we would get information relating to this fund and
                was told that they still do not know because they are still
                finding out exactly what to implement and how to implement it. I
                note that we were also informed yesterday that the office of the
                commissioner would cost approximately £800,000 a year. Will
                this money come out of the fund? If not, where will it come
                from?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, will the Executive ensure that until
                the children’s commissioner is appointed, all departmental
                policies are child-proofed? Go raibh maith agat.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms McWilliams:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We know the answers to some questions about
                provision for our children, but the Executive still cannot
                produce answers to others. Other Members have pointed out that
                unfortunately we are at the top of the ladder in relation to the
                number of children abused in the United Kingdom. That is a
                terrible indictment of Northern Ireland. What we do not know is
                the number of children who live in poverty in Northern Ireland.
                If we are able to keep data on the number of children who have
                been abused, we should extend the word &quot;abuse&quot; to
                include not just sexual abuse but financial abuse as well. We
                all know that the start you get in life determines the quality
                and dignity in which you will live thereafter. That, of course,
                is one of the things that the children’s commissioner could
                attend to.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Also, our children still have no advocate
                within Government structures. We heard yesterday, and again
                today, that other regions of the UK, and indeed the Republic of
                Ireland, have moved fast and effectively to do something about
                this. It is still unfortunately the case that young people are
                being admitted to adult psychiatric wards. Although the Minister
                of Health, Social Services and Public Safety announced in
                response to a question I asked that there would be 10 extra beds
                for children and young people who suffer from mental health
                problems, she has still not decided where those beds will be.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a great deal of uncertainty with
                regard to the specialised staff necessary for these beds, and,
                as they are not currently in place, it is not good enough to
                make an announcement and leave it at that. If there were a
                commissioner with oversight responsibilities, that person would
                be driving that policy forward. That is an abuse of young people’s
                rights.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have said before that there is a
                15-year-old girl in prison in Northern Ireland. That is not a
                good message to send around the world — the fact that there
                are no juvenile detention centres for young girls here. Young
                girls in residential care who offend are admitted to a special
                unit in Maghaberry prison. They are held there, mostly on their
                own, since the numbers are low. It is time we provided proper
                juvenile justice centres for girls as well as boys. I have
                written to Adam Ingram about this matter, and he says that he
                intends to provide small, independent units for girls in
                Rathgael in the future, based on a Scottish model, although he
                has not set a timescale for this.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with Sue Ramsey that we need to bring
                the responsibilities of the Northern Ireland Office and criminal
                and juvenile justice into any interdepartmental working group
                that is established. I add my voice to those concerns.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have a devolved Administration. Before we
                came into this Assembly, we were asked if we would do things
                differently, and if we would enter into partnerships with
                outside groups. We were also asked whether, if task forces were
                established in the future, we would bring in the expertise of
                civic society, particularly community and children’s
                organisations such as the NSPCC, Barnardo’s, the Children’s
                Law Centre, Save the Children and the Guardians Ad Litem Agency.
                Who else but people in those organisations has the necessary
                depth of knowledge? However, we heard yesterday that they are
                not to be included in the interdepartmental working group. I
                suppose we must assume that this group will be made up of civil
                servants. I have no wish to disparage the expertise of civil
                servants, but on their own, they do not have an adequate
                knowledge of children in Northern Ireland. The interdepartmental
                working group should be expanded to include the voluntary
                organisations — known as non-governmental organisations (NGOs)
                — and community groups that work with children on the ground.
                Over 30 years of the troubles, they have built up a knowledge of
                children that is second to none.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have said before that if it had not been
                for these people coming together across the sectarian divide to
                work on issues of commonality in relation to children, there
                would have been a Kosovo-like situation in Northern Ireland.
                They know more than most, as do the young people themselves, who
                should also be included on that committee. They could add a
                wonderful voice of difference to the decisions being taken
                forward. Authorship is ownership, and if they are not present
                from the beginning, there is no point in our asking them to
                implement policies on our behalf once the decision-making
                processes have been completed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Health, Social Services and Public Safety
                Committee tasked itself with an inquiry into residential and
                secure accommodation. I was a Member of that Committee, and we
                were so alarmed at what we heard that at times, we believed we
                were holding an inquiry into insecure accommodation and a lack
                of care. This is not a reflection on the staff but on the lack
                of resources and the levels of absconding children, who come in
                one door and go out the other. Indeed, staff were under such
                stress that they went out on strike to get their message heard.
                Representatives from NIPSA gave evidence to that effect, saying
                that they were concerned about how they would attract social
                workers in the future, as levels of stress and sickness were so
                high that people were walking away from the profession. This is
                the type of job that any commissioner could take forward.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yesterday we put down a Private Member’s
                Bill on a children’s commissioner, because we were concerned
                that the statement made by the First Minister and the Deputy
                First Minister might never be forthcoming. I warmly welcomed the
                statement, but it does need legislative teeth.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For the purposes of this debate, I would like
                to add my voice to those of Patricia Lewsley and Eileen Bell,
                who have outlined some of the powers of that commissioner. These
                powers should go further. However, I do not like to talk in
                terms of naming and shaming, but sometimes action is taken only
                after that takes place. When someone fails to comply with a
                recommendation, the commissioner should be required to respond
                to the Assembly and state which Department was the guilty party.
                The Assembly would then respond accordingly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That commissioner should establish a register
                of compliance notices and have the power to require a person to
                whom a recommendation is directed to furnish any information
                needed to do the job more effectively.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">6.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We also asked about investigative powers.
                There have been many debates about the powers of the Police
                Ombudsman. Often the question is asked &quot;Are her powers
                sufficient to enable her to carry out a good
                investigation?&quot; If we are to establish a children’s
                commissioner, that person should have no less powers. The power
                of investigation should extend beyond the production of relevant
                documents. It should enable the commissioner to subpoena
                individuals to give evidence and to prepare and publish a report
                on any investigation required to be carried out.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Welsh experience tells us — indeed, the
                very title of the report ‘Lost in Care’ suggests it — that
                had a commissioner been in place, with such powers of
                investigation, the recommendations might not have been so
                damning of the system. Likewise the Republic of Ireland — and
                Members have already commented on the excellent national
                children’s strategy entitled ‘Our Children, Their Lives’
                — has also published recommendations that require a formal
                investigation to be carried out by a director or a commissioner
                for children.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A further power should be a children’s
                impact statement, in line with section 75 of the Northern
                Ireland Act 1998, about which we hear so much. When we audit or
                carry out an &quot;MOT&quot; on particular policies that we are
                asked to equality proof, too often we do not think about
                children. If a separate children’s impact statement were
                required, that would task minds to think in future &quot;If I
                were to carry out this policy in future, what impact would it
                have on children in the community?&quot; The Minister for
                Regional Development might give thought to what a children’s
                impact statement might look like in his own Department. Indeed,
                Mr Poots, from the same party, actually addressed that issue
                with regard to road safety and planning.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In many communities we did not think about
                the necessary infrastructure for children, such as play
                facilities. I attended a residents’ association meeting last
                night in Belvoir estate. Two primary schoolchildren and two
                children from Newtownbreda High were in attendance, and they
                added a wonderful voice of difference to the meeting. They
                pointed out to us — the adults— that they had no outdoor
                play provision in a large public housing estate of 2,500
                families. The estate was not built with children and young
                people in mind. This has often been said about the housing
                estates in Belfast and throughout Northern Ireland. A children’s
                impact statement on any future planning proposals would be an
                extremely important proposal and power of the commissioner.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The commissioner should also have the power
                — and this has come to my attention as I have attended a
                number of court cases recently — to appoint someone to be the
                child’s representative in a legal context. We have the
                Guardian Ad Litem Agency, but unfortunately it does not have the
                legal power to represent children in their own right. Either we
                amend our civil and family law to allow legal children’s
                representatives to be the voice of the child in the court, or we
                give that power to the children’s commissioner. In the absence
                of that, our children are losing out. The legal context is very
                difficult for them to understand, and they do not have someone
                there speaking solely for them. The Guardian Ad Litem Agency
                would be the first to point out that that is not its
                responsibility, although it has a care and a duty to ensure that
                the children’s concerns are prioritised. The legal
                responsibility for a child’s representative is not empowered
                in Northern Ireland currently.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, an extra power that also should be
                in place is that the commissioner should be able to make
                representations at inquiries being carried out by Ministers or
                public bodies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Norwegian ombudsman addressed Assembly
                Members in the Long Gallery. He told us that, from time to time,
                he is called to address the Norwegian Parliament on children’s
                issues, and to point out where legal responsibilities are
                falling down or where new policies need to be developed. I would
                be concerned if Mr Poots’s recommendation, that this
                commissioner should simply have advisory responsibilities, was
                to stop short of that; that &quot;advisory&quot; was simply to
                be regarded as a type of therapeutic or consultative role. If
                this commissioner is to take on board the serious
                responsibilities of being the voice of our children, he needs to
                have much more extensive powers than that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Mrs Bell for putting forward the
                motion and for amending it in light of yesterday’s
                announcement. I hope it will not be too long before legislation
                comes before the Assembly to put the commissioner into place.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ford:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although the debate has not attracted the
                attention of many Members — especially those from the Ulster
                Unionist Party — it has been timely and worthwhile. As regards
                the way the debate has been structured, we certainly
                endeavoured, through our amendment, to address the gaps we
                perceived in yesterday’s statement by the First Minister and
                the Deputy First Minister.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Poots said that we were in the situation
                where Ministers were listening rather than giving a detailed
                format for the consultation. Those who have taken the
                opportunity to speak feel it is appropriate to put some flesh on
                the bones of that consultation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, I must refer to the issue of the lack
                of attendance by any Minister. Almost everybody who has spoken
                has commented on that, varying from the mildly expressed
                disappointment from Ms Ramsey to the slightly more active
                participation by Mr Poots and Mr Wells.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to put a very simple statement on the
                record of the House. At no time did Mrs Eileen Bell or I ever
                give any indication to any person that we proposed to withdraw
                the motion. Of course, there are more than four Ministers with
                responsibilities in this area, although it would be for the
                Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister to
                co-ordinate any Minister’s response. However, at no time did
                any Minister — or any person representing any Minister —
                approach us about withdrawing the motion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although I appreciate that some Members have
                felt the need to temper their remarks by defending Ministers,
                the reality is that if Ministers wanted to know what was going
                on, we have not been far from this Building in the last two
                days. It would appear that Ministers are incapable of
                consulting. I trust that they are slightly better at reading
                Hansard than they are at attending the Chamber. They seem to be
                learning some of the lessons of Westminster, where senior
                Ministers rarely attend the Chamber. I trust that our Ministers
                will not be importing that bad habit. It is something we have to
                deal with and I hope that Ministers will have a little more
                courtesy and will pay a little more attention to such matters in
                the future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am sure Members will not want me to rehash
                everything that was said. However, I want to refer briefly to
                some of the main themes as I saw them. We have been looking at a
                variety of the problems that children experience in their
                everyday lives. The issue of child protection tended to flow
                through almost everyone’s contribution.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Poots gave us a useful contribution —
                although I noticed that the Minister for Regional Development
                did not take the opportunity to talk about traffic calming. Mr
                Poots’s contribution certainly outlined the fact that if we
                are looking for a commissioner for children, it would not just
                be for abused or deprived children. It is about having a
                commissioner who will look at the totality of children’s
                lives.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Juvenile justice has also been highlighted.
                There is a major issue as to how the Northern Ireland Office
                relates to that. Perhaps the Secretary of State should read
                Hansard as well. Perhaps the First Minister will give him a
                copy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms McWilliams talked about things such as
                poverty and child psychiatry services, which we are drastically
                lacking compared with other parts of the UK.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Lewsley talked about yesterday’s
                announcement demonstrating that we were making the needs of
                children the highest priority. She is right — if that
                statement, this debate and the consultation lead to early
                legislation. At the moment, I remain to be convinced that it is
                a high priority and not just an attempt to bring the matter into
                the debate yesterday because we had this motion down for today.
                That would be particularly ironic, because we did not push for a
                debate last week. It was delayed because Ministers were not
                present.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several of the issues that have been
                highlighted go beyond the simple issue of the children’s
                commissioner. Those issues must be examined. Ms Sue&nbsp;Ramsey
                raised the issue of the role of non-governmental organisations
                in the consultation process. I think that it was Mr Poots who
                made the suggestion that the children themselves should be
                consulted. The appointment of a minister for children was
                suggested; that is a matter for the Executive. Perhaps we should
                have an Assembly committee for children. We should return to all
                those issues after the consultation period. Another issue
                highlighted was the role of the guardian<i> ad litem</i>, which
                already exists in the legal system.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Such matters need to be addressed seriously,
                but there was no evidence from yesterday’s statement that that
                was being considered. We need to examine the need for powers of
                investigation, subpoena and reporting — &quot;naming and
                shaming&quot;, as Ms McWilliams put it. The amendment would
                address three points that have not been covered. Other Members
                have highlighted the issues that they feel have been missed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should examine the question of the
                complaints procedure. I detected a suggestion in yesterday’s
                statement that decisions on complaints procedures would draw on
                the Welsh experience and the Waterhouse Report, which was
                concerned with the abuse of children in care. We must be sure
                that any procedure for investigating individual complaints goes
                wider than just the justice or care system.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Advising and assisting Ministers in the
                formulation of policy should be an essential role for the
                commissioner, perhaps in a role similar to that of the Civic
                Forum. The commissioner’s independent role would make
                consultation with children and with children’s organisations
                much easier.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One or two Members referred specifically to
                child impact studies. We have grown used to the idea that
                equality and human rights are contained in the Northern Ireland
                Act 1998. We have adopted ideas such as rural proofing, but
                unless we start to address the needs of our most vulnerable
                children in every aspect of legislation — not merely when
                someone remembers about them — we will not be able properly to
                address children’s needs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A remark was made yesterday about not wanting
                to rush the process. That gave me some slight cause for concern.
                We do not want to rush the process, and we should make time
                available to get things right. However, the message from our
                debate must be that we want to get it right as quickly as
                possible. The fact that there was so little detail in yesterday’s
                statement, compared with today’s debate, justifies the tabling
                of the motion and the amendment and the contribution of every
                Member who spoke. I trust that the motion, as amended, will be
                supported unanimously.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Wells:</p>
                </font></b><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The A24 is one of the main arterial routes
                through the South Down constituency and passes through
                Ballynahinch. The majority of those using the road are commuting
                to and from towns such as Kilkeel, Newcastle, Dundrum and
                Castlewellan. It is also an important route for those travelling
                between Lisburn and Downpatrick. The majority of people using
                the route are not actually going to Ballynahinch. They have to
                go through the town, and, frankly, they wish that they did not.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The most recent statistics available, which
                were collected in September&nbsp;1998, show that 15,000 to
                16,500 vehicles pass through Ballynahinch each day.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">6.30 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The only alternative route for people who
                want to commute from South Down to the Greater Belfast area is
                to travel via Clough from the south or Crossgar from the north
                along the A7 through Downpatrick. The problem is that that
                brings them through the second great bottleneck for traffic
                congestion in South Down — Downpatrick. As far as the people
                of South Down are concerned, there really is no alternative to
                travelling through the bottleneck on the A7.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is no exaggeration to say that the
                economic development of a large part of South Down is being
                severely hampered by congestion in Ballynahinch. Undoubtedly,
                the situation is going to get much worse. The Ards and Down area
                plan projects that an additional 7,500 houses will be built in
                the Down District Council area over the next 15 years. Many of
                these houses will be built in towns such as Ballynahinch,
                Newcastle and Castlewellan, which will generate more traffic
                through Ballynahinch. Even before the plan was published in
                draft form, planning permissions were granted for the village of
                Dundrum that will double the number of houses in that small
                village over the next 10 years. The Department has indicated
                that it expects traffic growth in Northern Ireland of between 2%
                and 3% per annum, so even if there were to be no further
                development, that would have an impact on South Down.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, the Department of Enterprise, Trade
                and Investment is putting tremendous effort into improving
                tourism throughout Northern Ireland. Newcastle and the South
                Down coast are important tourist spots and, as tourism grows, it
                will inevitably lead to further traffic congestion in
                Ballynahinch. Some of the worst examples of traffic congestion
                in Ballynahinch can be seen on summer weekends when many people
                try to make their way through the town to go to their caravans
                or to the seaside for leisure activities. In peak hours the town
                is extremely congested.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I appreciate the fact that the Minister will
                be sitting through this entire debate, given that he has already
                sat through the last one. He has obviously come briefed to
                answer the questions I will be raising, unlike other Ministers
                who would rather have their tea than come to listen to subjects
                being discussed that are relevant to their Departments. The
                Minister has also written to me promising that he will visit
                Ballynahinch, and I know that all the district councillors there
                will be very keen to meet him and point out the problems that
                congestion is causing for the town.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the morning rush hour in Ballynahinch
                it is not unusual for traffic to be queued right back to the
                junction with the road to Downpatrick, the B2. If the Minister
                were to visit Ballynahinch between 5.30 pm and 5.45 pm, he would
                find the traffic tailed back to Carlisle’s garage, or it may
                even tail back to the junction with the Saintfield Road, the
                A21. Unless hon Members have had experience of sitting in such
                queues, it is very difficult for them to understand how
                frustrating it is for people who are trying to get home.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is having a dramatic impact on trade in
                Ballynahinch because many shoppers refuse to go there; because
                of the delays, they go elsewhere. It is simply not worthwhile
                sitting in a queue of traffic waiting to get through the town to
                go shopping. That has a knock-on effect on the town of
                Newcastle. Many people are dissuaded from going there because
                they know that no matter what way they travel, they are going to
                face a traffic bottleneck.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For the people who live in Ballynahinch —
                fortunately, people still live in the centre of the town — the
                environmental impacts are significant. In addition to the
                obvious noise and congestion, exhaust fumes cause pollution. The
                environmental impact of the large number of vehicles travelling
                through the town makes life unpleasant for the residents.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister is aware that there is a simple
                and obvious solution to this problem, and it is summed up by one
                word — &quot;bypass&quot;. A bypass should be built to take
                traffic around Ballynahinch. A bypass from the junctions of the
                Castlewellan Road and Downpatrick Road with the main Newcastle
                Road, sweeping around the town to come on via the Crossgar Road
                to the Belfast Road, would eliminate a huge proportion of the
                congestion in Ballynahinch.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unlike other congested areas in Northern
                Ireland, in Ballynahinch the land for a bypass is available.
                There is no problem with land acquisition. Not only is the land
                available, but there would be almost unanimous support for a
                bypass among the Ballynahinch community. It would not be another
                Twyford Down situation where people would be chaining themselves
                to the bulldozers or camping out in trees. The people of
                Ballynahinch want a bypass and would give the Minister full
                support when he came to cut the ribbon.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The projected cost of a bypass is in the
                region of £5 to £6 million. That is not a lot of money
                compared with other major schemes. That amount is quite small in
                relation to the overall budget at the disposal of the Minister
                for Regional Development. It is vital that the bypass be
                included in the major works preparation pool. There is a list of
                schemes that, subject to funding — and the Minister is always
                quick to add that caveat — will go ahead. It is unfortunate
                that the Ballynahinch bypass does not feature in that programme.
                Will the Minister explain why the bypass has not been included?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also ask the Minister — wearing another
                of his hats — to ensure that when the development plan for
                Ards and Down goes to the draft stage, the land for the
                Ballynahinch bypass is clearly zoned and marked on the
                appropriate map so that there is no doubt as to where it could
                go. There is a lot of land available but it is important that
                the route is defined on the map in the area plan. It is also
                important that that is put into the area plan as a policy so
                that it becomes imperative upon the Department to ensure that it
                goes ahead.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am concerned that when the area plan team
                recently consulted with the residents of Ballynahinch and
                Downpatrick they used phrases like &quot;The plan will offer the
                people of Down district an opportunity to explore solutions to
                traffic congestion problems in Ballynahinch.&quot; The residents
                of Down district do not want an opportunity to explore
                congestion; they want the congestion relieved. They want a
                bypass to take away the enormous problems that the town is
                facing.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Poots:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does my hon Friend accept that that does not
                only affect the residents of the Down District Council area? I
                represent the neighbouring constituency of Lagan Valley, and
                many people from my constituency travel through Ballynahinch to
                reach the services that are available in the Down district,
                particularly in Downpatrick where there is a Driver and Vehicle
                Licensing Agency office, an agriculture office and a planning
                office. The congestion problems are not solely the bailiwick of
                people who live in the Down district but also of the people who
                travel from the Lagan Valley constituency.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given his comments on the development that is
                due to take place in the Down area, would the Member consider
                private finance for that scheme? There may be an opportunity to
                have builders and developers donate money to get the road scheme
                off the ground.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Wells:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the hon Member for his intervention.
                He is correct. The snarl-up of traffic that exists in
                Ballynahinch not only affects the Down district, but also those
                who are travelling to and from Downpatrick or Lisburn. Anyone
                coming from Lisburn who wants to go to the southern part of
                County Down is more or less bound to use Ballynahinch.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am keen to retain services in Downpatrick,
                and I have asked the Minister a written question about his
                proposal to remove the street lighting section’s design and
                consultancy service from Downpatrick. I am keen to ensure that
                services are not centralised away from Downpatrick to the
                Greater Belfast area. However, that is a difficult argument to
                sustain when people say that they would love to establish in
                South Down but the snarl-up of traffic is a major problem. That
                is off-putting to employees and potential investors. I think
                that we have to crack this particular problem.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The third request I make of the Minister is
                that we gather accurate statistics on the number of vehicles
                using Ballynahinch town centre. I have quoted statistics
                collected in September 1998 and there is a great deal of
                variation between what is claimed by councillors who represent
                Ballynahinch and by the Department. I have quoted the more
                conservative figures, but others maintain that the figures are
                much higher. I understand that the Department has recently
                gathered more statistics and I made efforts to try to obtain
                those today, but for some mysterious reason — and I am not
                suggesting for one moment that anything underhand is going on
                — those statistics were not available for the debate. I am
                sure that the Minister will make them available to other Members
                and myself through a written question that I have tabled to him
                on this important subject.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the fact that the Minister has
                shown an interest in this matter and we are making preparations
                for his visit to Ballynahinch to see the problem at first hand.
                He will be met by a very strong cross-community delegation of
                people with all shades of opinions, who are awaiting his visit
                with bated breath.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the difficulties with Ballynahinch is
                that unless you live in the area and have to travel to South
                Down and back on a regular basis, you will not be aware of the
                problem. However, once you have experienced it, and once you
                have had the privilege of waiting for 40 minutes to get through
                the town on a wet winter’s night, you will know just how great
                a difficulty this is. I am saying to the Minister that £5
                million or £6 million will not put a huge hole in his capital
                programme, but it will do an awful lot to make life much better
                for the people of South Down.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr ONeill:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The plight of the people of Ballynahinch is
                very real every day. It is so obvious that even a passing
                motorist would see it — and, as Mr Wells has outlined, a
                passing motorist would have plenty of time to see it because he
                would be sitting there for many minutes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The people of Ballynahinch face that ordeal
                daily — the ordeal of serious traffic congestion, which
                creates great disruption to their lives. There is constant and
                increasing pressure from heavy vehicles — some huge
                transporters — on what is, essentially, a fine old market town
                with many good historic buildings, and I would like to return to
                that particular aspect a little bit later.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Consequently, I am very disappointed that
                again there is no provision for a ring road for Ballynahinch, or
                indeed any scheme earmarked for South Down, in the Department
                for Regional Development’s recently published preparation pool
                for planning. We have lobbied long and hard for road
                improvements, and the Minister has replied to several of my
                queries on this issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not sure whether the historical
                background to the situation in South Down, and in Down district
                in particular, is fully appreciated. Members might be interested
                to know that the old Down County Council had a very parsimonious
                attitude to road development. Consequently, they would only
                enter into schemes they had the money for, whereas other county
                councils would borrow money and keep the schemes going. The
                result was that Down, as a county, had difficulty catching up
                with modern road improvements.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">6.45 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All those points about the development of
                roads in our district were put together by Down District Council
                in a thorough presentation that has been with the Department for
                some time. The council’s report should be examined again, and
                we should consider the effects of the road infrastructure
                deficit. The Minister recently agreed to receive a cross-party
                delegation from Down Council on the issue. I hope that
                sympathetic consideration will be given to our plight.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today we are talking particularly about the
                bypass at Ballynahinch. I thank Mr&nbsp;Wells for bringing the
                matter before us. It is obvious that he has learned much about
                the difficulties that we face in the Ballynahinch area. The
                bypass is an absolute necessity. The present situation poses a
                serious threat to the social and economic future of our area. It
                is not just a bottleneck: it is a noose around the economic neck
                of the district south of Ballynahinch.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The problem is all the more significant
                because of the effort and resources that have been put into
                promoting tourism in the area south of Ballynahinch,
                particularly the greater Newcastle area. We have a ridiculous
                situation in which one arm of Government is trying to encourage
                economic development through tourism, while another arm
                constricts that development with an inefficient road system. The
                most important thing in tourism marketing is giving customers
                easy access to attractions. If families are forced to sit in the
                car on a hot summer’s day, while the traffic moves slowly
                through Ballynahinch, they will hardly be encouraged to return.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Statistics show that Newcastle and its
                hinterland depend not just on Edwin&nbsp;Poots’s people coming
                on official business — I agree with him that there are many
                such people — but on day trippers who come from Lisburn, as
                well as Belfast, into the area. The situation must be
                experienced if it is to be appreciated; I think that
                Jim&nbsp;Wells made the same point. The problem is there any day
                during peak times, but during the summer the amount of Sunday
                traffic in Ballynahinch is unbelievable. There are tailbacks of
                many miles in the morning and the evening. We talk about
                joined-up government, but we need to get our act together and
                make sure that investment in tourism is matched by investment in
                the roads.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I mentioned my concern about the effect on
                the busy historic market town of Ballynahinch. A recent survey
                revealed that 15,800 vehicles travelled through the town in one
                24-hour period. The Minister provided me with that information
                some time ago. If one compares the daily traffic figures for
                Toome, these are not that far away. I do not wish to mention
                that in particular, knowing your interest there, Mr Deputy
                Speaker — but why not? And yet, by general acclaim, there is a
                necessity for a ring road there. Why are we not getting the
                attention that we need in the Ballynahinch area?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I recognise the attempts by the Department
                for Regional Development to help the situation. Some of those
                have been imaginative. Everybody would agree that the most
                recent — the one-way system — has helped traffic circulation
                and the general traffic flow. It has not cured the problem, and
                it has created problems of pedestrian access and road crossing
                — but it has improved the overall situation. However, it does
                nothing to address the noise and air pollution mentioned by Jim
                Wells. That inevitably results in a deterioration in the quality
                of life.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The stability of the old buildings is another
                issue, and I do not exaggerate when I draw attention to that.
                From experience, Members will know that road hauliers are using
                larger and larger trucks to transport their goods. When these
                large vehicles come thundering through the narrow streets of
                Ballynahinch, the effect on old buildings is bound to be
                serious. I make this point in connection with the excellent work
                done by the Ballynahinch Regeneration Company in its attempt to
                restore the quality and fabric of the town centre. We should all
                pay tribute to those people who give up so much of their time to
                try to improve things. Battling against the odds, they have been
                very successful. If it is for no other reason than to assist and
                encourage the efforts of such a group, we should be able to
                persuade the Minister and his Department to do something to help
                with this roads problem.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is unfair to ask this one town to bear the
                brunt of this whole heavy demand. I believe — as does Down
                District Council, unanimously — that the only real solution is
                to direct traffic away from Ballynahinch by way of a ring road.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I urge the Minister, in the light of our plea
                today, to re-examine his decision not to include this scheme in
                the forthcoming work preparations pool.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the excellent point made by
                Jim Wells, the land is available for this, and it is estimated
                to be at a reasonable cost. It is also clearly outlined on a map
                in the possession of both the planners and the Department for
                Regional Development. It has been earmarked as a possible route.
                There is therefore nothing to prevent this project from going
                ahead except two very important things— the will and the
                finance.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr M Murphy:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.
                I support Jim Wells in bringing this matter to the attention of
                the House. It is a timely debate. I congratulate the Minister
                for attending this evening to listen to three people speaking on
                the subject. I appreciate his coming, and I hope that other
                Ministers will take a leaf out of his book.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The traffic flow scheme currently in place in
                Ballynahinch is incapable of coping with the level of traffic
                going through the town, and it causes the greatest
                inconvenience. The town is further brought to a halt, and is
                chaotic, each Thursday when the market-day traffic arrives.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My concern is that this not only hampers
                business, but is a serious risk to people’s safety. With a
                population of approximately 6,500, Ballynahinch is entitled to
                an adequate traffic flow scheme to ease the current congestion
                and put an end to serious disruption. The problem is detracting
                from the positive appeal of the town, as people do not want to
                come to Ballynahinch to sit in traffic jams.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am sorry to hear that Ballynahinch is not
                in the Department’s plan for improvement, and I hope that the
                Minister will give the matter further consideration. A range of
                options are open, the simplest of which is to create more
                parking spaces. That would help the flow of traffic. However,
                that is only a short-term policy. A more thorough proposal would
                be to provide a bypass, as mentioned by Mr Wells and Mr ONeill.
                That would increase the number of vehicles and provide better
                access to the business community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I propose that in looking at this plan the
                Minister should consider the reinstatement of the rail link from
                Belfast to Newcastle. That would be an alternative to a bypass
                and would be a great help to the town of Ballynahinch. It would
                also relieve the traffic congestion on the Saintfield Road to
                and from Belfast in the early mornings and evenings.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What about the tourist traffic into Newcastle
                in the summer months? I am sure that each and every one of us
                has experienced at some time or another sitting for perhaps an
                hour or two hours in the traffic into Newcastle. That includes
                people coming to and from their business. It has to be
                experienced for one to fully realise the problem.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My proposal for reinstating the rail link
                would not only ease that traffic problem but also be of benefit
                to the businesses of Ballynahinch and Newcastle, help the flow
                of tourism and also help the environment.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister for Regional Development (Mr
                Campbell):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am happy to respond to and deal with the
                issues raised.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ballynahinch is a town on the highway network
                formed by the intersection of the A24, which runs north/south
                between Belfast and South Down, and other routes which traverse
                County Down in an east/west direction, for example, Lisburn to
                Downpatrick. Ballynahinch is a market town that serves a large
                rural hinterland and, like many others in Northern Ireland, has
                grown in size and population in recent years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The traffic moving into and through the town
                has also increased significantly. It is generally acknowledged
                that at certain times of the day and week, drivers have
                experienced delays in approaching and travelling through
                Ballynahinch. This situation has existed for some time, with
                traffic progression frustrated by both the very large seasonal
                fluctuations, generated mostly by summer traffic destined for
                Newcastle, and the interaction of through and local traffic. It
                is further exacerbated by the presence of a number of secondary
                schools and on-street car parking.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In recognition of the traffic management
                problems in Ballynahinch, in 1996 Roads Service developed a
                strategy of short-, medium- and long-term objectives to improve
                traffic conditions in Ballynahinch. A review of waiting
                restrictions in the town centre was undertaken and modifications
                introduced to overcome localised problems caused primarily by
                on-street parking. A feasibility study of a one-way system
                around the town centre to improve traffic progression was
                assessed and the local community received the proposal
                favourably.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">7.00 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Following completion of the necessary
                statutory procedures and construction work, the one-way traffic
                system was introduced in the town centre in March 2000. I
                understand that this scheme has been reasonably successful in
                improving traffic progression and reducing queue lengths. I
                acknowledge Mr ONeill’s comments in that respect. I hope that
                everyone who is local to the area agrees that congestion has at
                least been reduced by the introduction of the one-way system.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Statutory procedures are currently ongoing
                for the introduction of noise pollution measures to eligible
                residential properties along the line of the one-way system.
                Concerns have been expressed about the speed of traffic using
                the one-way system and the implications for road safety. Of
                course, that would be when there are not massive tailbacks on
                the road. However, the accident records available for
                Ballynahinch indicate that in the three months prior to the
                introduction of the one-way system, three traffic accidents
                resulting in personal injury occurred, while in the six months
                since the introduction of the system, there has been one such
                accident. It is acknowledged that at off-peak times, the one-way
                system does increase opportunities for speeding.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is the opinion of Roads Service that the
                one-way system offers traffic management benefits in the medium
                term, but that ultimately these will be reduced by the
                continuing growth in traffic volumes. The long-term aim for
                traffic management in Ballynahinch is for the construction of a
                bypass to remove through traffic from the town centre. As
                Members will be aware, Roads Service has, for a number of years,
                considered the provision of a bypass for Ballynahinch. At this
                stage, a detailed design of the proposal has not been
                undertaken, but an indicative route to the eastern side of the
                town has been identified. As has been said, the proposal for the
                bypass was contained in the Roads Service six-to-15-year major
                works programme while that was the policy of Roads Service.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since the introduction of the major works
                preparation pool in July last year, there is an intention to
                consider schemes for inclusion in what is considered as the
                forward planning schedule for major road schemes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At this point I wish to refer to the remarks
                made by each of those who have spoken regarding the Ballynahinch
                bypass and its position, or lack of it, in respect of its being
                considered by Roads Service. As I said, the forward planning
                schedule is being considered, and the Ballynahinch bypass will
                be seriously considered for inclusion in that schedule.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although traffic volume is not the only
                criterion for consideration, or justification for such a bypass,
                the volume of traffic currently travelling through Ballynahinch
                is estimated to be approximately 15,000 vehicles a day, and the
                Roads Service has assessed that approximately 10,000 of those
                would use the bypass. That is the passing-through traffic, which
                is travelling north/south.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to refer to the figures that Mr
                Wells mentioned. There appears to have been confusion in some of
                the local press in the South Down area regarding the figures.
                Obviously, I cannot be responsible for those who take figures
                that are given to them and then put a construction upon them.
                The figure that was supplied to Mr ONeill is the figure that
                Roads Service currently has available to it, namely 15,000
                vehicles a day. Some of the South Down newspapers mentioned a
                figure as high as 30,000 vehicles. It would appear, however,
                that there were a number of roads for which a series of numbers
                of vehicles a day was given, and that — and I could not
                possibly accuse someone of using journalistic licence —
                someone has added the total users of various roads together and
                assumed that 15,000 on one road and 15,000 on another may have
                meant that 30,000 vehicles were going to be using the bypass.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Wells:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I accept the hon Member’s point. Does he
                accept that the figures I quoted of between 14,900 and 16,400
                are similar to what he is suggesting? Mr ONeill’s recent
                figure is also in the same ballpark. That being the case,
                traffic going through Ballynahinch town centre is on a par with
                other areas in the preparation pool. People in South Down want
                to know why Ballynahinch is outside the preparation pool when
                other similar — or less deserving — cases are being
                included.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Campbell:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Member for his comment. I
                referred to the numbers not because Mr Wells or any other Member
                had mentioned the higher figure, but a glance at local newspaper
                coverage of the Ballynahinch bypass issue indicated that the
                figures have been misunderstood. Mr Wells’s and Mr ONeill’s
                figures, and those mentioned in the House, are accurate, broadly
                speaking. The number of vehicles is approximately 15,000 per
                day. Mr Wells and the other Members are correct in saying that
                Ballynahinch ought to be considered.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I repeat what I said earlier: the forward
                planning schedule for major road schemes is currently being
                considered and the Ballynahinch bypass will be considered
                seriously. The schedule has not been prepared yet and the bypass
                has not been excluded from it. Until we see the final schedule,
                no road is automatically included. When the final schedule is
                available it will be clear which schemes are in and which are
                not.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When a scheme such as the Ballynahinch bypass
                is considered, it — like all other schemes — is measured
                against five criteria as outlined in the ‘Moving Forward’
                transport policy statement. These are integration, safety,
                economy, environment and accessibility. On that basis, a
                cost-benefit analysis will be carried out. The South Down
                representatives will say that Ballynahinch scores highly on each
                of these criteria. My problem as Minister for Regional
                Development is that almost every other scheme for which there
                are campaigns will also score highly. That is a problem I will
                have to consider.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There will also need to be consideration of
                the scheme in the context of new Down and Ards area plans which
                are currently being developed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The standard of design that the Roads Service
                would consider appropriate would be for a single carriageway
                construction approximately 3·5 km in length. At the moment,
                building costs for that would be approximately £5·5 million.
                The issue of cost was raised and it was referred to as a
                comparatively small amount. I can understand why Members would
                consider £5·5 million to be a comparatively small amount. If I
                did not have a whole series of road schemes to build, all of
                which would individually cost a comparatively small amount, my
                task would be easier.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In introducing the one-way system last year,
                the Roads Service was keen to provide pedestrian facilities in
                the town. This was done in two particular areas when the scheme
                was introduced. However, due to further pedestrian demand an
                additional pelican crossing was provided at the leisure centre
                on Windmill Street on Friday 26 January 2001. A further
                pedestrian refuge will be provided at the Windmill
                Street/Harmony Road junction, close to a large new store. I hope
                and trust that this will be of benefit to the pedestrians in
                Ballynahinch and will also enhance road safety.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of course, I am always keen to build and
                improve the infrastructure in Northern Ireland. Most obviously,
                this can be done through improvements in the road network.
                However, as my predecessors and I have made clear on many
                occasions, that has to be achieved through a finite budget. In
                his closing comments Mr ONeill said that the two things that
                were required were the will and the finance. I can assure him
                that the will is here and will continue to be present.</p>

                try and deliver road schemes. You could argue that that has no
                direct impact on Ballynahinch, as it is not currently in the
                five-year building programme. However, the schemes currently in
                that programme have a higher priority than Ballynahinch. That
                would not change if delays were imposed on the earlier schemes.
                The knock-on effect would mean that there would be delays right
                down the line. As I have said on many occasions, to build roads
                I need the appropriate level of funding. I hope that Members
                remember that when they next have an opportunity to consider
                budget levels.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I understand the frustration faced by those
                in the Ballynahinch area and those who wish to travel through
                it, and I will repeat the remarks made during the debate. The
                will is most definitely there in respect of Ballynahinch — the
                finance is something that I have to negotiate and argue for. I
                hope and expect to receive the support of Members in
                endeavouring to obtain the necessary finance.</p>
