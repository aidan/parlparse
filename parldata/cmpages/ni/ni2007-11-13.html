		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The Assembly met at 10.30 am (Mr Speaker in the  Chair).</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Members observed two minutes&rsquo; silence.</p>
		    <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="1"></a>Assembly Business</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Before we deal with the business on today&rsquo;s Order Paper, I must inform the  Assembly that I have been approached by Members from all sides of the House  about the tragedy that occurred in Omagh last night. Our thoughts and prayers  are with the immediate family circle.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Members have also approached me about the attempted murders  of two police officers &mdash; one last night in the Fermanagh and South Tyrone  constituency, and one last week in the Foyle constituency in County <span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt; ">Londonderry. I know that the prayers of the whole  Ho</span>use are with those two police officers and their families.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. <span style="letter-spacing:-.05pt; ">My  attention is drawn to a point of order that was mad</span>e during yesterday&rsquo;s  proceedings by the Member for Strangford Mr McNarry. His intervention appears  to represent an attempt to make an ex-post-facto point of order in respect of a  matter that occurred the previous week. Mr Speaker, I do not expect an  immediate ruling from you on this matter, but I would appreciate your giving it  further consideration.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Speaker, when the event to which the Member <span style="letter-spacing:-.25pt; ">referred occurred, you were in the Chair, and any  Member </span>could have raised a point of order at the conclusion of Question  Time that day. None chose to do so. I wonder to what extent Members can have  their researchers trawl through the records of proceedings of this House and,  at some later date, ask you to rule on issues.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  I am making a point of order.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Order. The Member must take his seat. Mr Robinson has the  Floor.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  Mr Speaker, if it is permissible, it will give you a volume of work that will,  perhaps, be unwelcome. In particular, everyone knows that the Member who raised  the point of order is one of the <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt; ">worst-behaved  Members. I could find a massive num</span>ber of his breaches of Standing Orders.  We must know whether these matters can be dealt with ex post facto, or whether  they must be dealt with promptly and at the time, as is suggested in Erskine  May.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: This point of order was raised yesterday, and I said to all  sides of the House that I would deal <span style="letter-spacing:-.2pt; ">with  the issue at a later date. Furthermore, I told Members</span> that they should not prejudge my decision on the  matter.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I will take points of order from Mr McNarry and from Mr  Wilson.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  My choosing today was not to raise the matter; I have left it to your good  offices to respond to the House. I understand that a particular problem is that  you cannot refer the matter to the House until the Member who was mentioned  yesterday is present. I mentioned that yesterday, and I understand that you are  reflecting on it.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">If I could say to the Member who has just spoken &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  No, you cannot.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  If I may be allowed to finish, I say through you, Mr Speaker, that it ill  becomes this House when &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order, order. I ask the Member to take his seat. Yesterday, I told all sides of  the House that I would deal with the issue, and I will deal with it. I do not  intend to say any more about it in the Chamber this morning.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  On a point of order, we need a ruling on how  long after an event in the House a point of order can be raised. That  was the context of this morning&rsquo;s original point of order. Is the timescale a  day, a week, or is it a month?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I ask the Member to take his seat. I have already said that I will deal with  the issue. I will not deal with it this morning, and I have said that to all  sides of the House.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  ask you to consider whether the first point of order raised today was valid.  Regarding the reference of the person who raised it, since he was &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. Let us allow the House to move on. I have already dealt with the issue.  I will take a different point of order.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr W McCrea</strong>:  On a point of order, the matter to which you referred yesterday is completely  different to the matter referred to by my Rt Hon friend today. His point has  not been raised before; therefore, it is a pertinent  point of order on which you have not reflected, and my Rt Hon friend has  asked you to do so.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I assure the Member that all points of order will be reflected upon &mdash; very much  so.</p>
		    <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="2"></a>Executive Committee Business</p>
		    <p class="H4StageHeading">Local Government &mdash; &nbsp;Review of Public Administration</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Business Committee has allowed up to  two hours for the debate. The Minister will propose the motion, and all other speakers will have five  minutes. One amendment has been received and published on the Marshalled List. The proposer of the  amendment &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  On a point of order &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member will please take his seat.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The proposer of the amendment will have 10 minutes to  propose and five minutes for the winding-up speech.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I will take the Member&rsquo;s point of order.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I was too quick, Mr Speaker, and I apologise.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  As this motion relates to local govern&shy;ment,  I am sure that many Members will want to declare an interest before  speaking in the debate, which is important. I am conscious that quite a number  of Members are still involved in local  authorities in Northern    Ireland. It is important that they  declare an interest in what might be discussed here this morning.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment (Mrs Foster)</strong>: I beg to move</p>
		    <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly notes the emerging findings of the review  of the Review of Public Administration decisions, as they relate to local  government, and the initial proposals for the future of local government.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I do not have to declare an interest as I have now  left local government.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Before I move to the substantive matter before the House, I  want to refer to two other matters. First, I abhor absolutely the attempted  murder of a police officer in my constituency last night. I spoke to the  district commander then and again this morning, and he told me that he is  content with the co-operation that he is receiving from the community. I am pleased  about that. However, we must ensure, as leaders in our constituencies, that we  are unequivocal in what we say about those issues and that we ensure that the  people responsible are brought to justice. As someone who has been the victim  of terrorism in the past, I empathise with the officer and his loved ones, and  I assure them of my prayers.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, I turn to the very distressing news from Omagh  this morning. It is distressing to listen to the reports, never mind to look at  what happened last night. The nightmarish scenes are almost too difficult to  take in. All that I and others can say is how much we sympathise with the  family circle. I pray for them at this very difficult and painful time.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the opportunity for the Assembly to debate local  government. When I launched the review of the previous Administration&rsquo;s review  of public administration (RPA) decisions in relation to local government, I  gave a commitment to engage with stakeholders as the review proceeded. The  Assembly has a clear interest in the outcome of the review and the Executive&rsquo;s  proposals for the way ahead.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Now that the emerging findings of the review, which  represent the Executive&rsquo;s initial &mdash; and I stress the word &ldquo;initial&rdquo; &mdash; proposals  for the future shape of local government have been published, it is timely for  Members to be given an opportunity to express their views. That is particularly  relevant as the Executive subcommittee that I chair looks forward to receiving  and considering carefully and fully the views of stakeholders as the three strands of the review are drawn together and the final recommendations are considered.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The review of public administration was set up by the  Northern Ireland Executive in 2002 to deliver wide-ranging and comprehensive  modernisation and reform to the public sector. The full range of RPA decisions  was included in two announcements in November 2005 and in March 2006. The  decisions of the previous Administration in relation to local government can be  summarised as: the creation of seven councils; the transfer of a significant  range of functions to the new councils from central Government and other  bodies; the development of a new council-led statutory community-planning  process; and the power of well-being.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The local government task force, led by the former Minister with responsibility for the Department  of the Environ&shy;ment and with representatives from the Northern Ireland  Local Government Association (NILGA) and from the five main political parties  in the Assembly, was established to lead the implementation of the RPA  decisions. It also led a parallel and integrated process of modernisation  within local government, addressing issues such as governance, finance,  estates, shared services, the relationship between central Government and local  government, performance management and capacity building.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The task force also produced some very good work,  particularly in relation to the modernisation of local government. However, it  must be said that four out of the five political parties represented on the task  force participated on the basis that they remained funda&shy;mentally opposed to  the seven-council model that had been agreed by the previous Administration and  that their participation was without prejudice to that firmly held position.</p>
		    <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr McClarty] in the Chair)</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">10.45 am</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, although NILGA and the political parties were  committed to the development of strong and effective local government, to  varying degrees, they expressed concerns about several of the functions that  the previous Administration agreed should transfer to local government once  seven new councils had been created. They also questioned the adequacy of the  economic appraisal that underpinned the previous Administration&rsquo;s decision.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Transitional Assembly echoed and confirmed that debate,  both in the Chamber and in the work of the Programme for Government Committee.  That Comm&shy;ittee&rsquo;s work on the matter culminated in the publication on 23  January 2007 of its &lsquo;Report on Review of Public Administration and Rural Planning&rsquo;.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Following restoration of devolved Government on 8 May, the Executive reviewed the progress that had  been made in implementing the RPA. They considered the strategic  direction of the implementation programme, and,  in that context, it was agreed that I would implement a review of the  previous Administration&rsquo;s decisions on local government. The Executive agreed  detailed terms of reference for that review, which was launched on 6 July 2007.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Given the number of councils and functions that we believe  will be required, the review is considering what we expect local government to  deliver in the context of a fully functioning devolved Assembly and Executive  and in the context of the strategic direction of the review of public  administration. I remind the House that there are three strands to the review:  first, developing a shared vision for local government; secondly, revisiting  decisions that were made on the number of councils, while limiting that figure  to the three original RPA options of seven, 11 or 15; and thirdly, considering  the functions that will transfer to local government &mdash; again limiting that to  those that were identified for transfer in the final RPA announcements of the previous Administration. We are also considering  the previous Administration&rsquo;s decision on the develop&shy;ment of a council-led  community-planning process and on the complementary power of well-being.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Over the summer months, consultants undertook desk research  to establish the characteristics of local government in Northern Ireland and elsewhere, including the  other United Kingdom  jurisdictions, the Republic   of Ireland and further  afield. The consultants also facilitated several stakeholder interviews and  events to test the findings of that research. In parallel, the Executive  Committee&rsquo;s subcommittee, which I chair, met three times. That subcommittee  comprises me and my ministerial colleagues from the Department of Finance and  Personnel (DFP), the Department for Regional Development (DRD), the Department  for Social Development (DSD) and the Department of Health, Social Services and  Public Safety (DHSSPS). In addition, I also held several bilateral meetings  with other Executive colleagues.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">That work has culminated in the emerging findings report  that I published on 18 October 2007. I will not rehearse the details of that  paper, but I assume that Members will raise some of its findings with me.  However, I will discuss some of its key points. Our vision is to create local  government that will improve quality of life and create communities that are  sustainable, vibrant, healthy, prosperous, stable and, above all, people  centred. Discussions are continuing on the number and configuration of councils  that can best deliver our vision.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, the issues are complex. A considerable volume of  material and commissioned research informs those discussions. Although there is  a need for, and benefits to be drawn from, the reduction of some of the  existing diversity that lies between councils, there is also a need to balance that reduction by creating local councils that are of a size that allows  communities to identify and interact with them.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Proposals for an initial package of functions that should  transfer to local government are presented for discussion in the emerging  findings report. I know that local government representatives &mdash; and others &mdash;  have expressed concern and disappointment about the scale and nature of the  functions that are to be transferred. I understand the reason for that concern.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The process of further stakeholder engagement is not yet  complete, and my ministerial colleagues and I will want to hear and consider  fully all stakeholders&rsquo; views on the initial package before we finalise our  decisions. We arranged several stakeholders&rsquo; meetings, and although the meeting  in Cookstown was well attended and some forthright views were expressed, I must  say that I am disappointed that 15 officials but few councillors attended  yesterday&rsquo;s meeting in Armagh. I hope that  that situation is not replicated in the meetings that take place later this  week.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I stress that the proposals outlined in the emerging  findings report mark the beginning of a process of reform and modernisation of  local government. Achieving strong, effective and efficient local govern&shy;ment  is a long-term process that will require sustained effort over a considerable  number of years. Based on experience elsewhere in the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland  and beyond, the delivery of the vision for  local government will not be achieved through a single set of reform  proposals, no matter how well devised those proposals may be. We must continue  to develop the role of local government, as well as the relationship among the  Assembly, the Executive and local government, for many years to come. We  cannot, and will not, allow previous direct  rule Administrations&rsquo; wanton neglect of local government to continue.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As I said earlier, the Executive subcommittee, and the Executive as a whole, will wish to  consider fully and carefully all  stakeholders&rsquo; views, including those of MLAs, members of the Committee for the Environment and the  public, before final decisions are taken on the future shape of local  government. I shall discuss those views as they emerge with my colleagues on  the Executive subcommittee, with other  Executive Ministers through bilateral meetings, and with my colleagues  on the Local Government Task Force&rsquo;s  strategic leadership board before final recommendations are put to the  Executive Committee for discussion and agreement.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important to take time to consider all the issues  before final recommendations are put to the Executive. It is also important to  ensure that we conclude the review process quickly, in order that we can bring  an end to the current frustration and uncertainty that exists over local government.  Both councillors and staff, for whom I have a great deal of sympathy, are  affected by that uncertainty, as is the wider community. I aim to conclude the  review and report to the Executive before the end of January 2008 and to make a  statement to the Assembly as early as possible in February.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Before I conclude, I should say something about what  happens after the review process is completed. We will want to implement an  agreed reform and modernisation package as quickly as possible. Our aim will be  to implement that agreed package by 2011. I recognise that to do so will  require sustained effort and genuine engagement between central Government and  local government to ensure that the agreed package is implemented  professionally and with care. I want to ensure the smoothest possible  transition from our current structures and arrangements to those that we  believe will provide stronger, more effective local government for all Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  citizens. I look forward to working with my Executive colleagues, the Assembly,  the Committee for the Environment and, importantly, colleagues in local  government &mdash; through the strategic  leadership board and other Local Govern&shy;ment Task Force elements &mdash; in a true  spirit of partnership and shared endeavour in order to achieve that transition.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Since I came to office, my engagement with local government  has been very positive &mdash; at least, I think that it has been. I have very much  enjoyed the time that I have been able to share with local government  colleagues.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank you, Mr Deputy  Speaker, for this opportunity for the House to consider the motion. I  look forward to hearing Members&rsquo; views, and  I will, I assure you, listen most carefully to what they have to say.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I beg to move the following amendment: At end, insert</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;; and calls on  the Executive to transfer meaningful and significant functions to local  government.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">At the outset, I wish to declare two interests, which are  already noted in the Register of Members&rsquo; Interests. I am a member of Lisburn  City Council and, because I wish to say a few words on yesterday&rsquo;s events in  Dungannon, I should declare that I am a member of the Policing Board.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We tabled the amendment because we were very disappointed  about the information that has been provided to date. When the Minister  launched the review on 6 July 2007, she promised that its purpose was to ensure  that:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;we can deliver the change which will achieve the  strong, effective and efficient local government that we all want.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, something obviously needs to be done. However,  that is not what we have. What we have instead, and I can almost hear Sir  Humphrey&rsquo;s Civil Servicespeak, is a mask. A complete U-turn &mdash; an about-face &mdash; has been performed on what was promised  before the Assembly was restored. The review amounts not to a tweak, but to a  fundamental review that is taking us nowhere. That is one of the main reasons  why we on these Benches are bringing the matter to the Minister&rsquo;s attention.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister also said at the review&rsquo;s launch that she was:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;committed to working in partnership with a range of  stakeholders to win consensus&rdquo;.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">If that is the case, we have not got off to a very  good start. The Northern Ireland Local Government Association, on which many  Members sit, has expressed the utmost dismay about the emerging findings. I  will quote from the key findings following the robust meeting in Cookstown,  which the Minister mentioned. It states that the feeling:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;was one of disappointment, frustration, concern and,  in some cases, anger.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That does not sound like much of a move towards  consensus. One of the major problems emerging at that meeting, which was  summarised by PricewaterhouseCoopers, was that there was an:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;implied lack of  respect for local government&rsquo;s capacity to deliver.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That is a slap in the face to all those who work  hard in local government.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Linked to that was the suggestion from members of NILGA  that there is no point in having a review of public administration if no powers  are to be transferred. If 5% of work is  already being carried out by local government, and only 1&middot;5% more work  is going to be transferred, why should we bother with the review of public  administration? There will be cost inefficiencies should we decide to proceed  on that basis. Unless we are going to make a step change, the review is a  complete waste of time and an expensive waste of money.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Other items arising at  the meeting were that councils were concerned about their lack of clout  and that there is definitely an imbalance  between local government and central government. How can people be  expected to do their work when their views  are not taken into account?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The summary also discussed other issues that we were  promised would be looked at, such as double-jobbing, and how someone could be  in two places at the same time. Is there any conflict of interest involved when  people sit in this House and make decisions on matters that impact on councils?  The Assembly must deal with that issue, which is a more serious problem than  people think. The people of Northern    Ireland have a fundamental expectation that  politicians should do something &mdash; to date, they have done very little, and that  leads to statements such as the one I heard last night from one of the  political commentators who said that, although there are some problems, the  Assembly is fundamentally stable. I beg to differ.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The sinister events in Dungannon last night, and those that occurred previously in Londonderry, threaten to undermine the democratic  process in which we are now engaged. It is important that society does not  return to the old ways, and to ensure that that does not happen, people need to  see action: they need to see us doing something.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I have been here for six months and I have seen nothing but  people talking.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Yes, I will give way: make it your best shot.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  You can bet your life on that.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member has mentioned dual mandates. Will he tell the  House, as a relative newcomer to the Assembly and to local government, how he  is able to be in two places at once, because I suspect that he is no more  superhuman than anyone else in the House? Will he also recognise that in the  previous Assembly, when his party was the  leading party, the Members on the Benches opposite were allowed to sit  in Government while their army was fully armed? His party had no problems in  sitting with them in Government on three occasions.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Thank you for that short, sharp intervention. I am at a complete loss to  understand why the Member has not addressed the issue of treble-jobbing, given  that he is a Member in another place. What gives him the right to criticise me?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The point is that we must address such issues. Five years  ago, we were promised a review of public administration. So far, all that has  been decided is that we should go back to the drawing board and start again.  What kind of progress is that? People look to their councillors to make local  decisions; they think that councils have  more powers than they actually have.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  No, I will not give way. Lord Morrow has already spoken. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Deputy Speaker, is it &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  It is apparent that the dogs of war are straining at their leashes; although  perhaps they are the poodles of peace.</p>

		    <p class="B3BodyText">This is a serious issue. We need to find a way to engage  with local people on local issues. Where better to do that than at council  level? We must give them not only the power but the responsibility to make a  difference. That is what we are supposed to be doing, what we said we would do,  and precisely what we are not doing. That is why my party has brought this  amendment to the House.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There is also the issue of how to get other sections of the  community involved. That is what this is all about. It is not enough to say  that we have the same people in the same place. There are people who have  provided sterling service for a long time, but it is also true that we need to  find a way of bringing new people &mdash; people from different genders and different  races &mdash; into our democratic process. One of the easier ways to do that would be to bring them in through the  councils.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister said that there was not such a good turnout in  Armagh &mdash; I wonder why. If there is no power,  there is no interest. The councillors saw in Cookstown that this was a complete  and utter farce and a complete waste of time. Unless we are going to be serious  about this, how can we expect people to give their time to go and do things?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We hear these sweet words: the Civil Service is brilliant  at bringing them out. However, where is the real vision? Where can we actually  get things done?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. I take great exception to the Member  saying that the words I spoke this morning were Civil Service words. They were  my words. I take great exception to that, and ask him to withdraw.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: That is not a point of order. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Order.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  It is interesting that those who argued long and hard at the start of this  sitting about points of order now appear not to understand the rules.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We are here to debate the issue. The Minister said that she  wanted to hear from all of us, but now that we are telling her what we have to  say, she does not want to hear any more. These messages are coming loud and  clear, not just from these Benches but from NILGA and other interested parties,  and she should take them on board.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Where are we now? Dead slow and stop. The people of Northern Ireland  will ask what we are for. What is it that we are going to do? You have grabbed  control &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is good to see that there is still a bit of life there.  For a minute, I thought that they had gone to sleep.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The key point is that there are people in this House who  talk about equality. What we are really talking about is empowerment. We have  to empower local representatives to serve the people, do their best for Northern Ireland  and make sure that we all go forward in a positive future. That is what this is  about, that is what this policy wants to do, and that is why this party has put  forward this amendment, which I commend to the House.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  start by declaring an interest, like Mr McCrea, as a local councillor. I  suspect that, given the plethora of declarations of interest that we are going  to have, this will resemble the start of an AA meeting more than the Northern Ireland Assembly. I also declare an  interest as a vice-president of the Northern Ireland Local Government  Association, which Mr McCrea has referred to, and I welcome my colleagues from  NILGA who are here today.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In looking at this issue, we have to ask why we are here in  the first place. Mr McCrea has castigated the Executive for starting again.  Perhaps he has forgotten one of the principal reasons why we have started  again, which is that, under direct rule, a seven-council model was to be  imposed. My understanding is that the Ulster Unionist Party was opposed to that  model. Perhaps the Member for Lagan   Valley has had some sort  of Damascene conversion and actually wants to simply put that in place. We made  it very clear that we were not prepared to accept that model.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Indeed there are deficiencies in the emerging findings document,  which I will address later. My party does not have a problem with the amendment  but does have a problem with the UUP, Pontius  Pilate-like, washing its hands of the emerging findings. They emanated  from an Executive subcommittee, and an Executive, on which all four parties  that are in Govern&shy;ment are represented,  including the party of the proposers of the amendment. When Members  castigate the lack of powers being given to  local government, they should remember that the Northern Ireland Fire  and Rescue Service, for example, which comes under the remit of the Department  of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, is controlled by an Ulster  Unionist Minister. We should at least acknowledge the fact that there are  deficiencies in the emerging findings.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  For clarity&rsquo;s sake, will the Member enlighten the House as to who represented  the Ulster Unionist Party so effectively on the Executive subcommittee? That  person has quite singularly failed to satisfy the Member for Lagan Valley,  and Members need to be aware of the identities of the guilty people on this  issue.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: My  understanding is that the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety  represented the Ulster Unionist Party. He also seems to have a problem in  agreeing a Budget and subsequently not agreeing it.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I now move on to the substance of the report. Under the  emerging findings, you are left &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order, order. Mr Weir, please address your remarks through the  Chair.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: Mr  Deputy Speaker, I am happy to address my remarks through the Chair.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The emerging findings are something of a curate&rsquo;s egg, with  some good parts and some bad parts. Some findings have already been welcomed in  NILGA&rsquo;s report. I welcome the fact that local councillors will have direct  control over the vast bulk of planning issues and local development, which have  been a source of major frustration. Community planning powers will allow  councillors a greater say in shaping their local areas, and although finance  and personnel issues have not been fulfilled, it shows that not all powers are  linked to those facets. That will make a difference. The Committee for the  Environment has been told that vesting powers will be given to local councils,  and there has been a begrudging admission that regeneration powers will also be  given. I welcome that fact that councils will have increased economic  development and tourism powers.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, the report falls short in several areas, in that  Ministers have been overcautious. The failure to give councils some control  over local roads must be re-examined. Roads Service should retain control of  strategic direction, but there are advantages to villages, towns and cities  having some control over local roads. If local economic development powers are  to be increased, perhaps some of Invest NI&rsquo;s land bank might be better used if  it were handed over to councils. Control of the Youth Service would fit neatly  within local community development powers, as would local libraries, even if  they were in some form of unitary structure. Local government could also handle  certain public health and housing issues.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">When local government seeks control of further areas, it is  not simply in order to get its hands on power; rather it is because certain  issues are best decided at a local level. The key issue is what is of most  benefit to local people. To that end, there is much to welcome in the emerging  findings, but they have also been too cautious.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. First and foremost, I thank the  Minister for tabling the take-note motion. As regards the theatrical  introduction of Basil McCrea&rsquo;s amendment, I remind Basil, as other Members have  done, that his own party colleague is a member of the Executive subcommittee  that produced the emerging findings report.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in shares the  sentiment behind the amendment about  transferring meaningful power to local government.By the same token, I  remind Basil and the other parties that, from day one, Sinn F&eacute;in has  strenuously argued that it would not support  any additional functions being transferred to local government unless  firm, statutory equality protections were  built into their running and governance.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Throughout the work of the task force, subgroups and so on, Basil&rsquo;s party has steadfastly refused  to sign up to meaningful and  acceptable governance arrangements. Although  that section of the task force&rsquo;s work has never yet been completed, if  parties ask Sinn F&eacute;in to support the transfer of additional functions &mdash; or any  changes to local government, because the emerging findings paper does not set  anything in stone; it is a work in progress &mdash; they must bear in mind that Sinn  F&eacute;in will not support such changes unless firm, guaranteed equality and  protective measures are built into the running and governance of local  government. That is the baseline from which  Sinn F&eacute;in will judge any future discussions on the RPA.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Except for the number of councils, Sinn F&eacute;in and the other  parties agreed with the previous &mdash; albeit direct rule &mdash; Administration&rsquo;s  findings. All parties were involved in the task force, the nine subgroups and  the discussions with other stakeholders, including trade unions,  local-government officials and many other sectors with a stake in local  government. Although some of those deliberations have yet to be completed, all  the parties signed up for that package at that time, except for the number of  councils. Therefore, if those parties now prefer change, they must understand  that there are consequences. From the outset, Sinn F&eacute;in did not advocate a  review of the review of public admin&shy;istration. It was prepared to build on the  previous discussions in order to finish the task and to complete implementation  of the RPA.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Although Sinn F&eacute;in was the only political party to support the seven-council model, the only  opposition to the idea came from the  other political parties. Of course, that is important; however, every  other stakeholder wanted the smallest  possible number of councils. During those deliberations, it was easy to  attack Sinn F&eacute;in and to argue about cantonisation and the polarisation of local  government, but not so easy to face the reality that going from a smaller to a larger number of councils would  logically mean that Ministers and Departments, not wanting their services  fragmented further, would resist. Not only the Ministers and Departments but  every other sector in society argued equally forcefully against having a  greater number of councils, on the basis that services would be further  fragmented, harder to deliver and cost more money &mdash; valid reasons that still  pertain today.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Other parties that are asking for change might get what they wish for, but not what they want. They  should bear in mind that if their choice is for more than seven  councils, which they are entitled to argue for and might get, the price to be  paid will inevitably be that fewer functions will be transferred to local  government.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In the past week, other parties, people involved in NILGA  and others have approached Sinn Fein to ask what it will do about this matter.  We are saying &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Time.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  I want to stress the importance of statutory safeguards, about which there is  no detail in the Minister&rsquo;s paper. Without those safeguards and protections,  the SDLP will not sign up to any changes to  local government. When the details have been agreed, they should be  subjected to a cross-community vote in the Assembly. That is the only real  protection that there can be in order to arrive at equitable arrangements.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">11.15 am</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The subtitle of the review of local government aspects of  the review of public administration report is &ldquo;emerging findings&rdquo;. That is a  misnomer and a contradiction, because very  little emerges from the report. That is disappointing, but it is more  disappointing that the review team conducted no meaningful engagement with  stakeholders, particularly with elected members of councils, who have been kept  very much in the dark.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As we have heard from the Minister, the report says nothing specific about council numbers. What does  that mean? Does it mean that, despite all the opposition to the seven-council  model, the people who are working on the RPA still want to impose an English  model of local government that will be  totally inappropriate here? Do they  think that they will get away with the wholesale closure of council  offices west of the Bann and the stripping of more jobs from areas of high  deprivation?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Could it be that they are being so guarded about council  numbers because they believe that people in rural communities, especially in  the west, will accept <span style="letter-spacing:.15pt; ">civic councils that  feed into the deliberations of larger </span>councils?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">If that is the hidden agenda, I wish to send out a clear  message: ratepayers in rural areas, particularly in the west, will not be  conned. They will not accept any second-rate, lower-level arrangements that  will leave them powerless and voiceless. People who live in the west have  suffered enough of the deprivation and marginalisation that has resulted in  poor roads and little investment.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As some Members will know, people in urban as well as rural  areas are already worried about increases in their rate bills, not to mention  the further burden of water charges.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  I will not give way.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Whatever the final number of councils may be, an equal  spread of the wealth across all councils and a fair distribution of the rates burden is the very least to which the  public are entitled. That requirement is paramount to the SDLP.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">For all the supposed  commitment to strengthening local government, to improving efficiency and to subsidiarity, it appears from the review paper  that, apart from some functions of  the Department of Culture, Arts and  Leisure (DCAL) and the Department for Social Development, few functions  will transfer from central Government. The Departments appear to want to <span style="letter-spacing:.05pt; ">continue to hold on to as much power as possible  at the </span>centre.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">At least the SDLP Minister,  Margaret Ritchie, has made it clear that her Department will transfer  urban-regeneration and community-development delivery functions, for which  there are significant budgets, to local councils.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department of  Education, which does not deal well with school transport, among other issues,  wants to keep everything. The Department of Health, Social Services and Public  Safety, which certainly does not provide emergency cover very well, wants to  hold on to everything. The Office of the First Minister and deputy First  Minister, which does not appear to be dealing at all with trying to achieve a  shared future, wants to hold on to everything.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department for Regional Development, which had been  expected to transfer responsibility for roads back  to councils, has failed to invest in road improvement in the west yet  wants to retain that power at the centre. DRD has failed to maintain rural  roads and provide winter gritting programmes. That is unacceptable. If councils  are to play a meaningful role in local economic development, they must have responsibility for local roads.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Neeson</strong>: I  declare an interest: I have been an elected member of Carrickfergus Borough  Council for 30 years. In fact, I am the longest-serving member on that council,  and I am very proud of the achievements of local government.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, there is great uncertainty about the future of  local government in Northern    Ireland, and if reform is to be meaningful,  local government must have meaningful powers. The Minister is well aware of  recent criticisms about what appears to be a future reduction in the powers of  local councils, and greater clarity on that matter is required.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Members are aware of the need for the reform of local  government in Northern Ireland  &mdash; 26 councils are far too many for Northern Ireland. However, it is  unfortunate that the reform of local government is taking place in isolation  from a review of central government, and I have always been critical of that.  Eleven Departments are far too many for Northern Ireland, and Members know  that they were created artificially in order to appoint 11 Ministers. That  issue needs to be considered also.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The &lsquo;Review of Local Government Aspects of the Review of  Public Administration: Emerging Findings&rsquo; report contains interim plans for  consultation, and I hope that that consultation is meaningful. The report,  which was produced by an Executive subcommittee comprising four Ministers,  outlines how they intend to proceed with the review of public administration as  it relates to local government. NILGA has responded critically to the report,  and the Alliance Party supports NILGA&rsquo;s stance. NILGA&rsquo;s paper must be considered  seriously as part of the consultation process.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Alliance Party supports the rationalisation of health  boards; a single education authority with a special duty to promote integrated  education, and, believe it or not, a reduction in the number of quangos. We  also support the transfer of urban regeneration, minor roads powers and local  planning functions to local government.  Consideration should be given to the options  of having either 11 or 15 councils. Furthermore, we support the  Community Relations Council&rsquo;s challenge function regarding decisions made at  local level on community investment funds; shared civic offices;  weighted-majority voting for key decisions, and a new local government  watchdog.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Alliance Party has three broad concerns about the  emerging findings report. First, there is a lack of attention to good corporate  governance and how that may be improved through local government reform.  Secondly, there is no reference to financing: it makes little sense for  councils to have expanded powers and no means of expanding their incomes.  Thirdly, there is no clarity about what has been learned from good practice  elsewhere. For example, there has been a dramatic reduction in the number of  local councils in Denmark;  and there have been significant reforms in the Republic  of Ireland and across Great Britain.  However, there is scant evidence that any account has been taken of those  examples.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Regarding economic responsibilities, I am pleased that my own council &mdash; Carrickfergus Borough  Council &mdash; has taken a proactive  approach on economic develop&shy;&shy;ment. If local councils are to have real  powers, issues such as the vesting of land must be considered.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Councils throughout Northern Ireland have been  proactive in promoting local tourism to great effect. The main priority of the  Programme for Government is growing the economy. However, if the economy is to  grow, local councils must have the necessary powers.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  Given the number of contradictions that there have been during this debate, the  Minister will have difficulty in responding to the issues raised. Mr Neeson  talked about the Alliance Party&rsquo;s desire to do away with quangos. Members know  that, when Alliance Party members get together, their favourite game is not  &lsquo;Who Wants To Be a Millionaire?&rsquo;, but rather &ldquo;Who wants a quango chair?&rdquo;.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">They have had plenty of  them; it is their own job-creation scheme that has been scuppered by Mr Neeson.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP talks about devolving more powers to local councils, yet its Minister is the one who  is holding on, as tightly as she can, to such functions as urban  regeneration, housing responsibilities and so on. The Ulster Unionist Party has  complained about the delay, but it was the party which rightly said, along with  the DUP, that the proposed number of  councils was unsuit&shy;able and that there should be more time to  reconsider that issue, along with a whole range of other matters.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">So there have been contradictions in the debate &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. Where a Member has a number of mandates  &mdash; more than a dual mandate &mdash; is it correct that he should declare his  interests?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: At the beginning of the debate, the Speaker said that Members  should declare their interests.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  I apologise for not declaring my interests. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">My interests are  declared in the Register of Members&rsquo; Interests, and, therefore, they  were declared before the debate began.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I will make three points in relation to the debate. First  of all, time. Some Members have alleged that we are delaying matters further,  but this will be a once-in-a-lifetime change for local government. We have  inherited some of this from a direct rule Administration that viewed the RPA through direct rule eyes.  Following devolution, certain things need to be looked at in a different  way &mdash; I will refer to some of those in a moment. Time should be taken over the  process, and if that means that we must delay it a little, it is far better to  shape it correctly than to rush in and do something on the basis of what the direct rule Ministers said. There is also the issue of building capacity at local  government level. That requires work, and it will take time.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, there needs to be commitment from Ministers to  devolve certain functions. I have already mentioned  DSD. I could also mention the DUP Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure:  he should look again at the library function, which, I believe, fits much  better at local government level. The Minister of Education should consider  whether youth services might be devolved to  local councils. Some of the things predicted in our Programme for  Government may have to be reconsidered.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Lastly, some  imagination is required. Some functions are to be devolved to local  government, but that may not mean that they are simply handed down. Earlier in  the debate, a Sinn F&eacute;in Member said that if there were more units of local  government, fewer powers would be devolved to them. That does not necessarily  follow. Whereas there might not be the same economies of scale with 11 councils  as opposed to seven, there is the option of grouping councils for certain  functions, which could provide those economies of scale.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  Does the Member agree that, with respect to the clustering of councils, the LEADER  groups that delivered rural development funding were a key example of local  councils working together to deliver for the people, unlike the Department of  Agriculture and Rural Development (DARD), which this year had to return millions of pounds to the European  Union?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  There are already models that show how grouping of councils can work. In some  rural areas, the building control function is grouped, and it works well. Let  us not run away with the idea that if we step back from the seven-council  model, fewer powers will be devolved to local government. There are ways of  doing it: it requires a bit of imagination. In some cases, it may be a matter  of directly devolving issues, such as the Youth Service or library services.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">One model that might be tried is that councils might be  given money for roads, for example, but would buy in services from Roads  Service. That would avoid the breaking up of responsibility for roads and the  loss of economies of scale there. In other  cases, councils might liaise with other bodies. In education, they might  liaise with the education and skills authority, the Department, or whatever  body emerges from the RPA, to ensure that services delivered locally are  delivered properly.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There are many imaginative ways to do it. Let us not simply  criticise Ministers: my concern is that local government  has not engaged properly. Local government, the Assembly and Ministers  must engage equally. If that takes time, we should ignore the bluster of the  Member for Lagan Valley Basil McCrea, get down to work, and do the job  properly. I would add one word of caution in that the process cannot be delayed  interminably because people are worrying about the future; for example, those  who are waiting to be recruited into local government. We must ensure that that  capacity is not lost.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">11.30 am</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Boylan</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Ba mhaith liom c&uacute;pla focal a r&aacute;  faoin r&uacute;n. I would like to say a few words on this matter.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I declare an interest as a member of one of the best councils  in the North &mdash; Armagh   City and District  Council. I apologise to the Minister that I could not make it to the meeting  yesterday.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">This is work in progress. Sinn F&eacute;in did not ask for this  review. However we are prepared to work with, and develop, what was originally  proposed, and we expect debate and negotiation between parties to begin in a  serious way. Sinn F&eacute;in has no interest in giving enhanced powers to councils  unless those powers are accompanied by robust checks and balances in order to  avoid the discriminatory practices that still exist in many councils. Economies  of scale mean that the number of councils proposed must be the optimum number for delivery, and not be cumbersome,  unwieldy and impractical. Having more councils means a greater service fragmentation and poorer services for the  public.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The key issues emerging from the review of public  administration are about governance and equality, which must be delivered. The  emerging findings report is disappointing as regards the number of functions to  be transferred to local government, and my council is using words such as  minimalist. It would appear that some  Ministers are intent on watering down the powers to be transferred in  order to hold on to those powers themselves. I ask them to explain their position  not only to their party colleagues, but to bodies such as NILGA and the Society  of Local Authority Chief Executives (SOLACE).</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The emerging findings leave a lot to be desired, and we welcome the opportunity to have meaningful debate.  At the heart of that debate, Sinn F&eacute;in believes that community planning will  deliver fair and strong local Government. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I welcome the debate as it brings the review  of public administration, which has been a cause of concern for some time,  back into focus. Not least, I welcome it because the emerging findings report  is one stage in the process of undoing the damage that was outlined in previous  review of public administration conclusions. Due to that, I am surprised at the  response of the Ulster Unionist Party in  the House today. I thought that, like the DUP, they would be opposed to  many of the earlier findings of the review  of public administration. Their fingerprints are all over this report &mdash;  their Ministers contributed to it, and signed off on it, so it is surprising to  hear their criticisms.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>: No, I will not give way, because I am going to make a point. I  will give way in a moment.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, as is customary, UUP Members have forgotten their  past, and the fact that their fingerprints were also all over the beginning of  the review of public administration process. In 2000, Minister Sam Foster  initiated the fundamentally flawed process, and what one Minister Foster cocked  up, another Minister Foster must correct.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Today&rsquo;s debate is a  staging post in getting the review of  public administration correct. As my colleague Sammy Wilson said, this  is a one-off opportunity to get it right, and such opportunities do not come  along frequently.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Campbell</strong>:  I declare an interest as a member of the city council of Londonderry.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member has mentioned disturbing trends that have  emerged in the debate. Does he agree that another disturbing trend is that several nationalist Members have talked about the importance of governance  arrangements, which should be a  paramount consideration for all parties, because the many unionist minorities who have suffered at the  hands of nationalist majorities also want to see good governance arrangements  in the new RPA?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I thank the Member for his inter&shy;vention. I  have noticed that there have been contributions on governance arrangements from the Benches opposite. I must declare an interest as a member of Ards Borough  Council, which I omitted to do at the start of my contribution. In the east of  the Province, unionists have large majorities on councils. However, we are  mindful that unionists in the west of the  Province need protection from nationalist and republican domination.  Therefore, I take the Member&rsquo;s point on board.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Much of the discussion has centred on functions that should be transferred to local government. The  emerging findings report criticises to some extent the initial RPA  decisions. There is scope to examine the prospect of additional powers being transferred to local government. I am  glad that the public-realm aspects of local roads have been included in the  report. However, other local roads issues remain to be examined.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Youth services would fit  neatly with local government, particularly  given the amount of work that already takes place between local government and youth services; for example,  through community-safety partnerships. That would have a knock-on effect for  libraries and youth services, where there  would also be a neat fit. Although I do not want to disagree with the  process that has been initiated by my colleague the Minister of Culture, Arts  and Leisure, a body beneath the single library authority could have input at  local government level.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Urban regeneration is an increasingly important area of  local government. That is why I, and many others, were disappointed &mdash; quite  annoyed, in fact &mdash; that, although she deemed that she would transfer  urban-regeneration powers to local government, Minister Ritchie has done so  begrudgingly, criticising what she has called a &ldquo;narrow skills base&rdquo; at local  government level and saying that those powers would be devolved over time and  through a phased approach. It is rich for SDLP Members opposite to complain  about how few functions are to be  transferred, when their own Minister has  held on for grim death to some of her Department&rsquo;s functions.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  No, I will not give way, because my time is  almost up and I have already given way. Minister Ritchie has held on to  her powers. She has actually insulted many local government representatives and  officials, particularly in places such as Belfast  and Londonderry, which have a rich experience  of involve&shy;ment in urban regeneration.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, I remind the Minister of the Environ&shy;ment to  maintain a focus on efficiency. Although the delivery  of strong local government is important, the need to achieve efficiency  is equally so. The Assembly must not lose  sight of that fact. If that efficiency is not achieved, there is little  point in proceeding with the process.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Armstrong</strong>:  At the outset, I acknowledge the great debt that is owed to local government  and to those councillors who served during the darkest days of the Troubles, often at great personal risk.  The pattern of the 26 local councils that were established in the early  1970s was intended to operate in tandem with the Administration at Stormont.  Sadly, that proved not to be the case.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The review of public administration was originally  welcomed. It offered the prospect of a new beginning and had the potential to  deliver strong and effective local government, which Northern Ireland has been denied  for too long. It was seen as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, because it could  determine the pattern of local government  for the next 20 or 30 years. Therefore, we cannot afford to get it  wrong.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Hopes were high that the review would transfer real powers  to local authorities &mdash; powers that would bring them more into line with their  counterparts in Great    Britain. It was hoped that the review would  utilise modern thinking to improve service delivery and provide a template for  local government in Northern    Ireland in the early twenty-first century.  Sadly, because the review took place amid the background of direct rule, many  of those hopes were dashed.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Unfortunately, the reviews have too often been run by  unaccountable civil servants, or former civil servants, who have usually paid  scant attention to the wishes of locally elected politicians &mdash; hence the absurd  proposal for seven councils, which was supported by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland  and Sinn F&eacute;in. That is the very definition of an unholy alliance.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The restoration of a  devolved Administration provided us with the hope that the situation  would be rescued. However, the RPA emerging findings report received a less than enthusiastic welcome from significant  quarters, including the Northern Ireland Local Government Association.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am particularly  concerned that the proposals do not go  far enough in transferring powers to local government. Rather than  letting local government get on with the business  of delivering local services &mdash; and allowing the Assembly to busy itself  with Province-wide strategic and infrastructure projects &mdash; I fear that we are  in danger of weakening local government by denying it real powers. The Assembly  and the Executive are trying to micromanage functions that simply do not need  to be the responsibility of central Government. Those fears have been articulated  by Alderman Hatch &mdash; one of my Ulster Unionist colleagues &mdash; who is currently the  president of NILGA.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">For local government to remain relevant, it must have real  powers to affect the lives of citizens. Certain Ministers must resist their  natural instincts and temptations to retain as much centralised control as  possible, and must trust local government. Among the additional services that  NILGA has called for the Executive transfer to local government are planning; community planning; regeneration; local roads;  libraries; and youth services.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I respect the vast experience that resides in NILGA, and I  have no hesitation in supporting its call for the Executive to consider the  proposals contained in the emerging findings report and to return with a set of  proposals that will transfer meaningful and significant functions to local  government.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Ramsey</strong>: I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s contribution. She made some good  points about a shared vision and, in particular, about reviewing the number of  councils, which are most welcome. Does the  Minister also accept that there is a lack of morale and motivation in  all local authorities in Northern    Ireland due to uncertainty about their  future? We must have clarity about the future and the terms of the proposals.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As for the transfer of functions, I accept that the youth  service is an example of a model that should be transferred to local  government, bearing in mind the range of joint provisions between the community  sector and the youth sector. The social-education programmes that the youth  service brings to the table are exemplary,  considering the current levels of antisocial behaviour and ill  discipline.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP is disappointed by the limited list of functions that are proposed for transfer.  However, more importantly, it is  unacceptable that such important issues have been addressed without  meaningful engagement with political parties and councils on the detail of  functions for transfer, budgets, staff and options for cluster working by  councils.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In addition to concerns about the nature of the functions to be transferred, the SDLP remains  concerned about the process and  implications of transfer. We raised concerns about assets and debts of  existing councils, which are still to be addressed. Concerns related to equity  arise across a range of issues, an example of which is the redevelopment of  local areas. Some towns have benefited from central funding for redevelopment.  If powers are transferred, will other towns have access to adequate funding to  meet the same standards?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">A note has been passed  to me to remind me to declare my interest as a member of Derry City  Council.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Considering the Department of the Environment&rsquo;s connections  with the origins of the conflict, the SDLP is concerned about planning policy.  My party wants to see greater influence on local planning by councils, but as part of an overhaul of the planning system, and  in the context of effective statutory power-sharing safeguards for new  councils. As for the comments of the Member for East Derry Gregory Campbell &mdash;  who is not in the Chamber, at present &mdash; it is a fact that, in nationalist-controlled councils in Northern Ireland, a power-sharing  system is in place.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am sorry that the Member is not in the Chamber, because I  want it noted that unionists have 20% of the seats  on Derry City Council but hold 30% of committee positions. That is more  than would be the case under d&rsquo;Hondt and power-sharing arrangements.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">11.45 am</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>: Will the Member inform his colleagues on Down District Council of that arrangement? The DUP has never  held any senior civic position in that council throughout its entire existence,  despite maintaining three seats on it.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Ramsey</strong>:  I cannot comment on Down District Council. However, I can assure the Member  that in Derry City Council, the SDLP has  given up the position of mayor and two deputy mayors as allocated under  d&rsquo;Hondt to ensure that there is shared responsibility and that the unionist  position is represented in the two top posts.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP has called for a full-scale review of the planning  system in order to make decision-making more transparent and accountable, and  to shorten the planning process. The party believes that stronger planning  policies are required, and there should be greater clarity about interpretation.  The Planning Appeals Commission is not considered an adequate vehicle through  which to hold the system to account. There is also a need for greater  connectivity between planning decisions and their impact on other services,  which underscores the need for community planning.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Clarity is also required about area plans and new local  plans. With an 11-council model, area plans could be difficult to distinguish  from local plans. There must be flexibility and responsiveness at a genuinely  local level.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP welcomes the emerging findings, but they are quite  vague about the number of councils, with little indication of which of the  three options is favoured. That is disappointing, given that there are plans to  put a paper to the Executive by December. As set out in the SDLP&rsquo;s responses to  earlier phases of consultation, the party is totally opposed to a seven-council  model on the basis that it is inadequate to meet the needs of our dispersed  rural population. The party believes that it will lead to Balkanisation in Northern Ireland, making power sharing more difficult to establish.  It will also lead to reduced democratic accountability and fundamentally  undermine the character of local government. Furthermore, it will contribute to  central&shy;isation at a time when we should be trying to reverse that trend to  ensure that the west of the Province is being supported, as Tommy Gallagher  mentioned. We should support the rural  economy and rural communities, promote balanced regional development and  tackle rural and western disadvantage.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I declare an interest as a member  of Dungannon and South Tyrone Borough Council, which is the lead council on  this issue. I wish to express my concern about some of the emerging findings.  In general, many people, particularly local government representatives,  expected that more power would be transferred to local government. I am  concerned that a gap is developing between  local government and central Government. For years, local government  feared that when the Assembly got up and running, Ministers would claw back the  powers that they had previously talked about devolving. We need to devolve  powers to local government that will make it very powerful and allow it to  deliver for communities in the future.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The power of general competency has been talked about again  and again, and there has also been a focus on the power of general well-being.  However, local government must follow the needs of the area. The present local  government structure means that, far too often, local government and councils  cannot follow those needs or deliver for the communities that they serve. They  have no responsibility for roads or footpaths or for the general well-being of  the area. Unfortunately, responsibility for such matters falls between several  different stools &mdash; local government, Roads Service, the Housing Executive, and so on. That power of general  competency is needed to ensure that local government can deliver for its  communities.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In the past, local government has been on the edge of  involvement in European funding and its delivery, but it has never had any  responsibility for it. I welcome the fact  that, under the new structures, local government will have a greater  role in delivering those funds. That will  bring the statutory agencies together, thus ensuring that they deliver  on their responsibilities. It will also bring together various community groups  that often have good ideas but no particular strategy to facilitate or bring  them all together. If local government were to have a more powerful role, we  could look forward to the delivery of those strategies.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The role of the Assembly is to legislate for the  empowerment of local government and to allow it to deliver on the ground. The  local agencies are aware of the needs of communities and can deliver at ground  level. It is important that we separate the two situations so that we do not  have everybody doing everybody else&rsquo;s job. That will build a better  relationship between central Government and  local government in the future. Each  must carry out its role to the best of its ability, and have the  relevant powers to deliver for communities. At the end of the day, that is what  we want.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It has been proposed that local government elections be  delayed for two years. That is dangerous, because it would render councils dead  for two years, and neither staff nor councillors would know what is happening. People would be hanging on, instead of being  empowered. An election gives people power to carry on, which is important. It is possible to complete the current  strategy within the time left to councils, instead of delaying.  Otherwise councils will lose a lot of valuable staff due to the uncertainty,  and will have no power to plan for the future because no one will know what  their role is going to be.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>: At what stage will the Member address the number of councils?  Is he still of the opinion, shared by the unionist Benches, that seven is not  the preferred number?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>:  My party has made it clear all along that, whatever about the number of  councils or the powers devolved to them, the issue is that they are meant to  deliver fairness and equality and ensure that people are accountable for their  actions. Unfortunately, that is where a number of councils currently fall  short. There are unionist-controlled councils that could do better in delivering for the communities that  they serve, and in ensuring that there is equality, fairness and good  governance. Now is the time to show that goodwill. People can take things in  good faith and can put legislation in place, but now is the time for  unionist-controlled councils to ensure that they can deliver.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We must ensure that we have powerful local govern&shy;ment that can deliver for the community.  Unfortunately, the council on which I sit has gone down in history as  the council that brought local government down because of past discrimination.  That led to the civil rights movement and a 40-year campaign to bring about  equality and justice. That is where we are today, and it is important to  concentrate on how we deliver local  government, regardless of the number of councils.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I  declare an interest as a member of Carrickfergus Borough Council.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I support the amendment. Prior to devolution, all parties  expressed their support for the transfer of additional  responsibilities to local government. However, there now appears to be some considerable backtracking. Is this  the outworking of the control freakery of some Stalinist, centrally controlled  parties? We must have faith in the elected representatives on the councils and give them the responsibility. Decisions must not  always be taken centrally; that is not what democracy is about.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I shall focus largely on planning, because it is hugely  significant for local communities and would give greater responsibilities to  councils and councillors and enable them to  have a much greater impact on their areas. Planning is a key issue for  local government, and there has been a significant proposal to backtrack by  removing responsibility for area plans from local authorities. Local  authorities in the rest of the United Kingdom  have that responsibility: why should it not be the case in Northern Ireland?  Why is it OK in England, Scotland and Wales,  and why should it not happen in Northern    Ireland? Is the planning Minister reluctant  to lose significant powers from her Department? The responsibility for planning must be devolved to councils.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I  may give way later on, but I wish to pursue this issue.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Area plans are not developed in isolation. They must adhere  to the regional development strategy; there is an outline that must be followed  locally. Local plans are not developed independently, but must follow on from  other regionally developed policies. The scale of the current plans will not be  hugely different from that which is being proposed.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I know that there is a huge Belfast metropolitan area plan, but that plan  could possibly develop through amalgamated plans, which may well be in the  interests of council areas that are being developed. However, in the northern  part of my constituency of East Antrim, an  area plan covering Larne, Antrim and Ballymena is under consideration. I  suspect that that would not be much different in area than those of the new  councils that are likely to emerge, whether there be 11 or 15 of them. I reiterate my opposition to having seven  councils.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  acknowledge what the Member has said, and I agree that as much planning as  possible should go into local government if we are to mirror the arrangements  that are in place in other parts of the UK. However, there are no area  plans in England, Scotland and Wales.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  The issue is that decisions should be taken locally by councillors. It is  better that councils develop and follow plans for the purposes of trans&shy;parency.  However, decisions should be taken locally by councillors. The proposal will  add a third level of bureaucracy, giving councils a third planning level. I  suspect that that would lead to increased costs and not reduced costs. Why not give councils full responsibility?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Plans developed at local government level would be subject  to an appeals process, public inquiries and scrutiny from the legal system, so  there would be protection. Ultimately, the electorate would determine whether it believes that inappropriate decisions  are made by local representatives, but I hope that that would never be  the case.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I will illustrate further why that is important. There has been much talk about community planning. To  give community planning real teeth,  councils must be allowed to incorporate it in their area plans. What is  the point of giving councils responsibility for community planning without the  full teeth to demand that the issues flowing from that responsibility are built  into an area plan? Councils will not necessarily be able to do that under the  current proposals.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There are significant failings in the existing process.  Area plans are determined remotely from councils, and council views are often  filtered and eventually lost. In Carrickfergus, for example, a proposal emerged  that new houses could be built under high-voltage cables. The council specifically said that that should  not happen, but the area in question has now been earmarked for possible  housing.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, rather than using additional housing to ensure that spine roads are completed and are  developer-led, gaps are being left. Local councillors would have been  aware of the issues and would have driven the process through to completion.  The current process is failing, and mistakes are happening. It is important to  have faith in local representatives, give them respons&shy;ibility and allow them  to be held accountable to the electorate.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>: I declare an interest as a local govern&shy;ment councillor for  Craigavon. I also mention my membership of the Northern Ireland Policing Board,  and I endorse the earlier comments that were made by the Minister about the two  PSNI officers who were shot recently in brutal attempts to take their lives. I  express the SDLP&rsquo;s sympathy and our hopes for their recovery. We also endorse  the comments that were made to the Minister about the horrific events in Omagh.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Many SDLP Members are  missing from the Chamber as former Member Mr John Fee is being buried  today. Our party sends its sympathies to his wife and family, and the wider  family circle.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In her statement, the Minister said that she wanted to  listen. We hope that she will take action on many of the concerns that have  been raised, understandably, by Members across the Chamber. I have not heard  great dissent this morning, once the arguments over the strength of powers that  local government should have are distilled.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">At the early stages, the SDLP set out its vision of strong  and accountable local government, which would encourage and promote  participative democracy. The Minister referred to the number of meetings that  are being held across the North, and she  expressed <span style="letter-spacing:-.35pt; ">disappoint&shy;ment </span>at the turnout at some of those meetings.  However, I ask the Minister to reflect on her many years as a local councillor.  She will acknowledge that, during the early stages of the RPA, local  councillors were not allowed to engage in the process. They now feel that they  are being consulted at the end, rather than at the outset, of the process. That  goes some way towards explaining why councillors believe that they have been  excluded.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">12.00 noon</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP&rsquo;s major concerns centre on the lack of meaningful  engagement with stakeholders, particularly parties and councillors, on the  detail of the transfer of functions. That  lack of engagement persisted throughout the period of direct rule, and  the limited progress achieved in eventually securing policy-development panels  on RPA has now been rolled back because those panels have been suspended.  During the present exercise, only the most superficial level of detail has been  shared.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am sure that the Minister will acknowledge &mdash; as other Members have &mdash; the concerns of local  government staff about morale, motivation and uncertainty about their  futures. The emerging findings paper sets out no detail on where local  government headquarters will be located when agreement is finally reached. Many  people are concerned about council-owned buildings and where the centre of  authority will be located. Some Members highlighted how councils have come  together and delivered well for the people, particularly in areas where they  received EU funding, but, disappointingly, no departmental funding.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Community-safety planning and the local strategy  partnerships were intended to be vehicles for greater engagement with other  stakeholders. When I was a member of a  local strategy partnership, from the outset, senior staff from various  agencies and Departments attended meetings. However, as time went on, ever more  people who attended meetings represented their agency, but had little power to make decisions. Decision-makers  must be at the table and if they are to deliver, they must bring a substantial  budget with them.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP strongly  supports the principle of retaining the community-planning initiatives  that were set out as a vision for local government. That is the best way to  address the concerns of, and deliver for, the people. Many Western democracies  are experiencing less engagement by voters at the ballot box. Voters feel that  they have no stake, because they are not part of the decision-making process.  Community planning is one way in which it is hoped to stem the tide of a lack  in engagement by members of the public.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Many Members have explained the positions of the various  Departments. There is great concern that many Departments have yet to hand over  any power, or indicate that they will do so. No information has come from the  Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister on how they envisage  power being devolved. I am sure that all parties acknowledge the concerns about  community relations. Local councils can achieve results in that area.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>:  The RPA is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to deliver a world-class  system of local government for the people of Northern Ireland. I am dismayed  that the Executive&rsquo;s current plans, as  presented in the emerging findings paper, fall well short of the  necessary mark. The Executive subcommittee is engaged in a blatant attempt to  pass only small amounts of responsibility from each Department to local  government. That is the wrong way round: it should be a matter of identifying  what local government can and should deliver and, subsequently, how central  Government needs to be reformed to take account of that.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Most importantly, local representatives must hold prime  responsibility for local community planning. They  must have a direct say on all its elements, including economic  development, emergency services and transport. Local representatives are  closest to local communities, and they  offer the most direct accountability to local people. Therefore, they  must take the leading role in community planning. Currently, they face severe  restrictions in doing so, because they cannot vest land for economic  development, and, in most cases, have no direct say on local emergency  services.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, local representatives play merely a minor  consultative role in dealing with local roads and public transport. In  practice, local community planning functions are severely restricted by the  fact that responsibility for many functions rests with Departments, agencies  and quangos. Therefore, ultimately,  although most of the blame is often assigned to local councils, most of  the power rests with central Government. It is disappointing that the plans in  the emerging findings report pay mere lip service to addressing that matter.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">For local community planning to become a reality, that will  mean not only the transfer of key functions, such as vesting of land for  economic development or libraries, but a new type of local government, with  partnership-working on areas such as fire and rescue, local roads and bus  services. Local representatives need to be given a meaningful say, and new and  fairer financial arrangements must be put in place. Estates management should  be transferred to local councils so that they can take the lead in the  placement of essential education, emergency and health services, even where  those are managed by central Government.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Local community planning will also mean a new approach to  good relations. Councils must be bound by best practice in community and race  relations, and they must take the lead in ensuring improvements in those areas.  However, that is not an excuse for the Office of the First Minister and deputy  First Minister and other Departments to shirk their responsibilities. Good  relations in this society must be the cornerstone of government at all levels.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Reform of local government to the extent that we want will  also mean reform of central Government. That is no bad thing. Devolution of  justice powers will require a review of  Departments in any case. Therefore, in order to deliver more accountable  and efficient government, the opportunity should be taken to reform Departments  and quangos. Local government cannot be reformed without reforming the whole  structure; therefore, we want to see plans from the Executive for reform of all  structures of government.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Our message to the Executive is simple: try again. We want  to see local government in charge of local functions, using local finance. Most  importantly, that will mean real responsibility and accountability for community  planning, and a meaningful say for all its associated functions. Moreover, it  will mean reform, not only of local  government, but of central Government.  This is an opportunity to create a world-class system, and the Executive must not throw away that opportunity. I support  the amendment.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  I declare an interest as a local councillor on  Fermanagh District Council. I express my condolences to the family of  the victims of the fire in Omagh this morning. The family who died came from my  constituency of Fermanagh and South Tyrone. I also express my sympathy to the  family of the police officer in Dungannon on whose life a murder attempt was  made. I spent over three hours at the scene last night, and I must say that it  was a dastardly act.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Minister  for tabling the motion. Although some of the issues raised may have been  controversial at times, I hope that they  will prove helpful in developing the process. In the absence of devolved  government, local councils were the only show in town for almost three decades.  Councils were the only forums in which people had an opportunity to display  their political views and to make local politics work in the Province. I  reiterate my party&rsquo;s call for as much power as is reasonably possible to be  given to councils throughout Northern Ireland,  as is the policy employed in the rest of the United Kingdom.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The publication of the emerging findings paper was  disappointing and aggravating for those who support more power being devolved  to local councils. After the release of the paper, NILGA moved quickly to state  that the content of the publication was unsatisfactory in many ways. I agree  with that interpretation.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As the majority of Members are aware, over 120 elected  representatives and officers from local govern&shy;ment expressed their feelings  about the emerging findings paper at an event in Cookstown on 24 October 2007.  Among the arguments expressed at that meeting, and in subsequent publications  by NILGA, was the fear that the proposals will not deliver the previously  agreed vision and that they will not support the radical transformation of  service delivery or provide the opportunity to reinvigorate local democracy.  Those were just a few of the concerns that were expressed &mdash; there are, of  course, many more.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The need for regional democracy to be supported by the  Assembly is of major importance. The joy felt by the majority of people in Northern Ireland  after the return of the Assembly earlier this year is not in doubt. However,  that does not mean that all local government powers  can be held within the Executive or the Assembly. Councillors across Northern Ireland  are elected by local people on a localised platform. Those of us who support  democracy will agree that those elections afford a reasonable level of accountability  to local councils, which brings them closer to the communities that they  represent.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Accountability provides the basis for an increased mandate  at local council level. I have just read through the emerging findings paper;  local councils will be overjoyed to hear that in the transfer of the public-realm aspects of local road functions, they are  regaining control of grass cutting,  weed spraying, gully emptying, street lighting, off-street car parking  and pedestrian permits. All those issues are sensitive and important for local  people. However, they do not go far enough in increasing local accountability.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The vision in the paper  states that there should be:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;greater clarity  between the roles of central and local government&rdquo;.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It also states that:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;the interests of the citizen should be at the centre  of not only the vision for local government but also all decisions relating to  the new arrangements&rdquo;.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">For a number of reasons, that is just not the case.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The paper does not provide any clarity on the number of councils  or on the proposed functions for transfer to local government.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McFarland</strong>:  I begin by making the rare declaration that I am not &mdash; and never have been &mdash; a  councillor. The Assembly has heard accusations of rowing back, and I will speak  briefly on the issue of dual mandates. When the RPA was first announced, I was  greatly encouraged that the issue of Members trying to do two or three jobs at  the same time, or be in two or three places at the same time, would be  addressed. That was going well; last summer, the Preparation for Government  Committee met, with the five member parties agreeing to abolish dual mandates.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am slightly concerned that in meetings of the Assembly  and Executive Review Committee &mdash; of which I am a member &mdash; DUP representatives,  supported by their Sinn F&eacute;in counterparts, have begun to say that the new  councils will need experience. That ignores the substantial number of  councillors who are not MLAs or MPs, and who will presumably continue to sit on  those councils. The argument that those Members  make is that the new councils are so important that sitting MLAs in  their parties are required to continue as councillors after 2011. That is crazy  stuff. The House must face the issue of dual mandates early and be honest.  People do not expect Members to be on councils, in Westminster or in the House of Lords and  still perform their duties here.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I ask the Minister to urge her colleague Jeffrey Donaldson,  who chairs the Assembly and Executive Review  Committee, to address the issue of dual mandates &mdash; and to do so quickly.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">12.15 pm</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>: I  remind the House that I am a member of North Down Borough Council and have been  so for more years than I care to remember. I  thank the Minister for tabling the motion. It is timely and its purpose  is to enable Members to discuss the emerging findings of the RPA review and,  hopefully, have changes made to them. It is an important debate, and, as other  Members have done, I must mention the poor quality of the initial engagement  with the RPA team. Despite that, we hope to have a good outcome.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The debate has been good, although there has been a lot of  bluster and blether. Mr Weir dwelt on the pluses of the review, but he admitted  that it had shortcomings. He highlighted the economic aspect of the review and  said that the land bank from INI should be considered for transfer to the  councils, which could do a better job with it. He also commented on the  transfer of libraries &mdash; which was supported by other Members &mdash; and housing,  among other things.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Maskey referred to the seven-council model, and he appeared to link the number of councils to the  amount of power that they will have. That is an interesting situation.  Mr Boylan admitted that the review appeared minimalistic, and Mr Molloy &mdash; along  with other Members &mdash; referred to the clawback by Departments.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Gallagher referred to taking the power back to the  centre, and Dolores Kelly made a good point about the poor turnouts at local  elections, which she linked to the limited powers that councils have. That is  worthy of note, and I think that she was the only Member to mention it. Mr  Neeson mentioned the Alliance Party&rsquo;s intention to support the NILGA paper,  which many of us do. Sammy Wilson referred to the grouping system, which was one of the success stories of the last  revision of local government, and  that should be considered again.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Ulster Unionist Party is disappointed at the limited  proposals that form the basis of the emerging findings paper. The review of  public administration, as it impacts on local government, has the potential to  significantly improve the delivery of services to the public by offering  effective, efficient, focused and relevant services at the time and place that  they are required. The Ulster Unionist Party does not support change for  change&rsquo;s sake, but strongly advocates the transfer of those services where the  public can experience a significant improvement to their lives and communities.  Most people accept that the transfer of a comprehensive range of services would  result in a transformation of service delivery, impacting upon &mdash; and improving  the quality of life of &mdash; everyone in the communities in which they serve.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is clear that the retraction of key services from the  original proposals is at odds with the vision outlined in paragraphs 6 to 10 of  the emerging findings paper. The proposal to transfer only 1&middot;2% of the  public-sector budget and 0&middot;45% of public-sector jobs is a small change. Many  believe that that de minimis approach would jeopardise community planning and  call into question the value of reorganising councils, given the significant  cost of the change process. The limited proposal before the House could be  carried out by the existing councils without any further cost or disruption.  The Ulster Unionist Party supports that assessment, but would go further and  suggest that the proposed review of Departments has resulted in a circling of  the wagons by Ministers and senior departmental staff.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The lack of a strategic vision &mdash; and a desire to keep  control of the minutiae of Government &mdash; undermines the <span style="letter-spacing:-.3pt; ">commitment and resources  expended by local govern&shy;</span><span style="letter-spacing:-.4pt; ">ment</span> over  the past five years in preparing for the reform. We appear to have been given a masterclass in U-turning.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Ulster Unionist Party is committed to local government  that is accountable to local communities. That is why we support the 15 local  authorities for Northern    Ireland model; it would have the power to  deliver a comprehensive and responsive service to the people. I ask the House  to support the amendment.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  This has been a very useful debate, and I genuinely mean that, although there  was one notable exception, and it is unfortunate that the Member was the first contributor to the debate, because he  could have spoiled it for everyone else. Thankfully, he did not, and we  have had a very useful exchange about functions, numbers and the vision for  local government.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McCrea, who moved the amendment, stated his dismay and  frustration, and he wanted to know the purpose of the review of public  administration. Not once did he mention what he wants to see for local  government. His outburst in the House today was more about a leadership challenge in the Ulster Unionist Party than it  was about the review of public administration.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr W McCrea</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  Yes, I will.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr W McCrea</strong>:  I ask the Minister to be careful when using the name Mr McCrea, because I think  she means Basil McCrea, and not the other two honourable gentlemen of that  name. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span> I can understand the mistake,  because he is a new child on the block, and is, therefore, totally  inexperienced.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  I am very happy to clarify that I am referring to the mover of the amendment. I  was never referring to my honourable friend on those issues.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As regards the transfer of functions in the emerging  findings paper &mdash; and they are emerging findings, and I make no apology for that  &mdash; I said that I would bring the emerging findings to the House so that we could  have the sort of engagement that we are having today. Perhaps some Members  would rather that I had waited until I was finished before coming to them.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Emerging findings show that there is an increase to net  local government expenditure of 21% &mdash; an increase from &pound;455 million to &pound;558  million. Members have indicated that they do not think that that is enough, so  I will have to take that matter back to the subcommittee, which will be meeting  very soon.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Basil McCrea also said  that he did not want a review of the review of public administration.  That obviously means that he wants seven councils, which would be another  broken UUP manifesto promise, but then consistency has never been a strong  point of the Ulster Unionist Party.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Initially, the Executive subcommittee, and then the Executive, which includes two Ulster Unionist  Members, approved the issue of the emerging findings paper for  consultation. The Member should remember that point, when he talks about a  complete and utter farce, because he is talking about the leader of his own  party.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  No, I will not give way. I have taken quite a bit from you this morning.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">When the Member talks about complete and utter farce, he is  talking about the leader of his own party, who gave the go ahead to put the  emerging findings paper out for consultation.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  Yes, I will give way to my colleague. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>:  Surely, there must be something with Mr McCrea criticising his leader.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr W McCrea</strong>:  You mean Basil McCrea.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: Sorry,  I mean Basil McCrea criticising his own leader. What possible purpose could he  have for doing that?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  I could not possibly comment.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  Now &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. Take your seat.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Would Members please stick to the motion, instead of  political point scoring? <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  I find that very interesting. I will be raising issues with the Speaker  concerning comments made by Mr McCrea. Obviously, I have some more issues to  raise.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Moving on to the content of the motion; Mr Weir welcomed  issues on planning, community-planning powers,  vesting powers &mdash; which Mr Neeson mentioned and will be given to councils  &mdash; regeneration powers, economic development and tourism. He expressed his disappointment  about local roads, the land bank and Invest NI.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">He also expressed disappointment in respect of youth  services and libraries.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Maskey said that the review of local government was a  work in progress, and referred to governance issues. He will know that  governance is referred to in paragraph 49 of the emerging findings paper, and  that that is very much a live issue, which we will be addressing. He also  talked about the consequence of the move to seven councils, and about finding  ways of dealing with shared services, which is an issue that the subcommittee  is actively examining with respect to economies of scale.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Gallagher also spoke about governance, and I refer him  to paragraph 49 of the emerging findings paper. He said that there was very little  in the paper, and that stakeholders did not know what was going on. I take  issue with that. We are presently engaged with groups of councillors and other  interested parties right across Northern    Ireland. Mr Gallagher spoke of his concern  about stripping jobs out of the west. It will come as no surprise to him that I  will not be stripping any jobs out of the west, if I can help it. I assure him  that the paper has no hidden agenda, and that is one of the reasons why I  brought it to the Floor of the House.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Gallagher said that the only good Departments were the  Department for Social Development and the Department of Culture, Arts and  Leisure &mdash; and I am sure that my ministerial colleagues will be delighted about  that. Obviously, he missed the reference to planning in the paper. Mr Gallagher  also said that he was disappointed about the local roads issue.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Neeson spoke of the need for councils to have more  meaningful power. He, in common with Ms Lo, said that we should not be looking  at RPA in isolation from the current review. That is why, in my opening  comments, I referred to the evolution of local govern&shy;ment. We should have  cognisance of what is going on, but I cannot wait for the institutional review  report. We must move ahead with the review of local government.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Neeson said that he wanted me to take NILGA&rsquo;s paper  seriously. I certainly will. NILGA has been an invaluable partner in this  process, and that will continue. He also referred to reform in health and  education. Again, as with institutional review, we must be aware of the reform  that is ongoing in other areas. There is a real need to link local government  reform to reforms in health and education, for example. I am engaged in talks  with the two relevant Ministers to see how that can work in practice.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Sammy Wilson spoke about a once-in-a-lifetime change in  local government, as did other Members. I reiterate that very important  decisions lie ahead, but this is also a process of evolution and looking to the  future. Mr Wilson talked about the need to build up the capacity of local  councillors, and said that we should reconsider library functions and youth  services. He implored me, and other Ministers, to be imaginative in considering  shared services, and he referred to sectors where that had worked well  previously. We are actively considering that matter. He also referred to the  purchasing power of local councils in respect of roads, and I am also looking  at that issue.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Boylan apologised for not being in Armagh,  and I accept his apology. He also talked about equality in governance, and I have already addressed that  matter. He said that he was  disappointed with the functions package, and referred to the importance  of community planning.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Hamilton talked about governance issues from a unionist  point of view. I am disappointed that some Members across the Floor thought  that it was funny when we were talking about unionists in the west, but did not think that it was so funny when we were  talking about nationalists and republicans in the east. Equality in  governance is for everyone in Northern    Ireland, and it should not be seen as a  threat. Mr Hamilton also referred to youth services and libraries.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Molloy said that local government needed more powers and  hoped that a gap would not develop between central and local government. I do  not want to see a gap; I want to see a more joined-up relationship between  central and local government, with the appropriate body delivering the  appropriate service. Even if there is not  full devolution to local government, that  should not mean that councils cannot deliver services in particular  areas. However, we are looking at ways of teeing  that up.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Molloy said that he  was disappointed at the talk of a delay of elections until 2011. It is  legislatively impossible to have the provisions of the review of public  administration through the House before 2009.Therefore, we must either delay  the election or simply hold another  election to the 26 existing councils. That issue must be resolved.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">12.30 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Beggs mainly addressed planning matters and the need for  area-planning powers. Some 85% of what is  currently contained in the area plans will be delegated to local  councils. I am disappointed that the Member did not pick up on that fact. There  are no area plans in England,  Scotland and Wales. All that  the Department will retain centrally is the  remaining 15% of the content of the  area plans, which is required for strategic reasons and to deal with  European law. I am sure that Mr Beggs is aware of the judicial review that is  under way in respect of the northern area plan. Mr Beggs said that councils  must have the power to draw up plans for their areas. That is precisely what we  are trying to achieve through local plans. He should also be aware that a  planning review is ongoing. We are trying to ensure that the planning process  is fit for purpose when those functions are devolved to local councils.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mrs Kelly said that she hoped that I would listen to the  points that Members made from the Floor of the House. I hope that, by now, she  realises that I have listened very carefully to what has been said; that is why  I brought this matter to the Floor of the House. I accept her comments about  the earlier consultations and the lack of  engagement. I also accept her comments on the concerns about local  government staff and estates. I acknowledge Mrs Kelly&rsquo;s support for  community-planning initiatives. Ms Lo also said that community planning was important.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank Councillor Elliott for his helpful comments. That  is you finished, Tom. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span> I thank him for his  comments about Fermanagh District Council and the role that it could play, the  need for clarity in respect of relationships between central and local  government, and the importance of sorting out the number of councils in the  near future.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I firmly acknowledge the work that local councillors have  done over the past 35 years, when there was no devolved elected Chamber to take  the flak. Local councils were often the only place in which the views of the  community could be expressed. I wish to place that on record.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Alan McFarland, who was  quite glad to acknowledge the fact that he is not a councillor, said  that matters related to the institutional review and dual mandates need to be  sorted out. I am happy to pass those comments on to my Rt Hon friend the  Chairman of the Assembly and Executive Review Committee.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Leslie Cree made the winding-up speech on the amendment and  gave the somewhat surprising indication that he believed that 26 councils could  deliver on future arrangements. I hope that the Ulster Unionist position is not  that we stick to 26 councils but that we move to the appropriate number, with  the appropriate level of service.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Our shared goal is the delivery of a vision for local  government, to improve the quality of life for all our people and to create  communities that are sustainable, vibrant, healthy, prosperous, stable and  people centred.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I look forward &mdash; believe it or not &mdash; to coming back to the  House with the final recommendations of the  review. There is much interest in those recommend&shy;ations, not only among  local councillors, but in the House.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText"><span class="Italic">Question</span>, That the amendment be  made, <span class="Italic">put and agreed to</span>.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText"><em>Main Question, as amended, put and agreed to.</em></p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
		    <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly notes the emerging findings of the review  of the Review of Public Administration decisions, as they relate to local  government, and the initial proposals for the future shape of local government;  and calls on the Executive to transfer meaningful and significant functions to  local government.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Business Committee has arranged to meet as soon as the  Assembly suspends for lunch. I propose, therefore, by leave of the Assembly, to  suspend the sitting until 2.00 pm.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The sitting was suspended at 12.34 pm.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">On resuming (Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Molloy] in the  Chair) &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">2.00 pm</p>
		    <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="3"></a>Ministerial Statement</p>
		    <p class="H4StageHeading">North/South Ministerial Council &mdash; Institutional Format</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister (Mr McGuinness)</strong>: With your  permission, go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle, I wish to say  how saddened I am by this morning&rsquo;s devastating news of the tragic death of a  family in Omagh. My sympathy goes out to their friends, relatives and  neighbours who are, no doubt, heartbroken by their terrible loss.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to express my  deepest appreciation to everyone in  our emergency services who had to deal with that awful situation. The work in which the emergency  services are currently engaged in  Omagh contrasts markedly with the actions  of those who, in recent days, shot two policemen. That micro-group is  totally detached from reality, and has no popular support in the community. I  condemn, in the strongest possible terms,  the actions of its members and I call on them to stop such actions  immediately.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In compliance with Section 52(6)(b) of the NI Act 1998, we  wish to make a statement on the second meeting, in institutional format, of the  North/South Ministerial Council (NSMC),  which was held at the Ballymascanlon Hotel, Dundalk,  on Tuesday 30 October 2007. All of the Ministers who attended the meeting have  approved the following report, and we make it on their behalf.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive were  represented by the First Minister, junior Minister Paisley, the Minister  of Education and myself. The Irish Government were represented by Dermot Ahern  TD, Minister for Foreign Affairs, who chaired the meeting.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Ministers expressed regret at the decision of Seagate Technology to close its plant at Limavady. We  recognised that, because Seagate&rsquo;s workforce comes from a wide,  cross-border area, that decision will have serious implications for both the  Executive and the Irish Government. We agreed to co-operate closely in the  coming weeks in our efforts to address that situation, and we welcomed the  announcement of 300 new jobs at Norbrook Laboratories Ltd in Newry.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council noted that the terms of office of the boards of  the North/South implementation bodies and of Tourism Ireland Ltd will expire in  December 2007, and asked that work be taken forward to ensure that the NSMC can  put new boards in place by November 2007. The Council expressed its  appreciation of the work and the commitment  of the outgoing chairpersons, vice-chairpersons and board members of the  North/South implementation bodies and Tourism Ireland Ltd.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council welcomed the opportunity to consider the EU  dimension of its work, and agreed to consider that matter further at its next  plenary meeting.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council noted progress on the implementation of the recommendations contained in &lsquo;Study of  Obstacles to Mobility&rsquo;, which was commissioned by the NSMC, including  progress on a mutual recognition of qualific&shy;ations  in the areas of education and health, the introduction of single tariffs  by some mobile phone operators, and the greater availability of public-service  information for people who wish to cross the border to live, work and study. The Council launched a cross-border  mobility website, which provides a central access point for information  on a range of issues for such people. The Council requested that its  secretariat keep the website&rsquo;s operation, development, marketing and management  under review, examine options for its  future funding &mdash; including possible EU funding &mdash; and report back to a  future NSMC meeting.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council agreed that the NSMC secretariat should convene  two working groups: one to explore options for going forward on the transfer of  pension rights on a cross-border basis; and the second to examine cross-border  banking issues, including that of transaction charges. Both groups will report  back to a future NSMC meeting.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council noted the progress to date in acquiring  permanent accommodation for the NSMC joint secretariat in Armagh.  The Council agreed that, once evaluation of  the shortlisted bidders is completed, subject to the appropriate  internal processes in each Adminis&shy;tration,  officials should enter into contractual negotiations with the preferred bidder to provide lease  accommodation and report progress to a future NSMC meeting.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council discussed a number of issues of human resources  in respect of the North/South implementation bodies and Tourism Ireland Ltd,  including pay issues and the regrading of posts, which were raised in a paper  that was prepared by the chief executive officers of those bodies.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council agreed that  officials from the Department of Finance and Personnel and from the  Department of Finance would advise their Ministers on the issues and consider the chief executive officers&rsquo; pay paper  together with additional information provided by the bodies in the context of relevant national pay policies.  Conclusions will be reported to a future NSMC meeting.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council agreed a framework for approving the regrading of certain posts in the North/South  implement&shy;ation bodies and Tourism Ireland Ltd. It agreed that, provided  the principles set out in the framework are adhered to, NSMC approval of such  regradings can be deemed to have been given.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council noted that progress on all the matters  discussed at the institutional meeting will be reported to the next NSMC  plenary meeting and agreed that the Council will meet again in institutional  format, as appropriate, in 2008.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister (Rev Dr Ian Paisley)</strong>: I wish to associate myself with everything  that the deputy First Minister has said, especially about the terrible tragedy  in Omagh. I am sure that our hearts are sore as we think of the sadness over  that family and over the town at this time. They can be assured that all  right-thinking people feel as we do about the matter.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  I thank the deputy First Minister for his statement. I want to question him on  a specific point. Will he outline to the House the process by which  appointments to the North/South implementation bodies and Tourism Ireland Ltd  will take place? I assume that that will happen over the forthcoming weeks or  months. In addition, are there any plans to establish a board for Waterways  Ireland?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: Under the agreement that set up the implementation bodies in  March 1998, the North/South Ministerial Council appoints the management boards  to the trade and business development body &mdash; InterTradeIreland; to the  North/South language body, which includes Foras na Gaeilge and Tha Boord o  Ulster-Scotch; to the Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission; and an  advisory board to the Food Safety Promotion Board. Overall, there are 60  members on the boards of those bodies. The Special EU Programmes Body and  Waterways Ireland do not have boards.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The terms of office of the current board members, including  the chairs and vice-chairs, end in December 2007, and since most of those  people have served two terms, they cannot be reappointed. Many of the chairs,  vice-chairs and members have served on the boards for almost seven years. The  current boards have made a sustained commitment to the work of the bodies, and  the Executive and the Irish Government are currently considering appointments  to the new boards to be made on a 50:50 basis. The process of securing  nominations is under way. Appointments to the boards will require approval at  an appropriate NSMC meeting in November to ensure that the new boards are in  place by mid-December.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">If a Waterways Ireland board were to be established, that  would require legislation. As Members will know, the St Andrews review is an  opportunity to consider that.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Anderson</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat. I was going to ask when the appointments would be made,  but the deputy First Minister has already  answered that question.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  wish to be associated with the deputy First Minister&rsquo;s expression of sympathy  in relation to the Omagh tragedy. I also welcome his remarks about, and echo his strong condemnation of, the  attempted murders of two  police officers.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I appreciate the  appropriate reference to the job losses at Seagate Technology in  Limavady. It was good that the meeting was able to welcome 300 new jobs at Norbrook Laboratories Ltd in Newry. What  contribution can the North/South Ministerial Council make to economic  development, North and South, including co-operation between INI and IDA  Ireland?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: We are all conscious that we  are still in the early stages of this Administration; the institutions have been up and running for six  months, effectively. Considerable work is taking place in the different  institutional formats. In the course of the past week, the Minister of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment and Michelle Gildernew were involved in one of  the sectoral meetings.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">All issues that are connected to the economy are obviously  of huge importance to this Administration and to the Assembly, as it moves  forward.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We work with people in the Irish Government who recognise  the importance of liaising on matters in which it is clear that benefit can be  achieved for Dublin  and for ourselves. In the context of the work that is taking place on what I  consider to be the most important economic investment conference ever to take  place on the North, as time moves on, we look forward to working, through the  NSMC, with the Irish Government and others to ensure that we take best advantage  of the opportunities that are available for our workforce and community.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  too thank the Minister for his statement, and I associate my group both with  his expressions of sympathy to the family that has been devastated by the Omagh tragedy and with his condemnation of the  attacks on the two police officers.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">When the Minister mentioned the cross-border mobility  website, I was surprised to learn that the ambition behind it appears to be  merely to provide information. Does the Minister not agree that strong benefits  would be brought to this society, North and South, if the cross-border movement  of young people into further and higher education were encouraged? Given that  he is examining websites, perhaps he might also consider whether he could spare  time to publish on the OFMDFM website the report on research into the financial  cost of the Northern Ireland  divide. Bearing in mind the issues that apply to society here, both North and  South, perhaps he could discuss a shared future at the next NSMC meeting.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: I shall give a brief history of the report to which the Member  has referred. In September 2000, the  North/South Ministerial Council commissioned  a study on obstacles to mobility in order to identify the impediments that make it difficult for people who wish to move across the border &mdash; in either  direction &mdash; to work, study or live. That study was published in February  2002 and contained 50 recommendations that covered several key areas. Twelve  recommendations, relating to the transfer of pensions, bank charges and the provision of information, remain to be  implemented. Some progress has been made to implement those remaining  recommendations, including: work on the mutual recognition of qualifications,  resulting in the freer cross-border movement of workers in areas such as the  education and health sectors; the introduction of single tariffs by some  mobile-phone operators; and greater availability of public-service information  for people who wish to cross the border to live, work and study. The new cross-border mobility information  website has been launched, and the NSMC joint secretariat will keep the  operation, marketing and management of that website  under review. The secretariat will examine options for the website&rsquo;s  future funding, including possible EU funding, and it will report on that to  future NSMC meetings. The Council agreed  that the secretariat should convene  two working groups. The first group will explore options for  implementing a mechanism to transfer pension rights on a cross-border basis,  and the other will examine cross-border banking issues, such as transaction  charges. Those groups will also report back to a future NSMC meeting.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member also mentioned a shared future, about which  there is a great deal of debate. The work that the First Minister and I &mdash; and,  indeed, all the parties in the Assembly &mdash; are doing to lead by example is the  best illustration of the progress that we are making. We are showing that a huge job of work needs to be  done in order to bring about a  situation that will obviously create massive savings for us in our  budgetary considerations, especially if we have a very sound basis on which to  integrate our community more sensibly.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">A live and current  debate on a shared future is ongoing, but  I am not sure that it is an issue for the NSMC. In the final analysis,  the matter will have to be settled to the satisfaction  of everyone. Everyone in the Assembly has contributed to the work that has been done on it thus far; more people than just the First Minister and I  have been involved. The existence of  the Assembly, the fact that the institutions  are up and working, and the fact that we are making important agreements  on budgetary issues, investment strategies,  and programmes for Government, are clear indicators to the public about  how we intend to move forward. As the First Minister &mdash;correctly &mdash; said after  the NSMC meeting in Armagh, the important  point is to end all the old hatreds and divisions.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">2.15 pm</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Moutray</strong>:  Will the deputy First Minister assure Members that the review body will  critically examine the management of the North/South implementation bodies and  ensure that they do not remain the shambles that many of them currently are?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First Minister</strong>: The review will examine objectively the  efficiency and value for money of existing implementation bodies and consider  the case for additional bodies and areas of co-operation in the NSMC that might  deliver mutual benefits.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The review group&rsquo;s first meeting took place on 31 October  2007. In addition to senior officials from the Executive and the Irish  Government, the review group also includes  an advisory panel comprised of four experts &mdash; two nominated by the Executive and two by the Irish Government.  The two Executive-nominated experts are Peter King and Sean Oliver. Eoin O&rsquo;Shea  and John Hynes were nominated by the Irish Government. Eoin O&rsquo;Shea is the chief executive of the Institute of Directors  in Ireland, and John Hynes is the  former secretary general of  the Department of Social and Family Affairs.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is anticipated that  intensive work will be undertaken by the review group during November  and December and that a final report will be made available to the first NSMC  plenary meeting in 2008. To ensure that review  costs are kept to a minimum, the NSMC decided that the review group  would draw on the existing resources and expertise of Departments in the North and in Dublin in order to implement its terms  of reference. The NSMC secretariat will provide full administrative and  secretarial support to the review group, and the work of the existing  North/South bodies will be unaffected during the review.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, I have no doubt that in the course of that work,  which is under way, we will see people facing up to the past criticisms of those  bodies in order to improve them in the future.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I want to  associate my party with the First Minister&rsquo;s and the deputy First Minister&rsquo;s  comments about the tragedy in Omagh and the despicable attacks in Derry and Dungannon.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In his statement, the  deputy First Minister referred to the  North/South Ministerial Council&rsquo;s study on cross-border mobility, which Sinn F&eacute;in welcomes. The report, published  in February 2002, contains 50 recommend&shy;ations. Will the deputy First Minister  indicate what progress has been made to implement any outstanding recommendations, particularly those relating to  workers&rsquo; pension rights? Will he also indicate whether the study group&rsquo;s  report will be presented to the next council meeting and when that might be?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: The outcome of that will be reported to the next NSMC meeting. At  this stage, it is difficult to say what progress has been made because we have  only just ratified the review. Like everyone else, I await the outcome with  considerable interest, particularly in relation to pension transfers and bank  charges. Both of those matters are being determinedly focused on by the group.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>: In the report, the deputy First Minister mentioned Tourism Ireland Ltd.  Has a strategy been agreed that will benefit the whole Province? I ask in the  light of the loss of 100 jobs in my area last week, and I am conscious that  tourism is a growth area and has the potential to turn things around. In  addition, is there any indication when single tariffs for mobile phones will be  introduced?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: As I indicated earlier, there was a sectoral meeting last week,  on which Nigel Dodds, the Minister of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment, will report.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">On phone charges, things seem to be moving at a far quicker  speed than we have previously seen. We are hopeful that there will be action in  the shorter term.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Tourism is vital to our  economy, and I was heartened by the recent news that, last year, there  was a 75% increase in the number of North American tourists visiting the North.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Those are spectacular figures by our standards, and they  show clearly that an open market exists for us in the United States  in particular. We are conscious that, because of the state of world affairs,  instability and the unpopularity of American foreign policy in other countries, many Americans are reluctant to travel  widely. The fact that large numbers of them are coming to Ireland is  something that we should take advantage of. The 75% increase in the number of  American tourists travelling to the North will boost our tourism industry in  the future.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Shannon comes from a particularly beautiful part of our  country, and I have no doubt whatsoever that the entrepreneurs in his area will  be able to capitalise on the numbers of tourists to the benefit of the local  community.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McClarty</strong>:  My party and I would like to be associated with the expressions of sympathy for  those who so tragically lost their lives in  Omagh this morning. We also wish the two wounded police officers very  speedy recoveries.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I was extremely interested to read that the horrendous  economic news that emanated from my constituency regarding the impending loss  of 930 jobs at Seagate was discussed at the NSMC meeting. Can the deputy First  Minister tell the House what progress, if any, has been made in drawing up an  action plan to address that situation?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: Essentially, the Seagate facility at Limavady produces substrates  &mdash; component parts for data-storage systems in computers &mdash; which are common  across all computer hard-drive systems and which are now manufactured  predominantly in Asia. As a consequence of that, and of recent  expansion in global capacity, the Limavady facility is, according to  Seagate, no longer cost-competitive, particularly as regards labour costs.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">How can we provide assistance to keep the plant here, or  address what is a serious situation involving the loss of so many jobs? Invest  NI has been working closely with the company over the last 18 months in an effort to improve efficiencies and flexibility at  the plant. Despite the significant  success achieved by the workers at  Limavady, the movement in global capacity and prices means that the cost differential, which is  approximately &pound;15 million per annum, is too great to be bridged.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It was clear in the course of the meeting that we had with Dermot Ahern that he was keen to see the  Admin&shy;istrations of the North and South working together to address the  issue. In the coming period, we will try to see  how we can take advantage of the combined wisdom of those agencies that are under our combined stewardship to see  whether we can deal with the horrific difficulties in Limavady.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The north-west gateway initiative, which was set up during  the period of suspension, depended on Departments working with local councils.  All of that requires a joined-up approach and an integrated strategy. I look  forward to seeing the outcome of the combined wisdom of people who have been  through such experiences, particularly in the South.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Dermot Ahern talked about the situation in Clonmel, which suffered equally horrendous job losses.  However, the people there did not lie down under it; they got up off their backsides, shook themselves down and  recovered &mdash; Clonmel is now booming. We hope to do that with Limavady in  the coming period. It will not be easy; it will be difficult. However, given  the scale of the job losses, there is no doubt whatsoever that we must  prioritise Limavady as an area in need of assistance.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Ramsey</strong>:  I too would like to be associated with the deputy First Minister&rsquo;s condemnation  of the attempted murders of the two policemen and the awful loss of the family  in Omagh last night.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In his recent speech to a Chamber of Commerce meeting, the Taoiseach referred to the north-west  gateway initiative. He discussed how that initiative is a joint approach to building greater capacity and a  better quality of life for all in the north-west region, which, as we know, includes Donegal, Limavady, Strabane and Derry.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Taoiseach  identified challenges that the initiative addresses, including workforce  development, higher education, innovation and science. Will those areas be prioritised, especially in light of David  McClarty&rsquo;s point about the economic setbacks that recent job losses have  created?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Sir Reg Empey has often talked about investment coming from  America.  However, those investors are no longer interested in capital investment; they  are more interested in a trained and skilled workforce. What efforts are the  Executive making to ensure that we are creating a better workforce that has the  capacity to attract investment?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First Minister</strong>: The Member and I, among others, were present when the Taoiseach  visited the north-west a number of weeks ago. The Taoiseach spoke about the  importance of the north-west gateway initiative, which is hugely important to  everyone who lives in that area.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Since taking up the  post of Minister for Employment and  Learning, Sir Reg Empey has consistently reiterated the importance of  skilling our workforce so that it meets the needs of a changing world. That is  a huge priority for him. We have been to the United States on several occasions,  and he and I were on a delegation together during the Smithsonian Festival. In  all the engagements that we were involved in, it was clear that he considers  developing skills a priority on which his Department needed to major.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is still early days. However, the economic invest&shy;ment  conference will take place in May, and many business groups from the United States  will probably come to the North before that. In our attempts to attract more  inward investment, we hope to interest many of <span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt; ">those groups in the situation in the north-west, especially</span> as  the recent devastating news in Limavady has created an issue that must be  addressed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Other good work has been done on roads in the north-west.  Roads are key to infrastructure, and they <span style="letter-spacing:-.2pt; ">encourage  people to visit particular areas. The universities</span> in that area have  been working to attract more people to their institutions.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Sir Reg Empey was involved in a sectoral meeting of the  North/South Ministerial Council in Dublin  in recent weeks, and he majored on the issue of a skills strategy, which is  rightly a priority.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong><span style="letter-spacing:-.05pt; ">Mr McCartney</span></strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle, agus gabhaim  bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire fosta. The deputy First Minister&rsquo;s statement referred to  the next plenary meeting of the NSMC. Will the Minister please announce the  date of that meeting?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: The date of the next NSMC plenary meeting has not yet been  finalised. However, it is anticipated that it will take place early in the new  year. Given that it is the intention to host the North/South Ministerial Council meetings on an alternate basis,  the next plenary meeting will be held in Dundalk  in the South.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Boylan</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.  Will the deputy First Minister state when he envisages that the new  accommodation for the North/South Ministerial Council secretariat in Armagh city will be ready? Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: A business case and an economic appraisal that were completed in  2006 <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt; ">confirmed that the North/South  Ministerial Council joint </span>secretariat accommodation does not meet  operational requirements. It was therefore  recommended that suitable alternative accommodation in the Armagh area should be  identified. I have been to the current accommodation several times, and  I have seen the far-from-satisfactory conditions in which the civil servants  are working.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">2.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is recommended that the secretariat should lease  suitable accommodation in the Armagh area from  a third party, which will either provide an appropriate building, or design and  build one to specification. Earlier this year, expressions of interest were  sought from those willing to provide accommodation for the secretariat. A  number of tenders were received and have been evaluated against agreed criteria  to provide a shortlist of four bidders. Those four have been invited to respond  to a second, more rigorous selection process using a more detailed  specification. At its meeting on 30 October, the Council agreed that, once  evaluation of the shortlisted bids is complete &mdash; subject to the appropriate  internal processes in each Administration &mdash; officials should enter into  contract negotiations with the preferred bidder to provide leased  accommodation, and report progress to a future NSMC meeting. Following the  award of a contract, construction and fit-out will take approximately two  years, and the new accommodation could be available in late 2009.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McFarland</strong>:  I thank the Ministers for their statement. Has the deputy First Minister been  driven to distraction by the complaints of the First Minister and junior  Minister Paisley about what a waste of time and money the North/South  Ministerial Council represents, or have they changed their views on this issue  since the first Assembly?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In his discussions with Tourism Ireland on human resources,  which I see is on the menu here, have the deputy First Minister and his  colleagues worked out how the marked community imbalance in the staff of that  body is to be rectified?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: With respect to the Member&rsquo;s second  question, all those matters are consistently under review. Where there  are difficulties, measures will be taken to correct them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As to whether I am driven to distraction by the First  Minister, I have been working with him for the last six months and he has not  driven me to distraction yet.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: No  doubt the House takes great comfort from  the working relationship between the First Minister and the deputy First  Minister. However, we would like to see more delivery and better results.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">With reference to the  deputy First Minister&rsquo;s statement and his focus on economic development  after Seagate, is there not a limit on how far co-operation between the two  jurisdictions can go? They operate in different frameworks: the South works on the basis of a differential rate  of corporation tax; in Northern    Ireland, we have to operate on the basis of  selective financial assistance through the award of grants.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Have the Executive sought the assistance of the Irish  Government in making representations to the British Government on the Varney  Review? How will the Southern Government encourage investors who are considering investment in the island of Ireland  to invest in the North as opposed to the South, notwithstanding the more competitive framework in the South of  Ireland?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: The Member raises obvious practical difficulties: the fact that  we are working with two separate jurisdictions and two completely different  systems of government. The issue of corporation tax has exercised the Executive  and the Assembly many times in the last six months.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">During the course of his  review, Varney went to Dublin  and met different interest groups there. No doubt he learnt the views of  both the Irish Government, who are supportive of everything that we have said  in relation to that issue, and business interests in the South.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is always a level  of competition, as different regions of the country constantly angle for  more jobs and more prosperity. For us, the question is whether &mdash; in the course  of our deliberations with the Irish Government on a wide range of matters under  the auspices of the North/South Ministerial Council &mdash; we are working with  people willing to assist in economic investment and development in the North.  It is clear to us that there is good heart  for the North in Irish Govern&shy;ment circles and that, in spite of all the  practical difficulties, people are willing  to be imaginative as to how we go forward and improve the economic  prospects for people in the North, who have been so detrimentally affected by  decades of conflict.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Our society is emerging  from that conflict, and those with whom we work are prepared to assist  as much as possible. For example, there is  no doubt that our efforts to  encourage investment from the United    States receive support from the Irish  Government. As it approaches, I am becoming excited about the economic  investment conference&rsquo;s prospects. The new US special envoy to the North, Paula Dobriansky, has been here on a  number of occasions and has worked very hard to attract key American  companies to the investment conference. She has not simply issued fine words or  aspirational statements but has stressed  the need for delivery, which is the kind of language that I like to hear  when I talk to people about economic investment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Irish Government are therefore encouraging all of that  to which I have referred. Practical difficulties remain, but it is a matter of being imaginative, of which we are  capable.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="4"></a>Private Members&rsquo; Business</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Sports Strategy</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to one hour and 30  minutes for the debate. The proposer of the motion will have 10 minutes to  propose and 10 minutes for a winding-up speech. All other Members who wish to  speak will have five minutes. One amendment has been received and published on  the Marshalled List. The proposer of the amendment will have 10 minutes to  propose and five minutes for a winding-up speech.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Ramsey</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That this Assembly recognises the importance of sport  in the physical, social and economic well-being of society; expresses concern  that National Lottery funding is being diverted to the 2012 London Olympics and  will have a negative impact on community sport; and believes that the proposed  draft budget is not sufficient to meet the standards and priorities of the  proposed sports strategy recently announced by the Minister of Culture, Arts  and Leisure.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I am aware that  two of my colleagues on the Committee for  Culture, Arts and Leisure have tabled an amendment to the motion. We are  working well in Committee, so I do not want  there to be a Division, particularly on sport. However, we shall see how  the debate goes.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Sport and exercise are extremely important to the  well-being of society: it is not an accident that socially progressive  Governments invest heavily in sport and exercise facilities. Sport and exercise  have a direct impact on our health, social lives and education, and they  contribute to a country&rsquo;s international standing and economic well-being. There is great concern across the community and in sporting sectors at the  inadequate funding for sport in the  draft Budget. Given wider spending commitments, the ambitious targets  that the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure has set will not be met.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Serious shortfalls in sports funding have occurred as a  result of the siphoning-off of &pound;4&middot;5 million of lottery funding for the London  Olympics. When the London bid was announced, no  mention was made of the fact that money intended for good causes would be used  to subvent the infrastructure in London.  As a result, we now see the failure of our  Executive to provide adequate funding  to offset funding reductions in the draft Budget.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Sport gives society a powerful return on investment. It makes us fitter and healthier, and it improves  self-esteem and communities. Where there is world-class participation,  sport provides an international platform for the entire region.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Consider the money that sport saves the Health Service. For example, in my Foyle constituency,  there is a regeneration project  known as the TRIAX community sport  programme. The programme involves people from the Fountain, the Bogside  and the Brandywell. TRIAX runs a health and fitness club for women, of which  one of my constituents &mdash; let us call her Mary &mdash; is a member. Mary was badly  overweight, her physical health was deteriorating, and she was lonely and  depressed. After she joined the health and fitness club, she made friends and  lost over three stone. She now has her life back. Mary&rsquo;s story is replicated in  homes and communities across the North, and, as the Minister will know, that  example highlights the input that sport makes to health and well-being in  communities.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Sport is worth investing in because the returns for health,  education and society are so substantial. There was deep disappointment across the sport and community sectors  when the draft Budget was announced.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The sports sector delivers well above its weight due to so much voluntary contribution; it probably  has more voluntary contribution than any other sector. It is an  indictment that any Government should expect such work to continue to be  carried out on the cheap.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As a result of the comprehensive spending review (CSR)  decisions announced by the Minister of Finance and Personnel last week, there  are concerns for sport in Northern    Ireland. I will talk about three specific  issues: the impact on the draft strategy for sport, the Olympic centres of  excellence, and the stadia safety programme.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In October 2007, the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure launched the &lsquo;Northern Ireland Strategy for Sport  and Physical Recreation 2007-2017&rsquo;. That document identified anticipated  investments and associated targets for sport&rsquo;s contribution to society in Northern Ireland  during the next 10 years. Proposals in the CSR provide only a minute revenue  contribution towards the spending that will be necessary to achieve the  strategy&rsquo;s targets and outcomes. However, the CSR document lifts many targets  directly from the strategy. It is totally unrealistic to expect the level of  investment announced for the first three  years to make any significant contribution to the targets proposed in  the strategy. As a result, the strategy document identifies the need to spend  &pound;90 million in developing sports venues in Northern Ireland. Without such development, the targets  cannot be achieved.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The draft Budget provides virtually no funding for sports  facilities at community level. I will reiterate: no money will be available in the Budget for any community sports infrastructure in Northern Ireland.  That, combined with the loss of lottery income to the 2012 Olympic and  Paralympic Games, means that Sport Northern Ireland will have no opportunity to  make capital investment in community-sports facilities during the next three  years.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The historic level of investment by Sport Northern Ireland  &mdash; &pound;70 million during the past 10 years to local clubs, councils and community  organisations &mdash; will cease completely. Sport will receive no capital from  Government or from lottery funding.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Peter Hain announced the elite facilities programme, and he  confirmed that a budget of &pound;53 million to fund programmes would ensure that Northern Ireland  would benefit from the legacy of the Olympic Games. Many public- and  private-sector organisations have spent time and resources in applying for  funds under the funding programme of the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure. Many of the bids were superb and  promised to provide outstanding centre-of-excellence facilities across Northern Ireland.  Indeed, many of them were promised additional investment. It is disappointing,  therefore, that the recent announcement reduces that Budget commitment to &pound;35  million.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Fifteen million pounds has already been set aside for a  fifty-metre swimming pool in Bangor,  but there are &pound;102 million worth of  applications for other Olympic-related facilities outstanding. I  understand that Sport Northern Ireland and  the applicants had anticipated that there would be a pot of more than  &pound;30 million to fund the winners of the  competition. The CSR announcement has  reduced that pot to just &pound;20 million. If that situation is not remedied,  the Executive will fail to deliver on the former Secretary of State&rsquo;s promise  of &pound;53 million. Resources have been wasted on making applications when a large  part of the budget has now disappeared. Northern Ireland will fail to  benefit from any legacy opportunities from the 2012 Olympic Games.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">During the past seven years, the stadia safety programme has delivered health and safety  improvements to major sports grounds in Northern Ireland. The draft Budget makes no provision for any continued  investment in major sports grounds. In 1997, the Scott Report identified  that investment of &pound;30 million was required to bring Northern Ireland&rsquo;s sports grounds  up to proper health and safety standards. Inflation and increased standards  have now taken the required amount to well over the &pound;6&middot;3 million that has been  invested by Sport Northern Ireland. There  has been failure to deliver on obligations to improve health and safety  for spectators and players at major sports grounds, and members of the public  will be exposed to unreasonable risk when they attend those grounds.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Northern Ireland will fail to attract significant events because our sports grounds may not be up to the  required standard; indeed, some of  them may even be closed <span style="letter-spacing:-.25pt; ">because they  are not fit for purpose. Sporting infrastructure</span> in Northern Ireland is falling further behind that  of the Republic of Ireland, Britain, and the rest of the world.  Grounds will fail to meet the standards imposed by The Safety of Sports Grounds  (Northern Ireland)  Order 2006 and the associated &lsquo;Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds&rsquo;, commonly  known as the &ldquo;green guide&rdquo;. Grounds will be  closed or their capacity greatly reduced.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The big problem is the lack of capital funds. The Olympic  budget has been cut by &pound;18 million, and there is no funding for safe sports  grounds. Sport Northern    Ireland has made a commitment of &pound;8&middot;5  million to a safety programme. That money can come only from the Olympic  facilities budget, reducing it to around &pound;11 million &mdash; plus the cost of the  swimming pool. That constitutes a drop of &pound;27 million from the original budget  of &pound;53 million &mdash; that is a lot of money.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Even if Sport Northern  Ireland received an additional &pound;8&middot;5 million to provide for safe sport  grounds, the sad reality is that there is no capital funding for sports  infrastructure across Northern    Ireland. I say that in the context that there are groups that are currently  receiving funding for modernisation  processes, which are carrying out excellent work.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Ulster Rugby and the Ulster Council of the GAA have secured  funding until March 2008. If additional funding  is not added to that budget, we shall face major redundancies in those  two organisations, which even the Minister would concede are carrying out  excellent work in their own communities in promoting health and well-being, and reducing social crime and  vandalism. As I understand it, 15 jobs will be lost from the GAA and  Ulster Rugby unless additional money is provided.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">At a time when we are trying to create a positive  environment in which sports clubs have the capacity to deliver on health and  well-being, and when they are doing the work that the Government expects them  to do, we are shutting up shop.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I beg to move the following amend&shy;ment: Leave out all after the second &ldquo;sport&rdquo;  and insert</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;; welcomes the proposed sports strategy recently announced  by the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure; recognises that funding of the  strategy should be considered in the context of the findings of the Vernon assets group; and calls on all  stakeholders to work together to maximise the opportunities that exist  in the sports strategy.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I consider it almost impossible to underestimate  the impact of sport in supporting and sustaining the social and economic  framework of our society. I shall comment on the motion and the amendment,  consecut&shy;ively. The effects of active participation in sport on the long-term  health of our society are overwhelmingly positive. I believe, as Mr Ramsey  does, that we must analyse the benefits of sports activity on the human body  and, increase our understanding of why inclusive community-based sport is so  essential and why it requires sufficient resources. This matter was discussed  by the Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure in the context of the Minister&rsquo;s  statement, but not in respect of how we should address the issue. That is why  the motion is a little premature.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Recent research indicates that exercise triggers the  release of naturally produced chemicals that protect the brain cells and keeps  them performing at top speed &mdash; a goal that we are always aiming for. Exercise  can protect an ageing brain from dementia, and even from Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease.  Perhaps some Members should take note of that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Participation in sport  boosts concentration by assisting us  in gaining a restful night&rsquo;s sleep. It also boosts energy levels.  Therefore, the impact of participation in sport is very real. Active sports  participation reduces the risk of high blood  pressure, helps to maintain normal blood-glucose levels, and helps in the prevention and manage&shy;ment of type-2  diabetes. Recently, there was a present&shy;ation by Diabetes UK in the Long  Gallery, at which its representatives said  that one of the most common forms of  diabetes is type 2. That is the type that affects people who were,  perhaps, not born with diabetes, but acquire it later in life.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Moreover, sports  participation assists in the develop&shy;ment of strong bones and can be exceptionally beneficial for women,  who may be prone to osteoporosis.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We all now understand the clear benefits of sport for one&rsquo;s  heart in respect of cholesterol and blood flow, which are critical risk factors  in coronary heart disease and strokes. We  should also consider the negative impact of inactivity, namely the increased risks of colon cancer and  breast cancer. It should be noted that inactivity has been linked to cancers of the womb, lungs and prostate. There is  a high incidence of prostate cancer in men. High blood pressure &mdash; or  hypertension &mdash; can speed up the progress of kidney disease.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We are only too aware of the rise in obesity rates,  particularly in childhood obesity, and the National Health Service is trying to  address that problem directly. For all of those reasons, it is critical that  our community-based sports services and development of that sector are actively  resourced and promoted.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Let it also be noted that I strongly welcome the decision  to award the 2012 Olympic Games to the great city of London. The positive repercussions of that  decision will be strongly felt in Northern Ireland. Indeed, along with many others, we campaigned at  local government level for the London  bid. I was delighted that the London 2012  roadshow visited Northern    Ireland, and I hope that it inspires  the people of this Province to engage in sport and unearth their own talents.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I broadly welcome the comments of the Minister of Culture,  Arts and Leisure in encouraging everyone in Northern   Ireland to get involved in all aspects of the Olympic  games, whether it be sports participation, volunteering or coaching, so that we  can leave a lasting legacy for generations to come in Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, if funds are diverted, I am concerned about the  impact on local sports clubs and community sports development. I witness daily  the positive impact that funding has had in  allowing community-based sports teams to offer an inclusive sports  service to hundreds and thousands of my constituents. That is replicated in  other constituencies across the whole of the Province. It is therefore  imperative that the development of that work is not stunted by inadequate resource  allocation or diversion of resources to other areas.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Ramsey</strong>:  The amendment refers to the Vernon  assets group. Is there a time frame for  looking at DCAL and public bodies to determine what surplus lands there  are? Some of the groups can ill afford for that review to take place in two  years&rsquo; time. An immediate effect is needed.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>: I thank the Member for his intervention. I was about to come to  that point.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Just last week, the  Culture, Arts and Leisure Committee received a letter indicating that  approximately &pound;43 million of lottery funding and contributions that would have  gone to the arts, sport and culture was being given directly to the Olympic  Games. We have tried to explain our position in the amendment. That shortfall  of &pound;43 million &mdash; indeed, some Members have said that it may be as much as &pound;70  million &mdash; means that good major projects are being put on hold. Capital  projects could be shelved, and many other good sporting projects could be put  on the back burner for some time. Where is the legacy for sport in the Province  that the 2012 Olympic Games is supposed to leave us? It is not right that some  80-plus projects and schemes are being brushed aside for an Olympic programme.  We all welcome that programme, but we want to see what the lasting benefits  will be for us. That is why we have put forward this amendment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">For everyone&rsquo;s information, I want to explain the idea  behind the amendment. At about half past ten this morning, I spoke to the  Minister about my comments so that I could make them publicly in the Chamber.  The assets realisation group is headed by Ed Vernon. His job is to source  surplus resources in the areas that fall within the remit of the Northern  Ireland Assembly and to ensure that those moneys are then ploughed back into projects  that will perhaps not go ahead because of the re-allocation of money to the  Olympic Games. With respect to Pat, his motion outlines how we all feel, but it  does not outline how we will address this matter. However, the amendment does  just that; it tells us how we can address the shortfall.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I asked the Minister about that matter this morning, and it  is important that the point is made. I was told this morning that that review  of surplus resources will be made available and will, I understand, be in the  Budget year beginning 1 April 2008. We are looking for extra resources, and  they will be found as a result of the assets review. It is important that all stakeholders work together to  maximise the many opportunities of the sports strategy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that that statement is made, and I thank  the Member for making his intervention in relation to it. The Committee for  Culture, Arts and Leisure must discuss with the Minister how the issue will be  addressed: only then can we move on.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I strongly share the Minister&rsquo;s concerns that participation  rates in sport are among the lowest in the UK, and falling. I want to see  those rates improve through the combined action of Sport Northern Ireland,  councils and resources in our education sector. I want to see a win-win  situation, in which we maximise the potential of the 2012 Olympic Games in London and other significant events such as the  Commonwealth Games in Glasgow  in 2014, alongside the adequate resourcing  of a community-based sporting infrastructure.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We have a tremendous opportunity, not only to be part of the greatest show on Earth, the Olympic  Games &mdash; and the next greatest show, the Commonwealth Games &mdash; but to have  a legacy for the people of the Province and the children who come after us.  That will help us to meet the 24 targets set out in the draft strategy; it will  assist in improving public health; and it will contribute to our children&rsquo;s  academic performance and self-esteem. It will go some way to addressing the  under-representation in our sporting programmes of women, people with a  disability and people on low incomes. I urge Members to support the amendment.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brolly</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I approve of the broad thrust of  the motion. However, my party will support the amendment as an enhancement of  it. The second part of the motion would tend to tie our hands before the Budget  consultation process takes place and before, as Mr Shannon suggested, the  Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure has an opportunity to talk to the  Minister about the matter.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is disappointing that money is being taken from the poor  to feed the rich. Our local sporting community is already &mdash; and has ever been &mdash;  significantly underfunded. More than &pound;40 million of Lotto funding has been  taken away from our hopelessly insufficient budget by the English. Some things  never change. We are told that there will  be some spin-off for us from the Olympics &mdash; a sort of &ldquo;live horse, and you will get oats&rdquo; assurance. There  may be some training or games at the new  Long Kesh stadium, and maybe some  other crumbs. However, between  2009 and 2012, our sporting organisations, and small clubs, such as boxing  clubs, in more needy areas in particular, will not develop as they had hoped,  and many may not survive. I pay tribute to my own boxing club &mdash; St Canice&rsquo;s in  Dungiven &mdash; which has produced one of Ireland&rsquo;s best current professional  boxers, Paul &ldquo;Dudey&rdquo; McCloskey. I wish him, along with John Duddy from the  city, and all our boxers, every success in the future.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We should not rule out the possibility that a further tranche of Lotto money will be taken from us,  considering the almost monthly announcements of upward adjust&shy;ments of  the estimates for the London Games. The estimated cost of building the Olympic  stadium, for example, has doubled since  2004. During the inevitably lean  years from 2009 to 2012, we should seek enhanced investment from the  South, considering that all sports, except soccer, are organised on an  all-Ireland basis, and not unmindful of the likelihood that many of our local  soccer stars will opt to play for the South.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We can be encouraged by the record of our sporting  community, with help from generous sponsors, local and otherwise, over the generations, who have dedicated themselves to our young people, giving their time  freely and offering their expertise selflessly. However, we must keep  struggling to get them the proper tools so that they can do the job as well as  they know how. Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.00 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  The motion specifically mentions the negative impact that a reduction in  funding will have on community sport. It then proceeds to highlight the  potential impact that an inadequate level of funding would have on the delivery  of the proposed strategy that was announced recently by the Minister. It is widely recognised that, compared with GB,  historically, sport in Northern    Ireland is already underfunded. That was  before the double whammy, represented by the withdrawal  of &pound;4&middot;1 million from Sport Northern Ireland, appeared on the horizon.  Although there have been assurances that, post 2012, there will be a financial  redress, a crucial interim period remains when sporting activities may be  severely curtailed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Some people will ask &ldquo;so what?&rdquo; and say that sport is  unimportant in the scheme of things. However, the sports strategy for Northern    Ireland noted correctly that 2,000 deaths a year are attributable to physical  inactivity. The increasing levels of obesity among our children are directly  linked to a decrease in the opportunities that they have for sporting activity.  Coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes &mdash;some people in the Public Gallery  attended a conference today on that topic &mdash; and cancer risks have all increased  significantly as a consequence of inactivity. The National Health Service currently spends &pound;886 per head of population to  address health issues, but only &pound;1 per head is spent on physical  activity, which could prevent many of those illnesses.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mental-health issues could also be eased through greater physical activity and sport. If levels of  participation are reduced, stand back and watch the levels of stress and anxiety increase. Activity in sport bolsters  confidence and allows young people to experience a sense of achievement.  A reduction in that physical activity can undermine a fragile sense of worth  and lead to young people turning to alternative stimulation in the form of  alcohol and drug abuse.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The importance of  participation in sport and physical activity provides not only a  socially acceptable safety valve for young people, thereby reducing the risk of  antisocial activity, but it widens their horizons. It introduces them to  situations where they must work as a team  and beyond the safety net of their own community. Such transferable  social skills lead to an understanding of a wider society and its many  disparate sectors. That is a valuable experience for all, but it is especially  important for people who are locked into communities where one class and one  culture prevail.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The sports strategy is a suitable vehicle to deliver  individual and group benefits in the field of health and community cohesion. It  is also a valuable vehicle for economic  expansion. Sport in Northern    Ireland contributes more than &pound;300  million to the local economy. It is also calculated to provide employment to  around 13,000 people in the sport and  recreation industry. That industry must fear that without adequate  funding, the sporting economy will face a serious decline.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">On 10 September 2007,  at Question Time in the House, I asked the Minister of Culture, Arts and  Leisure what steps he was taking to offset the reduction in lottery funding.  The Minister replied that he was making bids for funding to support the  development of sport and the arts. Perhaps he will indicate how successful he  has been so far in convincing the Minister of Finance and Personnel of that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Eric Saunders, the  chairman of Sport Northern Ireland, has warned of the effects of cuts on  participation and performance, and on the provision of new facilities and the  upgrading of older ones. He has also warned of the impact on sports development officers, who are attached to local  councils, and on the much-vaunted programme for  the talented athletes in the Province to develop their skills. Those warnings must not be ignored if the  valuable sports strategy is to  achieve its aspirations and turn them into reality.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">On the matter of the amendment, Mr Shannon has pointed out  the benefits that the assets group may bring to addressing some of the problems  that have been mentioned today. I hope that his touching faith in Peter  Robinson will be rewarded. However, I remain to be convinced that Mr Robinson  can fulfil the role of Santa Claus, even in the approach to the festive season.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  When I first heard that London had been awarded  the 2012 Olympic Games, I thought that the knock-on effect might mean a bonus  for Northern Ireland.  Athletes will not have to travel halfway around the world, so many more local  people could be trained and sent to  compete, after which they might return with some gold medals.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, the recent news that some of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  lottery funding for sport is to be redirected to the London Olympics has made  me question my initial enthusiasm. It is good news that the Olympics will be  held nearby, as many of our constituents will be able to travel easily to watch them. However, if that  means that London&rsquo;s  hosting the Olympics will be to the detriment of sport here in general, it is  not such good news.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Sport in Northern Ireland  is at an all-time high. Almost all Northern Ireland teams, and many  individuals, are achieving success. Some of those successes were expected, but  others were not. If funding for sport in Northern Ireland is cut, it will be  extremely difficult to maintain that level of success, which is due mostly to  sporting activity at grass-roots and community level, where as many people as  possible benefit. I do not agree that the money should be redirected to benefit  the select few elite athletes from other areas. At a time when fitness and  health are high on the agenda, the decision to redirect sports funding away  from Northern Ireland  was ill thought out.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I wonder whether those in charge of finance for the London  Olympics knew all along that lottery funding would need to be redirected from  different areas throughout the UK.  I am glad to see that the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure is in the  Chamber today. Will he confirm that the budget of &pound;53 million, which was  awarded to elite facilities for 2012, is secure and will be honoured? That most important question requires an  answer.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Sport can have a massive impact on community relations, as  it often provides the only opportunity for children and young people from  different communities to come together to interact. Often, children go through primary and secondary school without ever getting  involved with kids from the other side.  Therefore, sport has an important  role to play as Northern    Ireland moves into a new era. A cut in funding will, undoubtedly, hinder that  progress.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The cut in lottery funding notwithstanding, I voice my  concern for all Northern Irish sport, because it was not even mentioned in the recently announced investment strategy  for Northern Ireland.  People can benefit so much from partaking in a wide range of activities, so I  had hoped that sport would feature strongly in the investment strategy.  However, I should have realised that my hopes that the Executive would make the  right decision were just daydreams, because, so far, they have failed to  deliver on almost every issue. I express my disappointment with the Executive.  I thought that they would do the right  thing for the whole community.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">All sporting activities  must be supported. I pay tribute to Sport Northern Ireland for its  vision and ideals. However, that organisation must be properly funded.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Browne</strong>: I support the amendment. I congratulate the city of Glasgow on its successful bid to host the 2014  Commonwealth Games, which, in addition to the 2012 London Olympic Games, will  present Northern Ireland with economic, social and sporting  opportunities. I hope that Northern   Ireland, particularly Belfast, will host some events associated with both the Olympics and the  Commonwealth Games. I agree that the Assembly should  recognise the importance of sport to the physical, social and economic  well-being of society. However, I would be  equally concerned about any diversion of funds having an impact on community sport in Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The 2012 Olympic Games in London  will be the greatest sporting event held in the United Kingdom for over 40 years.  It will have a dramatic, positive impact on  sport generally and on community sport, in particular. However, the  Assembly must be mindful of budgetary caution  and prudence. I am sure that all Members could cite &mdash; and some already  have &mdash; projects and areas of special sporting interest that could benefit from  an increase in the proposed draft Budget. Nevertheless, rather than stating  that the draft Budget is insufficient to meet the standards and priorities of  the proposed sports strategy, which was announced recently by the Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure, I propose that every effort should be made to  investigate other means to compensate for any National Lottery funding that may  be diverted to the 2012 Olympic Games.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As well as recognising that funding of the strategy should be considered in the context of the  findings of the assets realisation group, whose report will be published  in early January 2008, other means should be explored to try to make up the shortfall. Camelot is endeavouring to  persuade the Treasury to move the National Lottery to a gross profit tax, which  would generate additional good-causes revenue of approximately &pound;398 million  between 2008-09 and 2018-19. Some of that money  could be used to compensate for the moneys being diverted from the  National Lottery for the Olympics.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Another means of obtaining funding for sport and for arts  could be through the Strategic Investment Board&rsquo;s investment strategy for Northern Ireland.  The board&rsquo;s &lsquo;Building a Better Future: Draft Investment Strategy 2008-2018&rsquo;  states that we can look forward to developing a culture and sporting  infrastructure over the next 10 years that will bring great benefits to all the  people of Northern Ireland. It also states that a fulfilled and healthy society  needs a rich, creative and vibrant artistic and sporting base.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Sport England  is another example of an organisation compensating for the diversion of lottery  funding. It is seeking ways in which it can raise &pound;50 million through working  with the private sector to increase investment in community-sport facilities.  As well as encouraging the private sector  to offer its skills and expertise to local sports clubs in the  communities that it serves, Sport England is working with the Football  Association and the Football Foundation to create sports hubs involving  community and commercial activities. I urge Sport Northern Ireland to initiate  similar schemes here to compensate for the diversion of lottery funding.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members of the Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure  believe passionately in sport. The Assembly must do everything in its power to  encourage, involve and support as many people as possible in sporting activities. That is why community sport is so  important. However, we must look beyond our doors in seeking financial  support. Therefore, I support the amendment.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Anderson</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Ba mhaith liom taca&iacute;ocht a  thabhairt don leas&uacute;. I support the motion. It should be a cause of concern to  the Assembly that the British Government are  diverting Big Lottery moneys to prop up development projects financially  for the London Olympic Games. That money should come directly from the coffers  of the British Government. Surely the British Prime Minister, Mr Brown, having  spent many years as Chancellor of the Exchequer, could come up with the money  from elsewhere, rather than taking it from the poor and most marginalised  communities.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">While the British Government spend billions of pounds of  taxpayers&rsquo; money to prosecute their wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, community  groups that provide essential services are being hit as lottery funds are diverted to fill the subsequent financial void. As  Members of an elected Assembly with no real power to raise tax or  revenue, no one should be surprised that we have a limited budget to meet  legitimate demands for first-class public services and infrastructure &mdash; in  sports and leisure, or any other sector.  Therefore, there is a need for greater all-Ireland economic  co-operation, particularly because &mdash; as  Francie Brolly said &mdash; many of our major sports operate on an all-Ireland  basis. That illustrates the need for the Assembly&rsquo;s existing powers to be  strengthened, enhanced and augmented. Perhaps we could then levy in support of a sports-development budget that  addresses future demands and the expectations of our people.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As a Member for Foyle, I have additional concerns that the  limited funds for the sports strategy should be allocated on the basis of spatial  equality and the need for balanced regional development. In 2003, the DSD urban  design strategy concluded that job-creation opportunities in local leisure  activities would equal knowledge-based job-creation opportunities over the next  15 years. Therefore, local leisure activity is a strategic area for employment  growth in places such as Derry, on foot of the Stand Up for Derry  campaign. T&aacute; m&eacute; ag iarraidh n&iacute;os m&oacute; jabanna agus tuillleadh infheist&iacute;ochta i nDoire. I call for more jobs and  investment in Derry. That campaign is  set against the backdrop of more than 10,000 redundancies in the Derry city area between 1998 and 2004.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If sport has the potential to grow as an area of  employment, politicians must take the necessary steps to ensure that cities  such as Derry realise their full potential. In addition to facilitating greater  employment and enhancing local and  regional services, sport can play  a key role in assisting the delivery of neighbour&shy;hood renewal. That is an  important consideration in a city where  over half the population live in neighbourhood-renewal areas. A recent  study into the role of sport in deprived <span style="letter-spacing:-.3pt; ">areas concluded that sport can be used to attract</span> individuals who are reluctant to engage  in education or training through traditional  routes, and to motivate people to learn new skills. As Jim Shannon said,  involvement in sport can help to tackle the growing problem of obesity and  contribute to healthier lifestyles.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A clear and dedicated funding stream that is linked to  local sports-development plans is required, which includes key stakeholders and  &mdash; where applicable &mdash; neighbourhood renewal  priorities. Derry is the largest  municipal area west of the Bann; it is the capital of the north-west and the  second-largest city in the North. From a regional perspective, Derry has the need, the economic case and the critical  mass of population for investment in large  sporting infrastructure projects to be successful. The political will of  the Minister is required to make that happen. That political will should have  been realised in his budgetary bids, and would have been were those bids  subject to a full equality impact assessment. I support the amendment, and I am  sure that Jim Shannon, Pat Ramsey and Barry McElduff will address in my  concerns in the Committee. Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Simpson</strong>:  I declare an interest as a member of a subcommittee of Craigavon Borough  Council that is involved in applying for an Olympic Games flagship project. I support the amendment tabled by my  colleagues Jim Shannon and Lord Browne.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I suppose that Members will look at my physique and wonder at my talking about the Olympics and  sport.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  He is a wrestler.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Simpson</strong>:  Yes, a wrestler. I looked across the Chamber at the proposer of the motion, Pat  Ramsey, and then I looked behind me at Lord Browne who was the second Member to  speak to the amendment, and I thought that there is hope for me yet.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>A Member</strong>:  There is a heavyweight section.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Simpson</strong>:  Yes, there is a heavyweight section, and I understand that an observers&rsquo;  category will be introduced, so perhaps we will fit into that category.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Northern    Ireland ought to have a sports strategy, and  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s recent announcement to that effect. We have heard other Members say how beneficial such a  strategy will be for the younger generations and, perhaps, for some of the  older generation. My colleague Mr Shannon mentioned the release of some form of  juices within the body to stimulate the brain. We will not get too excited  about that, but if that happened, it would  benefit us all, and I would welcome it. Had there been a sports strategy  in the past, I am sure that all Members would say that they would have been a lot fitter and that things would have been  different when they attended school or university.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The amendment sits  comfortably with long-established DUP policy. For several years, the DUP  stood almost alone in saying that savings could and should be made in the  public purse if the size of the public sector were addressed and its efficiency  questioned. I hope that the capital-realisation task force, headed by the Vernon assets group, will  identify where money can be saved. In sectors where savings are identified,  additional investment should be made. I am pleased to hear that my colleague Mr  Shannon has spoken to the Minister and that more funding will be available from  1 April 2008. That is encouraging news,  despite Ken Robinson&rsquo;s comments  about doubting whether the Finance Minister could fulfil the role of  Father Christmas. I hope on this occasion that he acts like him and that we  will see the benefits of that in due course.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">All Members will realise that all projects will not be  realised: some will be knocked out in each round. However, some innovative  projects are in the pipeline, and I trust  that those will be successful. As I said earlier, I am involved in a  flagship project in Craigavon to provide a new rowing lake and white water  rafting facilities. It is a unique provision that will be beneficial to  tourism, and it meets the standards and sustainability requirements as laid  down in the Olympic criteria. It will bring thousands of people to my  constituency, and all MLAs in the area support the project and are keen to push  it forward, given that it will benefit everyone. It is my hope that hugely  beneficial projects, such as that in Craigavon and others across the Province,  will be realised so that Northern    Ireland can punch above its weight in the  future.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>: As a committed devolutionist, no one welcomed the removal of the direct ruler more than me. However,  one matter that the then Secretary of State addressed  positively was the confirmation of a budget of up to &pound;53 million to fund the elite-facilities programme. That funding was intended to ensure that Northern Ireland would benefit from, and contribute to, the legacy  of the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games in London.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is regrettable that the enthusiasm of the Minister responsible for sport is clearly not shared by  the Minister of Finance and Personnel, who enjoys the sport of &ldquo;control  freakery&rdquo;. Although he would undoubtedly strike for gold, thankfully his skills  are not recognised by the International Olympic Committee or any other proper  sporting body, and I fail to understand how they are recognised in the House  sometimes too.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">On 28 October, Mr Peter Robinson, despite the efforts of  many in the public and private sectors who spent time and resources in making  bids to the elite facilities programme, announced a reduction of &pound;18 million in  the fund, reducing it to only &pound;35 million. It was a savage cut, and was without  care, consideration or interest in Olympic sports, or in sports in general. It  means that Northern Ireland  will fail to benefit from the legacy opportunities; the Government will fail to  deliver on its promise of &pound;53 million for Olympic-related facilities; resources  will have been wasted in making applications when a large part of the Budget  has now disappeared, and the reputation and credibility of Government in Northern Ireland  is now at stake.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Over the past seven years, the stadia safety  programme has delivered health and safety improvements at major sports  grounds in Northern Ireland.  The draft Budget makes no provision whatsoever for a continued programme of  investment in them. The Scott Report of 1997 identified &pound;30 million worth of  investment required to bring our sports grounds up to standard. Inflation and  increased standards have now overtaken that figure, but, to date, the  Government have invested only &pound;6&middot;3 million in sport in Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Government will fail to deliver on their obligation to  improve health and safety for spectators and players at our major sports grounds; and members of the public may be exposed to unreasonable risks when they  attend them. Northern Ireland  will fail to attract significant numbers of events as a result of the poor  condition of those grounds, and the sporting infrastructure will fall further  behind that in Ireland, the  rest of the United Kingdom  and the rest of Europe. Sports grounds here  will fail to meet the standards imposed by the new safety of sports grounds  legislation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I will talk about building economic structures on another  day, but we need to do more than talk. We can only build economic structures  when we have also addressed the building of  a local social fabric in tandem.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In one way, I have no problem with the amendment, but I  must point out a patently obvious question to Members. Why is the DUP running  away from the key component of the motion, which focuses attention on the draft  Budget? Is it because that party has been bound up in the &ldquo;control freakery&rdquo;  that it would appear the Executive have been  subjected to on the draft Budget?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Sport is an essential  part of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  shared, natural story; from the triumphs of years gone by, to more  recent achievements. Now is the time to build on that. The draft Budget allows  for no building bricks to be put in place, and that is most regrettable.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Maskey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I commend Pat Ramsey for moving  the motion, as it concerns a subject that the Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure has debated in recent  months.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly should recognise the importance of sport in  the physical, social and economic well-being of all in our society. The crux of  the matter is that when London  submitted the Olympic bid, the costs put forward were not a true reflection of  the final cost of running the games.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Francie Brolly and others stated that over &pound;42 million of  lottery money is being diverted from here to the Olympic Games in London, and yet we still  do not know what the benefits for us will be. No events or training facilities  have been promised; nothing that the North  will get has yet been put forward or confirmed in stone. I urge the  Minister to do all that he can to ensure that that is done.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The cost to us is immense, and all that can be done must be  done to make sure that we get the maximum return for the money spent. The loss  of that money will have a detrimental effect on many community sports in the  North. People will lose jobs and sporting societies will not be allowed to  develop as financial restrictions are imposed on them due to the incompetence  of the original costing submitted for the London  bid. Some initiatives in areas of social need have already been halted because of  the fund being skewed to London.  My colleague Sue Ramsey has written to the  Minister stating her concerns about the issues in west Belfast. Many organisations that will lose funding will come from areas of need, and many people in poverty and social  exclusion will be affected &mdash; so there is nothing new there.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members of the Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure have  raised all those points in the Committee, and will continue to do so. We will  also raise those issues with the Minister; argue vigorously about the issues in  the draft strategy that we do not like; and urge him to make the relevant  changes.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee will scrutinise the draft Budget and advise the Minister on how to improve it. The  Committee has already discussed the means for other stakeholders to promote sport in our society. Other Departments  must step up to the mark. There will be a knock-on effect on the health  and well-being of many of our citizens, and the educational needs and social  development of our communities will be affected.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Local communities and  councils have a duty to assist our  communities. For too long, some local councils have flirted with the  important issue of sport. For example, Belfast City Council does not have  enough pitches to cater for sporting teams. It has a few rugby pitches, but not  enough; it has many soccer pitches, but not enough for the many teams in Belfast. There are some  Gaelic pitches, but clearly not enough for the vast number of clubs in Belfast; and there is not one suitable camogie pitch, even  though there are many camogie clubs in Belfast.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The amendment to the  motion calls on other stake&shy;holders to become involved in sport in the  North. It is not good enough to allow councils such as Belfast City Council,  and Departments, off the hook while we search for better sports facilities for  everyone in our community. Sinn F&eacute;in will support Jim Shannon&rsquo;s amendment &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  Shame.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Maskey</strong>:  Call shame if you like, David, but that is what we are doing.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McNarry is the Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for  Culture, Arts and Leisure, and the Committee will discuss the draft Budget this  Thursday. Members of the Committee want to put their stamp on it to ensure that  the Minister delivers for sport in the North of Ireland. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: I  too welcome today&rsquo;s motion. I support the amendment moved by my colleagues Mr  Shannon and Lord Browne. As the original text of the motion recognises, sport  has the ability not only to inspire individuals, but to have a positive impact  on their physical and mental health and their social lives. It also has a  positive economic impact on a nation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We have heard today about the many millions of pounds that  good causes in Northern    Ireland will lose, and a considerable amount of that will be from grass-roots sport. That is of great concern to us all,  particularly with regard to those community projects that, over the  years, have benefited from lottery money to fund new AstroTurf pitches and  tennis courts, or to provide additional equipment for sports clubs.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Clearly, such a dramatic impact on sports funding is not in the best interests of those of us in Northern Ireland  who love sport. Anything that has a negative impact on community sport is not  to be welcomed. However, let us not be so pessimistic. Some Members seem to be  content to seek problems rather than solutions.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I strongly welcome the draft sports strategy that was announced in the House by the Minister. The  hosting of the Olympic Games in the United Kingdom represents a massive  opportunity that does not often come around for local sport. Northern Ireland  could greatly benefit from the London 2012 Olympic Games, and it is up to us to  ensure that we reap that benefit.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The DUP amendment calls  on all stakeholders to work together  to maximise the benefits of the proposed sports strategy and to wait to see what additional funding might come  as a result of the findings of the Vernon  assets group, which should go some way towards addressing the shortfall that  Members have heard about today.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As other Members have pointed out, the motion is premature because the Committee for Culture, Arts  and Leisure has not yet addressed this matter or considered further  potential funding outlets. Mr Ramsey raised those concerns and, having enjoyed  playing sport from an early age, I share his concerns.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Ken Robinson talked about participation in sport. However,  as a result of London&rsquo;s  hosting of the 2012 Olympic Games, huge opportunities exist for particip&shy;ation in local sport. I remember the 1988 Seoul  Olympic Games when the Great Britain  men&rsquo;s hockey team beat West    Germany in the final to win the gold medal.  Two local players were on that team &mdash; Stephen Martin and Jimmy Kirkwood &mdash; who,  as the Minister knows well, are now associated with my hockey club. The perfor&shy;mance  in the 1988 Olympic final of those two men and their team did more to encourage  young people to play hockey &mdash; a relatively small sport that does not receive  masses of funding or media exposure &mdash; than any other initiative.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The impact of local heroes participating in the Olympics is  an inspiration for thousands of youngsters. Last Thursday, in the Long Gallery,  I listened to Lord Coe speaking about the young athletes who took up running  after watching Kelly Holmes in the last Olympics. It is important that the 2012  Olympics are successful and that team GB  bring home as many medals as possible, and that will cost vast sums of  money.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">With the Olympics on  our doorstep, Northern    Ireland will be able to attract many  teams here to train, and I am optimistic that we will also be able to host a  few events. I listened to Lord Coe addressing Mr Ramsey&rsquo;s concern about  funding, and he spoke of the important role  that major Olympic sponsors will play in developing and getting involved  in local sport. I hope that that happens and that local communities see the  benefits. We must be vigilant and ensure that those sponsors put money into  local community sports.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I share Members&rsquo; concerns about how much money is being  diverted from community-level sports in order to fund the Olympics. However, I  hope that Members also recognise that the Olympic Games can inspire a new  generation of sports stars to participate in sport at all levels. Let us  embrace this opportunity and work together to ensure that funding from other  sources is available and that grassroots sport in Northern Ireland benefits rather  than suffers as a result of the Olympics. I support the amendment.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Culture, Arts and Leisure (Mr Poots)</strong>: I am grateful for this further  opportunity to address the Assembly on the subject of sport. Members will  recall that, on 9 October, I specifically requested such an opportunity. At  that time, I announced the publication of the draft Northern Ireland strategy for sport and physical recreation 2007-17 for a  three-month consultation period.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In my statement, I drew  attention to Northern    Ireland&rsquo;s rich sporting heritage and  highlighted the importance of sport in its own right and in its potential to  deliver other significant benefits such as  improved public health and academic  performance in children and young people, community development, and  neighbourhood renewal. Therefore, I welcome that fact that sport&rsquo;s physical,  economic and social importance is also recognised in the motion and in the  amendment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I also stressed that that did not represent the whole picture.  Northern Ireland sport faces  major challenges and difficulties: its participation rates are among the lowest  in the United Kingdom  &mdash; and falling. There is evidence that some  people in our community &mdash; notably women, people on low incomes and those  with a disability &mdash; remain seriously under-represented in sport. Our sports and  recreation infrastructure requires substantial modernisation and, additionally,  Northern Ireland  has a declining record of achievement in major competitions.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In order to address those issues, I call for a new  long-term vision for sport in Northern    Ireland that will enable it to be developed  on a sounder basis for the future and will deliver all the benefits, including  social and economic benefits, that are potentially available.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The draft strategy for sport and physical recreation that  has been developed by the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure in  consultation with Sport Northern Ireland and is currently out for public  consultation, suggests such a vision. It  also suggests that Government should commit to taking action to help to  develop sport in Northern    Ireland. Those commitments, if accepted,  would involve recognition of the value of sport by Government, including its  community benefits: the importance of success and of implementing a suitable  strategy in partnership with other stakeholders.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The draft strategy proposes a series of 24 targets to be  achieved over the next 10 years. The targets are designed to address concerns  about participation in sport, infrastructure deficiencies and the performance  of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  athletes and teams in major competitions. However, it is recognised that change  on such a scale comes at a price. It is estimated that the full implementation  would require an investment of some &pound;200 million over 10 years.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The draft strategy further emphasises that no organisation  will have the capacity to meet single-handedly the cost of delivery and that a  genuine partnership approach to resourcing will be required. That will involve all stakeholders, including  Government, Sport Northern Ireland,  local authorities and the voluntary and  private sectors. Moreover, I have repeatedly stressed, as does the draft  strategy, that the levels of public funding are subject to the normal budgetary  processes, including consideration of other competing priorities and the  ability of stakeholders to contribute.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Olympic and Paralympic Games in 2012 will help to  address some of the issues in the draft strategy, particularly those relating to Northern Ireland&rsquo;s sporting  contribution to 2012. However, the transfer of funds from the National  Lottery&rsquo;s distribution fund to the 2012 Olympics does not appear to have taken  due account of the needs of community and grass-roots sports. To that end, the  matter was raised with Lord Coe last week when he was in Northern Ireland.  I also informed him that DCAL had made a bid directly to the Treasury for &pound;53  million for elite facilities and asked for his support on that issue.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As the National Lottery  is a reserved matter, responsi&shy;bility  for the transfer of funds lies not with my Department but with the  Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS).  Since it decided to support London&rsquo;s  Olympic bid, DCMS has consistently said that lottery proceeds would form  a key part of the public funding package.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Having said that, I believe that the reduction of funding  from the lottery will be about &pound;2&middot;5 million from 2008 to 2011, although it will  go on until 2013. The money that we will gain for sport over the three years  from 2008 to 2011 will be &pound;11&middot;5 million in our block Budget.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Today, some Members, including Mr Shannon, talked about the  importance of sport in keeping the mind&rsquo;s juices flowing and helping people to  think better. I was tempted to make some Members do 50 press-ups and 20 laps of the grounds, because everyone seemed to  focus on bad news, implying that there was no good news and that sport was all  doom and gloom. In fact, the money that we  will lose as a result of DCMS taking  &pound;2&middot;5 million from us over the next three years, and a further &pound;2 million  over the following two years, has been more than made up for by the &pound;11&middot;5  million that will be raised through our normal budgetary processes.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Ken Robinson suggested that we should not put our trust  in a Robinson; it was up to him to make such a statement. However, the Minister  of Finance and Personnel has not been unreasonable when it comes to sport.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Ramsey</strong>:  When Lord Coe was in Parliament Buildings, I asked him whether the clawback of  lottery money for the London Olympics would commence only in 2009. Will the  Minister answer that question?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: The clawback of lottery money to fund the Olympics will start in 2008 and will continue  until 2013.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">When the Olympics is finished, there is to be a clawback,  and there is supposed to be the sale of some &pound;675  million worth of assets, which we will undoubtedly be bidding for. There  is also a legacy trust, which we will be going after as well.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Brolly said that the English were robbing us, and that  this was historic. I notice that he is wearing a nice, bright orange tie today that would do many Orangemen proud.  There is a chance that we will get something back from the English after the  Olympics.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr Ian  Paisley</strong>: He is also wearing a blue shirt.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  Yes, he is a true orange and blue today.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is important to  recognise that today is not all doom and gloom. We will continue to  support the Olympic Games. I fully  recognise the potential for adverse effects, and, together with the  other devolved administrations in Scotland and Wales, I have lobbied the DCMS  to ensure that the contribution from the National Lottery be kept as low as  possible. We have also sought assurances  that, should the costs for the Olympic Games increase, DCMS will not approach the National Lottery again to  seek further funds, as that would be damaging to the regions.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">DCMS has stated that the latest budget for the Olympics is  based on a thorough assessment of costs, includes  substantial contingency amounts that are based on analysis of risk, and  is a robust budget that will last until 2012. Furthermore, land values in the  Olympic park are expected to increase considerably. That should help with the  windfall that I referred to earlier.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, the benefits of the Olympics to Northern Ireland  should not be overlooked. The opportunity, through  the elite facilities, to prepare for host preparation plans will be hugely beneficial. The opportunity  to host preliminary rounds of the soccer tournament will also be  beneficial. My Department wants to maximise the amount of time that the Olympic  torch relay will spend in Northern Ireland,  and to ensure that the opportunities for business as a result of 2012  are fully exploited.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">What we are trying to do for the Olympics, we need also to try to do for the Paralympics. We should  encourage and recognise the role that disabled people have in sport and  increase their participation. I will touch on the health aspects later. Some  90% of people with disabilities who are actively engaged in sport are in  full-time employment. That is far higher than the general figure for people who  have disabilities. That is an indication that people with disabilities who  engage in sport have higher self-esteem, greater confidence and greater  motivation. That is one of the positive influences  that sport can have on people with disabilities.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Games will also act  as a catalyst for the develop&shy;ment of sport in the UK. Northern Ireland  intends to capitalise on the Olympics by getting young people involved in sport  at domestic and international level; achieving high performance in the Games;  creating better facilities on the back of demand; leaving a legacy; and  maximising economic and social impact.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department made bids for funding for sport under the  comprehensive spending review, and we have had funds awarded in the draft  Budget. The draft Budget, which was published on 25 October, showed that my  Department will receive &pound;33&middot;7 million for resource and &pound;112&middot;3 million for  capital.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We are spending somewhere in the region of &pound;8&middot;2 million on  capital this year alone. Next year, we will have a 400% increase to &pound;31&middot;2  million, followed by &pound;36&middot;5 million and then &pound;44&middot;6 million in 2010-11 &mdash; a 500% increase on this year. I cannot say that the  Minister of Finance and Personnel has been overly stingy in granting  400% and 500% increases.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Regarding the current shortfall, I indicated that my  Department is bidding directly to Treasury for &pound;53 million for the elite  facilities. The Barnett formula &mdash; which  would normally apply, with the regions receiving a stream of that  funding &mdash; was not used to establish the Olympic funds. Therefore, we have a  strong case to make that bid, and it would be reasonable for us to receive  that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Ken Robinson readily identified that for every pound  that central Government spends on sport, some &pound;900 is spent on public health. I  could make a much greater contribution to people&rsquo;s health in Northern Ireland  by increasing the budget for sport than could be made through the increases  that have been given to health. Debate in the Assembly over the past few weeks  has centred largely on health issues. Again, Mr Ken Robinson identified rightly  that, annually, 2,000 deaths in Northern    Ireland could be attributed to people not  engaging in enough physical activity. Some 17% of men and 20% of women in Northern Ireland  are clinically obese, and by the age of 12, one child in 20 is clinically  obese.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Sport and physical recreation have an important role to  play. It has been recognised that they can help to combat problems such as  cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, cancer of the colon, anxiety and  stress. Through a combination of healthier-eating and sport and  physical-recreation programmes, Finland  has succeeded in stemming the rise in  obesity. In the United<span style="letter-spacing:0pt; "> Kingdom</span> only 32% of people take the recommended amount of exercise, but in Finland that  proportion has reached 70%.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Research that was carried out in recent years in the  primary-school sector in Northern    Ireland suggests that regular participation  in sport and physical recreation contributes  to improving a child&rsquo;s academic performance and perceived self-esteem.  Short-term and sustained exercise programmes can contribute positively to the  cognitive performance of children and young people. In addition, the appeal of  sport and sports-related employment can be used in the curriculum to engage  disaffected pupils and increase their commitment to continuing in education.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Sport is a social activity by its very nature, and it can  be beneficial for those young people who are perhaps on the margins of our  society. Yesterday, I mentioned the positive effect that midnight soccer could  have on communities in which young people may feel that they are of little  importance or have no key role to play. Sport can reach out to young people who  are in areas of social deprivation and make a significant change, giving them  something worthwhile to do &mdash; something that is more appealing to them than  taking drugs or engaging in binge drinking. It will help them to look after their bodies and to have  healthy bodies and minds. It will also help them to recognise that they  have a significant contribution to make to society.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The most recent figures  that are available for Northern Ireland show that spending on sport has contributed &pound;293  million per annum to the economy, which is around 2% of the gross domestic  product. Tourism is estimated to have contributed around &pound;30 million. Around  12,500 people are in sport-related employment in our economy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I trust that that helps Members to address some of the  issues that they raised. I thank the proposers of both the motion and the  amendment for bringing them to the House. I trust that this will lead to  further investment in sport.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCausland</strong>:  In proposing the motion, Pat Ramsey set out  clearly the important issues that surround the funding of sport in Northern Ireland.  He analysed the financial position so  thoroughly that I was impressed by his mathematical ability, and I  feared at one point that he had swallowed a calculator. He dealt with the  subject at some length and expressed views that all of us share about the  importance of sport in society.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Jim Shannon highlighted the relevance of sport again, and  he spoke about the review of surplus assets, which is the key to his amendment.  The findings of the Vernon  assets group, which examines surplus assets and the money that can be raised  through them, will be published soon. In January we will know how much money  will be made available from that source.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Francie Brolly also emphasised an important point in  stressing the role of the Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure, and that topic will be examined on Thursday.  Moreover, he did not disappoint us; he managed to mention Dungiven in his  speech.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Ken Robinson highlighted an important issue: the social  skills and social benefits that flow from sport, as distinct from the medical and physical benefits. In playing sport  &mdash; particularly team sports &mdash; people develop skills in working with other  people.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Kieran McCarthy spoke of the redirection of lottery money  from Northern Ireland.  Lord Browne congratu&shy;lated the city of Glasgow  on being selected to host the Commonwealth Games in 2014. He took the issue a  stage further as regards fund-raising for sport, in that he referred not only  the Vernon  assets group, but he spoke about other opportunities that exist and that we  should seek to increase. He mentioned in particular the Strategic Investment  Board.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that we look at other opportunities to  raise funds in a creative way for sporting facilities.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Martina Anderson took us on a world tour via Afghanistan and Iraq. On the other hand, David  Simpson was appropriately parochial and stuck to the project that he has  in mind for Craigavon.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">David McNarry told us that he was a staunch devolutionist  but proceeded to exude doom and gloom on every  quarter. He disappointed us by not mentioning, despite his position as  Deputy Chairperson, the role that the Committee of Culture, Arts and Leisure  will have in this issue on Thursday.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Paul Maskey referred to the work of the Committee and spoke  of the benefits of local events. No doubt the Committee will work with the  Minister to see what can be done to bring the most benefit to Northern Ireland  through the 2012 Olympics, whether that is through training opportunities for  teams or through the events themselves.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Alastair Ross talked about the variety of sports, and in  particular the impact that a reduction in funding would have on community sports. He made the pertinent point that  certain people prefer looking for problems to  finding solutions. The advantage of the amendment is that it highlights the opportunities that  there are to find solutions. It also gives the Committee the opportunity  to look at the issue thoroughly.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister cited the low participation rates in sport in Northern Ireland,  particularly among women and people with disabilities and in areas of social  disadvantage. As he said, we need to find a new vision for sport in Northern Ireland.  He talked of the benefits that there will be after the Olympics from the sale  of associated assets. There will be opportunities then to bring out resources  throughout the United Kingdom,  including Northern Ireland.  The Minister, like his party colleague Alastair Ross and others, looked at the  issue in a positive way, trying to find solutions rather than purveying doom  and gloom, as was the case with Mr McNarry.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am happy to support the amendment; it is a good amendment  that strengthens the motion. The motion highlights the issue, quite rightly,  while the amendment seeks to show a way forward. I hope that others will see  the sense in supporting the amendment.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. T&aacute; an-&aacute;thas orm achoimri&uacute; a  dh&eacute;anamh ar na harg&oacute;int&iacute; a rinneadh ar son an r&uacute;in. Tuigim f&eacute;in an t&aacute;bhacht le  c&uacute;rsa&iacute; sp&oacute;irt i saol an lae inniu agus s&iacute;lim gur ch&oacute;ir d&uacute;inn an sp&oacute;rt a choth&uacute;  ar achan bhealach is f&eacute;idir linn. I value the contribution that sport makes to  many aspects of life in Northern    Ireland, as has been outlined during the  course of the debate. We heard about the importance of sport to health, education, social life and relationships.  Members talked about how sport can improve self-esteem, save money for our health system and improve both  physical and mental health. My colleague Pat Ramsey told the story of a  lady called Mary who got back her good health through sport.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We heard of the  disappointment of a range of sporting bodies  about the provision for sport in the draft Budget. Mr Ramsey referred to  the elite facilities project, the reduction of its budget from the promised &pound;53  million to &pound;35 million, and the outcomes that that might have.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">He referred to the Government&rsquo;s failure to deliver  on their promise of &pound;53 million and the many resources that have been wasted on  making applications when a large part of the budget has now disappeared. That  presents a challenge to the reputation and credibility of the Government.  Subsequently, Northern    Ireland will fail to benefit from many  legacy opportunities of the 2012 Olympic Games.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">4.00 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">David McNarry mentioned the Scott Report, which identified  that investment of &pound;30 million was required to  bring Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  sports grounds up to standard. He pointed out that that figure had been  reduced to &pound;6&middot;3 million as a result of inflation and increased standards. He  also mentioned some of the effects of that; for example, that members of the  public will be exposed to unreasonable risk when they attend major sporting events; that Northern Ireland will fail  to attract significant events because of the poor condition of its  sports grounds; and that Northern Ireland&rsquo;s sporting infrastructure will fall  further behind that in the rest of Ireland, the UK and the world. Those were  some of the main points that have been made  in support of the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The sport and physical recreation strategy, which was launched by the Minister in October 2007,  identifies anticipated investment  and associated targets for sport&rsquo;s contribution  to society during the next 10 years. However, the CSR proposals provide only a small revenue contri&shy;bution to  the spend that is necessary to achieve those targets. The CSR document lifts  many targets directly from the strategy. It is totally unrealistic to expect  the level of investment that has been announced for the first three years to  make any significant contribution to the targets proposed in the strategy. The  result will be that the targets will not be realised without a corres&shy;ponding  level of investment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The strategy identifies a need to expend &pound;90 million to  develop sports venues in Northern    Ireland, and the associated targets rely  totally on creating opportunities for people  to participate in sport and physical recreation. Without developing  sports venues, the targets cannot be achieved.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The draft Budget, which was announced last week, provides  virtually no funding for sports facilities at a community level. Mr Ramsey  pointed out that when that is combined with the loss of lottery funding to the  2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games, Sport Northern Ireland will have no  opportunity to make capital investments in community sports facilities during  the next three years. Historic levels of investment &mdash; over &pound;70 million during  the past 10 years &mdash; by Sport Northern  Ireland to local clubs, councils and community organisations will cease  completely during the next three years. In future, local sport will receive no  capital support whatsoever from Government or the lottery.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Those are the hard facts that have been presented in  support of the motion. The motion&rsquo;s aim was to widen the debate beyond the  Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure and  to make other Members, and people further afield, aware of the way in  which the sports budget has been slashed. The shortage of resources has been highlighted. Members have heard how sport  contributes to people&rsquo;s well-being. It also fulfils some of the  responsibilities of several Departments other than the Department of Culture,  Arts and Leisure, including the Department of Health, Social Services and  Public Safety; the Department of Education; the Department for Employment and  Learning; the Department for Social  Development; and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment. All  parties are agreed that there is a shortage of resources.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Much faith has been put in the capital realisation task force and the resources that it might bring  forward. However, there will be many  calls for whatever resources the task force realises.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Members of the  Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure &mdash; and others who are interested  in sport &mdash; have no guarantee that sport will be compensated by the capital realisation task force for the amount that it has  lost from the Budget. Ken Robinson  pointed out that we are being asked by the amendment to put our faith,  blindly, in Santa Pedro, who has many  presents to deliver to many people. We are not convinced or assured of  the size of the parcel that sport will ultimately receive.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although the supporters  of the amendment state that it seeks  to identify funds, and to add to the motion, it fails to do so. We are in no way certain or assured of the  amount of resources that will be allocated to sport.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">T&aacute; s&eacute; ar intinn ag an ph&aacute;irt&iacute; seo clo&iacute; leis an r&uacute;n bun&uacute;sach  agus gan taca&iacute;ocht a thabhairt don leas&uacute; at&aacute; in ainmeacha Jim Shannon agus Lord  Browne.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is therefore the  intention of the SDLP to stick with the motion and not to support the  amendment, which promises much, but delivers little. We do not know what  resources will come from it, ultimately. I reaffirm my support for the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question, <span style="font-style:normal; ">That the  amendment be made,</span> put and agreed to.</p>

	      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly  recognises the importance of sport in the physical, social and economic  well-being of society; expresses concern that National Lottery funding is being  diverted to the 2012 London Olympics and will have a negative impact on  community sport; welcomes the proposed sports strategy recently announced by  the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure; recognises that funding of the  strategy should be considered in the context of the findings of the Vernon assets group; and calls on all  stakeholders to work together to maximise the opportunities that exist  in the sports strategy.</p>

	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: A valid petition of concern has been received in respect of the  motion. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Order. Members must resume their seats.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Having checked the petition, I regard it as fulfilling the  requirements of Standing Order 27. However, the presentation of the petition  means that a vote on the motion may not be  held at the conclusion of the debate. The Business Committee agreed, at  its lunchtime meeting, that the vote will take place as the first item of  business on Monday 19 November 2007.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members should also note  that the vote on the motion will be  conducted on a cross-community basis. Members who wish to inspect the  petition of concern may do so in the Business Office. We shall proceed with the  debate, for which the Business Committee has agreed to allow up to one hour and  30 minutes. The proposer of the motion will have 10 minutes to propose and 10  minutes for the winding-up speech. All other Members who wish to speak will  have five minutes.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Miss McIlveen</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly opposes  the introduction of a club-bank arrangement  for establishing Irish-medium schools in Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">From the outset, I would like to make it clear that the  motion does not represent a sectarian attack on the teaching of the Irish  language. It seems that there are parties in the Chamber that have such an  agenda. The Minister is so belligerent that, in following a narrow sectarian  political agenda, she has adopted the safety net of a petition of concern to  ensure that she gets her way. Obviously, she is convinced that she will not win  the argument. The motion is concerned with  the provision of a level playing field whereby education is provided in an even-handed way, without advantage to any  sector.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Since the Assembly came into being, much has been said  about fairness and equality. The introduction of a club bank arrangement for  establishing Irish-medium schools in Northern Ireland does nothing for  fairness and equality, nor does it promote the concept of a shared future. It  is my opinion, and that of my party, that the controlled sector caters for  everyone. Having four sectors is not logical, and places too great a financial  burden on the Department of Education. Things were bad enough when there were  two sectors; next we had the integrated sector; and now we have the promotion  of the Irish-medium sector. At present, according to the report of the  independent strategic review of education, there are 50,000 empty places in our  schools.</p>
	      <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Speaker in the Chair)</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is estimated that due  to the decline in pupil numbers there will be an additional 30,000  surplus places over the next 10 years. The opening of further Irish-medium  schools can only add to that problem.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The sector potentially most at risk from the unfair  advantage being given to those schools is the Catholic maintained sector. Given  that, due to falling numbers, schools are being amalgamated or closed in order  to save costs, it seems amazing that more investment in Irish-medium schools is  planned. Despite that, it has been proposed that a club-bank system, similar to  that currently in place for the integrated  sector, be established for the benefit of the Irish-medium sector. Such  club banks have an unfair advantage over the controlled schools and the  Catholic maintained schools. As such, I find the concept wholly objectionable.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In order to put that into context, I will briefly explain  how the club-bank system works, but, at the same time, try to avoid sending my  colleagues into a coma. The Integrated Education Fund was established in 1992  to provide a more co-ordinated approach to the funding issue. The Integrated  Education Fund (IEF) and the Northern Ireland Council for Integrated Education  (NICIE) made arrangements with three banks;  in return for depositing &pound;1 million, the Integrated Education Fund could  borrow up to &pound;10 million to finance the capital costs of establishing new  integrated schools. If after at least three years the school has been deemed  viable, it will, according to the Department of Education, receive recognition  for capital grant aid. During the course of assessment for viability, the  Department of Education is responsible for any interest due on the loans. The  school would then be reimbursed by the Department for any capital expenditure  incurred during the period that it is funded by the club bank.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is not therefore simply a case of &pound;1 million being spent  and, all of a sudden, self-sufficient schools appear. Rather, &pound;1 million is  spent, and then once the school is set up, the Department must once again open  up the coffers. The Department has spent &pound;33 million in the last five years  funding similar schemes in the integrated sector.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The viability criteria for Irish-medium schools are based  on enrolment figures for two consecutive years, plus estimates for the third  year. The Department of Education will currently grant recognition and  grant-aid status for 12 pupils in year one. With the best will in the world, it  would be difficult to see how a school could not meet those criteria as they  are set so low. Once the viability criteria  are met, the school is eligible for grant funding. A decision to amalgamate St Joseph&rsquo;s  Primary School in Ahoghill with St Patrick&rsquo;s Primary School in Aughtercloney  was made when the schools were attracting numbers of 18 and 26 respectively.  However, Irish-medium schools are deemed viable and eligible for grant funding  with only 24 pupils and an estimated enrolment figure for the third year.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The council for  Irish-medium education is to operate the scheme in the same way as NICIE  does for grant-maintained integrated schools &mdash; or so we are led to believe by  the Department of Education. However, details are so thin on the ground as to  be virtually non-existent. Last year the then Education Minister, Angela Smith,  confirmed that the Department of Education had directed more than &pound;1,300  towards a report into the operation of the club-bank system. Perhaps the  Minister will confirm that this report is now available in order that the wider  public can be made aware of the system and  the conclusions contained in the report. I would be grateful if the  Minister would refer to it in her remarks.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">For Members&rsquo; information, the Minister has already  requested that the sum of &pound;1 million be allocated in 2008-09 for an  Irish-medium building fund club bank. That is before the report on the  club-bank system has been made available for consideration, and also before the  Minister&rsquo;s review of Irish-medium education has been completed and considered.  Does that mean that she is determined to press ahead with her plans, regardless  of those outcomes?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In addition to the bid for &pound;1 million, the Minister is also  asking for additional financial support for Irish-medium schools: &pound;170,000 in  2008-09 for Irish-medium budgets, rising to &pound;230,000; &pound;215,000 over three years  for language enhancement for teachers in the Irish-medium sector; &pound;75,000 over  three years to upgrade Irish-language skills for pre-school workers; and &pound;6  million over three years for curriculum support.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">With reference to those additional moneys that are required  to enhance and upgrade the language skills, it seems incredible that Government  money is being spent on teaching teachers what is allegedly their own language.  Are similar amounts of money being spent on teachers who teach English in the  controlled sector or in the Catholic maintained sector?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In a previous debate,  the Minister lambasted Members and told them to read the report of the  Independent Strategic Review of Education.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I ask her to do the same, and I specifically draw her attention to chapter 9 of the Bain Report, which  is titled &ldquo;Planning: A Strategic Approach&rdquo;. The report recom&shy;mends  area-based planning, and that the Department of Education should proceed with  that until the education and skills authority is established. It also states  that:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;future school  building projects should be approved only after area-based planning is  established&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">4.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That does not seem to fit well with the Minister&rsquo;s bid for  &pound;1 million to establish an Irish-medium club bank. Is she continuing to pick  and choose the aspects of the Bain Report  that suit her agenda? Members are still waiting for the Minister to  clarify her position on the recommendations of the report in its totality. The  simple fact is that limited money is available for investment in education.  Investment should be made on the basis of  area planning, and need must be identified. A club-bank system merely  impedes area-based planning by creating a bias through the provision of  financial incentives.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">To use such a scheme is an attempt to circumvent the system  and impose a new set of rules for Irish-medium education and protections that  do not apply to mainstream schools in Northern Ireland. That should not  surprise us, however, after what we have all seen. At a time of budgetary constraints across all Departments, money  could be better spent on school repairs, on existing grant-maintained schools,  which cater for the overwhelming majority of pupils, or on the dire need to  deal with illiteracy and innumeracy in society.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the Department of Education&rsquo;s &lsquo;A Consultation on Schools  for the Future: A Policy for Sustainable Schools&rsquo;, criteria are set out that  must be adhered to before opening a school can be considered. One criterion is  financial viability. A school with only 50 pupils costs almost 200% more than  an average school, which has around 140 pupils. The Department&rsquo;s consultation document  points out that that rises to almost 300% more if a school has fewer than 20  pupils. According to the Department, in order to establish viability, an  Irish-medium school has only to show an intake of 12 pupils in year 1 and 12 in  year 2, and it has only to provide estimates for year 3. If the Minister  determines that three schools meet the viability criteria with 24 pupils and an  estimate, each school will cost, in the worst-case scenario, 200% more than the  average school.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I may be accused of  scaremongering when I say that. However, over the summer, the Minister  announced the opening of three Irish-medium schools: one in Londonderry;  one in Glengormley; and another in Crumlin. According to the Department of  Education, the school in Glengormley has only 13 pupils enrolled in year 1. How  does that school meet the viability criteria? The school in Londonderry  has 15 pupils in year 1, but only seven in year 2 and nine in year 3. Again,  how does that school meet the viability criteria? The school in Crumlin had an  intake of 12 pupils in year 1, one in year 2, four in year 3 and three in year  4. Will the Minister apply the criteria that she used to award grant funding to  those three schools when she uses the club-bank system? If so, I dread to  imagine the impact of that far from thriving sector on the meagre resources of  the education system.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In proposing area-based planning, the report of the  independent strategic review of education &mdash; the Bain Report &mdash; calls for  fairness, equality and cost effect&shy;iveness.  A club-bank system that will be to the advantage of Irish-medium  education will achieve none of those aims. For those reasons, I ask the  Assembly to vote in favour of the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Butler</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Ba mhaith liom f&aacute;ilte  a chur roimh an r&uacute;n seo at&aacute; os comhair an Tion&oacute;il. C&eacute; go bhfuil buaireamh orm  faoi, s&iacute;lim ag an am ch&eacute;anna go dtugann s&eacute; deis d&uacute;inn an t-&aacute;bhar t&aacute;bhachtach  seo a dh&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the motion on the club-bank scheme. Although I  have concerns about the motives behind the tabling of the motion, I welcome a  debate on the scheme and its use in the  Irish-medium sector. Therefore, I thank Michelle McIlveen and Mervyn  Storey for securing the debate.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The motion is dressed up  as concern over the club-bank scheme as a means of funding schools, but  it is really an attack on the Irish-medium education sector.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">It is disappointing that, once again, the DUP is  playing politics over the provision of Irish-language schools. Of course, such  attacks are not confined to the Irish-medium sector; the DUP has also shown  hostility to the Catholic education sector and the integrated sector. Michelle  McIlveen, for example, recently called for the abolition of the Catholic,  Irish-medium and integrated sectors. One has to question that type of approach,  as it insults the parents, children, staff and teachers at those schools. It  tells me that the DUP cannot tolerate minorities in society.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Let us consider the  facts behind the club-bank scheme in relation to the Irish-medium sector  without all of the DUP&rsquo;s alarmist and  scaremongering language. There is growing evidence that children in the  Irish-medium sector are receiving their education in an environment of substandard buildings and poor facilities. A  two-tier system is in place when it comes to the provision of school buildings  and accommodation. The club-bank scheme aims to enable children in the  Irish-medium sector to receive education in  improved accommodation and school  buildings, without any risk to the public purse.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">This debate also raises an equality issue. The club-<span style="letter-spacing:-.05pt; ">bank scheme is a way of helping to ensure that  children</span> in the Irish-medium sector are not taught in lower standards of  accommodation than other education sectors. It has been said that the  integrated sector has been using this kind of scheme since the mid-1990s, when  there was recognition that newly established integrated schools would not be  included in the capital building programme until they had demonstrated a level  of enrolments that would make the school viable. The objective of the club-bank  scheme is to minimise the risk to public money of a significant capital loss if  a new school were to fail during its initial start-up phase. A few years ago,  the Department of Education reviewed the use of the scheme in the integrated  sector and concluded that it should continue.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department of Education has undertaken to provide an  initial lump sum to allow Comhairle na Gaelscola&iacute;ochta agus Iontaobhas na  Gaelscola&iacute;ochta to start a club-bank scheme by drawing loans from their chosen  bank. The idea of the club-bank scheme is that it allows the Department of  Education to share the risk for schools that have not yet met the threshold for  capital support grants. Accommodation in the Irish-medium sector is  significantly worse than in any other sector, and that must be addressed. The  club-bank scheme is an innovative attempt to get to grips with the  accommodation crisis in the sector, and it should be actively encouraged.  Irish-medium schools have not been funded by the Department of Education  through the club-bank scheme to date, and, if the club-bank scheme is to be  taken away, rather than expanded, people here must ask themselves how the  Irish-medium and integrated sectors are to be funded.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A growing number of parents are choosing to have their  children educated through the medium of the Irish language. That is happening  at a time of falling rolls and an increasing number of empty desks in our  schools. We have a diverse education system, and many parents wish to have  their children educated through the Irish-medium sector. If the Assembly  supports the motion, it must tell both the Irish and integrated sectors how  they will be funded.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong><span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt; ">Mr K Robinson</span></strong>: My preferred option, with regard to the facilitation of the  teaching and learning of Irish in schools, would be to build on the excellent  work that is <span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt; ">being undertaken in  Irish-language units that are attached</span> to maintained schools across Northern Ireland.  That meets the crucial criteria that should  be of concern to the cash-strapped Executive. It integrates children  whose parents wish them to be schooled in Irish with their wider peer group in a district or parish. It is  also a more cost-effective approach to the provision of education.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have concerns over the rapidly escalating costs which, in  recent years, have been associated with the expansion of exclusive Irish-medium  schools.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">There is also  the practical matter of the serious shortfall in the number of qualified  teachers who are available to teach a range of specialist subjects in Irish.  Those subjects are vital if pupils are to pursue examination courses effectively and realise their full  potential in life.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the past seven years, &pound;47 million has been spent on  Irish-medium education. I am sure that I am not alone in pondering what impact  that sum of money could have made if it had been spent on raising the literacy  and numeracy levels in schools located in <span style="letter-spacing:-.2pt; ">marginalised  communities such as the Falls, the Shankill,</span> the Bogside and the rural communities west of the Bann.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The club-bank mechanism is an intriguing approach to facilitating the wishes of a small number of  enthusiasts. As has been mentioned, from the mid-1990s, the lobby for  integrated education used the mechanism for many years. The Department of  Education facilitated the approach, and the appearance of new schools reflected  the obvious attraction of being able to access such a funding stream.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is small wonder, therefore, that the controlled and  maintained sectors, which, after all, represent the overwhelming majority of schoolchildren,  looked on in awe. It is understandable that many associated with those two  major sectors felt that the club-bank scheme did more than merely facilitate:  it created an advantage that they could not hope to emulate.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">One cannot blame  Irish-medium schools for wanting to hitch their wagon to a similar  scheme. The potential danger of widening division that is caused by this  mechanism was apparent in the mid-1990s. The model that Members are debating  today underlines the danger of that ever-growing division and flies in the face  of the clich&eacute;s of a shared future and a shared vision to which the Assembly is  supposed to aspire.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">All Irish-medium schools are funded under the common  funding formula, as are the controlled and maintained schools. A vesting process  is initiated when schools reach the prescribed viability criteria which, as has  been mentioned, are normally based on enrolment figures for two consecutive  years: currently the figure is 15 for schools in Belfast  and Londonderry and 12 for those located  elsewhere. Furthermore, there must be evidence of an expected intake in the  third year of 20 pupils in Belfast  and Londonderry and 15 elsewhere.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Integrated Education  Fund and the Northern Ireland Council for Integrated Education made an  arrangement with the agreement of the three banks. That arrangement requires &pound;1  million from the IEF, against which &pound;10 million can be borrowed to finance  capital costs. After three years, schools receive recognition for capital grant  aid. Vesting is carried out by solicitors  for the Department, NICIE and the schools. When the process is complete,  any approved capital expenditure is reimbursed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Presumably, the Irish-medium club bank would seek to make a  similar arrangement. The trust fund for Irish-medium education would underwrite  a new school&rsquo;s capital costs, and the  Council for Irish-Medium Education would  operate the scheme in a similar fashion to NICIE.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The central issue is  equality for all, and advantage, real or  perceived, to none. The fundamental shortage of funds necessary to  achieve educational progress is all too obvious to Members. Therefore, it is  essential to direct funds to where they are  needed &mdash; to improve the levels of literacy and numeracy in all schools.  That would better enhance the employability prospects of pupils, and nowhere is  that required more than in the urban and rural areas in which the most  marginalised young people live. Such investment would improve their quality of  life and their future prospects immeasurably.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member&rsquo;s time is almost up.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  It would also improve the overall social cohesion of the entire community and  move us towards the shared future that everyone seeks.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh c&eacute;ad maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. T&aacute; an-&aacute;thas orm labhairt ar an  r&uacute;n seo.

	      <p class="B3BodyText">I cannot say that I agree with the motion. However, I  welcome the opportunity to discuss the development of Irish-medium education in  Northern Ireland,  as did Mr Butler.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I declare an interest as a member of the board of governors  of an Irish-medium school. I have also been involved in setting up a number of  Irish-medium preschools.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">4.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The rapid growth and development of the Irish-medium sector over the past 37 years has been  amazing. It is a story of diligence and dedication against great odds to realise a vision that many would have  considered impossible. Only five pupils attended the first Irish-medium  school, Bunscoil Phobal Feirste, which was founded  in 1971. It took 13 years of continuous voluntary work and fund-raising  before official recognition was gained for  the school from the Department of Education.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The efforts of the founders  of Bunscoil Phobal Feirste are  indicative of the work that parents have been prepared to put in to ensure that their children can avail  of Irish-medium education. Further testimony to their commit&shy;ment is the  present state of Irish-medium education, with 46 na&iacute;scoileanna &mdash; pre-school  units &mdash; 33 bunscoileanna &mdash; primary schools &mdash; and three me&aacute;nscoileanna &mdash;  post-primary schools. By any measure, that is a remarkable development and it  shows beyond a shadow of a doubt why Irish-medium education is considered to be  the fastest-growing area of education, even in a situation of declining rolls. Irish-medium education is represented in the  controlled, maintained and voluntary sectors.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is considerable demand for Irish-medium education,  and the Department of Education is legally <span style="letter-spacing:-.25pt; ">bound  to provide for that demand. Irish-medium education </span>provides children  with high-quality education in developing pupils spiritually, emotionally,  physically, intellectually and linguistically. Pupils in Irish-medium education  gain the added value of competence in two languages.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Irish-medium  education sector recognises current demographics and is willing to  co-operate with other sectors, with a view to sharing facilities to maximise  valuable resources. Comhairle na Gaelscola&iacute;ochta &mdash; the Council for Irish-Medium  Education &mdash; has a strategic plan for the  development of the sector through&shy;out Northern Ireland. At the moment, a  review arising from the Bain Report is under way to decide how the growth of the sector can be best facilitated in  the future.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The amazing development  of Irish-medium education has meant that estates provision has lagged  far behind growth. Almost half of all Irish-medium primary schools are in  accommodation that meets health and safety standards but is not fit for  purpose. The idea of the club bank is to address that gap in order that newly  established schools can access accommodation that is fit for purpose, thus  enabling them to meet the threshold for capital recognition.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">On the operation of the scheme, the Department of Education  will approve the interest rates applicable to the scheme, the staging of  interest payments and the agreement with the bank. The risks for the loans are attributed to Iontaobhas na Gaelscola&iacute;ochta &mdash; the  Trust Fund for Irish-Medium Education &mdash; and Comhairle na  Gaelscola&iacute;ochta, not to the Department or the taxpayer. Should the scheme go  ahead, Comhairle na Gaelscola&iacute;ochta would provide the Department with all  requested documentation monthly. The Department of Education has provided an  initial lump sum to allow Comhairle na Gaelscola&iacute;ochta and Iontaobhas na  Gaelscola&iacute;ochta to start the club bank by drawing loans from a bank that are  based on the lump sum acting as collateral. However, the money will be used  only as a guarantee to the bank. It will not be spent, and it will eventually  be returned to the Department. The scheme is intended to last only &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member&rsquo;s time is almost up.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  The Alliance Party opposes the motion. It is regrettable that a petition of  concern has to be tabled on what is essentially private Members&rsquo; business. The  motion is the latest in a line of debates on the Irish language and  Irish-medium education. Most people looking in from the outside will wonder  about the Assembly&rsquo;s sense of priorities.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There are so many issues to discuss and challenges to face,  yet the Assembly is still debating the Irish language. There are major  challenges in education &mdash; for example, the future of post-primary education and  sustainable schools. Those are much broader  challenges than the one outlined in the motion, but there has been no  debate on the fundamental principles that underlie the future of education.  Instead, Members debate the small side issues.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Equally, the Minister must articulate the wider range of  problems faced by the education system in Northern Ireland. The Alliance  Party has some concerns that the Programme for Government refers only to the  Irish-medium sector and not to others &mdash; most notably the integrated-education  sector. I hope that the Minister will address that when she speaks.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As set out by its proposer, the motion does not add up; it opposes the club-bank approach, but Miss  McIlveen tried to set out some practical difficulties and concerns that  she had with the scheme. I do not know whether that was a front for her overall opposition to the scheme, or  whether those concerns were genuine. Asking for a review, or a more detailed  study, of the club-bank approach &mdash; to see whether it offers a positive way  forward and delivers results &mdash; would have  been a more constructive approach.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The club-bank system has considerable merits. The Alliance  Party is not wedded to any particular method of  funding the education system. If innovative approaches can be found,  they are worthy of consideration. The club-bank system is a relatively low-cost  option for Government to facilitate choice in the education system. Reference  has already been made to integrated education, and it is worth highlighting the  valuable role of the club-bank approach in the expansion of integrated education in Northern Ireland. I pay particular tribute  to the Integrated Education Fund and its work. Often, the Government have had a  narrow mindset about defending the status quo in communities and not  recognising the demand for an integrated approach to education from parents.  Money made available by the IEF has meant that those wishes are respected and  enabled integrated schools to come into existence and prove their viability and  overall sustainability to communities.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am aware of the sustainability problems across our  education system due to the falling rolls in the school estate, which have  resulted in over 50,000 empty school places.  In trying to seek a simplistic solution, the proposer of the motion  makes a fundamental mistake by saying that  those problems would disappear if all schools were controlled. Members  must look at the wider context of area  planning, collaboration between schools and sharing. The  Irish-medium sector can fit into the  broader perspec&shy;tive of the way  forward for education.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is important to recognise the demand for Irish-medium  education &mdash; it is not my preference but I respect that it is for others. A  respect for choice and diversity is a fundamental element of a shared future.  Integrated education has proven to be the more sustain&shy;able option, although I have an open mind about whether Irish-medium schools are sustainable in certain  localities of Northern    Ireland. However, they are certainly part of  the future provision of education and, as long as they are placed in the firm  context of a sustainable schools policy, which the Department has still not  produced, are something that we can celebrate as part of our cultural heritage  and the future of education in Northern Ireland. The Alliance Party opposes the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCausland</strong>: I believe in a shared future. Rather than supporting the  segregated system that exists at present, we should seek to break down  segregation and create a truly integrated single system of education in Northern Ireland.  Dominic Bradley told the story of Irish-medium education, some aspects of which  I want to discuss. A voluntary trust fund for Irish-medium education similar to  the Integrated Education Fund was mentioned &mdash; I understand that it is called  Iontaobhas na Gaelscola&iacute;ochta.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am indebted to our colleague Dominic Bradley for that  pronunciation, because I had no idea how to pronounce it. However, an  interesting point about that organisation is that it already receives funding  from the Department of Education. I asked who sat on the board of the  organisation and, lo and behold, it emerged that its chairperson &mdash; who was appointed by the Department of  Education &mdash; is Se&aacute;n Maguire. He is also the editor of the &lsquo;North Belfast News&rsquo;  and is chairperson &mdash; or at least he is one of the leading figures &mdash; of Sinn  F&eacute;in in North Belfast. Therefore, I started to  understand why Caitr&iacute;ona Ruane is possibly  so enthusiastic and committed to the proposal.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A couple of weeks ago,  our colleague Barry McElduff and I were discussing the Irish language on  Radio Ulster&rsquo;s  &lsquo;The Stephen Nolan Show&rsquo;. The mother of a child in a school in west Belfast &mdash; the name of  which I will not attempt to pronounce, but it translates as the school of the  skylark &mdash; phoned in. I said that the skylark was a pseudonym used by Bobby  Sands and that the school was holding up Bobby Sands &mdash; a convicted terrorist &mdash; as a good role model for  children. At that point, the lady went apoplectic and would not  undertake to translate the name of the school into English. Thankfully, Barry  McElduff did translate it into English, but he did not concede the point that  it was so named in honour of Bobby Sands.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The next stage of my story takes us down to Newry &mdash; an area not unknown to Dominic Bradley &mdash; and the  recent visit to the Irish-medium school there by Conor Murphy who was  presenting Irish-language versions of the life of Bobby Sands to the  schoolchildren. Again, Bobby Sands was being held up as a role model for  children. Members should begin to get the story that helps to explain why  Caitr&iacute;ona Ruane &mdash; whom I see has left the Chamber &mdash; is so enthusiastic about  Irish-medium education.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">During a debate on 6 November 2007, my colleague Michelle McIlveen referred to an article in a  Rathfriland newspaper &mdash; &lsquo;The Outlook&rsquo;&mdash; in which a hunger striker  Laurence McKeown was commenting on the visit to the Irish-medium school in  Newry by Conor Murphy. He said that many teachers in Irish-medium schools &mdash; even some principals &mdash; are former  prisoners. When Michelle McIlveen repeated  that in the Chamber, Barry McElduff got upset. He said that she was  endangering the lives of those teachers by saying that, but she was merely repeating what Laurence McKeown had said.  Instead of dealing with the issue &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. Would it not be in order for Mr McCausland to  address the motion? He has not done that yet, and he has been speaking for  three and a half minutes.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I note the Member&rsquo;s concern. I ask Mr McCausland to carry on; I am sure that he  will get to the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCausland</strong>: The motion is about Irish-medium education, and I think that I  have spoken about that. For instance, when I spoke about the role of Sinn F&eacute;in,  I was dealing with Irish-medium education, and I will continue to do so. I have  commented on the fact that so many teachers and principals in that sector are  former prisoners. One of the difficulties that many unionists have with  Irish-medium education is that it is a closed sector  &mdash; unionists do not know much about it. However, the veil drops  occasionally.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We are indebted to some unnamed person &mdash; who is unknown to  me &mdash; who contributes to discussions on a local website. He picked up on the  thread from someone who seemed to be a dissident republican or supporter of  republican Sinn F&eacute;in and provided some interesting insights into the  Irish-medium sector in Londonderry. He told,  in great detail, the story of a maintained school that used to have an  Irish-medium unit, and he explained how Sinn F&eacute;in was working actively within  it. He detailed all the meetings and the names of the people involved.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. Is it appropriate for a Member in the Chamber to quote from an unnamed source on an unnamed website, because the  references that he is making cannot be corroborated or referred to by any other  Member? <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If Mr Storey believes everything that he reads on a website  he is in for a bad day. The world will be flat before he leaves the Chamber.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: It would be useful if the Member would clarify exactly what he  is saying.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">4.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCausland</strong>:  I am simply stating what I have become aware of through reading that website. I  am now attempting to ask some questions. I  have an answer to one question that I have posed; I will follow up that  with more, and then we will be able to illicit the truth. The website makes it  clear why Caitr&iacute;ona Ruane is so enthusiastic about Irish-medium schools.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member&rsquo;s time is up. Unlike interventions, no extra time is provided for a  point of order.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brolly</strong>:  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Mar urlabhra&iacute; Shinn F&eacute;in ar son  na teanga, &eacute;ir&iacute;m le cupla focal a r&aacute; in &eacute;adan an r&uacute;in seo. Cuireann s&eacute; br&oacute;n orm  amanna&iacute; go bhfuil an oiread sin daoine chomh g&eacute;ar, chomh l&aacute;idir, is chomh  nimhneach in &eacute;adan na teanga uaisle &aacute;ilne seo. I declare an interest, a  mhacasamhail Dominic anseo, as a founder member of Na&iacute;scoil Neachtain in  Dungiven, which I am glad to mention again. I am also a trustee of the school.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Yet again, a motion is before the House that reveals a  fundamental antipathy to the Irish language, despite the protestations of the  proposer. Yet again, as was the case with  David McNarry&rsquo;s recent motion, the proposer of the motion is a person with a lovely Gaelic surname:  McIlveen. Ironically, one of the great champions of the Irish language in Belfast is a young man of  that name, although he uses the original Gaelic spelling &mdash; Mac Ghiolla Bh&eacute;in &mdash;  which, translated into English means &ldquo;the son of the follower&rdquo;, or &ldquo;the disciple&rdquo;,  or &ldquo;the servant of Ben&rdquo;. Ben was most  likely an early Christian Gaelic holy man or, perhaps, a holy woman.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Irish-medium education sector now comprises 65 schools  here, educating up to 5,000 pupils at nursery, primary and secondary level. However,  as with the integrated-education movement, instead of being complimented and  encouraged for what is positive and laudable in its campaign, it continues to  be undermined and discouraged by people who see it only through political eyes. I expect that the integrated-education  movement will take some comfort from the fact that the naysayers have now a  target in Irish-medium education at which  they can launch themselves more warmly and enthusiastically.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The indigenous language of any land is the jewel in its  crown. The Irish language pervades our physical environment &mdash; our family surnames, towns, townlands, rivers,  streams, hills and glens. It is important that we, the Irish people, maintain  and develop the cultural and spiritual  character that inspired the creation and evolution of that lovely  language.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in fully supports the Irish-medium education sector.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. Others in the House were much exercised  earlier when my colleague Nelson McCausland was accused of not addressing the motion. When does the Member  propose to deal with club banking, instead of talking about Dungiven and  giving a host of Irish lessons?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. I hope that the Member will address the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brolly</strong>: I  am simply outlining how important it is that the Irish language be supported by  the club-bank system and that the two schools that are currently eligible  receive funding from it as soon as possible.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in fully supports the Irish-medium education sector,  and wants to see it develop and grow. Sinn F&eacute;in also wants to see it develop  and grow outside of the Catholic, nationalist community.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Over the centuries, the Irish language has proved itself  impervious to political, religious and other malign influences.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  I thank the Member for giving way. Is he  aware that, during the establishment of the national schools in Ireland in the late nineteenth  century, Irish-speaking children were made to wear an bata scoir &mdash; a  tally stick &mdash; around the neck? Each time a child spoke Irish, a notch was cut  in the tally stick, and the child was later punished for each notch. Does the  Member agree that the motion is the modern-day tally stick, in so far as it  wishes to punish children with substandard facilities just because they are  learning through the medium of Irish?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brolly</strong>: I  thank Mr Bradley for his intervention, which shows that history evolves and  changes. We are now in a new cycle, and the Irish language is fighting back.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, regardless of the intervention, I hope that  Irish-medium schools will become eligible for club-bank loans. No one  complained about it until now, and it is regrettable that the motion was  proposed. I look forward to the day when every facet of our cultural life here can be shared, encouraged and promoted by us  all.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am glad that the Minister acknowledged my small  contribution of wearing my orange tie. Out of small acorns great oak trees  grow. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>: It is pleasant to welcome the Minister of Education to the Chamber, after being kept informed of her  movements by Mr Butler. I am really pleased to see her here and to have a nice  chat with her about this important issue.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In no way am I against the Irish language. When I was in  the west coast of Scotland  for my summer holidays, I came across the McCrea clan, and a lot of the  information about the clan was written in Scottish Gaelic or whatever. Neither have I a problem with people speaking  in Irish.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is important to have  a real debate. My concern with club banks is that we are putting the  cart before the horse. It is fundamentally wrong to push ahead with an agenda for the Irish language when there is no  consensus that that should be done. It is strategically flawed. I am not  against the language, but I am absolutely against its being used as a political  tool.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Francie Brolly spoke most eloquently about the language and  Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s support for it, and that is OK. However, instead of being  supported, the language has been hijacked. The Irish language has been taken  over and the debate is put forward in terms that make it difficult for anybody  to support. One does try to keep an open mind on those matters, look forward  and determine the benefits of giving preferential treatment to an  Irish-language exercise through the club-bank system. Does it prepare our young  people for the future, and does it add anything to it?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Even if those arrangements can be made in primary schools,  what happens in the post-primary sector? There is a shortage of teachers in  that sector, and it would be quite awkward. However, even if that could be  sorted out &mdash; and I have heard the Minister say that people could be brought  from elsewhere &mdash; what happens to the tertiary sector? We are keen to get 50% or  more of our young people into that. Where will we get the lecturers?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Then what happens after that in R&amp;D? How much of the  world&rsquo;s research and development is conducted in English and how much in Irish?  At that stage, the question must be asked: does it really stack up? The  potential problems of such a move must be considered.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am committed to a  shared future, and it is important that we find a way to work together  and respect differences. However, I have a bit of a problem with a language  that requires 100% immersion. How does one  integrate or work with people who speak a completely different language?  That seems to be incompatible. In the  South, there has been a direction &mdash; although maybe it has changed &mdash; that  even Irish-medium schools must also teach English from an early age. Even  there, it is not 100% immersion.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">On a serious,  non-political point, our education system is in danger of getting into problems by &ldquo;salami slicing&rdquo;. For  example, and to show that there are a breadth of things going wrong and  demonstrate the difficulty of singling out a particular issue, a primary school  in Mallusk is threatened with closure because a Brethren school is going to be  set up. I understand absolutely that the Brethren have issues of their own, but  there is a knock-on effect.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Similarly, I have spoken to Muslims who want to open a  school. There are a range of people, such as the Muslims, the Chinese and the  Poles, whom one could attempt to deal with, but one cannot deal with them all.  Before moving to fund such ideas, Members must properly debate the issues.  Respectfully, the UUP supports the motion. However, I am sure that we will  return to the issue at another time, and I look forward to a friendly and frank  engagement.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education (Ms Ruane)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. This debate  has been prompted by opposition to plans to introduce a loan arrangement for  the provision of accommodation for approved Irish-medium schools. Such an  arrangement has existed in the integrated sector for many years. At the outset,  I should say that a loan scheme for the Irish-medium sector is still under  discussion. It is important that such a scheme be considered carefully &mdash; not  least because of the planned changes to the future administration of education  and improved strategic planning of the estate.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Nevertheless, the focus to which Irish-medium education has  been subjected in the Assembly should be of concern. More than 40 questions  have been asked by the other side of the House &mdash; 6&middot;5% of all education  questions &mdash; about a sector that accounts for approx&shy;imately 3,750 children, or 1&middot;1% of the school population. We have had only two petitions of concern in the  House. What were they about? Irish-medium education. We have had 0&middot;7% &mdash;  I repeat, 0&middot;7% &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane</strong>:  No, I will not give way. We have had 0&middot;7% of the Budget spent on Irish-medium  education. What does that say to us? The Irish language is part of our national  heritage. It should be celebrated and treasured, not insulted in an attempt to  fan the flames of prejudice and hatred.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Good Friday Agreement included a commitment to:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;take resolute action to promote the language &hellip; seek  to remove, where possible, restrictions which would discourage or work against  the maintenance or development of the language&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: On  a point of order, Mr Speaker. Is it in order for the Minister to allege that  the petition of concern in relation to Mr McNarry&rsquo;s motion on 9 October  referred to the Irish-medium sector when it had nothing at all to do with  education? Obviously, in relation to the petition of concern, the Minister is  giving wrong information to the House.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: A petition of concern has been presented to me, and it has  already been dealt with. The Minister should continue.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat. The Good Friday Agreement included a commitment to:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;take resolute action  to promote the language &hellip; seek to remove, where possible, restrictions  which would discourage or work against the  maintenance or development of the language&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The European  Charter for Regional or Minority Lang&shy;uages contains a commitment to education in Irish where numbers are  considered sufficient. There is a statutory  duty to encourage and facilitate the development  of Irish-medium and integrated education, and I intend to do just that.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">5.00 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We are in a new era in which people expect to see leadership from their politicians. I visited Mount Vernon this morning to discuss the issues faced by the  community there &mdash; issues that are faced by communities in other parts of  the North. It is important that the Assembly be inclusive and show leadership  to those communities to help to improve their lives, step by step. That is a  small step but, in a small way, I am trying  to show leadership, and I ask Members to join me in that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is a shame to hear a  young woman, such as Michelle McIlveen, attacking the Irish language and  trying to justify her attack by saying at the outset that that is not what she is doing. I would much prefer to see  innovative thinking from a young woman in the DUP &mdash; or in any party &mdash;  rather than tired, narrow-minded thinking or obsessions with the Irish  language.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We must move forward. My  colleague Francie Brolly mentioned  the Irish-medium community. I ask Members to consider for one moment the  effect that this debate will have on that community and on the children who  might be listening to parts of it. It is not fair.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I congratulate the Irish-medium sector for the work that it  is doing; I want to distance myself from the attacks on it and to say that I am  sorry that there has been such a constant attack on its chosen form of  education. I would like to reassure those people &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. In your capacity as Speaker, can you help the  House by distinguishing whether this speech is being made by someone acting as  a Minister or a Member &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. That is not an appropriate point of order.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane</strong>: I  would like to reassure those people that they can expect fair play, as will  everyone in the education sector. I would also like to reassure them that, in  my role as Minister, I have been out and about in many communities, and I have  visited many schools that are predominately Protestant. The generosity of  spirit shown by people there on many issues, including the Irish language, is  in stark contrast to that shown by Michelle McIlveen and Nelson McCausland  today. Those people are ashamed about such attacks and the type of narrow  mindedness that has been shown today, and they want to distance themselves from  that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Beidh Comhalta&iacute; i ndiaidh r&aacute;iteas agus tuairim&iacute; a  chluinstin faoi sc&eacute;im chlub bainc, agus creidim go mbeadh s&eacute; ina chuidi&uacute; ag  Comhalta&iacute; m&iacute;ni&uacute; a f&aacute;il ar cad &eacute; at&aacute; i gceist leis an sc&eacute;im agus an d&oacute;igh a  n-oibr&iacute;onn s&iacute; san earn&aacute;il imeasctha.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members will have heard comments and concerns expressed  about a club-bank scheme, and it would be useful  if I explain briefly what that is and how it operates for the integrated  sector. It is referred to as a club bank simply because it is an agreement  among three banks, NICIE and the Integrated  Education Fund. The agreement allows  the integrated sector to place money on deposit against which it can  borrow sums to finance the capital cost of new grant-maintained integrated  schools. That can be done only for schools for which a statutory development proposal has been published, has been  the subject of consultation, and  which has been conditionally approved by the Department of Education. It  cannot be used for schools that are funded independently.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The publication of a  development proposal is required when there is a proposal for a school  to be established, be closed or to undergo a significant change that would  alter its character or size. The development proposal gives the school  recognition for funding. The club bank is a means of delivering accommodation  for integrated schools without capital funding from the Department of Education  at the outset.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In agreeing to the use of club-bank arrangements in the mid-1990s, the Department&rsquo;s objective was to  reduce the risk of loss in providing public funding for a new school  during its early years, until it had proven its enrolment viability. Thus, a  newly established school that had been approved for funding by the Department  would receive recurrent funding only to cover costs such as teachers&rsquo; salaries,  conditional on meeting the intake requirements. That school would be eligible  for capital funding if it had met the minimum intake  requirements over a longer period of three years.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Those schools have traditionally been constructed with a core building and mobile classrooms, with  further mobile classrooms being added over time, subject to the schools  increasing in size.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department reimburses approved capital costs once the  criteria are met. Once the reimbursement of approved capital expenditure is  made, the club-bank arrangement does not provide any further funding for that  particular school. The school trustees have to meet the costs of any further capital work, then retrospectively  claim grant aid from the Department. Therefore, in the early years, the sector,  rather than the Department, takes the risk in providing facilities through  borrowing from the banks for capital works.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">T&aacute; roinnt blianta &oacute; shin, moladh socr&uacute; den chine&aacute;l seo  d&rsquo;earn&aacute;il na Gaeilge.

	      <p class="B3BodyText">A similar arrangement was proposed for the Irish-medium  sector several years ago. I understand that, because of the anticipated smaller  scale of loans, the intention was for only one bank to be involved, rather than  three. It was envisaged that such a scheme would operate in a similar way to  that in the integrated sector: the sector would borrow for the purposes of  providing accommodation for a school that had itself been conditionally  approved by the Department.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The work of the review of education administration includes  the development of an area-based planning approach  to the schools estate. In a period of significant changes to pupil  numbers, that approach will help to offer a real solution to the issue of  over-provision. Furthermore, it should bring greater consistency and equality to planning. It is proposed that the new  education and skills authority will  have a central role in the planning of  the estate, within the policy framework and guidance provided by the  Department.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The production of well-developed area-based plans could make club-bank arrangements redundant. In future,  all school schemes that are considered necessary to meet expected needs in an area, and are supported through area-based planning, should be  able to be considered f<span style="letter-spacing:-.3pt; ">or funding from the outset. That will require</span> the  education and skills authority to  have access to robust information on anticipated needs for an area. The use of  bank loans for a particular sector  will be expected to diminish, and will most likely become unnecessary  altogether.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is an important  question around how to address the accommodation needs of existing  Irish-medium schools in the period before the education and skills authority is  established. The issues are subject to consideration, and the position of  individual schools will need to be considered on a case-by-case basis. Equality  will be at the forefront in the making of those decisions, and statutory duties will be taken into account.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A club bank, therefore,  is simply a means of addressing accommodation needs for recently  established schools that have already been recognised for recurrent, but not capital, funding. As I have explained, there is a  question over the future role of a club bank.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although Members have focused on concerns about access to  loan arrangements for Irish-medium schools, we have heard little from Members  today &mdash; except snig&shy;gering and bully-boy tactics &mdash; as to what funding arrange&shy;ments should be used instead for recently  estab&shy;lished approved schools. All children are entitled &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. Is it in order for that sort of language to be  used in the Chamber? My colleague and I have  tried to be construc&shy;tive during this debate. We have suggested &mdash; I do  not know whether the Minister was present at that time &mdash; that the maintained  sector and the Irish units that are contained &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Order. I have allowed the Member some liberty on his point of  order. I remind all Members and the Minister that, in this House, as far as  possible, they should temper their language.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  On a further point of order, Mr Speaker. While the Minister is on her feet,  some Members in the Chamber are continuously trying to shout down the other  Members, which disrupts &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  That is not an appropriate point of order. I understand that, from time to  time, there are debates in the House that raise emotions. However, once again,  I remind Members that they should be temperate and measured in what they say. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane</strong>:  Has the Member opposite finished making his point?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. The Minister has the Floor. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am taking no further points of order. I ask the Member to  take his seat, and I am &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am taking no further points of order on this issue. The  Minister may continue.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane</strong>: I  will repeat my last sentence, as I do not know whether Members heard it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although Members have focused on concerns about access to  loan arrangements for Irish-medium schools, we have heard little today as to  what funding arrange&shy;ments should be used instead for recently established  approved schools and, indeed, for schools that are working out of Portakabins,  of which there are many in the Irish-medium sector.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">All children, regardless of creed, race, religious belief  or political opinion, are entitled to learn in facilities that meet modern  educational standards. An obvious alternative to borrowing would be to plan for  capital funding for new schools from the outset. Is that what Members want to  see? Those matters will be considered carefully in deciding how best to  proceed, and in anticipation of an area-based planning approach.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I will not tolerate any sector&rsquo;s being treated in a  discriminatory or unfair manner. I will continue to take my equality duties as Minister of Education in the North of Ireland &mdash;  Mar Aire Oideachais i dTuaisceart na h&Eacute;ireann &mdash; very seriously. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  Sometimes, I hear the comments of Members, and it is clear to me that they  forget that they are in a debating Chamber. This is not a stroll down to the dry-cleaners  to hear what everyone is saying. This is a debating Chamber, so let us have the  debate; let us have the banter, but in a way that is fair. I do not accept the  allegations made by the Minister that bully-boy tactics are being used. Those  on the other side of the Chamber know well how parts of society operate with  respect to bully-boy tactics.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members know me to be  someone who uses temperate language &mdash; someone who is always considerate  and moderate in what he says. However, Members have made a number of contributions to which I must respond. I  dissociate myself from the scurrilous comments that were made by the Minister and others, attacking Michelle  McIlveen. I commend Miss McIlveen for stressing that her motion is not a  sectarian attack on the Irish-medium sector. The motion simply highlights the  problems that will emerge as a result of this policy, should it ever be  implemented.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The policy is unfair, and it gives an unfair advantage to  the Irish-medium sector. We have the figures: &pound;33 million was given to the  Irish-medium sector in the past five years. Obviously, one cannot argue that  there has been discrimination. Surely, &pound;33 million &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I will not give way. I  have 10 minutes, and I can assure Members that I will use them to the full.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Having given the Irish-medium sector &pound;33 million, the  Minister plans to give it additional moneys and an additional advantage.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My colleague Michelle  McIlveen also made reference to  area-based planning. It seems as though that concept, along with &lsquo;Schools for the Future: A Policy for  Sustain&shy;able Schools&rsquo; and the Bain Report are to be torn up. Those  matters are referred to; credence is paid to them in lip service, but they are  not dealt with in reality.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Paul Butler was next to contribute. I am surprised and  somewhat disappointed that he is not sitting in his usual place. Normally, he  sits at the Minister&rsquo;s side, like a mini-me of the Minister of Education.  However, he has taken a seat at the back of the Chamber. He said that Miss McIlveen&rsquo;s comments were an attack,  dressed up. I have disposed of that allegation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The DUP is not playing politics. The education of all our  children, whether they attend an  Irish-medium school, a controlled school, a maintained school &mdash; or, like  my children, a Christian independent school that does not receive one penny  from the Department &mdash; is too important to be the subject of political games.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If we have entered a new era &mdash; I say &ldquo;if&rdquo; because recent  events have perhaps called that into question &mdash; let us see it in reality. Let us  have a level playing field for all.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">5.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Paul Butler referred to growing evidence of the existence  of substandard buildings in the Irish-medium sector. However, he did not refer  to the substandard buildings that exist in the  maintained sector, the controlled sector or the other sectors. It is all  right for pupils in those schools to be in Portakabins. It is acceptable for  schools such as Ballycastle   High School, which is in  my constituency, not to have had a newbuild since 1964. That is a controlled  school, and, as such, it is in one of those sectors that can be ignored when it  comes to giving financial and infrastructural assistance. Mr Butler also said  that the scheme will educate children in the Irish-medium sector:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;without any risk to the public purse.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">One million pounds has been proposed for the scheme, and  the breakdown of the additional bid that the Minister has submitted cites &pound;3&middot;5  million for 2008-09, &pound;2&middot;5 million for 2009-10, and another &pound;2&middot;5 million for  2010-11, of which some is for language enhancement for teachers in the  Irish-medium schools. Obviously, Long Kesh did not provide enough  Irish-language teaching, and that is the reason that their skills need  enhancing.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText"><span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  You probably understand it better.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Moving on, I welcome Ken Robinson&rsquo;s comments, and I always  appreciate the wisdom that he brings to education matters, not only in the  Chamber, but in the Committee for Education. He referred to the Irish-language  units in the maintained sector. We must ask why there is a problem and a  division. Why are people making a choice? I welcome his comments about the  exclusivity of the Irish-medium sector and the dangers of division. He also  referred to a shared future, but I will come back to that in a moment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Dominic Bradley, who is not in the Chamber, spoke of rapid  growth in the Irish-medium sector. I thought that  he would say that such growth has taken place over the past five or 10  years, but, lo and behold, he said that it had occurred over the past 37 years.  If we wait until the sector&rsquo;s fiftieth birthday, we may have 5,000 children in the Irish-medium sector. Is that  rapid growth? The Minister has told us that the Irish-medium sector represents the equivalent of 1&middot;1% of the school  population and 0&middot;07% of the Budget. If Dominic Bradley deems that to be rapid growth, I hope that the economy  grows faster than the Irish-medium  sector, otherwise the Programme for Government will have no chance of  surviving.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">What can one say about  Stephen Farry and the Alliance Party? He dealt with a small side issue.  However, the one point that amazed me about his speech was that, probably for  the first time in any of his interventions or contributions in the Chamber, he  did not refer to the document &lsquo;Research into the financial cost of the Northern Ireland  divide&rsquo;. That document is the bedtime reading of all Alliance Party Members.  What does that document say about the divisions that exist in the education  system in Northern Ireland?  I will quote a part that Stephen may have missed last night:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;schools provision  &mdash; greater collaboration across schools sectors and consolidation within  the schools estate could result in savings&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The document goes on to say that between &pound;15&middot;9 million and  &pound;79&middot;6 million could be saved. Are we not getting to the heart of the issue for  the Irish-medium, maintained and controlled sectors? Members must face up to  the reality that our education system will cost an absolute fortune, as that  document proves. What does the Minister do? She decides that money is of no  consequence and that we can afford to dish out more for new schemes such as the  club banks.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I must clarify for Mr Brolly, who needs to be given a  lesson in Ulster-Scots &mdash; not Irish &mdash; history, and assure the House that the  McIlveens, one of whom is on this side of Chamber, were Ulster Scots who  arrived with the Hamiltons and the Montgomerys when they settled in 1606. That  needs to be understood.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome Mr  McCausland&rsquo;s comments, which were self-explanatory.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I will now deal with  the Minister&rsquo;s remarks and leave Basil McCrea alone for once. During an  intervention that she made on another occasion when she addressed the House,  the Minister quoted poetry to me. She also said that she was glad that I was  not the Education Minister. I want to quote a little bit of poetry to her:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;As I was sitting in my chair, I knew the bottom was  not there; nor legs, nor back, but I just sat, ignoring little things like  that&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That is what the Minister has done with regard to  the financial arrangements for education,  classroom assistants, and so on: she has continually ignored the facts.  I support the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: That concludes the debate on the motion. I remind Members that  the Question will be put as the first item of business on Monday 19 November 2007,  on a cross-community basis.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Motion made:</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">That the Assembly do now adjourn. &mdash; [Mr Speaker.]</p>
	      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="6"></a>Adjournment</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Priory Integrated College, Holywood</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I remind Members that the proposer will have 10 minutes in which to speak and  all other Members will have approximately seven or eight minutes in which to  speak.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  am grateful for the opportunity to discuss this important issue. This debate  is, first and foremost, about the future of Priory Integrated   College in Holywood.  However, the subject is, in fact, broader because  the wider reorganisation of educational provision in Holywood depends on  decisions that will be taken on Priory   Integrated College  in the near future.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">At the outset, I want to  acknowledge the strong support for the new campus and other educational  reforms in Holywood that has come from across the political spectrum in North  Down and which will, undoubtedly, be  reflected in the comments of my fellow North Down MLAs during the  debate.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">By coincidence, North Down Borough Council will also be  debating a cross-party motion on this subject tonight, which will, no doubt, be  passed. I thank the MP for North Down, Lady Sylvia Hermon, who has been vocal  on the issue and who has provided critical leadership.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I also thank the Minister of Education for taking the  trouble to visit Priory   Integrated College  in June 2007, just a few weeks after she assumed office. The school was  grateful for her visit, during which it was clear that the Minister took a  great deal of interest in the children&rsquo;s work. She could not have failed to  notice the building&rsquo;s poor state of repair: it is well past its sell-by date  and is no longer fit for purpose.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The South Eastern Education and Library Board, in considering the future of education provision in  Holy&shy;wood, has, through an economic appraisal, come to the firm conclusion that the most efficient and effective  solution &mdash; financially and  educationally &mdash; is to relocate Priory Integrated College to the Redburn  Primary School site; demolish the current  building in order to make way for a new  primary school that would facilitate the amalgamation of Holywood  Primary School and Redburn Primary School; and construct a new nursery unit on  the site vacated by Holywood Primary School.  It is a significant reorganisation of education provision in the town.  However, it places education on a fully sustainable basis. The newbuild campus  for Priory Integrated College  must be the first step in that reorganisation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">On 1 March 2006, former  Education Minister, Angela Smith, announced funding of &pound;8&middot;7 million for  the new building. That was part of an overall investment of &pound;380 million in the schools estate across Northern Ireland.  That announcement was made shortly after  the Secretary of State had announced  the independent strategic review of education, which was subsequently  headed by Professor Sir George Bain. Therefore, the announce&shy;ment was made as  the Department was moving to adopt a more strategic approach to the schools  estate. However, in January 2007, the Secretary of State indicated that capital  projects that had already been approved, such as that of Priory Integrated   College, needed to be  reviewed in light of the Bain Report&rsquo;s recommendations.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In February 2007, the South Eastern Education and Library  Board reaffirmed its support for the project, in the light of the Bain Report.  In other words, the board sees the project as being consistent with that  report. In March, the then Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State Maria Eagle  confirmed that the building work for 84  schools, which had been put on hold, could proceed. She stressed that  the remaining assessments could be completed within two months. It is now  almost six months since the time in which  those assessments should have been  concluded. However, Priory   Integrated College  is still awaiting the go-ahead for its  project. Other schools are also awaiting decisions, not least the High  School, Ballynahinch, which is in the Minister&rsquo;s constituency. Priory Integrated   College has done  everything that has been, and could be, asked of the school.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to stress a number of important points about Priory Integrated   College. First, it is an  integrated college. I firmly believe that integrated schools are the most  sustainable form of education, both financially and economically. They offer the most rounded education to  students, which is of benefit to wider society. The former Holywood High School  took on integrated status 10 years ago, with a new name and a new ethos. It is  widely acknowledged to be one of the most successful post-primary integrated  schools in Northern Ireland.  The Minister is aware of my concern over the approach that the Department takes  to viability criteria for integrated schools. However, it is worth noting that,  in North Down, fewer than 70% of students are recorded as having a Protestant  background.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Priory   Integrated College  is the only integrated post-primary school in the constituency, and it is fully  subscribed. A considerable number of its pupils attends from Bangor  and east Belfast.  However, the majority of its students comes from the town of Holywood. The neighbouring post-primary integrated schools &mdash; namely, Lagan College  and Strangford Integrated College  &mdash; are oversubscribed. Therefore, the  school is not only sustain&shy;able but critical, if every child in North  Down and East Belfast is to be offered the  opportunity to avail himself or herself of integrated post-primary education.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Priory Integrated  College has established partnerships  with Oakgrove Integrated  College in Derry and an Irish-language  school in Cork,  the Pobalscoil na Tr&iacute;on&oacute;ide. I hope that I have pronounced its name correctly.  Moreover, Priory Integrated College  is an all-ability school and delivers excellent academic results. It is worth  noting that the college is the only non-selective option for people who live in  the large town of Holywood.  The school and its students make valuable  contributions to the community through sports, the arts and community  and charity work. The wider community in Holywood, including the Holywood  Chamber of Trade, is supportive of the new school.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As an integrated school, its appeal to the entire community  is maximised. However, the sustainability argument  goes even further. The school has collaborated with a wide range of  other local schools, including Glastry College, St Columbanus High School, Strangford Integrated  College, South  Eastern Regional  College and Sullivan Upper   School. That  collaboration offers students in all those schools the benefits of, and access  to, the widest curriculum possible. Holywood&rsquo;s local grammar school, Sullivan  Upper, is also supportive of the changes.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am conscious of the problems facing the schools estate  across Northern Ireland.  Those problems include falling rolls and 50,000 empty school places, which, in  a few years&rsquo; time, may rise to 80,000. It was in that context that the Bain  Report was commissioned. That report places a heavy emphasis on sharing in and  between schools, collaboration among schools and area planning. It is clear  that Priory Integrated College  ticks all those boxes.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Clearly, there must be  a rationalisation of the schools estate. That rationalisation will  create many problems in many communities. Local representatives will use Adjournment debates to argue for special cases.  However, the case of Priory Integrated   College is different.  Holy&shy;wood is well ahead of the curve in innovation and rationalisation.  The community is hungry to move ahead with the necessary rationalisation, but  decisions are not being taken. A ready solution for area planning has been presented on a plate to the Minister.  That solution could be a model for other areas.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The reorganisation of  the schools estate in Holywood will provide a much more sustainable  outcome. Priory Integrated College can provide for long-term enrolment, well  in excess of 450 students. The year 8 intake for 2007-08 was 88. Although, the Bain Report recommended a  threshold of 500 students for post-primary schools, that threshold was for  reviewing the situation in the context of those schools&rsquo; experiences. A threshold  of 500 students is, of course, an arbitrary figure. The realities of how  communities exist must be taken into account.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Frankly, a newbuild  campus for Priory   College could see an expanded school well beyond that threshold  figure of 500. The demand is there, and integrated education is extremely popular, not only in Holywood, but  through&shy;out North Down. In any event, the amalgamation of the two primary schools on the current site will see  a single primary school with an enrolment figure well in excess of 400.  That is almost three times the Bain threshold figure for primary schools. The  overall package of this reorganisation is,  therefore, unambiguously sustainable.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">5.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">What further  information or evidence does the Minister need from the school in order to make that decision? She may be  in a position to make a crucial announcement this evening. However, if not, I  ask her to assure the House, particularly the MLAs from North Down, and the  entire community in Holywood, that she will be able to take a positive decision  in the very near future.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The consequences of delay are pupils and staff continuing  to work in conditions recognised by the Minister&rsquo;s  own Department as not being fit for purpose; health and safety issues;  high levels of anxiety among staff, students and parents; high maintenance  costs, which are totally unnecessary; and uncertainty in the feeder primary  schools. I urge the Minister to take the necessary decision and to provide a  model system for education, not just in Holywood, but right across North Down. I must stress that the will exists in the  community to move forward on education and to make the types of changes  that are necessary in Northern    Ireland. With the support of the Minister  and the Department, those changes can be made.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  thank my colleague for North Down Dr Farry  for bringing this issue to the Assembly&rsquo;s attention. Moreover, I take  this opportunity to welcome some representatives from Priory Integrated   College who are in the Public Gallery to listen this very important  debate.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As has been said, what has happened with Priory Integrated   College goes to the heart  of many issues. It goes to the heart of the  issue of the Department&rsquo;s integrity. A previous Minister announced that  the investment in the college was to go ahead; however, there was a lack of  follow-up action &mdash; indeed, the Department dragged its feet. Such cases are not  unique. Often when announcements are made,  the failure to act swiftly on them, and, in some cases, the failure to implement particular decisions, places a  question mark over the integrity of the Department.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">This issue also goes to the heart of the need for decisive  action. Although we can be critical of the Department for failure to move  forward on the matter when direct rule Ministers were in charge, there are some  concerns over the length of time that this matter has taken since devolution.  Soon after devolution was restored at the  beginning of May, I wrote to the Minister about Priory Integrated   College &mdash; indeed, I am  sure that she has received representations from a number of Members. In June, I  received a response thanking me for my letter of 24 May. Indications were given  that, at that stage, it was not possible to determine when the scheme will be  allowed to proceed and when building work on the new school could commence. It  is now nearly five months since I received a response to that letter, and  nearly six months since the matter was originally raised by Members, yet the  pupils, staff and governors of Priory   Integrated College  are still in a state of suspended animation. They still wait to hear when the  college will be given the green light on the newbuild, or, indeed, whether it  will be given the green light at all.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Above all, this issue is about the application of pure  common sense. As Stephen Farry pointed out, it is clear that the case for a  newbuild in Priory   Integrated College  is unanswerable. In making the case, let me ask four questions. First, is a  newbuild necessary? I have had the honour of visiting the school and seeing the  conditions there &mdash; I am sure that other Members have, too. In the previous  debate, reference was made to a school in  north Antrim that has remained unchanged since the 1960s. Priory Integrated   College has been in  existence since 1952, so the building is 55 years old. Unfortunately, anyone  visiting the college can clearly see the wear and tear of that building.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is simply in an unacceptable state for education. The  walls are peeling, and there are areas that are unsafe for the children.  Indeed, when an education and library board representative visited the school  and was asked about refurbishment, he said that the school was not  refurbishable, and that it had reached the stage at which any money spent on  repairing or improving it would only be throwing good money after bad. It is  clear that that is not an answer.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Against that background,  the next question is whether the  school is successful. Despite the appalling conditions in which teachers  have had to work &mdash; as the previous contributor  said &mdash;Priory Integrated College&rsquo;s  academic record has been excellent. It is a non-selective school; one  might almost say that it is a model for the path that the Minister would like  to go down. However, it has achieved  excellent results. Sixth-form provision was first made available at Priory Integrated   College four years ago,  and of the first cohort of A-level students, 93% are at university. The vast majority of that group of pupils  would have been unfairly labelled as 11-plus failures, yet they have achieved  excellent academic results.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The third question is  whether the school is sustainable. There is a clear demand for  integrated education and, as Dr Farry said,  the nearest schools &mdash; Lagan College and Strangford  Integrated College,  both of which are some distance away from Priory Integrated   College &mdash; are  oversubscribed. Despite the appalling physical condition of the school, its  numbers have increased. At one time, the school roll reached a low of 190; it  is now about 420 or 430.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In discussions about the sustainability of the school, a  figure of 500 pupils has been mentioned. However, Dr Farry has already pointed out that that is not a proper  comparison because it does not compare like with like. Given that the maximum enrolment of Priory Integrated<span style="letter-spacing:0pt; "> College</span> has, in effect, been capped at about 450 pupils,  the opportunity to achieve that target of 500 is nigh on impossible at this  time. The school is growing in popularity, and found itself oversubscribed  after the most recent intake.  It would be difficult for parents to be impressed with the school, given the state of the building, but  many parents want their children to go there.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The needs of the area go beyond Priory Integrated   College itself. There is a knock-on effect for Holywood Primary   School and Redburn   Primary School, which intend  to amalgamate, and also for nursery provision. The vast majority of pupils aged  between three years and 18 years throughout  Holywood and parts of Bangor and east Belfast are affected. A  new build at Priory   Integrated College  is clearly going to be sustainable.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The final question is whether best practice is being  adopted in relation to sustainability. Co-operation exists between Priory Integrated  College, Sullivan  Upper School,  St Columbanus&rsquo; College, South Eastern Regional  College, which comprises the former  North Down and Ards Institute of Further and Higher Education, and also  involves Strangford Integrated College  and Glastry College. Work is continuing with a  school in County Cork &mdash; unlike Dr Farry, I am not even  going to attempt the Irish pronunciation. The school co-operates with Oakgrove Integrated  College and is involved in a  cross-generational project with the primary 7 class at Glencraig Integrated   Primary School. Priory Integrated   College fulfils the Bain  Report&rsquo;s collaboration criteria; it is a model school.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The parents and  governors of Priory   Integrated College  are asking the Minister for some implementation, some delivery and, at the very  least, some certainty in the process, so that they can have a date for a  newbuild. It is an unanswerable case. Let us see something being done for all  the people of Holywood.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>: I  support my colleagues on this issue. Dr Farry has set out the history of the  matter. Prior to the debate, I dug out some of the many oral and written  questions that have been put to the Minister.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am amazed by the number of questions that there have  been, although the replies have been much the same. In March 2007, we were told  that six schools would be put on hold and one of those would be Priory Integrated College. On 15 June, in response to a question  for written answer, the Minister said:</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText"><span style="letter-spacing:-.05pt; font-size:8.5pt; ">&ldquo;The Department expects to be able to provide  confirmation of the </span><span style="font-size:8.5pt; ">position shortly.</span>&rdquo; &mdash; <em><span style="font-size:8.5pt; ">[Official Report, Bound Volume 22, pWA105, col 2].</span></em></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The enrolment level was  capped at a maximum of 450 pupils,  and the Department of Education was concerned at projected enrolment  trends and the sustainability of those projected trends. On 17 September 2007,  the Minister said in the House:</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText"><span style="font-size:8.5pt; ">&ldquo;Pupil numbers are clearly an important factor in assessing the future  viability of schools, but they should not be the sole factor</span>.&rdquo; &mdash; <em><span style="font-size:8.5pt; ">[Official Report, Vol 23, No 7, p323, col 1].</span></em></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister confirmed  that other factors to be taken into consideration included:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;the educational experience of the children, the  financial position of the school, leadership and management at the school,  accessibility, and links with the community.&rdquo; &mdash; <span style="font-size:11.0pt; font-style:normal; ">[Official  Report, Vol 23, No 7, p323, col 1].</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I contend, and I do not think that there is any dissention from the point of view, that Priory Integrated College scores in all those areas. The enrolment figure of  450 could easily be reached, and one of the problems is that the lack of  action on the Priory Integrated College  site delays the two primary schools in Holywood, but also the ones in  Bangor and in Conlig that have applied for integrated status. There is now a  queue of schools awaiting decisions, while other decisions have been taken. For  example, the Minister decided to close the school  in Conlig, even though its application for integrated status is still  being considered. A nonsensical situation is developing in North Down.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We want to have the best education system possible for  North Down, and we cannot be faulted for that. Therefore, we must be told  sharply when a decision will be made by either the Department of Education or  the South Eastern Education and Library Board, whichever one is holding up the  issue.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I mentioned the  nightmare situation that has developed: the numbers of pupils who attend, or are about to attend,  integrated primary schools are diminishing overall because of the lack of  progress at Priory   Integrated College. I have been surprised to learn that, in  considering the future of schools, the powers that be tend to look at  the numbers on the ground and give little thought to the projected numbers. For  example, it seems that there is no liaison  between the projected enrolment of a school and the building of houses  in that area.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In Conlig, where the primary school wishes to be an  integrated primary school, 1,600 new houses are being built in the area. By any stretch of the imagination, that  is an essential criterion to be taken into account when deciding the future of that school and the future  of education for integrated-status applications throughout the borough of North Down. If they were given integrated status, those  primary schools would be feeder  schools to Priory   Integrated College. I appeal to the Minister to make a decision about Priory Integrated   College so that the issue  may be resolved and people can plan for the future education of their children.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>: I  am delighted to support Dr Farry in raising this matter in the Adjournment  debate.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Children, teachers and residents from Holywood and the surrounding  area have waited patiently for an effective reorganisation of the school system  in Holywood. They have grown resentful that, year after year, their hopes of a  new school being built have been dashed with delays and inaction. Dr Farry and  I, along with other Members in the Chamber today, are colleagues on North Down  Borough Council. Along with every member of  that council, we are disappointed by  the Minister&rsquo;s failure to act responsibly and decisively to provide a  suitable educational infrastructure to serve the children of Holywood.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Much is made at times of the area&rsquo;s reputation as the County Down  gold coast, but North Down Borough Council, like many other councils, serves a  diverse community, and all its children, especially those from disadvantaged areas, are entitled to have their  education in a positive and supportive environment.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">5.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The people of Holywood pay high rates and taxes, and they reasonably expect proper educational  provision for all their children in return. The Minister should be keen  to advance the proposals for a new school in the area, because education in the  town is characterised by the willingness of many parents to send their children  to schools that accept pupils without considering their religious affiliation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The proposal to build a new school for Priory Integrated   College in Holywood has  been on the table for several years, and the patience of the community is wearing thin. The proposed newbuild will have  numerous social, educational and  economic advantages, and it will benefit the pupils of both primary  schools in the area when they amalgamate. The Minister&rsquo;s failure to act is causing problems and has led to considerable  frustration for parents, teachers and children at both primary and  secondary schools. It is also having a major impact on the plans for the local  primary schools in the area, because they too are in limbo as they await a  decision.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Local political representatives have been inundated with  requests from constituents for information, action and support. They are  entitled to an answer, and I hope that the  Minister will provide one today. The implement&shy;ation of the plan would  ensure that Holywood has an excellent educational infrastructure that is  appropriate to the needs of the twenty-first  century. Furthermore, the community  would understand that devolved Government works for all areas of the Province. The plans for Priory Integrated College must be implemented immediately, because it is  vital for the well-being of the children in the town.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the last debate on education, the Minister spoke about  how many schools she had visited. I stand to be corrected, but she has not  visited any schools in North Down. I  challenge her to visit Priory   Integrated College  to observe the result of academic selection, the viability of the  project, the support of the community and the state of the building. I hope  that she will come to North Down and show a bit of interest in the people there  for a change.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McFarland</strong>: I thank Stephen Farry for introducing today&rsquo;s debate. I also thank the Minister for being present, and  I hope that she has her listening ears on.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Priory Integrated   College is a successful and popular integrated  school. As Members have heard, an exciting plan had been agreed to amalgamate  the two primary schools into one new school on the existing college site and move the college to a new building on  the Redburn Primary School site. Why has that plan been halted? It appears  that it is because the number of pupils enrolled does not meet the departmental  threshold of 500 that is required for a newbuild. I understand that the college  has a cap of 450 pupils,  which was determined by the South Eastern Education and Library Board.  Therefore, the college has to turn away a number of pupils each year, which  prevents it reaching an enrolment of 500.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The situation is ridiculous. I visited the school with  fellow Members earlier this year, and I wrote to the Minister outlining the  daft position. The Minister even visited the school, for which I thank her. I  understand that she arrived shortly after  my visit. However, despite a mound of supporting evidence, she still  refuses to approve the newbuild. Will she please explain why, in the face of so  much evidence that the plan meets the requirements, does she still refuse to  back it? Priory Integrated College  is everything that an integrated school should be, but the board and the  Department are discriminating against it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My colleague Lady Sylvia Hermon MP is a strong <span style="letter-spacing:-.35pt; ">supporter of the project, and all MLAs and local  councillors</span> are in favour of  the newbuild. I ask the Minister to sort out the confusion and to process the  proposals now.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B Wilson</strong>:  I am increasingly concerned about the delay in starting the building of the new  college. I congratulate Dr Farry for introducing the debate today. The debate  is a result of growing frustration, because Members have questioned, and  written to, the Minister but have had little response.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My interest stems from the fact that my eldest son is a  former student of Holywood   High School, which he  attended when it was in the process of applying for integrated status. I was  involved in the ballot before the application that successfully transformed it  into Priory Integrated College.  Since then, I have taken a great interest in  the development and expansion of the college because, at that time, it  was not in a good state. I supported the school&rsquo;s application for integrated  status because I recognised that there was an increasing demand for integrated  education in North Down. It has been highlighted that the neighbouring integrated post-primary schools of Strangford Integrated  College and Lagan  College are oversubscribed, and, in  fact, Priory Integrated College  is also oversubscribed this year. Therefore, there  is great demand for integrated schooling. More parents are choosing to send their children to integrated schools, and that is reflected by the increase  in enrolment at Priory   Integrated College.  That is likely to continue, particularly with the provision of a new  school.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The excellent examination results and the fact that the college now provides A-level courses have  contributed to the increase in enrolment. The college&rsquo;s GCSE results are  well above average for a non-selective school, and all A-level students  obtained three A-level passes at grade A to D, which is exceptional, given that  all the students were deemed 11-plus failures.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Priory Integrated College&rsquo;s progressive policies are also high&shy;lighted by  the fact that the college is at the forefront of adopting the principles set  out in the Bain Report. It is working with  Sullivan Upper, the South   Eastern Regional College and St Columbanus High School on various courses. Priory Integrated   College is doing all the  right things for the future of education, and it is making considerable  progress. The only problem is that the school buildings are deteriorating; they  are grotty and are no longer capable of meeting the demands of modern  education. A recent survey of the school showed that repairs totalling more  than &pound;1 million were necessary to bring the college to a fit state, but that  would be simply throwing good money after bad. Priory   Integrated College  needs a new campus.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The fact that the  college was oversubscribed this year highlights its popularity. In some  cases, the conditions under which students  and teachers are expected to work are appalling. A new school is  necessary to allow the college to develop its full potential.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">An early decision is essential, as a delay affects not only  the students of Priory   Integrated College,  but virtually every other child in the Holywood area. Work on Holywood Primary School and on Holywood  Nursery School cannot commence  until the Priory Integrated College  site is vacated. The delay is unacceptable,  as it creates uncertainty throughout all levels of education in  Holywood.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In March, the then Minister with responsibility for  education, Maria Eagle, stated that a decision would be made in two months. However, eight months later, we still await that decision. It is time to remove that  uncertainty and to make a firm  commitment to Priory   Integrated   College. That  would release the land for the develop&shy;ment of the new primary and nursery  schools in Holywood.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education (Ms Ruane)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. The  Department of Education considers demand for all forms of education within a  framework set out in legislation whereby, in so far as is compatible with the  provision of efficient instruction and training and the avoidance of unreason&shy;able expenditure, pupils shall be educated in  accordance with the wishes of their parents. The Department also has a  statutory duty to encourage and facilitate the development of Irish-medium and integrated education. The Good  Friday Agreement states that an essential element  of the reconciliation process is the promotion of a culture of tolerance at  every level of society, including initiatives  to encourage and facilitate integrated education.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members have said that the capital scheme for Priory Integrated   College was put on hold  by direct rule Minister Maria Eagle, following a review of capital planning  schemes to assess their consistency with the direction set out in the Bain  Report.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Bain Report recommended a schools estate comprising  fewer larger schools, with greater collabor&shy;ation and integration within, and  across, school sectors to address the needs of local areas.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In assessing the need for building projects, it is important that the particular circumstances are  examined carefully. We must look at preferences, within and between  sectors, and take account of the impact of declining  rolls on long-term sustainability in the post-primary sector. There are  added difficulties involving the  availability of places and effects on enrolment patterns.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Following the Bain Report, six projects &mdash; including Priory Integrated   College &mdash; were put on  hold because of uncertainties surrounding them. Priory Integrated   College has an enrolment  of 368 pupils in years eight to 12; 41  pupils at post-16, and 17 pupils with statements. The projected long-term  enrolment is for 400 pupils in years eight to 12.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Bain Report did not state that schools that are below  that level must be rationalised automatically; and I have not agreed with the report&rsquo;s recommendations in their entirety. There are issues relating to  the Irish-medium and integrated sectors that the Department must examine  &mdash; and there is currently a review of Irish-medium education.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Bain Report  recommended that schools below the 500-pupil level were to be reviewed  to ensure that they were continuing to  provide a high standard of education. All schools must be judged on  their merits, with a particular focus on the duty to promote and encourage.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In response to Alex  Easton, I visited Priory   Integrated College on 30 May 2007 and was impressed by the good work  of the principal and the staff, as well as the evident commitment to the  delivery of high quality education.  Priory Integrated College  has well established links with other providers across all sectors, and  enjoys strong leadership and management. There is no doubt that the school has  developed strong links with the community. The key issue is to determine the  provision needed for the local area, which takes account of local enrolment  trends and anticipated demand in the future. Bh&iacute; an Roinn i dteagmh&aacute;il le bord  an oirdheiscirt maidir le riachtanais ionchasacha an cheantair le gur f&eacute;idir  cinneadh a dh&eacute;anamh a luaithe is f&eacute;idir.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department has liaised with the South Eastern Education  and Library Board on its position regarding anticipated needs in the area. I  have no development proposal in front of me, but I want a decision on the  future of the project as soon as possible. I understand and share the  frustration of the school. I note the support of all the parties present &mdash; the  Alliance Party, the DUP and the UUP &mdash; and I will make sure that the board and  my officials get a copy of the debate.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane</strong>: I  will finish first. I do not believe in uncertainty or that it is fair for  schools to operate in an uncertain environment. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Dr Farry, the Minister has finished so the debate is over.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText"><em>Adjourned at 5.58 pm.</em></p>
