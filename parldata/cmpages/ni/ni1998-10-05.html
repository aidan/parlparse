                Secretary of State to determine where and when meetings of the
                Assembly shall be held. I have received from the Minister of
                State, Mr&nbsp;Murphy, a letter advising me that</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The Secretary of State directs that the

                on Monday 5 October until 6.00 pm on Friday 30 October.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is also the responsibility of the
                Secretary of State, under paragraph 10 of the Schedule to the
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland (Elections) Act 1998, to determine the
                Standing Orders of the Assembly during the shadow period. The
                Minister of State, Mr&nbsp;Murphy, has further written advising
                me that the Secretary of State has considered and agrees to the
                proposal from the Committee on Standing Orders, set out in the
                letter of the Joint Chairman, Mr&nbsp;Cobain, to the Minister,
                dated 17&nbsp;September&nbsp;1998, that the number of seats on
                each Assembly Committee should be increased by one. The
                Secretary of State has therefore determined that paragraphs
                15(2) and 16(2) of the Initial Standing Orders are amended to
                read as follows:</p>
                <blockquote>
                  <blockquote>
                  </font><font SIZE="1">
                  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;15(2) Committees shall consist of not
                  less than 10 and not more than 19 members and shall be such
                  that, as far as is practicable, there is a fair reflection of
                  the parties participating in the Assembly and that each party
                  with at least two Members shall have at least one seat on each
                  Committee.&quot;</p>
                  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;16(2) The Committee shall consist of
                  the Initial Presiding Officer (who shall be Chairperson), the
                  Deputy Presiding Officer and not less than eight and not more
                  than 17 Members appointed by the Initial Presiding Officer,
                  following consultation with the leaders of the parties of the
                  Assembly, and shall be such that, so far as is practicable,
                  there is a fair reflection of the parties participating in the

                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members should note that at this stage the
                rest of the Initial Standing Orders remain unchanged.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have previously observed that the Initial
                Standing Orders give only limited guidance on the conduct of our
                business, both inside and outside the Chamber. In such a period
                of transition that may be inevitable, but it can lead to
                misunderstandings. In particular, the way in which the Initial
                Presiding Officer should conduct himself is rather ill-defined.
                I have two remarks about how I intend to interpret my role
                during my time in office.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have decided to adopt the definition that
                was given in Speaker Lenthall’s description of his duties:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;I have neither eyes to see, nor tongue
                to speak in this place, but as the House is pleased to direct me
                whose servant I am here.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For that reason I have not given, and do not
                intend to give, any interviews or comment on matters pertaining
                to the content of our business here. Therefore I am adopting the
                conventions that are often referred to as Speaker’s Rules.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Having dealt with conduct, I shall now turn
                to rulings. The Committee on Standing Orders, under the joint
                chairmanship of Mr&nbsp;Fred&nbsp;Cobain and Mr&nbsp;Denis&nbsp;Haughey,
                was mandated by the Assembly to develop a comprehensive set of
                orders for the guidance and regulation of our work. Although
                those will not become our Standing Orders until they have been
                adopted by the Assembly and approved by the Secretary of State,
                I intend to use any agreement that is reached by the Committee
                on Standing Orders as guidance in interpreting the Initial
                Standing Orders. Of course, where there is a conflict, the
                Initial Standing Orders must prevail.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It may also be helpful if I clarify the role
                of some of the items which are being sent out to Members. Four
                sheets of paper went out to Members last Thursday by special
                delivery — the Order Paper for the upcoming Assembly sitting,
                the business diary for the following two weeks, the schedule of
                forthcoming business and the all-party notices. The Order Paper
                and the business diary speak for themselves. The forthcoming
                business paper lists only those upcoming matters which have been
                agreed to be tabled. If nothing has been listed under
                forthcoming business it should not be assumed that no business
                will take place on that day; it means simply that no business
                has yet been agreed for that day.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important that Members understand that
                the all-party notices are not only a way of communicating
                administrative arrangements from the Secretariat to Members.
                Members may also use them to communicate with each other. For
                example, a Member may sponsor a meeting in a Committee room,
                which is open to all Assembly Members. That could be included by
                advising the Second Clerk of the details in advance.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These four papers will continue to be sent to
                Members by special delivery on Thursday evenings.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Later this week, we hope to have available a
                first version of the Assembly Members’ Handbook. This will be
                in the form of a loose-leaf binder so that the information
                contained in it can be updated regularly. Feedback on all this
                material, including problems with arrangements for delivery,
                would be most helpful.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the last sitting of the Assembly a Shadow
                Assembly Commission was elected, and it has met on three
                occasions. To enable Members to follow the Commission’s
                deliberations, I have, with the agreement of its members,
                arranged for a copy of the minutes of each of its meetings to be
                placed in the Library. It is intended that this practice will be
                continued. When the Commission judges that there are substantive
                issues which ought to be brought before the Assembly, a
                statement will be made in the Chamber.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Following the terrible events in Omagh, the
                Secretary of State appointed Mr&nbsp;John&nbsp;McConnell to
                assist, on behalf of the Government, in the process of
                rebuilding lives and property so terribly damaged. The Assembly’s
                concerns demonstrated in the debate at its last sitting have
                been noted, and Mr&nbsp;McConnell has produced a brief note for
                the Assembly on progress to date. He has forwarded this to me,
                and I have placed a copy of it in the Library.</p>

                Unionist Assembly Party. — <i>[The Initial Presiding Officer]</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Initial Presiding Officer:</p>
                </font></b><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I advised the Assembly that the Secretary of
                State had determined to amend paragraph 15(2) of the Initial
                Standing Orders by increasing the upper limit of membership from
                18 to 19, and paragraph 16(2) by increasing the upper limit of
                membership of the Committee to Advise the Presiding Officer from
                16 to 17. Since the responsibility for decisions about the
                latter rests with the Initial Presiding Officer, I have decided
                to invite the United Unionist Assembly Party to nominate a
                member to that Committee. The motion, which is self-explanatory,
                permits the newly established United Unionist Assembly Party to
                be represented on the Committee of Standing Orders and the Ad
                Hoc Committee on the Procedural Consequences of Devolution. It
                seeks the Assembly’s agreement to this course of action and
                requires a simple majority.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A Chathaoirligh, Sinn Fein will support the
                motion on the basis that this is a transitional arrangement
                which will not bind the Assembly proper to any particular course
                of action, and I have already discussed this with you, Mr
                Initial Presiding Officer. While we will always support the
                principle of proportionality in all matters relating to the work
                of the Assembly, we will, nevertheless, want to ensure, because
                of the unique arrangements and procedures which apply here, that
                there is no scope, by default or otherwise, for abuse of the
                system here in terms of cross-community representation, parallel
                consensus, or, further down the line, the d’Hondt system. We
                support the motion only insofar as it applies to these
                Committees which will have a very short lifespan.</p>

                strengths, my party will contest that matter hotly with them.

                Procedure Committee of the House of Commons that we present a
                report to it by 9 October. The Committee has met on four
                occasions, on the first of which I was elected Chairman.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are a number of issues upon which the
                Committee will seek to develop a view. These include the roles
                of the Northern Ireland Select Committee and the Northern
                Ireland Grand Committee. Under the arrangements for devolution,
                many matters which currently come before these Committees will
                come before the Assembly. This will have a knock-on effect on
                the workings and procedures of those Committees — clearly,
                something that this Committee will wish to consider.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Next, we must examine the procedures that
                relate to parliamentary questions.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How many of you will be aware of the 1923
                ruling by the Speaker at both Stormont and at Westminster which
                stated that matters devolved to the Stormont Parliament should
                no longer be addressed from the Floor of the House of Commons
                because the Ministers responsible for such matters were in the
                Stormont Parliament? Should this ruling continue under the new
                arrangements?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The question of the proper scrutiny of public
                expenditure in the Northern Ireland Departments is overseen, at
                the moment, by the Public Accounts Committee at the House of
                Commons. If such matters are devolved to Ministers and to this
                Assembly, there may be a case for having a separate Public
                Accounts Committee in Northern Ireland answerable to the
                Assembly. These are matters that are likely to have a knock-on
                effect on how Westminster does its business.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are different views on how European
                legislation should be dealt with. Currently it comes forward to
                Parliament, which legislates on behalf of the United Kingdom.
                Should that continue or should the Scottish Parliament, the
                Welsh Assembly and the Northern Ireland Assembly look at the
                European matters on their respective Floors?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is also the question of the role and
                views of Northern Ireland Members of Parliament. The famous West
                Lothian question has been raised by Tam Dalyell, the Member of
                Parliament for West Lothian, and asks whether Scottish Members
                of Parliament will have the right to consider and vote in the
                House of Commons on matters that pertain to England when English
                Members of Parliament will not be able, after devolution, to
                discuss matters devolved to Scotland. If that principle were
                extended to Northern Ireland, it would clearly have an effect on
                what happens at Westminster.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The question is how to delineate the
                responsibilities of the Secretary of State, who will retain
                responsibility at Westminster, and the authority of the
                Assembly, and again there are ramifications on how Westminster
                is likely to do its business.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The next stage is for the Procedures
                Committee to consider some complex oral evidence and seek
                guidance from the Standing Orders Committee, constitutional
                lawyers and the Procedures Committee at the House of Commons
                itself. Initial discussions with the Procedures Committee shows
                that it would accept comments received by early November. The
                Committee is therefore seeking to renegotiate the deadline
                because of the complexity of the issues involved and the amount
                that Members need to learn. Although we have Mr McGrady,
                Mr&nbsp;McCrea and Mr McCartney, who are either serving or
                former Members of Parliament, and although I spent three years
                as a parliamentary assistant at Westminster, there are many
                members of the Committee who are not familiar with how
                Westminster operates.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is also uncertainty about the Bill.
                Many clauses in that Bill may be changed completely by the time
                it comes in to law, so there may be ramifications there and,
                indeed, for the inclusive nature of the Assembly’s Standing
                Orders. There are three parts to this question: first, what will
                the Bill eventually say; secondly, what will the Assembly’s
                Standing Orders say; and, thirdly, how the Committee will view
                changes to Westminster’s role.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is also curiosity about how the
                proceedings in the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly
                will operate. They will be different and, most importantly of
                all, they have not yet been elected. I understand that various
                teams have been liaising with the Cabinet Office to produce
                outline Standing Orders for them so that when they come into
                being, they will have something on paper. Clearly, because of
                the knock-on effects, it is likely that all three devolved
                institutions will want to have similar relationships with
                Westminster.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are major constitutional implications,
                and the Committee believes that it would be wrong to rush its
                conclusions. The Committee is, therefore, seeking the leave of
                the Assembly to continue its work for a further month and report
                to the House by 6&nbsp;November. I hope that the interim report
                has given a flavour of the challenge faced by the Procedures
                Committee and that an extension will be permitted.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Robinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to make several comments as a preface
                to my remarks on this report. The first is that there are some
                bad habits creeping in to our procedures. I did not receive a
                copy of the report until this morning when I arrived in the
                building and made an effort to get it myself. Any report which
                is open to debate and amendable should be with Members well in
                advance of our session.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I appreciate that the Committee had a
                deadline to meet, but I am sure that its Members were not
                working over the weekend, and presumably they had completed
                their task — in as far as it went — before the end of
                business on Friday. It would have been helpful if some way had
                been found to have it with us on Saturday. It had still not
                arrived when I left home this morning, and I now find myself
                having to speak on a report of which I have been able to give
                only a cursory look. I make that point as, I hope, a helpful
                criticism.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, I note that this is the second time
                that the Assembly has delegated a task to individuals or to a
                Committee, and it has not been fulfilled. I understand that this
                is a complex subject and that some Members will have to read
                themselves into it and become more acquainted with the issue,
                but no matter how many Committee meetings it takes, there is a
                duty on the Committees and on the First Minister (Designate) and
                Deputy First Minister (Designate) to comply with the Assembly’s
                requirement and provide a report by the stipulated day. In
                saying that, I have no doubt made myself universally unpopular
                with colleagues in my party and in other parties who will, of
                course, indicate how much work has been done on that Committee.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Where a task has been set it must be
                fulfilled. Having said that, I support them in their desire to
                complete the job, and I hope that it will be fulfilled within
                the extended period. I want to encourage them. This is a part of
                the United Kingdom which has an elected body, and it is
                important that we play our full part. We should not — and I
                ask Members not to get to their feet on this one — become
                territorial on these matters whether we are in central
                government, regional government or local government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should not forget that our main purpose is
                to provide a service for people. If we say that we are not going
                to provide the information that people may need to do their job,
                then, ultimately, our constituents will suffer, and if Members
                of Parliament require information relating to devolved matters,
                we should not reasonably withhold it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is currently a procedure in the House
                of Commons whereby if I put down a Question, written or
                otherwise, for a Minister on a matter which might be the
                responsibility of, say, the Housing Executive, the Minister,
                although not immediately responsible, may, after speaking to the
                Chairman of the Housing Executive and obtaining the answer,
                place it in the library and thus make it available for all
                Members of Parliament.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Equally, a devolved Minister may feel that he
                is directly responsible to this Assembly — and so he or she
                would be — but if a Member of Parliament at Westminster wanted
                to have some information about a road scheme in Northern
                Ireland, it would be unreasonable for that Minister to refuse to
                tell him because he was not an Assembly Member. The answer
                should be provided through the Secretary of State, who can
                either reply directly to the Member or place the answer in the
                House of Commons’ library as a response from the Minister in
                Northern Ireland’s devolved Government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should remember that, ultimately,
                Ministers in this Assembly have a responsibility for whatever
                duties they carry out, and they should be answerable to the
                people. If somebody at Westminster feels that they have a
                pertinent question, they should have the right to ask it and get
                an answer.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am sure that we in the United&nbsp;Kingdom
                family will want to strengthen our relationship with Westminster
                and with the United&nbsp;Kingdom as a whole, rather than try to
                put a wall around our procedures here and simply say, &quot;We
                are answerable only to this Assembly and to no one else.&quot;</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs&nbsp;Nelis:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thank you, a Chathaoirligh. Part of the The
                Ad&nbsp;Hoc Committee’s terms of reference was to comment on
                the press notice that was issued by the Procedure Committee at
                Westminster. It is premature for the Ad&nbsp;Hoc Committee to
                try to address the Procedure Committee’s comments. The
                Chairman of the Ad&nbsp;Hoc Committee has said that the task of
                trying to comment on the procedural consequence of devolution
                presented great difficulties for the majority of Members. The
                Ad&nbsp;Hoc Committee was not initially in possession of all the
                necessary information. At the outset it was not in possession of
                any information at all. There were also problems due to Standing
                Orders not being completed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is perfectly understandable that the
                Ad&nbsp;Hoc Committee has not completed a report on its
                comments. The Assembly will have to take note of the procedural
                consequences when the North/South bodies are set up and the
                Assembly is directly engaged in a relationship with Dáil&nbsp;Éireann
                at Leinster&nbsp;House.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;McCartney:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;Robinson spoke about &quot;a
                report&quot;. In the words of Humpty-Dumpty, a report can be
                anything you want it to be. This report does nothing other than
                set out the problems that faced the Committee from day one.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee could have reported by any
                date. It could have submitted a report stating &quot;We have
                nothing to report&quot;. It could have said, &quot;On the basis
                of the information that is currently available to us, it is
                impossible to make a report that would in any way be relevant to
                the consideration of the matters about which we are asked to
                inquire&quot;.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was unable to attend the first two meetings
                of this Committee. Mr&nbsp;Cedric&nbsp;Wilson deputised for me.
                At the third meeting I discovered a peremptory order that a
                final report had to be delivered by today. I made it clear to
                the Committee that I would not in any circumstances lend my name
                to a final report that contained absolutely nothing of value. I
                do not criticise the members of the Committee because at this
                stage there is no reason why they should have any knowledge of
                the procedural esoterics of Select Committees and the like in
                the House of Commons. No member of the Committee, other than
                those with parliamentary experience, had, to use an Ulster
                expression, &quot;a baldie&quot; about what was going on. Such a
                situation came about because, in its press notice, the
                Westminster Procedure Committee said that it wanted our comments
                by a specific date. As a result there was minor hysteria in the
                Assembly about providing a report by that date.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A meaningful report could not be provided for
                the following reasons. First, the Northern&nbsp;Ireland
                legislation had not gone through all its stages in the Commons
                and the necessary substantial material was unavailable.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.30 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, in order to liaise and relate the
                Standing Orders of this Assembly with the procedural Standing
                Orders for the House of Commons, it would be necessary for the
                Standing Orders of the Assembly to be complete. They are far
                from complete — the Standing Orders Committee is still in
                existence.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thirdly, it would have been necessary to have
                at least the substance of the provisions that will pertain
                between the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly and
                Westminster in order to make meaningful and sensible comparisons
                between what was going to happen between Westminster and those
                bodies in circumstances not largely different from our own.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The result was that the Committee on the
                Procedural Consequences of Devolution was not in a position to
                deliver anything of substance. Therefore the Committee agreed
                that it would produce an interim report which in essence says
                &quot;We have nothing to tell you. Here, in layman’s language,
                is a list of the problems that we will address&quot;. However,
                in terms of addressing those problems or making recommendations,
                it says zilch. I doubt that there will be any significant
                improvement on the matter by November.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly should have responded to the
                House of Commons press notice by stating that it would be
                impossible to make any meaningful comments by the date
                suggested, and that when the Assembly is in a position to make
                comments, we will make them. Why was that not done? Why are we
                debating this issue today? In my submission this is filler.
                There is no reason why the Assembly’s time should be taken up
                with this motion, had it been properly addressed initially. The
                only reason it appears here is so that the public can see that
                the Assembly is doing something. The truth is that, on this
                item, it is doing virtually nothing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The real issues to be addressed are the
                democratic foundations upon which this Assembly is supposed to
                operate. Will they be democratic or will they be controlled by
                the possession of weapons by a private army supporting one of
                the parties allegedly participating in the democratic process?
                That is what we should be talking about. We should be talking
                about the circumstances in which the North/South bodies are to
                be set up, if they are to be set up. We should be talking about
                the terms in which members of the Executive are entitled to be
                members of the Executive on the basis of any democratic
                principles. Instead we are talking about an issue that should
                not be considered at this stage. If anyone had addressed it with
                any logic and common sense, he would have replied that at this
                time, there is simply not available any of the most basic and
                relevant information that would enable us to make a meaningful
                report.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The interim report is largely a non-report.
                It is time this Assembly started addressing issues of substance,
                instead of manufacturing issues such as this.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr A Maginness:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I congratulate the Chairman of the Ad Hoc
                Committee on the production of the interim report. I do not
                share the views expressed by Assembly Member, Mr&nbsp;McCartney.
                The reality is that the Committee was faced with an instruction
                from the Assembly to prepare a report within a certain time. It
                became evident that that would not be possible, but we
                endeavoured to fulfil the instruction given by the Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given the time available and the resources at
                our disposal, in terms of expert advice and assistance, I
                believe that we have produced a good and fair interim report.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report flags up in a straightforward and
                common-sense way the problems that will exist with the
                procedural consequences of devolution. It was designed
                specifically to assist and advise Members.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We decided not to rush into a definitive
                document — it would clearly have been impossible to do that
                — but in the time available it was our desire to give as many
                people as possible the benefit of the Committee’s discussions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will not repeat Mr&nbsp;McFarland’s
                meticulous and fair comments, which reflected the standard of
                his Chairmanship and the co-operation that exists on the
                Committee. I regret Mr&nbsp;McCartney’s remarks and, indeed,
                those of Mr&nbsp;Robinson, whose criticisms were petty and
                churlish and reflected poorly on the Member.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is the best interim report that could be
                produced in the time available. Members will be able to learn
                quite a lot from it and investigate further the issues that have
                been highlighted so ably by the Committee.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Furthermore, at that Committee meeting it was
                agreed — albeit in Mr&nbsp;McCartney’s absence — that
                there would be a self-denying ordinance and that the Committee’s
                Chairman would move the motion asking the Assembly to take note
                of the report.</p>

                present and that had I been, I would not have given my consent
                to any such self-denying ordinance? Furthermore, does the Member
                also agree that it was my suggestion that the report be an
                interim one and not a final one and that the relevant issues be
                set out in plain language?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr A Maginness:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not know whether Mr&nbsp;McCartney would
                or would not have consented to the Committee’s agreed line,
                but I do know that he did not remain for the full Committee
                meeting. The fact that he was absent is for Mr&nbsp;McCartney to
                explain to his party and to the Assembly. If the United Kingdom
                Unionist Party had wanted to ensure that the Committee’s
                position was not the one that it adopted, it should have been
                there to ensure that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;McCartney did raise the issue of an
                interim report, and that was easily agreed with the rest of the
                Committee. It was a common-sense proposition, and there was no
                dissent on it. We did not have to rely on Mr&nbsp;McCartney’s
                learned skills to come to that conclusion.</p>

                we should be debating – and I believe we should be debating
                them. If a motion in respect of those matters were to be put
                down, would you accept it, and could those matters be discussed
                at a future sitting?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is not a point of order as far as this
                debate is concerned. Mr&nbsp;McCartney took a degree of licence
                in regard to the breadth of his comments. As far as the specific
                question is concerned, any motion may be brought forward and
                discussed by the Committee to Advise the Presiding Officer which
                will look at the style of motions and their format. Up until now
                we have had what are called &quot;take-note debates&quot; —
                debates which are not amendable and for which the House will not
                divide.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It would be fair to say, both literally and
                metaphorically, that this is ‘Much ado about Nothing’. The
                report caused difficulties for the entire Committee. Instead of
                sniping at Committee Members, people should recognise that if a
                job is worth doing, it is worth doing well. Committee Members
                should be applauded; they are saying that the task with which
                they were charged was impossible to complete in the allotted
                time for various reasons outlined by other Members — the
                Northern Ireland Bill has not yet been completed, the Standing
                Orders are not yet completed. We were charged with an impossible
                task, but we were big enough, bold enough and man enough to
                admit that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Paragraph 11 of the interim report states</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It would be a very foolish committee that

                fall into that trap; we need more time, we have asked for more
                time, and I expect that the House will give us more time in
                order to perform such an important task. We must all fully
                accept our responsibilities and not be slipshod in the face of a
                false and inoperable deadline.</p>

                set because it is wrong for any Committee to create an elitist
                little group which keeps to itself information that should be
                presented to all Members.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I disagree with the comments made by the
                Member for North Down, Mr&nbsp;McCartney. The Assembly should
                not be used, either now or in the future, to renegotiate the
                Good Friday Agreement.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Morrice:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It has been said that the report is not
                complete and, perhaps, that we have not carried out our duties.
                It is important that the Assembly and the wider public know that
                I and other members of the Committee learned two very important
                lessons from our meetings. The first concerns Mr&nbsp;Robinson’s
                remark about not being territorial. This was vital to our work.
                We are not alone in Northern Ireland. The United&nbsp;Kingdom is
                going through an incredibly fascinating process of devolution,
                from which we must learn. We must also learn from these islands
                as a whole, from Europe and from the wider world. I am
                attempting to broaden the picture. We have examples of best
                practice in places like Spain, Belgium, Germany, America and
                Canada. We must learn from those examples and also from the
                mistakes which have been made.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second lesson concerns education, the
                learning curve that was referred to. Mr&nbsp;Close suggested
                that we should not form an elite group which gathers information
                but does not disseminate it. Openness, transparency and speaking
                plainly in a language which is understood are vital, a language
                which is understood by, as we used to say in the BBC, &quot;the
                man, the woman and the child on the Ormeau Road bus&quot;. We
                need to be understood by everyone, and that is very important.
                We do not want the report to be issued until it is complete
                because we want it to be an education for Members of the
                Assembly and everyone outside as well.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I commend the report to the Assembly.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr S Wilson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One thing that we have learnt from this
                debate is that politicians are quite touchy, but the legal
                profession is equally so, and politicians who are also members
                of the legal profession are extremely touchy. Much of this
                debate has been taken up unnecessarily by people who are
                concerned about damaged egos.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The one thing which all the Committee members
                can genuinely say is that we have done our best to complete the
                task that we were set. We have not spent time unnecessarily
                contemplating the devolution label. Many of us, when we started,
                thought that the answers to some of the questions put to us by
                the Procedures Committee of the House of Commons could be easily
                and quickly answered.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As we took evidence we found that the issues
                were much more complex, and that there were more constraints
                than we had envisaged at the outset. The Committee cannot be
                faulted for not having done its work. As a teacher I had to make
                a distinction between people who did not do their homework and
                people who did not do their homework in the way that I thought
                it should have been done. The homework has been done, but
                perhaps some Members expected a different result. To date we
                have done the task we were required to do, and the report shows
                that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We were constrained because the legislation
                is not yet complete. We were also constrained — as was pointed
                out by some of the people who gave evidence to us — by not
                having Standing Orders completed for the Assembly. That is not
                an excuse; it is a fact. As far as the Democratic Unionist Party
                is concerned — and this reflects the views of many other
                members of the Committee — the general principle is that the
                Assembly is an integral part of the governmental arrangements
                for the United&nbsp;Kingdom. We do not wish — it would not be
                possible anyway, as was pointed out to us by some of those who
                gave evidence — to make recommendations or push a line which
                would totally divorce this Assembly from the rest of government
                in the United&nbsp;Kingdom.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The House of Commons, which is the supreme
                authority on governmental arrangements within the
                United&nbsp;Kingdom, must equally have a say and responsibility,
                and its Members should be able to scrutinise and know what is
                going on in this part of the United&nbsp;Kingdom. To some extent
                we are guinea pigs, being the first regional Assembly to have
                the opportunity to make a submission on the matter; the
                Assemblies in Scotland and Wales are not yet up and running and
                therefore are not able to give evidence. That was a further
                constraint upon us — a kind of self-denying ordinance. There
                are things which may well be within the remit of the Assembly,
                but there must also be accountability at Westminster.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another important factor which we
                contemplated at great length was the fact that, whether we like
                it or not, Westminster provides most of the funding for
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland and, therefore, it will require input and
                scrutiny on how those funds are spent, even though the matter
                may be devolved to the Northern&nbsp;Ireland Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;Close perhaps sat on the fence, as is
                his wont, when the question was put to him by Mr&nbsp;Robinson.
                In the end, I believe we will produce a magnificent report; the
                input from the Committee will be of quality, and we will
                approach the task with professionalism and diligence. Of course,
                it is just possible that when the final report is presented to
                the Assembly, my party colleagues may point in derision at it,
                but I do not think that will be the case. The Committee has not
                rushed fences or produced superficial recommendations. The final
                report which this Assembly will receive will be one which will
                be of use to the Procedural Committee of the House of Commons
                and will ensure good governmental arrangements between this
                region and the rest of the United&nbsp;Kingdom.</p>

                be debating the issue of decommissioning, or whether terrorists
                should be in the Government of Northern Ireland. We would love
                to be debating those issues which concern every man, woman and
                child in Northern Ireland. However, the point is that we have
                been asked to deal with a technical matter, and we should not
                walk away from that, rather we should make the best go of it and
                ensure that the Committee brings forward a report.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unfortunately the position outlined
                repeatedly in the Committee by Mr&nbsp;Wilson is not the one
                that his party appears to have adopted today, but I am sure that
                when we go back to the Committee we will find that the position
                is not as stark as it appears.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Turning to the content of the report, I think
                it is important that a principle is established. Indeed, many
                Unionist Members have already referred to it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is Westminster’s responsibility. We
                are an integral part of the United&nbsp;Kingdom, and it is up to
                the Government to determine our relationship with the rest of
                the United&nbsp;Kingdom.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, it is fair that Westminster should
                say to the Assembly &quot;Give us your advice. Tell us how you
                would like the procedures to operate.&quot; We have an
                opportunity to have an input into the Westminster Procedure
                Committee’s thinking about how devolution and the procedures
                of devolution should operate. I look forward to conventions and
                procedures being established which do not tie and restrict
                either this body or Westminster, which are durable and flexible
                and workable and which allow this Assembly, in terms of its
                relationship with the rest of the United Kingdom, to function as
                best as is possible. It is important that we have the
                opportunity to scrutinise and, where Westminster deems us
                competent, to legislate. We must urgently establish a channel of
                communication with Westminster so that we have full access to
                information — for example, draft European legislation — and
                that we are able to give advice from a Northern Ireland
                perspective. I ask the Assembly to let us go back into Committee
                and prepare a more comprehensive report by 6 November which
                makes our views clear.</p>

                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr Ian Paisley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion was originally in the name of my
                deputy, Mr&nbsp;Robinson. As there are few farmers in East
                Belfast, I am taking it over for the farmers of North Antrim and
                elsewhere. I became uneasy when my colleague,
                Mr&nbsp;Sammy&nbsp;Wilson, also from East Belfast, spoke about
                guinea pigs. There are no guineas in the pig industry. It is in
                serious crisis, and it is right that public representatives
                should have this opportunity to express their views on the
                serious situation in farming.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The industry is important. It employs about
                4,000 people, has 1,800 producers and 2,200 processors and is
                worth approximately £200&nbsp;million to the
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland economy. Those who know the pig industry
                knows that its fortunes rise and fall, but this could be its
                final fall, and Northern&nbsp;Ireland could be left with no
                viable pig industry. When some Members of the Assembly met the
                Minister, Lord&nbsp;Dubs, they put just one question to him.
                They asked, &quot;Do you want a viable pig industry in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland or are you prepared to preside over its
                demise?&quot; The pig industry is not on the road to recovery.
                We face its demise, and we had better wake up to that hard,
                terrifying fact.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The pig industry had the fire at the factory
                in Ballymoney, and that was a terrible blow. Forty per cent of
                the killing and curing power was taken out of the industry. Such
                a blow in any industry would have been seen as an emergency in
                any other part, not only of the United&nbsp;Kingdom but of the
                whole of Europe. Yet our Government, and those who sit farther
                down the road from us in this very estate, did not think it was
                an emergency. They did not go immediately to Europe and say that
                40% of our industry had been destroyed. We expect them to do for
                us what has been done in Germany, in France, in Spain and in
                Italy in such situations. The Government have never acknowledged
                this to be an emergency situation. In fact, wearing the hat of a
                Member of the European Parliament, I approached the Government
                and asked what approaches they were making to Europe. They
                replied that they were making no approaches to Europe because
                there is no money in Europe for this.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I then went to Europe. I talked to Mr&nbsp;Fischler,
                the Commissioner, and he said that there is money in Europe.
                This is an emergency, but the United&nbsp;Kingdom Government
                have made no application for help. So I went back and they said
                they would consider the matter. After considering the matter
                they decided that they were not going to make an application.
                However, there will be a debate in the European Parliament this
                week on the pig industry and its tragedies, and I welcome that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The United Kingdom Government, the Secretary
                of State and our Ministers should have been on the ball to get
                from Europe not charity but something that we have paid for.
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland, according to the Exchequer at
                Westminster, has never got out of Europe what we have paid in
                per head of our population while the United&nbsp;Kingdom has
                been a member. It is all right for the Irish Republic to get £6
                million a day, but we have never got out what we have paid in.
                The Government have not been faithful stewards of the pig
                industry, and for that I castigate them.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCartney:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Paisley has said that killing and
                processing have been reduced by 40% owing to the fire at Lovell
                &amp; Christmas in Ballymoney. Is he aware that the remaining
                60% capacity is increasingly being taken up by the processing of
                pigs imported from the Republic of Ireland?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr Ian Paisley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was about to come to that. I am very glad
                that things from the South can be slain in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland, but our pigs should have priority.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I come now to the very important matter of
                pricing. It is very important. In the basement cafeteria here I
                asked for a sausage and was told that it cost 35p. I then asked
                for a slice of bacon to go round the sausage, and that was
                another 30p — 65p for one sausage and one slice of bacon. Look
                at the prices the farmers are getting for their pigs. Why is it,
                with the drastic fall in the price to the farmer, that the
                housekeeper and the buyer in the shops are getting nothing? In
                fact, it seems that the prices of pork and bacon are rising, not
                falling.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the week that commenced
                20&nbsp;June&nbsp;1998, around the time of the fire, the price
                was 85p per kilo. During the next two weeks Maltons had no pigs
                taken in, but in the week that commenced 6&nbsp;July&nbsp;1998
                it shipped its first pigs to England at 85p per kilo. During the
                next week it shipped again, and the price dropped to 78p per
                kilo. No pigs were moved during the next week, but in the week
                that commenced 27&nbsp;July&nbsp;1998, the price dropped to 60p
                per kilo. No pigs were moved during the week after that, and
                during the following week the price dropped to 50p per kilo.
                These are drastic cuts in price.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The farmers waited impatiently — and
                rightly so — for Maltons to make a decision. There were lots
                of negotiations, which I will not go into today, and I am aware
                of them all but the Industrial Development Board paid a large
                subsidy to buy Wilsons, the Unipork people, and make the deal
                with Maltons. I must pay tribute to Lord&nbsp;Dubs and the
                Industrial Development Board because a lot of money was paid for
                this. Wilsons changed hands and did very well out of the deal
                — Mr&nbsp;Wilson got all his debts paid, and £10 million into
                his hand as well. He nearly did as well as he has done out of
                mushrooms, but that is a story for another day.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We all thought that the first priority in
                Cookstown would be to kill Northern Ireland pigs. What has
                happened? Northern Ireland pigs have been killed, but more pigs
                from the South have been killed in Cookstown than ever before. A
                backlog of pigs is now rising. Somewhere in the region of 20,000
                pigs are waiting to be slaughtered. If that figure rises to
                40,000, where will the pig industry be? We, as public
                representatives, have a duty to make known our alarm about what
                is taking place. There are no two arguments to this.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These are facts, and facts are stubborn
                things. I cannot give names, but I have studied these figures
                very carefully. Producer A, since the fire, has been able to
                ship just 28% of his pigs. All Members, even those who have no
                experience of farming, will know that pigs have to be fed. And,
                of course, if the pigs get too fat, the farmer will not benefit
                from all the meal that he has bought. In fact, the pigs become a
                liability. That is the tragedy. Producer B has shipped 39% of
                his pigs, while producer C has shipped only 30%.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important to remember that the farmers
                have to wait 12 days before getting a penny in payment. There is
                no cash flow in the pig industry today. These people have their
                backs against the wall. Indeed, some of them have contemplated
                suicide. That is a fact. They have had to be counselled. Why?
                Because people in the pig industry always had a cash flow and
                worked hard to make their industry viable. Now they cannot meet
                the feed bills. I understand that around £40 million is owed to
                the millers at present.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What have public representatives done?
                Assembly Members have met all the bankers, together with the
                Secretary of the Northern Ireland Banks Association. We have
                talked to them. We have pleaded with them to ease their pressure
                on farmers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They told us that they had difficulties, but
                we said that banks did not go bankrupt. They are all in the
                money. They boast of making millions of pounds every year but
                farmers are going bankrupt. The banking sector has a
                responsibility.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have also talked to the Department of
                Agriculture for Northern Ireland. Last weekend, we put pressure
                on it again about the slaughtering of pigs that had been raised
                in the Republic of Ireland. I was at a meeting at which the
                Social Democratic and Labour Party Member for Mid Ulster,
                Mr&nbsp;Haughey, proposed that pigs be sent to a factory across
                the border to be slaughtered. Instead of that, pigs from the
                South are being brought up to Cookstown to be slaughtered, thus
                preventing the slaughter of pigs that have been reared in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Government must face their
                responsibilities. This is an ongoing crisis. The backlog that is
                starting in the pig industry will increase and, as it increases,
                farmers and pig men will go to the wall.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I know that I speak for all those who have
                the interests of agriculture at heart when I say that the
                Government must not allow this industry to go to the wall. How
                can the Industrial Development Board justify using taxpayers’
                money to finance Maltons without first purchasing all
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland pigs, before topping up with Southern
                pigs? Is it for financial reasons? Are their commercial
                requirements more important than the preservation of a viable
                industry in Northern&nbsp;Ireland? It is annoying that Southern
                pigs are being killed in Cookstown, and it is totally
                unacceptable that the price paid for Southern pigs is
                approximately 10p per kilo more than for Northern&nbsp;Ireland
                pigs. That averages out at £7 per pig. That means that our
                farmers are losing £7 per pig in a factory that is financed by
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland taxpayers, and that should not be. The
                House needs to make its presence felt on this matter.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most North Antrim Members are here today, and
                the House will hear a great deal from us on the subject of pigs
                because the Agivey bacon factory is an important employer in our
                constituency. It was with some relief that we heard of the
                acquisition of Unipork by Unigate although, as Dr&nbsp;Paisley
                has ably pointed out, there seems to be a little more to it than
                meets the eye. By investing £27 million in the takeover, that
                firm is showing confidence in the future of the pig industry in
                the area. It remains to be seen whose pigs it will put through
                the factory.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have to focus on the conduct of the
                Government and their attitude towards the structure of the pig
                industry: the unilateral legislation that forced our pig
                producers to get rid of the stall-and-tether method of keeping
                sows; the range of health and hygiene requirements placed on the
                rearing, slaughter and processing of pigs, which added
                considerably to the cost of producing pork products.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I stress the word &quot;unilaterally&quot;
                because the same measures have not been applied elsewhere in
                Europe. In the future that may mean that United&nbsp;Kingdom
                pork produced to the standards required by regulation will set
                the benchmark price.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the moment pork producers elsewhere in
                Europe are not applying the same standards and are supplying
                pork to the pig-meat industry in the United&nbsp;Kingdom. This
                is yet another area where the United Kingdom, by assiduously
                applying regulation, has disadvantaged its own producers to the
                benefit of those in the rest of Europe.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This has coincided with a period when both
                the pound and the green pound, which sets our prices, are
                particularly strong. It has coincided with a period when pig
                production has risen by 10% over the previous year and, worse
                still, with a drop in the demand for pig products due to the
                financial crisis in Russia and parts of South-East Asia.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is the situation that industry dreads.
                It has increased production; its production costs have gone up;
                and its market has been reduced by factors beyond its control
                and which it could not have foreseen.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These problems apply equally on the mainland.
                The difference in Northern&nbsp;Ireland is that we have come
                face-to-face with the problem sooner. Due to the loss of the
                Agivey bacon factory the build-up of pigs on
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland farms was much more rapid.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is almost inconceivable that the
                Government can be so lacklustre in their approach to this
                problem. Any of these factors, if applied to some other
                industry, would have caused an equally serious problem.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The problem of a strong pound is universal.
                The whole of British industry is complaining about it. Other
                industries have lost part of their market due to financial
                problems elsewhere in the world. However, the pig industry has
                to face every one of these problems and in its case the only
                person who is losing money is the farmer. The loss is not being
                shared the whole way up the production chain. I feel that the
                Assembly should give careful consideration to the profit margins
                of the retailers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the most unfair aspects of the pig
                crisis is that the best producers are the ones who are being
                burdened with the greatest debts. They were the producers who
                acted most promptly to take on board the new regulations, who
                accumulated debts to produce a better pig which would comply
                with the regulations due to take effect by the end of the year.
                They have invested in a pig industry which now has a distinctly
                reduced market.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is not the first time that there has
                been difficulty in the pig industry. From time to time in the
                farming industry, there are periods of overproduction, lost
                markets and reduced profit margins.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is the first time that so many parts of
                the agriculture industry are suffering from variations on the
                same problem. It is also peculiar how, just as only the pig
                farmer is losing money in this crisis, only the beef farmer is
                suffering from BSE. The meat processors are not having any
                difficulty at all. The Department, therefore, has an immediate
                responsibility to address this issue and, furthermore, being the
                custodian of the industry, it must look to the future. It would
                be daft to address this problem only for it to recur in a short
                time. We must be sure that we have a viable and sustainable
                industry for the future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since it invested so heavily in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland, Unigate clearly believes that we have the
                highest standards of health, hygiene, pig production and pig
                processing available. These are essential to the future of the
                food business and, in due course, pork produced in the
                United&nbsp;Kingdom will set the benchmark and be the premium
                product. If we cannot get immediate action to address the acute
                financial problems of the pig producers or solve the problem of
                disposing of live pigs, that future — which may well be right,
                may well be rosy — will never come for many of our pig
                farmers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have a long history of successful pig
                production in Northern&nbsp;Ireland, and pig producers have
                coped with tight margins, with loss-making situations, with blue
                ear disease and with swine vesicular disease and have come
                through them all. We have a very high standard of pig husbandry
                in Northern&nbsp;Ireland. It would be an absolute disgrace if
                all that were to be thrown away by a lack of action now.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion. Although I cannot
                always support what Dr&nbsp;Ian&nbsp;Paisley says, I am very
                glad to do so on this occasion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I regret that the motion is not more
                inclusive, for the entire agriculture industry is in crisis —
                the worst crisis in recent times. A two-hour debate is not
                sufficient to deal with the problems of the pig industry, and is
                certainly not sufficient to deal with the problems of
                agriculture as a whole. The Assembly has a duty to look at that
                whole matter and to look at it very urgently.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need at least one full day to debate the
                crisis in agriculture which is affecting our economy so
                drastically. Mr&nbsp;Initial Presiding Officer, can you advise
                us on how we might best make arrangements for such a full day’s
                debate? Can you also advise on how we could arrange for the
                House to hear evidence from the Ulster Farmers’ Union, the
                Northern Ireland Agricultural Producers’ Association and other
                relevant bodies? The crisis is one of monumental proportions,
                and the Assembly has a duty to deal with its effects and the
                impact of it on the community as a whole.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I further propose — this could be dealt
                with through the usual channels — that, having had a full day’s
                debate on the agriculture industry and having taken evidence
                from the farmers’ representative bodies and others, we take an
                all-party delegation to meet the Secretary of State for
                Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to try to impress upon him the
                size of the disaster facing the industry and the serious
                implications which that will have for the whole of our economy
                and for rural society in particular.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I apologise for interrupting Mr&nbsp;Haughey’s
                flow and endorse everything he has said. Does the Member agree
                that the appropriate Committee to take such evidence would be
                the Committee to be set up to scrutinise the work of the
                Department of Agriculture and that that highlights the necessity
                of assigning the Committee portfolios even while the Assembly is
                in shadow mode? If the Assembly is going to get into full gear,
                these portfolios should be assigned as soon as possible.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Haughey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I take the Member’s point entirely; he is
                right. However, I do not wish to overlay the discussion of this
                extremely serious matter with a political distraction which we
                will have to settle at another time and in another way. There
                are urgent issues facing us as a community —issues which need
                to be addressed in a structured way — and the sooner we get on
                with doing that the better.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I accept that the pig industry is a special
                and an extremely urgent case. There is a crisis — not just
                here but all over Europe. There is a glut of pigmeat in the
                European Union, but I will not go into how that came to be now.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A glut of pig meat means a serious problem
                for pig-meat producers because prices fall. That, in turn, is
                exacerbated by the current absurdly high value of sterling which
                makes it extremely difficult to clear that glut of pig meat by
                exporting it outside the United&nbsp;Kingdom and
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland. That crisis, exacerbated by the sterling
                problem, has been turned into a disaster for the pig industry
                following the fire at Agivey. The situation is urgent, and
                special measures are needed to deal with it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have pointed out to the Minister and to
                others responsible that agri-monetary compensation is available
                from the European&nbsp;Union at the request of the relevant
                Minister. That funding could be used to alleviate the crisis
                facing the pig industry, but it has not been requested. And the
                reason it has not been requested is the operation of the
                so-called Fontainebleau Agreement — a mechanism under which
                the former Prime Minister, Madam&nbsp;Thatcher, secured a rebate
                on the United&nbsp;Kingdom’s net input into the European
                budget.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I disagree with Dr Paisley on one matter. The
                United&nbsp;Kingdom’s so-called net input into the European
                Union does not come out of British taxpayers’ pockets. It
                comes about by virtue of the fact that the United&nbsp;Kingdom,
                unlike other European Union member states, continues to convert
                a disproportionate element of its trade outside the European
                Union, therefore the Customs and Excise duties collected on
                goods coming into the United&nbsp;Kingdom — many of them in
                transit to other European Union member states — go into the
                European Union budget as its own resources. So when
                Madam&nbsp;Thatcher thumped the table and demanded the return of
                her money, it was not her money and it was not coming out of
                European taxpayers’ pockets.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Agro-monetary compensation is available, but
                the British Government have not asked for it, because under the
                Fontainebleau Agreement, it would not make financial sense to do
                so. But it makes good financial sense and this is a matter that
                the Assembly should press with the British Government and with
                the Secretary of State for Agriculture.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need to concentrate on the immediate need
                to increase the slaughter capacity available. Dr&nbsp;Paisley
                referred to a suggestion that I made in a previous meeting that
                there was spare slaughter capacity available just south of the
                Border. I have been in touch with the proprietor of the plant in
                question, and he is prepared to talk to Maltons, and I have also
                been in touch with Maltons to urge them to have discussions with
                him. I hope that they have already contacted each other and that
                there may be action on that front.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have also been in touch with the Department
                of Agriculture in Kildare&nbsp;Street, and I have discovered
                that the plant in question was inspected recently and was passed
                for immediate production, so all that is required is a business
                understanding between Maltons and the proprietor. I intend to
                continue to pursue that matter.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If there is not an increase in slaughter
                capacity within a couple of weeks, as Dr&nbsp;Paisley has
                correctly said, there will be an unmanageable amount of pig meat
                on farms with the consequent pressure on farmers. That must be
                cleared because, for three to four months, it will not be
                possible for Maltons to expand slaughter capacity at the
                Cookstown plant that it has taken over. One obvious way to
                provide for that three- to four-month period would be for
                Maltons to take a short-term lease on the plant that is
                available just south of the border. That would meet the
                immediate need.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The European Union has a duty to address the
                crisis in the pig industry throughout Europe. It is not good
                enough for Commissioner&nbsp;Fischler to say that the problems
                must be resolved by market forces. As other Members have said,
                if market forces are allowed to reign, there will be
                bankruptcies by the hundred. Our pig-meat industry will
                collapse. Not bringing production into balance with consumption,
                but rather losing capacity, will almost certainly mean a
                shortfall in pig-meat production in the foreseeable future, with
                consequent imports from outside the European Union. We cannot
                and should not contemplate such a future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Pig-meat production has to be reduced
                rationally in a way that preserves our capacity to provide the
                quantity that we need. I have written to Commissioner&nbsp;Fischler
                within the last few weeks with a proposal along those lines.
                However, I understand that the Commission is not willing to
                commit huge sums to support the pig industry because that might
                lead to difficulties with other product sectors. Pig-meat
                production can be managed downwards by the imposition of weight
                limits at slaughter and by quotas; that will not require huge
                sums. I have written to the Commissioner urging him to adopt
                those suggestions, but I have had no reply.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I respect what was said at the start of the
                debate, that we need at least one full day to debate the crisis
                in agriculture. We need to be able to take evidence from the
                relevant bodies to equip a delegation to meet the Minister for
                Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to impress upon him the
                seriousness of the crisis in agriculture in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland and the consequences for our whole
                economy.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Initial Presiding Officer:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Three specific questions were put to me in
                terms of a ruling. There is no technical reason why we should
                not have a full day’s debate on agriculture. That is a matter
                for discussion through the usual channels, and I shall certainly
                ensure that the matter is raised and discussed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, I was asked about holding a
                hearing. As Mr&nbsp;McCartney correctly said, the proper forum
                would be one of the scrutiny Committees. We do not currently
                have such a Committee and the tenor of the remarks suggested
                some urgency, which may mean that the matter ought not to be
                left to that. However, that leaves us with a technical dilemma
                as to how it can properly be achieved. I shall explore the
                various possibilities to see whether agreement can be reached
                through the usual channels, on how the matter might be
                addressed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The third question was about an all-party
                delegation. That is entirely a matter for the parties. It is not
                a matter for me, and it should be taken up between the parties
                at whatever level is deemed to be appropriate.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We can see that three rather experienced
                politicians have come up with three very reasonable ways of
                proceeding, and there may indeed be other ways. This
                demonstrates how, if the will is there, the means can be found.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will ensure that the matter is discussed
                through the usual channels and hope that an agreement can be
                reached. It is clear from the remarks made by Members across the

                subject to the farming community and their financial plight, may
                I suggest that the party Whips get together. They should be able

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is clear what the will of the Assembly is

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Molloy:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A Chathaoirligh, may I thank Dr&nbsp;Paisley,
                the Member for North Antrim, for providing us with the
                opportunity to raise this matter. There is a crisis not only in
                the pig industry but in agriculture generally throughout the Six
                Counties.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Farmers are wondering whether this is a
                deliberate policy by the British Government and the European
                Union simply to wind up the agriculture industry here. We seem
                to go from one crisis to another, and no attempt is made by
                either the British Government or the European Union to resolve
                them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have had the BSE crisis and the attempts
                to resolve that crisis involved isolating beef produced here
                from that of British beef. Remember this is different — it is
                reared and looked after in this country. As Dr&nbsp;Paisley has
                said, the strip of water between us is all that separates the
                two standards. We need to recognise that the beef and pork
                produced here have probably been of a higher standard than that
                in the rest of Europe.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now we have the decline of the pig industry,
                which is a major crisis for pig producers, and for the small
                farmers in particular. For years they have survived on mixed
                farming, producing beef cattle, sheep, pigs and poultry. Every
                part of this industry has been affected by scares of different
                kinds. Why do we have these scares? Sometimes there is little
                fact to support or substantiate the claims that are made.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A lot of blame has been attached to the fire
                at the Ballymoney plant, and that did reduce the killing and
                curing capacity. But that in itself has not created the crisis.
                There have been many different reasons, but I would like to
                concentrate on the packaging of bacon and pork products in the
                Six Counties. Time and again we see pig products on the shelves
                labelled &quot;Processed in Northern&nbsp;Ireland&quot;, but
                that does not tell us the source of those products. Many of them
                come from Denmark and other Scandinavian countries.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.45 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is confusion with regard to packaging.
                Source needs to be clearly identified so that customers may be
                assured that they are supporting the local industry.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The crisis is a result of the absence of an
                overall agriculture policy. The Six Counties has been linked to
                Britain industrially but has lost out on the agricultural side,
                as Dr&nbsp;Paisley has said, whereas for years the South of
                Ireland has benefited from European funding.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need a co-ordinated agriculture policy in
                Ireland. It is important that we speedily move to set up
                appropriate Departments, the scrutiny Committees and, most
                important of all, a North/South body to bring about an
                all-Ireland agriculture policy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What is the point in blaming Ministers who
                have other responsibilities? We need to move speedily to the
                appointment of a Minister who can demonstrate to the Assembly
                that he is doing all in his power to ensure that, for example,
                the pig industry prospers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Undoubtedly we need support from the European
                Union.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have heard today how all aspects of the
                pig industry in the North and in the South are linked. I welcome
                the news that throughout Ireland there is growing co-operation
                in all aspects of farming — not excluding the unions. We have
                an opportunity to help. We should not sidestep the issue but
                should set up appropriate Ad&nbsp;Hoc Committees with power to
                scrutinise and to plan for the future. Let us stop moving from
                one crisis to another.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should move speedily to set up an
                Executive that is responsible for a Ministry of Agriculture and
                will lead to the establishment of a North/South body. It is
                important that this Assembly have powers of control and
                scrutiny.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have an opportunity today to speak with a
                united voice in support of the pig industry and to show that we
                are concerned. Meetings are all very fine, but we need to move
                speedily to practical issues. We must use practical means to
                deal with the crisis.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ford:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Like Mr&nbsp;Haughey, I welcome this debate,
                but not the motion’s exclusion of certain matters. There is a
                crisis in the pig industry, but this is not the only sector of
                agriculture which is suffering. For example, lamb producers in
                Great&nbsp;Britain are getting even worse prices than those in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland. In the case of beef, there is no doubt
                that flagged suckler herds in Northern&nbsp;Ireland had their
                chances in the certified herd scheme sacrificed so that others
                could make progress, albeit slowly. Producers are still waiting
                for their 1997 compensation while we discuss problems that have
                arisen in 1998.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are many problems throughout
                agriculture, but we have a major crisis in the pig industry,
                which requires not just a debate but action.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A number of factors have been highlighted by
                Members. The strength of sterling is a fundamental problem for
                all of British industry, whether agricultural or manufacturing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are economic problems in Russia and the
                Far East which are beyond the capacity of this House to solve.
                There is over-production across Europe, and action is required
                at European level. The fire did not help the situation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Government must take action. We need to
                move on to the point where we take responsibility, but all we
                can do at this stage is put pressure on others. The pressure
                which is being applied by farmers’ representatives, with the
                support of people from every part of the House, has helped to
                make a difference. It has put pressure on Lord&nbsp;Dubs in
                particular, but it has also shown how difficult the problems are
                to resolve.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We met Lord&nbsp;Dubs just after the initial
                proposal for the welfare scheme&nbsp;—&nbsp;it was proposed
                that under the scheme pigs would be removed from the food chain
                at nil compensation&nbsp;—&nbsp;and forced him to produce a
                fairly minimal amount of compensation. At the meeting
                Mr&nbsp;Small, the Permanent Secretary for the Department of
                Agriculture, said that he would have to satisfy the Government
                and the European Commission to get them to agree and then find
                the money from somewhere.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We all hope that in a few months we will have
                the power to decide on agriculture here. I do not know how much
                we will be able to do in co-operation with our neighbours down
                the road. We will still have to go through the British
                Government when we go to Europe.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, having power solves only the first
                problem. We will still have to satisfy Europe and come up with
                the money from somewhere. The short-term aid provided by the
                Government was a minimal financial payment which was dressed up
                as a welfare scheme to ensure that it met the European criteria.
                Unfortunately, it was a one-off scheme and the difficulties
                continue. We need to press for the reintroduction of that scheme
                to take away the surplus pigs that we still have.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Haughey highlighted the issue of the green
                pound. One of the reasons for every part of agriculture
                suffering is that the Government have refused to make any
                application for agri-monetary compensation. We, as a united
                Assembly, should be putting pressure on them, because that is
                something which would benefit every sector.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was pleasant to see the direct action
                taken by many of the producers to highlight issues such as
                sourcing of meat, the way in which retailers have been buying
                elsewhere and the prices which consumers have had to face. Many
                customers are going into shops&nbsp;—&nbsp;and it is not just
                the farmers’ wives&nbsp;—&nbsp;and looking at the labels to
                see where food is coming from. This, and our standards, are to
                be welcomed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should also be asking why the consumer is
                paying as much as he was paying three months ago while the
                farmers are receiving virtually nothing. It is a long time since
                I studied economics, but that does not sound like a free market
                to me.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Northern Ireland we have high standards,
                the highest in Europe&nbsp;—&nbsp;quite possibly the highest
                in the world in a number of areas&nbsp;—&nbsp;in food quality,
                health and animal welfare. We should not be seeking to reduce
                those standards, but to maintain them, and we should be ensuring
                that people are aware of them. During the next century this is
                what the consumer is going to demand. It will not be a matter of
                cheap food but of quality food. If we take this crisis as an
                opportunity to publicise our standards it may help us; if we
                take it as a reason for reducing our standards we may destroy
                our long-term viability. There are signs at Westminster that the
                creation of a Food Standards Agency for the United&nbsp;Kingdom
                has been put on the back burner. That is something that the
                Assembly, when it gets its full power, should take up for the
                benefit of our consumers and producers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is vital that consumers get the
                information to make an informed, fair choice from what is
                available. If we are going to work to alleviate this crisis, we
                must also prepare for the future to ensure that there is
                long-term viability for every sector of agriculture.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr R Hutchinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All Members agree that farmers in general and
                pig farmers in particular are in a state of crisis.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As we consider their plight it is worth
                remembering that we are speaking of people who have worked hard
                to set up their businesses and who, over the years, have
                provided not only employment but also a service to the people of
                Northern Ireland. An industry that employs approximately 4,000
                people and is worth around £200&nbsp;million to the economy of
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland deserves immediate help from the
                Government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are some 65,000 sows in the Province,
                producing some 25,000 pigs for slaughter each week. On
                28&nbsp;August&nbsp;1998 the Government provided some help with
                the announcement of the pig welfare slaughter scheme to cull
                overweight pigs. Compensation of £30 per pig was payable and
                applications for some 27,000 pigs were made, of which 15,000
                were presented for slaughtering. That is now complete and most
                of the payments have been made. To its credit, the Ulster Pork
                and Bacon Forum provided a top-up payment of £3 per pig to
                encourage people to enter pigs under this scheme.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have all heard about Maltons which
                recently took over the Unipork processing plant at Cookstown.
                Many farmers had hoped that this would result in slaughtering
                increasing a little more quickly. However, because the plant has
                limited chill facilities it cannot increase slaughtering numbers
                until new facilities can be built. In the meantime Maltons
                continued to ship pigs to England, agreeing to take some 4,000
                pigs per week, but the number actually shipped is considerably
                less. Farmers are very unhappy with the way they have been
                treated by Maltons and unless something is done there will be a
                second backlog of pigs building up when it was hoped that the
                slaughter scheme and Unipork takeover would help to stabilise
                the market.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Pig prices have shown no sign of improvement
                and farmers continue to make a large loss on every pig. For
                example, in September&nbsp;1997 the loss was £7·08, but by
                August&nbsp;1998 it was £17·03. No producer can sustain that
                level of loss without it having a severe effect on his business.
                Aids to private storage were introduced on 28&nbsp;September.
                Farmers welcomed this but its effect will be limited as the meat
                must be exported outside the European&nbsp;Union when it comes
                out of storage. In addition to the strength of sterling,
                oversupply problems and the ever increasing specifications
                required by supermarkets, pig farmers in the Province are
                disadvantaged for other reasons.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, the rigid implementation of welfare
                regulations such as the stall and tether ban. The ban will come
                into effect in the United&nbsp;Kingdom on
                1&nbsp;January&nbsp;1999 and will require pigs to be kept in
                loose housing systems. Many farmers have not yet been able to
                build new loose-house systems because they cannot afford to do
                so; the money is not there for them to convert facilities.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.00 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">By contrast, the European Union — including
                the Republic of Ireland — banned only tethers and no mention
                has been made of stalls.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, feed costs are approximately £10
                per tonne higher here than in England, due largely to transport
                costs. This is roughly equivalent to £2·50 per pig. There is
                no subsidy on that at all, and no cheap long-term loans as in
                France or Germany. No grant aid is available for modernising, as
                it would be in the Republic of Ireland. Northern&nbsp;Ireland
                has poor Aujesky’s disease status, but any eradication
                programme would have to be for the whole island of Ireland: the
                Republic of Ireland has not reciprocated.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Meat-and-bone meal cannot be fed to pigs in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland. It is not suggested that MBM should be
                legal in Northern&nbsp;Ireland, but imported pork from animals
                that have been fed on MBM, and therefore produced at reduced
                cost, is becoming increasingly common in our supermarkets. That
                needs to be looked into.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are ways in which our industry can be
                helped. Pressure should be put on Maltons to ensure that there
                is no further backlog. That can be done by rapidly increasing
                exports to England. That company is responsible for the majority
                of the slaughter capacity in Northern&nbsp;Ireland. As my party
                leader has said, sourcing policies at Cookstown need to be
                examined. Maltons should be encouraged to take more pigs from
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland in preference to pigs from the Irish
                Republic. Co-operation within the industry should be encouraged,
                possibly with financial assistance. A recent report by the
                Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food on the
                competitiveness of the United&nbsp;Kingdom pig industry pointed
                to the lack of co-operative producers’ groups as a major
                weakness.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Processors must pay a realistic price that
                covers the cost of production. There should be grant aid for
                modernising and a common-sense approach to the implementation of
                legislation. Producers should be able to average their returns
                over a five-year period for tax purposes. Long-term low interest
                rates would help, as would better access to education and
                training. There is currently a shortage of skilled labour.
                Transport assistance for grain from the United&nbsp;Kingdom is
                another option. Unless drastic action is taken on the pig
                industry, many homes in the Province will be in danger of
                falling apart; I would urge the Government to take the steps
                that are necessary to help our pig farmers.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Douglas:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Farming in Northern&nbsp;Ireland is in
                decline, mainly because of the strength of the pound and the BSE
                crisis. The situation has been exacerbated by the failure of the
                British Government to take up the monetary compensation that has
                been made available in eight other European Union countries.
                Although much reference has been made to the European Union, it
                falls to the United&nbsp;Kingdom Government to obtain that money
                for our farmers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The pig industry is part of an industry that
                is in oversupply not only in Europe but in the world, to the
                tune of 10%. While that continues, many difficulties lie ahead
                for Northern&nbsp;Ireland producers. The fire in mid-June at the
                Lovell &amp; Christmas factory could not have happened at a more
                difficult time for pig producers. Before the fire, Maltons had
                been processing up to 15,000 pigs a week. After the fire, that
                fell to 2,200, and although it had promised that a further 4,500
                pigs per week would be transported to England, that never
                transpired.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After much lobbying from the Ulster Farmers’
                Union, political leaders and devastated farmers, the Government
                helped to alleviate the desperate oversupply on farms. This was
                mainly because of the welfare issue&nbsp;—&nbsp;there was
                little consideration for the welfare of the farmers themselves.
                The buy-out scheme – at approximately £30 per pig – still
                left farmers losing in the region of £30 as it takes
                approximately £60 to cover all production costs, including
                overheads.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Because of the very serious crisis during the
                last months, the Government, through the IDB, have helped
                facilitate Maltons to purchase the factory in Cookstown in the
                hope that a new factory can be built within two years to cater
                for pig processing in Northern&nbsp;Ireland. At the present time
                Maltons is paying only £31 per pig at slaughter in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland, while in Great&nbsp;Britain the price is
                in the region of £45 per pig. This payment is to pig producers
                who are applying the same code of practice as their counterparts
                across the water, hardly what one would call a level playing
                field. Maltons is currently processing a substantial number of
                pigs from south of the border, when we are still in oversupply.
                As a substantial amount of taxpayers’ money has been used
                through the IDB, pressure should be brought to bear by the
                Government on Maltons to pay producers at least on a par with
                their counterparts in the remainder of the United&nbsp;Kingdom
                and to source all their pigs in Northern&nbsp;Ireland while we
                have this oversupply.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The other two processing plants in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland are paying a higher price per pig at
                present, and surely this disparity needs to be addressed. At
                Cookstown on Saturday, weaned pigs were being sold for £2 each.
                Before this crisis these pigs were making between £18 and £20.
                At this level, each sow will lose about £100 per litter. If the
                depressed situation continues — and there is no better outlook
                in the near future&nbsp;—&nbsp;many producers will be selling
                their pigs to cut their losses. Surely this cannot be allowed to
                continue. If some further steps are not taken to help producers
                through the next few years, most of our 1,800 producers will not
                survive&nbsp;—&nbsp;certainly not at an economic level.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I urge the Government to take further steps
                to help farmers, especially in the pig sector, to set up
                structures to ensure that our producers, in future, have an
                organised market to enable them to compete on a level playing
                field. Unless immediate steps are taken to stop the decline of
                the pig industry, there will be further depletion of the rural
                population, which will have serious implications for the country
                as a whole.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support this motion.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms McWilliams:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rural development, as much as urban
                development, is the concern of every Member in the Chamber, and
                we have heard today about the serious crisis in the pig
                industry. We have heard from other Members what the problems are
                and so I will be brief in making some suggestions for action.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Douglas described the problems facing
                those who are rearing pigs and told us that producers are
                getting £2 for each weaned pig at the Cookstown market. That
                really does signify a total collapse in that market.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have also heard about the problems facing
                the pig processing industry. It seems from recent articles in
                the ‘Farm Trader’ that the industry has had a pre-tax loss
                every year since 1991, ranging between £4 million and £7·6
                million a year&nbsp;—&nbsp;there is not much profit to be made
                in processing either — and we have a crisis on both sides of
                the industry. I heard Robert&nbsp;Overend on Radio Ulster this
                morning saying that he is a farmer and asking where the trading
                margins are for pig producers. He also asked &quot;What happens
                when the little pig goes to market?&quot; We really need to know
                the answers to those questions to enable us to find long-term
                solutions to the problems as well as short-term ones, and I am
                thinking about the surplus that exists at present and the call
                for action on it. Bob&nbsp;McCartney is right: the sooner we get
                the Executive and the scrutiny Committee for agriculture in
                place, the sooner we can look at both the short-term and
                long-term problems.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Something must be done about the fact that
                these pigs are still on the farms. There is a huge surplus and
                this is a major crisis, not just for animal welfare, but for
                farmers’ incomes. As Dr&nbsp;Paisley pointed out, many of
                these farmers are in such a psychological state that some have
                recently committed suicide — and the number is rising.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also take Mr&nbsp;Ford’s point that there
                is no contradiction between having good food safety and good
                food production. The debate has often been between the producers
                and the consumers, and many of the regulations that have been
                introduced have somehow been pointed to as being part of the
                problem. I do not see it like that. The suggestion I am making
                is one that John&nbsp;Simpson made recently in ‘Farm Trader’.
                It points to the European Union and, as the United Kingdom
                Unionist Party Member pointed out earlier, to some assistance in
                relation to the materials that are being transported. The
                European Union has a provision that could allow some assistance
                towards the transportation of surplus pigs to other outlets.
                Several Members referred to the fact that the outlets in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland are not dealing with them — either
                because of the Republic of Ireland’s pigs or because they do
                not currently have the capacity.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After the fire, pigs were transported to
                England, but the shipments were not large enough, and because
                the farmers were not getting enough assistance, they stopped, as
                there was nothing in it for them. Within the European Union
                there is a provision that allows assistance, particularly for
                transport aid, to trade from peripheral regions. This has been
                accepted elsewhere, and it seems to me that
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland is a peripheral region and should be
                making use of some of this transport aid to deal with the
                current surplus. If aid were made available, we might be able to
                deal with some of the short-term problems, so incentive schemes
                must be put in place urgently. Processors should be invited to
                tender, and those with the lowest bids should be considered for
                that aid.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In common with all Members I have been
                lobbied by the Farmers’ Union on this issue, and I am only too
                glad to offer my support.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those of us who attended the transition
                seminar last week were invited to take up some of the
                suggestions made by the chairmen of the Farmers’ Union and the
                Agricultural Producers’Association. When they addressed
                Members they said &quot;Gentlemen of the Assembly, we ask for
                your support&quot;. On behalf of the Northern Ireland Women’s
                Coalition, may I say to both Leslie&nbsp;Craig and
                Will&nbsp;Taylor that the women in this Assembly take
                agriculture every bit as seriously as the Gentlemen.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Carson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most of the problems have already been
                considered today.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am concerned that the pig producers are
                currently facing heavy losses and severe financial difficulties,
                and as a housewife and an Assembly Member with many concerned
                constituents who depend totally on pig farming for their
                livelihood, I want to make two points.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Government’s reaction has been tardy,
                and pig farmers and their families have suffered greatly. I have
                seen this with my own eyes in my constituency. The financial aid
                offered was too little and much too late. The reorganisation of
                the pig processing industry in Northern Ireland and the
                restoration of facilities to replace the loss of Lovell &amp;
                Christmas may bring better times, but it will be an uphill
                struggle for some time. For some pig producers and their
                families it may be too late.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My second point concerns point-of-sale
                marketing. I am very basic and down-to-earth. I appeal to all
                Ulster housewives to show their loyalty and demand home-produced
                pork products in their local shops and supermarkets. That would
                be worthwhile. I know that is pretty basic, but it would
                demonstrate their concern.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At our seminar last week,
                Mrs&nbsp;Joan&nbsp;Whiteside from the Consumers’ Council said
                that it had conducted a survey which showed that
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland people were not supporting local products.
                Some supermarkets have responded to the pressure from pig
                producers and their families to stock local products. Now the
                public can see products clearly marked &quot;Produce of Northern
                Ireland&quot;. However, in local supermarkets some sausages are
                marked &quot;Irish produce&quot;, but a closer inspection shows
                that they have been made in England. Shoppers can play their
                part by reading the print — which, admittedly, can sometimes
                be quite small — and ensure that they buy local products.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There has been an expansion of multiple
                supermarkets here, and that has led to the dropping of local
                suppliers, not only of pork but of vegetables and dairy
                products. Even milk has been found to be packaged in Manchester.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I appreciate that we all depend on others
                accepting Ulster products, and it is important that we increase
                our exports, but charity begins at home. A good home market will
                ensure a sound foundation for future development. I appeal to
                Ulster housewives to support the pig farmers by buying
                locally-produced pork.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dallat:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion, and I was pleased that
                Dr&nbsp;Paisley stopped short of calling for passports for
                Southern pigs so that the Assembly can be united on this major
                issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The crisis, of course, is not confined to the
                pig industry; it affects agriculture as a whole. Whether one
                owns a picturesque farm in Fermanagh or a window box in
                Cullybackey it does not matter — everyone will be affected by
                this crisis if it is not dealt with. I support Mr&nbsp;Haughey’s
                suggestion to widen the whole debate about the crisis in
                agriculture.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 1996, farm output in Northern&nbsp;Ireland
                was £942 million; in 1997 it dropped to £803 million; and
                estimates for this year put output at £756 million. That is an
                overall drop of 20%. In terms of income, the situation is even
                more serious. In 1996, total income was estimated at
                £319&nbsp;million; last year it dropped to £203 million; and
                this year the figure is no more than £156 million. That is a
                drop of over 50%. We must seriously consider Mr&nbsp;Haughey’s
                comments because the drop in income is not confined to pig
                producers. Income from pigs is down 24%; sheep income is down
                25%; cattle income is down 12%; and income from broilers is down
                8%. However, I am happy to report that potato growers are making
                some money — but only potato growers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Paisley referred to debts. I think he said
                that £40 million was owed to the manufacturers of feeding
                stuffs. I would add to that the £500 million that is owed to
                banks and the £80&nbsp;million that is owed to hire-purchase
                companies. That shows the seriousness of the matter.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The reasons for the crisis in agriculture
                have been well documented here, and I do not propose to go over
                them again. The solutions, of course, are also well known. Some
                reference has been made to the Ulster Farmers’ Union and the
                Northern Ireland Agriculture Producers’ Association. Let us
                take forward the suggestions that have been made in the debate,
                and fully involve those organisations in solving the problems.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A whopping 62,000 people are employed in
                agriculture in Northern&nbsp;Ireland on 32,000 farms. The market
                is valued at £2·28 billion, which is 8% of gross national
                product. The crisis has implications for the wider community. I
                do not own a farm, but I live in a rural area and am wise enough
                to know the effect that this crisis will have if it is not dealt
                with.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am involved in rural regeneration
                programmes vital to the future stability of
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland. They are part of the peace process, and
                they could be put in jeopardy if this problem is not dealt with.
                Members have asked questions about who is getting the profit. We
                have been told that retailers may be creaming it off, but I do
                not think so. There is a chain of middlemen which needs to be
                uncovered.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sometimes we can look to the Republic of
                Ireland for inspiration. The Government there recognised the
                problems that large multinational supermarkets would create and
                put appropriate controls in place. Only last week, one of the
                largest, Tesco, announced plans to import huge quantities of
                potatoes. The Government of the Republic stopped this, so there
                at least, the potato growers can breathe freely for another
                while.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are many difficulties facing the
                agriculture industry. Some of the solutions are long term; the
                industry needs reinvestment and financial support. Above all, it
                needs a level playing field. The Assembly should take on board
                the excellent and very positive suggestions that have been made
                here today.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sometimes I wonder why two thirds of the
                world is starving, while the other third cannot find a market
                for its foodstuffs. It leaves me bewildered. In supporting the
                motion, I also ask that the suggestions that the debate be
                widened and that the Assembly give its support to the
                agriculture industry as a whole be taken up immediately.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No one can overstate the tragedy that is
                facing Northern&nbsp;Ireland’s pig farmers. If this matter is
                not dealt with, where is the pig industry going? Will we have a
                pig industry after this crisis? I have no problem with the
                suggestion that we should have a wider debate on agriculture —
                I know that there are problems in the lamb and sheep sectors of
                the industry as well, such as BSE and other related matters. But
                if we wait to consider and debate the full range of problems in
                the farming industry, there will be no pig farmers in the
                Province at all — they will all have gone bankrupt. We cannot
                allow this to be lost in a general debate on agriculture; the
                present crisis must be dealt with urgently.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I did not intend to suggest that
                consideration of urgent action on the pig crisis should be
                delayed until we have a general debate on the agriculture
                industry. In the course of my remarks, I called several times
                for immediate action.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev William McCrea:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I accept that, but I feel it is important to
                make clear that we are dealing with a very serious crisis. There
                are people in the province who are about to &quot;go over the
                top&quot; mentally, who are about to commit suicide because of
                this situation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Government, the European Union and the
                banks must do something now. This is not something that can be
                dealt with further down the line. They must do something now to
                help this industry out of this crisis.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The pig industry problem is not a problem the
                pig farmers created for themselves. It is true that there is
                overproduction and a glut of pigs throughout Europe. But in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland, at the very time when there was
                overproduction across Europe, the Government and the Department
                of Agriculture were aiding another processing factory to expand
                its kill in the Province.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us get the facts absolutely clear. The
                pig industry was encouraged to increase its production here. The
                Industrial Development Board encouraged many of the pig farmers
                to take out bank loans so they could put up bigger houses and
                increase their production. The farmers are innocent of any part
                in this crisis and should be helped to face it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second part of the problem was the fire
                at the Agivey processing plant which, tragically, took place at
                a time when the industry was going through problems across
                Europe. One night 40% of our kill capacity was wiped out. From
                that moment on, there was a dramatic change in pig prices. On 20
                June, when the fire took place, Northern&nbsp;Ireland pig
                farmers were being paid about 85p per kilogram, a reasonable
                payback for their hard work. But from that time onwards there
                was a decrease in the amount that pig farmers were paid.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After the fire at the Agivey processing
                plant, there was a total lack of communication between Maltons
                and the pig farmers facing a processing crisis. Any blame ought
                to rest with those who should have been consulting and assisting
                the farmers — many of them faithful Maltons producers. But
                very few pigs — sometimes no pigs — were removed from their
                farms despite Maltons promise to take 4,000 pigs across the
                water each week.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us look at the facts. There were weeks
                when not one pig was sent across the water to England. On most
                weeks it averaged 2,000 pigs — not the promised 4,000. At the
                time of the fire the pig price was 85p per kilogram. Then it
                dropped to 78p, then to 60p, and last week to 50p. What else has
                happened during this time? A grading system was introduced as
                another way of lowering the price to the producer. One pig
                producer averaged 46·3p per kilogram, yet pigs, sent to other
                factories in the province, fetched 63·52p per kilogram. The
                difference between what has been paid at Maltons processing
                plant at Cookstown and what has been paid by other factories in
                the province is 17·22p. This difference of £12 per pig is a
                disgrace. While farmers are going bankrupt, someone is making a
                fat kill. The housewife is not paying less for her bacon, yet
                the farmers are getting a pittance. They are losing £20 per
                pig. No farmer can sustain such a loss. The Assembly must
                identify who is making the profit, and that is why this issue is
                before us today.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is interesting that the pig producers in
                the Irish Republic are paid approximately 10p — £7&nbsp;per
                pig&nbsp;— more than the Northern&nbsp;Ireland producers. They
                are coming from the Irish Republic to the Malton factory in
                Cookstown and getting £7 per pig more than producers here.
                Surely there is something wrong with such a situation, even
                allowing for other fluctuations such as the 2p per kilogram VAT
                refund. Northern&nbsp;Ireland farmers were getting 50p and under
                for their pigs while pigs coming from the Irish Republic were
                worth 59·4p. That surely is wrong at a time of crisis.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Industrial Development Board is paying
                money from our Exchequer to ensure that the producers from the
                Irish Republic get more than the producers in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland. In fact 1,000 more pigs were taken in
                Cookstown from the South of Ireland, thus depressing the market
                further for pigs produced by Northern&nbsp;Ireland farmers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To add insult to injury, at the weekend the
                ‘Mid-Ulster Mail’ and the ‘News Letter’ reported Maltons
                as saying that it was paying over the odds and that Northern
                Ireland farmers were getting more for pigs. This came out of a
                meeting between the Ulster Unionists and Maltons, and the public
                relations exercise by Maltons was bought hook, line and sinker
                by someone. Maltons is not paying over the odds. In fact they
                are undercutting the farmers in my constituency and paying more
                to those coming from the Irish Republic. I resent that. Also,
                while farmers here are getting 50p for their pigs, those across
                the water are getting 70p. This is wrong. We demand equal
                treatment for our farmers from this company. They should get a
                just reward for all the hard work that they have put in. It is
                about time this firm faced the reality that the farmers are
                having to face.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Government have done precious little to
                help the farmers. The French Government in similar circumstances
                brought in an initial measure for farmers in difficulty and
                other financial aids, yet our farmers got nothing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need to research this issue. The farmer
                gets a miserable pittance for his pig, the housewife pays
                exorbitant prices and in between are the processors and the
                supermarkets. Where is the fat cat? Who is getting the money? It
                is about time the housewife and the farmer got their share.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to support the motion. Aontaím go
                ginearálta leis an rún atá idir chaibidil againn. I endorse
                the comments of other Members who have spoken in this debate.
                All of us have been well lobbied through our daily contacts with
                farmers in our constituencies and through extensive
                correspondence from the Northern Ireland Agricultural Producers’
                Association and the Ulster Farmers’ Union. Farmers are in
                despair and under tremendous strain. In the past they earned a
                reputation for complaining, but on this occasion the complaints
                should be listened to.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The crisis extends across the whole
                agriculture sector. Cattle and sheep prices have plummeted to
                record lows, but the pig industry is a special case. The
                agriculture industry has suffered a succession of body blows and
                neither the British Government nor the European Union have
                responded appropriately to the crisis.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Immediate, radical action is needed to arrest
                the general decline.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a tendency towards rural
                depopulation, a drift from the land. A comprehensive,
                integrated, rural strategy with agriculture at its core and
                supported by the EU is needed. That strategy should consider
                sympathetically the plight of small farmers. It should aim at
                making small farms viable and try to keep farmers on the land.
                To make farming viable, it could consider agri-tourism and
                diversification.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many farmers are under severe pressure. They
                wonder whether they have made a wise choice in travelling the
                road less travelled. Agriculture is obviously one key area where
                all-Ireland development would be beneficial to everyone, North
                and South, cross-border, all-island. It suits my party to make
                that point politically, but it is also common sense. The same
                could be said of the delivery of the Health Service and on other
                issues. It is navel-gazing for us to restrict ourselves to the
                Six Counties in considering the delivery of services or the
                development of industry. Farmers will not thank us for being
                myopic in that regard.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Can the relevant agencies increase kill and
                cure space and slaughter capacity? Is there any scope for the
                adaptation of meat plants which are presently on low production?
                My point about all-Ireland development is pertinent when one
                considers what happened at Ballymoney. Was it not prudent, from
                a cost-saving perspective alone, to look south for spare
                slaughter capacity when there was no readily available spare
                capacity in the Six County state?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should stop navel-gazing and look towards
                all-Ireland development of the agricultural economy. Our farmers
                will thank us for doing that.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Kennedy:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this
                important topic, which requires urgent attention. I am conscious
                of the fact that many of the points that I shall make have
                already been made, but it does no harm to reinforce them. I am
                concerned not just about the pig industry, but about agriculture
                as a whole in Northern&nbsp;Ireland. That is because I come from
                the largely rural constituency of Newry and Armagh. Many of my
                constituents who are involved in agriculture as a whole, and
                specifically in pigs, are near the bottom line in terms of
                livelihoods and in terms of their own lives. We are aware of the
                worries that they and their families share. It is crucial that
                the Assembly give urgent attention to their plight. The state of
                the agricultural economy gives rise to grave concern. Everyone
                in Northern&nbsp;Ireland ought to be concerned about that
                because what affects the farmer affects everybody, although I am
                not sure whether everybody realises that at this time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The reasons for the crisis have been
                outlined. The current economic situation has been managed, or
                perhaps mismanaged, by the Government in terms of high interest
                rates and so on. There is overproduction of pigs in other
                European Union member states, and there is no sign of that
                lessening.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a result of other crises within
                agriculture, particularly beef, many farmers went into pigs to
                try to survive. Unfortunately, they are now in even more dire
                straits as a consequence. There was the unfortunate fire at the
                Lovell &amp; Christmas factory and the closure a couple of years
                ago of the local Ulster Farmers’ Bacon Company plant at Newry
                in my own constituency.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many of us warned then that it would have
                dire consequences, resulting not only in the loss of jobs, but
                in the availability of the local plant that was working well.
                The plant had worked for over 25 years and, with the exception
                of one year, had never lost money. Yet it was closed without
                rhyme or reason. We also had the closure of the plant at
                Enniskillen. So the unfortunate fire at Lovell &amp; Christmas
                compounded the crisis that we found ourselves in.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have grave concerns about the agriculture
                policy of the present Labour Government. They have proved that
                they are no friend of the farmer or of agriculture. I am
                concerned that this will continue, as there is no sign of any
                improvement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have had a beef crisis; we have had a
                poultry crisis; and every now and again we get a mad scientist
                who publicly warns us of another new crisis — potentially in
                sheep. I wish that Government spokesmen, even if they are
                academics and scientists, would act sensibly and speak carefully
                so as not to raise consumers’ fears when no real fear exists.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the limited scheme that was put in
                place after a lot of toing and froing by the Government, even
                though it is clearly insufficient to deal with the overall
                problem. Therefore, I endorse the calls on the Government to
                bring forward a new more equitable scheme urgently that will
                address the needs of local pig producers. Other European
                countries can deal effectively with crises in agriculture and
                bring forward proper schemes to give real assistance to their
                people.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish that our Government, Her Majesty’s
                Government, would initiate the same arrangements. There is
                mounting concern that pigs are dying and leaving the farmers in
                debt to the tune of over £20 per animal, yet there is no
                decrease in costs to the consumers. We urgently need to find out
                who is making the money, where it is going and the reasons for
                that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need to address all these issues urgently,
                and I look forward to the Assembly’s playing its part in that.
                Many in the agriculture industry will be looking to see what
                leadership the Assembly can give and how it acts on behalf of
                the industry and in the best interests of the people of
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It worries me to think that the large number
                of civil servants, on secure, handsome salaries, have not been
                able, in spite of all their endeavours, to provide crisis plans
                for an industry that has already had a considerable number of
                crises.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What is wrong with having a crisis plan so
                that European Union funds can be accessed quickly when an
                industry is affected? Why can imaginative ideas not be
                introduced to prevent the worst kinds of suffering?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a very serious crisis in the sheep
                industry and, as a representative for South Down and the Mourne
                sheep farmers, it is incumbent on me to comment on it. This
                crisis is rapidly becoming as serious as that in the pig
                industry. I am calling for action — sheep farmers need an
                emergency deal now.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;Kennedy referred to the Government’s
                misinformation about BSE in the sheep industry. Consequently
                there is alarm in that industry. There is almost the development
                of a food-scare cult, and some people think it is fashionable to
                make alarmist statements without realising their disastrous
                consequences.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of Agriculture could develop a
                proactive plan — for example, a very practical measure would
                be the early payment of the sheep annual premium. Indeed, moneys
                that are currently outstanding should be paid over now.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly’s Agriculture Committee and
                the cross-border committees will have to scrutinise the
                Department’s lack of imagination. Plans will have to be
                scrutinised so that they can deal with tragedies such as that
                faced by the sheep industry.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Hill farmers are also alarmed that Agenda
                2000 proposals may lead to the Hill Livestock Compensatory
                Allowance being removed. Again, the Department needs to provide
                clarification and assure farmers that that will not be the case.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An average small farmer in my area may have
                only 100 ewes and 10 cows from which he receives an income of
                £675 and £1600 respectively — a total income of only £2275
                for a marginal hill farmer. There would be disastrous
                consequences were that allowance to be removed, considering all
                the other things that farmers have had to suffer in recent
                times.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr Ian Paisley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have had a good debate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a reason why we have highlighted the
                crisis in the pig industry, although I am fully aware, as is
                every informed Member, that there is a crisis right across the
                board in agriculture.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There have been times in the Province when
                individual sectors of agriculture have been under intense
                pressure. The whole of agriculture is under intense pressure but
                the most intense pressure, at the moment, is on the pig
                industry. We have heard in this debate, and rightly so, that
                there are worldwide pressures. There is a strong pound. We will
                not be able to do anything about that in time to save the pig
                industry. These are the facts. The Prime Minister is saying that
                he is keeping the pound strong, and the Chancellor is backing
                him up, yet this policy is utter folly — it will destroy the
                economy and especially the manufacturing industry. But that is
                the policy and if we wait for a change of heart, we will have no
                pig industry. That is the sad fact that we have to face. Of
                course, there are ramifications from Russia and Europe. But if
                we wait until they are solved, we will not have a pig industry.
                We need immediate and effective action.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have my qualms about Europe as everybody
                knows. But we are in Europe, and Europe controls agriculture.
                Have we never heard of the Common Agricultural Policy? The
                Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food does not make
                decisions; down the road does not make the decisions — the
                decisions are made in Brussels. Let us remember that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we are going to do anything by way of an
                Agriculture Committee or an inquiry, we need to go to Brussels
                to put the pressure on. If we are going across the water, let us
                go to the Prime Minister. He seems to have little bags of money
                here and there, and when he gets into difficulty, he throws a
                few million out.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no use in going to the Ministry of
                Agriculture, Fisheries and Food — the hardest and cruellest
                civil servants ever brought out of the womb of the Civil service
                sit in that Ministry, and I do not know whether the good Lord
                can convert them to a reasonable point of view, though, of
                course, I believe in the majesty and sovereignty of grace, being
                a Presbyterian. However, we must take this matter to the Prime
                Minister and to Europe as soon as possible, because every day
                men are facing ruin.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A beef producer whom I know now owes
                £45,000, and he is terrified. He never owed money like that in
                his life. Another producer in the pig industry owes £25,000 as
                a result of the last three months. These men cannot live with
                this. It is terrifying because they always had a viable industry
                and a cash flow. There is no cash flow now, so some things need
                to be done immediately and pressure must be exerted to ease the
                financial worries of farmers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I believe that this can be done in two ways.
                One way is to give money direct to the pig producers. There is
                no use in giving money to the factories. There is no use in
                giving money to the meal men. We need to alleviate and lift the
                strain. We must bring hope amidst despair; we must work; we must
                make demands because if we do not, there will not be a viable
                pig industry remaining. If the pig industry goes, more parts of
                farming will be sacrificed. If we allow the British Government
                or any power to let the pig sector of agriculture disappear, all
                sectors will be destroyed. We need to go to the authorities and
                put pressure on them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must also talk to the bankers — and I
                would like the Assembly to do the talking. The bankers were very
                good at going around the farmers, encouraging them and saying
                &quot;You know you should do this, that and the other thing —
                there is money here for you.&quot;</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The evil day comes when the bank manager
                sends for you. We have all had the experience. He looks over his
                glasses and says, &quot;Your credit is too much — you must
                reduce it each month&quot;. The man has no way of reducing it.
                He is at wit’s end corner. We need to make immediate decisions
                on those two levels because financial pressure will kill the
                industry.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is a serious business and many factors
                are involved. Some of the pig merchants have been in the
                industry for generations and they are broken-hearted. At
                breakfast time there is a shadow over them and at teatime the
                shadow is still there. We must think of them. If this part of
                agriculture is torn out of our country where will those people
                find employment? Where will the pig men and their families go?
                They will be for ever unemployed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We can make progress. It will not be easy
                because the Government always say, &quot;You want more
                money&quot;. We do want money. We want money to bail out this
                industry and to keep it going. Slaughtering must be speeded up
                by those who have got money from the Government to keep the
                industry going. I have a good personal relationship with the
                management of Maltons, but I am greatly disappointed by what has
                happened, and I am making representations direct to the company.
                We must have action. Some of the people who are suffering were
                good Malton customers. They were not Wilson customers, and they
                are feeling the burden and heat of the day. We must push them
                for action.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is the Member aware that the supermarkets are
                marking up pork cuts by as much as 900% and that promotions have
                been running on imported pork which has not been adequately
                labelled? Does he agree that if the multinational supermarkets
                will not back our industry properly, we should not support their
                major planning applications?</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with my Friend 100%. He asked a
                strong question at the seminar I attended a few days ago. He
                said, &quot;Show me the bankers, the producers and the feed men
                who have gone bust. You cannot show them, but I will show you
                the farmers who are going bust every day.&quot; He was not liked
                for that, and I understand that his invitation to a great dinner
                was withdrawn. So he did not feast at that table.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I understand that for a balloted Adjournment
                debate the ballot is conducted on a Friday. It would be helpful
                for Members to know that they had been unsuccessful in the
                ballot. Some Members arrived here not knowing whether they would
                be called in the Adjournment debate although they had prepared
                for it. It would also be useful if the names and subjects that
                are to be debated in the Adjournment debate were known by Friday
                lunchtime by means of an amended Order Paper or a circulated

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This matter is resolved on a Thursday
                evening. There were some 24&nbsp;applications for this first
                occasion, and I expect a much larger number in future. The
                amount of time required to contact everyone on a Friday in order
                to let them know the outcome will be considerable and if we were
                to continue in this manner, we would require some additional
                staff. The information that should have been given was that
                those Members who were to be called would be contacted on
                Friday, and if they were not, it was because they would not be
                there. We could, of course, adopt the mechanism that
                Mr&nbsp;Weir suggests, but that would have practical
                implications in terms of contacting everyone, particularly in
                view of the fact that not everyone is able to be contacted.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not suggesting that we go to great
                expense or hire additional staff, but if the outcome is known on
                a Thursday evening, a letter could be sent out to members by
                first-class post on Friday morning, and they would receive it on
                Saturday morning. That would not cause too much trouble.
                Alternatively, on Thursday evening could a circular be put in
                the pigeon-holes of those who have been selected? That would
                resolve the situation without inordinate expense.</p>

                which appeals to me or to my party. Surely there is a better way

                — there is no quarrel with that — but a system which allows,
                as in this case, one Member from the Ulster Unionist Party,

                the Alliance Party and none from the other parties to speak is
                not something that we should recommend.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is supposed to be an Assembly where
                reason, equality and fairness prevail, and that certainly cannot
                be achieved by a common lottery. There are better methods. We
                are not tied to the House of Commons in this; it may have
                established a ballot for all sorts of other reasons. In any
                case, this Assembly is not operating on the same basis as the
                House of Commons, with a Government and a major opposition
                party. This is supposed to be a consensual Assembly, and that
                ought to be reflected by something other than a lottery.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is true that Members are from parties of
                differing sizes, but the size of the parties bears no relation
                to the number of applications to speak. There are some parties
                with many Members and almost no applications, and other parties
                with fewer Members but with a considerable interest in the
                matter. That is one of the reasons for the apparent skew that
                you describe, and that has to be taken into account.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My understanding was that those who were
                selected today would not be selected the next time. Secondly,
                Sinn Fein is not happy with the allocation today or with the
                method that has been used. As Mr&nbsp;McCartney has said, we
                must approach this in a way that will ensure representation from
                all the parties.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some parties may have made a number of
                applications judging that in a ballot they would have a better
                chance of getting some out, but we put forward two on the basis
                that we had two Members who wanted to speak. We might have been
                better putting in 20&nbsp;applications — that would have
                increased our chances of getting two out, but that would just
                tarnish the system. We must look again at this method of
                balloting and find some means of getting representation from
                across the Chamber.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is to do with each party having proper

                we have imported the d’Hondt system to ensure equality in the
                selection of Ministers and in the selection of Chairmen and
                Vice-Chairmen, surely we can devise a better system than a

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members must understand that if we do start
                to operate this on the entirely proportionate basis that is
                being referred to, Members from quite a number of the parties
                will not get an opportunity to speak at all in some of the
                debates. In the debate this afternoon the parties are not being
                represented on the basis of their size. All parties will get a
                chance to speak and then subsequently we will try to parcel out
                the time on a proportionate basis. That means that the smaller
                parties will get an opportunity to speak at a much earlier stage
                and more regularly than would otherwise be the case.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am entirely the servant of the Assembly and
                will accept whatever system the House chooses. However, it is
                important to understand that if one chooses another system it
                may not have precisely the outcome one wants. Let us not forget
                that this is the very first day we have used this mechanism,
                which your representatives decided to use on this occasion, and
                these things usually work out more reasonably when taken over a
                period of a few months. Taken over only one day, clearly there
                will be a skew. If we change it so that in all debates an
                entirely proportionate basis is used, then it will be rather
                difficult for me — and part of my responsibility is to try to
                make sure that smaller parties, independents and dissidents get
                a chance to speak — to ensure that this happens.</p>

                point that Mr&nbsp;Weir made about communication with Members,
                those are matters which should be considered by the Standing
                Orders Committee. It can look at all these issues and try to
                come up with a system that is fair to everybody and has a degree
                of consensus across the parties. This is the best way of
                handling this issue rather than entering into a long involved
                debate which will end with the result that a lot of people who
                have asked to speak will not get to speak. I have no vested

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This suggestion from the Chair that if you
                have a lottery it may in some way balance out over time is akin
                to the argument that if a monkey were let loose on a typewriter
                and given infinity it would produce all the plays of
                Shakespeare. The idea that we should be committed to a lottery
                is something which I find fundamentally offensive. Nor need the
                rules in relation to Adjournment debates be those that govern
                the manner in which we deal with general debates, where the
                practice of giving one Member from each of the parties an
                opportunity to speak before introducing any proportional methods
                for the rest of the speakers is working and is generally
                accepted to be fine. I still make the point that we ought as
                rational beings to be able to produce a fairer system than that
                which is produced by random lottery.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issue I want to address is the
                development of the city of Belfast in the widest possible
                context. Most of us are aware that in the last century Belfast
                was a tremendous industrial powerhouse, and some of us would
                like to see it being a powerhouse again — perhaps in the
                technological sense of the twenty-first century. The one thing
                militating against that is a tremendous lack of co-ordination
                across all the Government Departments. I raise the suggestion in
                passing that when the Assembly gets organised perhaps we should
                have a Junior Minister for Belfast to co-ordinate work across
                the Departments, but I will leave that for the moment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The whole community in Belfast has made
                tremendous strides in redeveloping and rebuilding the city, in
                both physical and human fabric terms. I have serious concerns,
                about the opportunities missed and squandered, just as I am
                pleased about the opportunities used. I would like to draw
                attention to some of those concerns, and I hope I will have a
                chance to debate this at greater length at a later stage.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While there are piecemeal plans, there is an
                almost total absence of any overview, co-ordination or
                integrated plan for the development of the city, and that is my
                overriding concern. There are a number of component parts to any
                worthwhile development strategy: constructing the physical
                attributes; developing a transport system; connecting the
                education system to the strategy; the economic aspect that
                involves people rather than bland structures; and generally
                ensuring that the health and social services underpin the whole
                thing so that when things go wrong, or when people are either
                ill or at a disadvantage, they are supported.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I could further subdivide the components, but
                it is not essential to do so at this stage to make my point. In
                our system, as I see it, all these parts function independently,
                and there is little linkage between them. Much, but not all, of
                the potential synergy is lost at a considerable cost to the city
                in both financial and human terms. Some five or six years ago,
                those of us who were on Belfast City Council were permitted to
                raise a small amount of money from the rates to promote the
                economic development of the city. We raised £1&nbsp;million and
                we used that to unlock a further £1 million of EC funding.
                Tremendous strides have taken place, with many of the targets
                achieved across a whole range of programmes, unlocking some of
                the bottlenecks and providing opportunities for the people. I
                pay tribute to my colleague Mr&nbsp;Empey, sitting fornenst, to
                use the Ulster-Scots word. He has done an outstanding job in
                providing leadership, strength and drive.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the city council we have built our whole
                agenda around three themes: community economic development; the
                development of existing businesses; and promoting inward
                investment where possible. I must emphasise that in most cases
                we have surpassed our own expectations, and successes range
                right across the whole spectrum including community projects,
                those which strengthen our retail sector, those working to build
                confidence and capacity in small business and those helping to
                build a formidable network of friends and allies across Europe
                and North America with a view to supporting the work of the
                Industrial Development Board.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have mobilised and encouraged people and
                empowered them to believe in themselves and achieve their full
                potential.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am seriously concerned that the efforts of
                the council and its staff are often frustrated by what can only
                be described as a distinct lack of enthusiasm. I have heard
                others put it much more strongly, using terms such as &quot;lack
                of co-operation&quot; or &quot;petty rivalry&quot;. In that
                context I refer to some of the Government’s organs and
                agencies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the issues that concerns me is
                European funding. It is great at the moment with structural and
                social funds. We even had the peace and reconciliation fund. But
                Objective 1 status is at risk, and the question that must be
                answered is what happens when the funds run out. Who will
                organise the exit strategy and who will be left holding the
                baby?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am particularly concerned about land
                availability and the structured land-use strategy that we need.
                Land use is fundamental to any development plan, but we do not
                have a strategy, and I am not sure whether we even have a
                complete list of land availability in Belfast.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition, we have tremendous problems with
                the Planning Service of the Department of the Environment. For
                all sorts of petty bureaucratic reasons, it exerts a
                stranglehold and obstructs much necessary and desirable
                development.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is poor co-ordination between the
                various subsections of the Department of Economic Development.
                They all do their own thing, sometimes communicating with each
                other but often acting like strangers. We desperately need a
                united, co-ordinated approach. Another concern is the total lack
                of any transport strategy for the city. We have Translink,
                Citybus and Northern Ireland Railways, and we all have a lot to
                learn.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The gasworks development has been left idle
                for the last two years because of petty obstruction by the
                planners. First, they said that Belfast City Council had to
                spend £500,000 on widening the Ormeau&nbsp;Road some 600 to 700
                yards from the gasworks site. That project was needed in any
                case, but they saw the opportunity to lumber the city council
                with the burden for it. Now that that matter has been resolved,
                they have blocked the developments because they have decided not
                to allow any cars on the gasworks site. I am at a loss as to why
                they insisted on widening the road for cars supposedly coming in
                and out of the gasworks when it now transpires that there is not
                to be any adequate car park for those who are there. There are
                some 1,000 to 1,200 jobs hanging on that bit of petty
                bureaucracy, and that situation cannot be allowed to continue
                much longer.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The north foreshore is another issue. Some
                330&nbsp;acres of European prime site would be ideal for a
                bio-technology park, where the universities could co-operate and
                we could create a massive web of twenty-first century jobs. The
                city council has spent over 40 years reclaiming land from the
                sea and recently spent £20&nbsp;million on cleaning it up. Some
                120&nbsp;acres of it are now ready for development. It is ideal
                for the science and technology park that this city and country
                badly needs. The Department of the Environment has fobbed us off
                for the past three or four years, saying that the Harbour
                Commissioners wanted it. We now know that they do not want it;
                but still we cannot have it. Thousands of pounds worth of
                methane gas, which could have been used to make electricity, has
                been blown off that site.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will briefly mention the D5 and hypermarket
                developments. Sainsbury’s at Forestside has devastated the
                Ormeau&nbsp;Road, as will the D5 development the city centre.
                There has been much indecision in relation to the city’s
                southern road approaches and the inner-city distributor box.
                That box will cut a swathe through the southern centre of the
                city, from the Grosvenor&nbsp;Road, through Durham&nbsp;Street,
                Hope&nbsp;Street, Bankmore&nbsp;Street and across through the
                gasworks, seven acres of which has been blocked because of that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, I want to raise the issue of the
                privatisation of the port of Belfast. Will that privatisation be
                like the airport one, where millions were made? Who will be the
                beneficiary of the port’s privatisation? Some 2,000&nbsp;acres
                of the best development land in Europe are attached to the port
                of Belfast — 600&nbsp;acres on the Antrim shore and 1,400 on
                the County Down shore.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This offers the potential for jobs to a much
                wider community than those ratepayers in Belfast.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many opportunities have been squandered due
                to muddle and confusion. I would like to have the opportunity to
                raise this issue in a more general debate, but I emphasise the
                urgent need for a co-ordinated strategy here, and I believe it
                falls to the Assembly to take the lead in this. We should
                discuss how we can co-ordinate development in this region, and
                it may be that, in due course, we will need a junior Minister
                for Belfast.</p>

                <font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs E Bell:</p>
                </font></b><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to make a few comments
                concerning the establishment of the Equality Commission.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with some of the comments that were
                made about the ballot; we do need to think about this again.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Equality is defined as &quot;the condition of
                being equal with more than two persons in quality or in having
                strength, ability et&nbsp;cetera&quot;. Equity is
                &quot;fairness&quot; and also recourse to &quot;principles of
                justice to correct or supplement the law&quot;. I start with
                these definitions because the term &quot;equality&quot; — like
                many other words, such as &quot;inclusiveness&quot;,
                &quot;identity&quot; and even &quot;peace&quot; — are not
                always used in the correct way, but rather to support a certain
                slant to suit other perspectives. In every society, every
                citizen is different, there are different incomes and living
                situations, but that should not mean that those who do not enjoy
                full employment, good health or sound minds should not be equal
                to, or at least feel equal to, others as regards basic rights
                and a proper quality of life.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We in this Assembly have a chance to ensure
                that all our citizens, whatever their circumstances, have the
                right to realise their full potential and to have their place in
                the sun. However, our hands are being tied by what I believe is
                the premature setting up of the Equality Commission. The Belfast
                Agreement stated that decisions on the establishment of this new
                Commission would be &quot;subject to the outcome of public
                consultation&quot;. The consultation process produced only 18
                replies in favour of the merger out of a total of 123, yet it is
                still being debated and will become law before the new Assembly
                is even finalised. It will be cut and dried before the proposed
                Department of Equality can start its work.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A number of points are still unclear. It has
                been suggested that the Northern Ireland Office is to allocate a
                budget of £4·8&nbsp;million to the Equality Commission. The
                current budget for the Commission for Racial Equality, the Equal
                Opportunities Commission and the Fair Employment Commission is
                £5·5 million. Who will be supervising the allocation of this
                smaller budget to the different departments of the new
                Commission? Will that be done by Westminster or by the new
                Assembly? How will it be administered and how will that affect
                the staff of the existing equality bodies?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These are important points. But I would like
                to go on to what I consider are more important points. Emphasis
                is being put on eliminating religious and political
                discrimination, but there seems to be no clear process proposed
                for reducing other types of discrimination such as that based on
                gender, disability and race. The political imperative to focus
                on equality issues in respect of the two major groups in our
                community may undermine those of smaller, less vocal groups. For
                instance, the members of the minority ethnic groups are only now
                finding a voice through the Commission for Racial Equality and
                are in danger, along with others who feel that they have a need
                for recourse to the other equality bodies, of losing out on the
                attention of the new Commission, which will be remitted to
                attend to all the different interests.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is essential that the Assembly is
                empowered to ensure that this Equality Commission is seen to be
                fair and to work for all who need it. Rights must not only be
                protected, they must be promoted. Any downgrading of gender,
                disability or racial rights should be challenged as patently
                discriminatory.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another point of concern is that the
                legislation, as it stands, could lead to some problems with
                affirmative action programmes. For instance, certain measures
                are currently taking place to increase Catholic representation
                in the Royal Ulster Constabulary. The Bill does not allow for
                this, but I think it should, as there is a precedent laid down
                in the provisions of the Canadian Charter of Rights, for
                example.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.30 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sex discrimination is another crucial area
                that needs specific attention. Women, as with those with
                disabilities, face the reality of inequality in all areas of
                economic and social life. The Equal Opportunities Commission has
                demonstrated that there is still work to be done in the area of
                equal pay for work of equal value, and it has recently
                encouraged Government Departments, agencies and local councils
                responsible for economic development to include a gender
                dimension in their policy development.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Female Members in the Assembly will agree
                that the Assembly must adopt such a stance in its own
                legislative practices. I am glad to note that the shadow
                Commission is already looking into the possibility of childcare
                provision for Members and staff.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To conclude, I should restate my concern and
                the Alliance party’s concern at the timing of this proposal to
                set the Commission up, especially when it is clear that so many
                organisations and groups have expressed similar concerns. The
                amalgamation of the existing equality commissions can only
                suggest a certain lack of confidence on the Government’s part
                that the Assembly will deal with equality issues in a proper
                fashion. No one is disputing that there should be a review, but
                it should have been delayed until the Assembly was fully set up,
                and we also want to think about the new Human Rights Commission.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am sure that we all want to create a
                Northern Ireland where citizens can live, work and play in a
                fair and equitable society without fear or discrimination. The
                Assembly will play its part and be committed to that goal. The
                Government should have shown more faith in the devolved
                Administration’s ability to achieve this.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev William McCrea:</p>
                </font></b><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I should like to raise the retention of acute
                services at the Mid-Ulster Hospital. Some weeks ago, the
                Northern Health and Social Services Board decided to follow the
                Government’s line on the Golden Six acute hospitals. In the
                review, and in response to the Government’s request, the board
                decided to remove the acute services from the Mid-Ulster
                Hospital.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was interesting to note that no sooner had
                the proposal been put by the chief executive of the board — an
                official of the board — than the meeting concluded. The
                proposal was accepted and a press release on behalf of the
                chairman and the chief executive was released immediately. It
                seems that the decision had been made before the meeting took
                place. This is not a proper way of dealing with the Health
                Service and the future health of our people.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On that occasion Mr&nbsp;Baker, an SDLP
                Councillor from Cookstown, and I made representations to the
                board. The members listened courteously but were quick to go
                ahead with their own proposals.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The present review ought to be stopped
                because its findings will in time prove to be nugatory. Given
                where the Golden Six hospitals are situated, the principle and
                the design of that policy is fundamentally flawed and out of
                date.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The review was commenced under the Tory
                Government and, when the Tories went out, the new Labour
                Government permitted it to continue. It may be that the decision
                about acute services will not be taken by the Labour Government.
                It may become a responsibility of the Assembly and of a Minister
                of Health in Northern&nbsp;Ireland. For that reason we should be
                looking for support for the Mid-Ulster Hospital from within the
                Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are many headings, and one could
                consider why acute services should be retained as they are.
                Because of time constraints I can deal with only some of them.
                The first issue is accessibility. The time that is taken to
                reach skilled medical attention is critical in all emergencies,
                and it involves consideration not only of distance but of the
                condition of the roads and the route to be followed in getting
                patients to that point of assistance. It is generally accepted
                that the roads in the two council areas that are covered by the
                Mid-Ulster Hospital — Magherafelt and Cookstown — are some
                of the poorest in the Province. Journey times to the hospital,
                especially from the western half of the district, would increase
                significantly if acute services were to be placed in Antrim
                rather than in Magherafelt. The Automobile Association states
                that it would take 52&nbsp;minutes to travel from Pomeroy to
                Antrim as opposed to 22 minutes to Magherafelt, and 50 minutes
                from Stewartstown to Antrim as opposed to 24 minutes to
                Magherafelt.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 1994, the Northern Health and Social
                Services Board produced a report on the development of hospital
                services in its area. The report stated that an acceptable
                journey time was considered to be 40&nbsp;minutes. The board’s
                ‘Customers’ Charter’ states that, in an emergency, an
                ambulance should arrive within 14&nbsp;minutes in an urban area,
                18&nbsp;minutes in a rural area and 21&nbsp;minutes in a remote
                area. Obviously, those times could not be complied with if the
                services were moved from the Mid-Ulster Hospital and placed in
                Antrim. The life expectancy of the person requiring immediate
                medical attention is put at risk.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Northern Ireland Ambulance Service is
                currently undertaking a study into response times for calls if
                the rationalisation of acute services proceeds. Under a new
                system that is currently being piloted in Great&nbsp;Britain,
                the service will be expected to meet 75% of category A calls —
                immediate life-threatening calls&nbsp;— within eight minutes.
                This is highly unlikely to be the case if the Mid-Ulster
                Hospital loses its accident and emergency department.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are travel delays in Toomebridge and
                although a new bypass is agreed and proposed, it will be several
                years before that is completed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have to consider equity. Cookstown and
                Magherafelt have fairly high levels of deprivation, and more
                difficult access to acute hospital services would result in the
                transfer of costs to those who are least able to pay, thereby
                reducing access to acute services. That also contradicts the
                Department’s guidelines. Its aims, which are set out in ‘Targeting
                Health and Social Needs’, are to reduce inequalities and to
                ensure that the changes do not increase variations in
                availability or access to health care. Reduction in services
                would cause job losses, resulting in a further negative impact
                on an already deprived area. The transfer of acute services can
                only increase inequalities and reduce accessibility. That
                contradicts in practice the Department’s statement that</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;the effectiveness of targeted
                resources, programmes and services must be assessed to ensure
                that they are succeeding in reducing and not inadvertently
                perpetuating or increasing variation in health and social
                well-being or in the availability of or access to health and
                social care&quot;.</p>

                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;a comprehensive Health Service,
                publicly funded, publicly operated, free at the point of use and
                available to all on the basis of need, not on the ability to
                pay&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the policy dictated by the review were to
                be followed then the only safe place to be sick in this Province
                would be east of the Bann. Your chances of survival, west of the
                Bann — an area of the greatest deprivation and disadvantage
                — would be greatly diminished. The situation is totally
                unacceptable. All you have to do is look at a map of the
                Province to see that five of the six golden hospitals are going
                to be east of the Bann. That is not apportioning health services
                relevant to need or social deprivation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On behalf of all the people of the mid-Ulster
                area, from whatever side of the political spectrum they come, I
                wish to make it clear that existing acute services at the
                Mid-Ulster Hospital ought to be retained. Failure to do so will
                result in an increase of inequality as regards access to acute
                services in the Cookstown and Magherafelt District Council
                areas. That is unacceptable. There will be longer response times
                in emergency situations with ambulances arriving outside the
                stated response times. Journey times will increase by
                30&nbsp;minutes, with some well above the acceptable journey
                time of 40 minutes, as stated by the Northern Health and Social
                Services Board. There is likely to be an increase in mortality
                rates on journeys to Antrim Hospital. There could be a possible
                reduction in self-referrals for acute hospital services, further
                reduction in the significant underprovision of services to the
                people living in the west of the Province and a negative
                economic impact on an already deprived area.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">God forbid that what happened in Omagh had
                happened in Magherafelt, had the services been removed. I
                remember the fight to keep acute services in Omagh. There would
                have been a vast number of fatalities, and they would certainly
                have been significantly higher. I want to see our community
                getting the same acute services as the rest of the Province. In
                health terms that would be justice for all our people.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thirty years ago a group of people, mostly
                though not all from the Nationalist community, proposed to
                parade peacefully into the city of Derry to protest about a
                system of widespread discrimination based on religious belief
                and political persuasion. On this day, exactly 30&nbsp;years
                ago, that parade was banned. Why? It was after all a peaceful
                protest, a parade into a city with a Nationalist majority ruled
                by a Unionist minority.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was banned because of a mindset which held
                that Nationalist rights were limited by the extent to which they
                were acceptable to Unionists. It was banned because of a
                tradition based on an inequality of power between Nationalists
                and Unionists, a tradition whereby it was taken for granted that
                marches by the Loyal Orders and associated with the Unionist
                tradition had the absolute right to march in town centres,
                Nationalist areas and Unionist areas. At the same time parades
                associated with the Nationalist community had to be confined to
                Nationalist areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Civil Rights march, exactly 30&nbsp;years
                ago today, challenged that supposition, and what ensued exposed
                to the world the system of deep discrimination and injustice
                which lay at the root of that mindset. It is ironic that
                30&nbsp;years later, at a time when political leaders, many of
                them coming to terms with the need for change, with the need for
                equality and for a mutual acceptance and respect for each other’s
                traditions, that the parade’s issue is still here to haunt us,
                so to speak. Indeed, it has the potential to inhibit and to
                damage the difficult process in which we are engaged. However,
                it is not surprising because the parades issue symbolises the
                very inequality that has lain at the heart of
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland’s troubled history.</p>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Drumcree is not about a 15-minute march down
                the Garvaghy Road; it is about a demand for change and equality
                on the one hand and the fear of change and the resistance to
                that change on the other.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The 5&nbsp;October march in Derry was a
                protest about real grievances as the Cameron Commission
                subsequently confirmed. It was not part of a plot to subvert the
                state. In the same way, the conflict in Portadown arises from a
                real sense of grievance born out of the experiences of a small
                Nationalist community in a large Unionist town, a community to
                which it has been clear over the years that their rights must be
                restricted and not equal to those of the majority.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Portadown District of the Orange Order
                failed to recognise that there is no such thing as an absolute
                right, that all rights must be exercised with due regard for the
                rights of others and that all rights carry responsibilities. It
                is in a situation such as that at Drumcree that a conflict of
                rights can only be resolved through dialogue and accommodation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have no doubt that the sense of grievance
                felt by sections of the Unionist community about the Drumcree
                situation is real and strongly felt. Undoubtedly the changes to
                the status quo proposed by the Good Friday Agreement are seen by
                some as threatening. It is a pity that an agreement which
                represents a balanced approach to the rights of both Unionists
                and Nationalists, an agreement at the core of which lies the
                principle of consent, continues to be represented by some as a
                threat and a sell-out.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To portray the re-routing of parades, as has
                been carried out this summer, as an attack on the cultural
                heritage of Unionism is a gross distortion of the reality. Of
                the 3,242&nbsp;parades that were notified this year — I
                repeat: 3,242 — only 2% were restricted, and those
                restrictions were imposed in areas where dialogue had either
                failed or had not even been attempted.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The emphasis this year has been on the
                Drumcree situation and the running sore of Portadown. On a more
                positive note, and there have been positive notes, I have no
                doubt that the courageous voice of the
                Rev&nbsp;William&nbsp;Bingham speaks for many in the Orange
                Order who have been appalled at the events surrounding Drumcree.
                The small turnout at recent demonstrations sends a clear message
                as well.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will not as I have not got much time left.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I read in today’s ‘Irish News’ that a
                Church of Ireland Archbishop and Bishop and 150&nbsp;clergymen
                have publicly voiced concern and deep unease about the events
                surrounding the Drumcree church service in recent years. That is
                a welcome development as well.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Over the summer potential flashpoints have
                been defused from Derry to the Ormeau&nbsp;Road and Dunloy where
                common sense prevailed, where both residents and Loyal Orders,
                to their credit, reluctantly accepted unpalatable decisions in
                the interests of the common good. And that was true of both
                sides in those areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another positive note to have been struck
                recently was the decision by the Ballynafeigh Orange Lodge to
                hold a seminar at which Nationalist, Unionist and Loyal Order
                views were expressed. I would encourage that. And a further step
                forward would be to engage in dialogue with the local residents.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, I will return briefly to the
                situation in Portadown and to the fact that the Orange Order
                still refuses to enter into dialogue. Stand-offs, demonstrations
                and confrontations continue. We saw the consequences of that in
                1996 and 1997, consequences with which we are all too familiar.
                This year we witnessed the surreal spectacle of Army
                reinforcements being helicoptered into a field at Drumcree in
                support of the RUC.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The relatively small Nationalist area of
                Portadown was surrounded by steel barriers and protected by
                troops and police. A visitor from Mars might have concluded that
                the third world war had begun. The stand-off and vicious nightly
                attacks on the security forces went on for over a week, all
                because a group of men persisted on returning from church
                through an area where they were not welcome rather than along
                the alternative route from which they had come. Where was the
                sense of proportion?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr Presiding Officer.
                There is an implication that the Orangemen were responsible for
                attacking the police, which is absolute nonsense.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Initial Presiding Officer:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is not a point of order.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Rodgers:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Regrettably, it has not ended there. For
                three months now the Nationalist community in Portadown has
                suffered intimidation and harassment. It has even been suggested
                by a representative of the Orange Order that the harassment
                could stop if they were allowed down the Garvaghy&nbsp;Road. The
                implication of that is clear.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Three Catholic-owned businesses in Portadown
                have been burnt down and others have been threatened; all of the
                town’s traders have had their trade seriously affected; and a
                young policeman lies in hospital with serious brain damage. He
                has a young wife and three children, and he is fighting for his
                life.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Who gains from such a situation? Not the
                Nationalist nor Unionist communities; not the traders; not even
                those who continue to protest and demonstrate; and certainly not
                Frank&nbsp;O’Reilly — the young policeman — or his wife
                and baby and two other children.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Surely it is time to stand back and apply
                common sense. It is time for the local leaders of Unionism to
                support publicly the need for dialogue. Surely the experience of
                the previous three decades is enough to prove to us all that
                violence and confrontation compounds our differences and ensures
                that everyone pays the price.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are together here today, but our
                differences have not gone away. I hope that during the talks
                some of us have come to a better understanding of each other. We
                have agreed to disagree in some areas, but we have committed
                ourselves to working together to resolve our remaining
                differences. None of us is less true to himself for doing that.
                Entering into dialogue is not giving way on fundamental
                principles; it is a recognition of the reality that conflict
                cannot be resolved any other way.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The failure to break the deadlock over
                Drumcree must be addressed. It is unacceptable and intolerable
                that a small, unelected group of men in Portadown should
                continue to hold both communities to ransom simply because they
                will not enter into dialogue.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to speak about the future&nbsp;of
                Whiteabbey Hospital, although Rev&nbsp;William&nbsp;McCrea has
                already dealt with some of the broad issues, because the
                hospital to which he referred falls under the same health and
                social services board as Whiteabbey Hospital.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the issues for many people in the
                North Belfast, Newtownabbey and south-east Antrim areas is that
                while more than 50,000 people signed a petition at the start of
                the year outlining their opposition to some of the board’s
                proposals, there does not seem to have been as much attention
                paid to that as to other hospitals. That is why I am taking the
                opportunity to raise this matter.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to appeal to the Minister. It has been
                assumed that the Assembly will have the final say on some of
                these issues, and I hope that that will be the case. However,
                that is not absolutely certain, and the message from the
                Assembly must be that the elected representative should take the
                decisions that will affect the provision of health care.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It should certainly not be made by the
                Minister in advance of a full debate and consideration of all
                the issues by the relevant Committees and the House itself.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is easy to say this hospital is special,
                that it is a local hospital providing essential services.
                Everybody can make a case for a local hospital or a local
                school, so it is important to look at the issues as objectively
                as possible. I would therefore seek to measure the decision that
                has been taken by the Northern Health and Social Services Board
                against the criteria which it has adopted.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is a reasonable approach and better than
                adopting criteria of our own choosing. There were five key
                criteria used by the Northern Health and Social Services Board
                in relation to the future of acute and emergency services and
                medical and surgical in-patient services in hospitals in its
                area. There were initially three options and option three has
                proved successful. All options involved severe downgrading of
                services available in the Mid-Ulster and Whiteabbey Hospitals.
                Accident and emergency services and medical and surgical
                in-patient services were to be removed under all options.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But let us turn to the five key criteria:
                ensuring high quality care, access to appropriate local
                services, efficient delivery of care to meet patients’ needs,
                equity of access to care and patient-centred care services.
                These are sensible, reasonable criteria. But how were they
                applied in the case of Whiteabbey Hospital? Now with high
                quality care, every hospital authority throughout the United
                Kingdom is looking at the question of centralisation. What is
                the best way to provide high-tech services, acute services and
                accident and emergency services?</p>

                Mr&nbsp;Dodds. Whiteabbey Hospital’s catchment area straddles
                three Assembly constituencies: North Belfast, South Antrim and
                East Antrim. The recent decision by the board about services
                comes as a great surprise. There is disappointment and grave
                concern in Carrickfergus and Newtownabbey that the whole
                Assembly constituency of East Antrim will be left without
                adequate medical or emergency services.</p>

                Mr&nbsp;Initial&nbsp;Presiding&nbsp;Officer, that you took care
                that my time will not be reduced.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In relation to the point that I was making
                about high quality care and so on, this sort of process has been
                happening throughout the United&nbsp;Kingdom for some time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many people who are dealing with the
                Whiteabbey Hospital situation are annoyed because it seems that
                the decisions were taken some time ago. There has been much
                investment in the Causeway Hospital, and in the new Antrim
                Hospital and, as a result, there has been no investment in the
                Whiteabbey Hospital. There is a feeling that the process is
                under way and that there can be only one possible&nbsp;outcome.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a parallel with the Tower Block in
                Belfast. As soon as such a building is in place, many other
                decisions inevitably and consequentially flow from it and there
                are financial consequences. The guiding principles should be
                need and what best serves the communities in those areas. That
                is the approach that we should adopt to all these issues. I hope
                that the Assembly will have an opportunity to adopt that
                approach, and that we will not be presented with a fait
                accompli.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another matter is that of ensuring access to
                appropriate local services. Rev&nbsp;McCrea has already dealt
                with some of the issues in relation to transport and so on. The
                Northern Health Board proposes that local services will be
                provided under option 3, but it makes no attempt to define the
                range of investigations, procedures and treatments that could be
                provided within key settings, such as minor casualty services.
                It deals with that in a broad-brush way, and many people will
                want to see detailed recommendations before they are prepared to
                give their assent.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The third criterion is to ensure effective
                delivery of care in keeping with patients’ needs. We know
                about travel time in relation to rural hospitals. It applies
                equally to Whiteabbey Hospital because its catchment area
                contains some of the largest and most deprived housing estates
                in Northern&nbsp;Ireland. Some people do not have access to a
                car or other transport, some depend on public transport, in
                which there are many deficiencies and difficulties.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Ambulance Service has not been improved
                in line with proposals and suggested changes. It is essential
                that improvements to the Ambulance Service are made before there
                is any relocation or centralisation of accident and emergency
                services. There should be a review of the impact of any
                relocation or change in services to find out how people would
                get to hospitals.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Public transport should be looked at. The
                policy appraisal and fair treatment review reported that
                travelling time for more than 70% of people would be
                significantly increased, yet about 40% of all patients of
                Whiteabbey Hospital have no car or access to one. All issues
                must be considered before decisions are made.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Do patient centres and care services offer
                value for money? It is disturbing that we will be asked to
                approve more than £40&nbsp;million to bring about changes.
                Nobody has been able to demonstrate to the Whiteabbey Hospital
                action committee or to me the economic advantages. I should like
                to know how much extra it will cost.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">6.00 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The final issue is implementation. The board’s
                document refers to consultation with local people, although it
                seems that the board is not listening to local people at all. It
                has brushed their concerns to one side. It also makes it clear
                that the local GPs will be consulted. I have spoken to some of
                the local doctors, and they say that their contribution will be
                essential if this alternative of a community-style hospital is
                to work. So far, they have not been consulted. Before anything
                more is done, they should be consulted.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am concerned about the historical
                investment pattern that has led to major investment in Antrim
                and Coleraine. In saying that, I do not disparage those two fine
                hospitals. There should be necessary improvements to ambulance
                services and public transport, and the board should clarify to
                everybody’s satisfaction the advantages and disadvantages of
                transferring services to other hospitals.</p>

                </font></b><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am the last to speak, but since my name
                begins with W for Wilson, that is not unusual except, of course,
                when I top the poll.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Before commenting on the desirability of
                restructuring the Department of the Environment, I should
                declare a personal interest. My long-standing involvement with
                the angling fraternity has brought me face to face with numerous
                pollution incidents in the Province’s river systems. Some of
                these have been relatively minor, but others have proved totally
                destructive.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Even those Members who might not list fish
                kills following pollution incidents as being items at the top of
                their daily political agendas cannot, in recent times, have
                escaped hearing the news of disasters which have hit the
                River&nbsp;Bush, the Upper&nbsp;Bann, the Blackwater and the
                Sixmilewater, which is in my constituency. There was also
                another incident elsewhere, just a couple of weeks ago. I could
                go on&nbsp;— the killing is endless.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My close association with the Ulster angling
                scene and the condition of our waterways could, of course, be
                seen as a narrow and specific interest, but I feel that it
                heightens one’s appreciation of the whole spectrum of
                environmental degradation and highlights the concerns of other
                environmental interests about matters such as planning,
                industrial infrastructure, the impact on tourism, the marine
                environment, wildlife, farming practices, and so on.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In recounting a little story I want to make a
                serious point. An individual who wished to make contact with the
                Friends of the Earth organisation telephoned the Department of
                the Environment to enquire about telephone numbers and received
                the testy reply &quot;Look, this is the Department of the
                Environment, we are no friends of the earth&quot;.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The widespread popular cynicism concerning
                the sincerity of numerous governmental assertions about
                protection of the environment is, I believe, well founded. Many
                issues are facing this Assembly, but I feel that a concerted
                drive to protect, and be seen to be protecting the environment,
                properly and effectively, would receive enthusiastic support
                from all parties and the majority of the electorate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Ulster Unionist Party has long argued
                that the poacher and gamekeeper structure, which was highlighted
                in the Rossi Report, should end, and let me say that I am not
                satisfied that yet another executive agency should be the model
                to be considered.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If Members have not read a
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland Audit&nbsp;Office report published in
                April this year on the control of river pollution, they should
                obtain a copy; it makes very interesting reading. I am not
                interested in engaging in some form of
                Department-of-theEnvironment-bashing contest. I want to see
                efficiency in all areas of Government but that efficiency must
                not be achieved at the expense of accountability.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Here is what the Ulster Angling Federation
                said about the Comptroller and Auditor&nbsp;General’s report
                earlier this year:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;This scathing report comes as no
                surprise. It confirms what anglers have known for years. Raw
                sewage periodically enters most of our rivers from treatment
                works and storm overflows. Consented discharges to our rivers
                from industry often fail to meet conditions imposed and are
                often ignored by the agency which is supposed to protect the
                rivers — the Department of the Environment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the rare occasions when prosecutions are
                taken, the courts impose derisory penalties when the maximum
                fine is £20,000. The poacher/gamekeeper situation whereby the
                Department of the Environment’s Water&nbsp;Service is policed
                by the Environment and Heritage Service — another Department
                of the Environment agency — must change.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">England, Wales and Scotland have
                environmental protection agencies independent of Government. We
                suspect that if Northern&nbsp;Ireland had an independent agency,
                it would expose the disgraceful state of most of our sewage and
                water treatment plants and would be a major embarrassment to
                Government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Lord Dubs recently announced that much of
                Northern Ireland’s sewerage system was close to collapsing and
                that an extra £50&nbsp;million per annum was required to bring
                the system up to standard. This is a welcome recognition by the
                Government of the problem, and a change from a succession of
                Ministers who could only talk about a clean and a pleasant land
                where sewage treatment plants smelt like roses.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am reluctant to argue for a simple division
                of the existing Department, and while I favour the concept of a
                powerful watchdog body, I most certainly have no intention of
                creating a new quango. My point is that we do need a vehicle
                empowered to be the effective guardian of the natural
                environment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need to get this right, and we should be
                prepared to take a little time to do it. There are subject areas
                within the existing Department which are properly the remit of
                local government. If these were to revert to local government
                —and that begs a further question regarding the possible
                changes to the existing local government structure — then
                self-evidently such areas would not need to be covered by
                branches of the Department of the Environment, nor for that
                matter by executive agencies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It seems obvious to me that there are
                existing branches and agencies in the Department of the
                Environment which could be transferred to other Departments. One
                might cite for example the Public Record Office and Land
                Registry, which could be returned to their traditional home in
                the Department of Finance.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Maybe we should focus on maintaining an
                environmental Department centred around an existing branch to
                deal specifically with environmental conservation, protection
                and preservation. Such a department would have an environmental
                impact assessment role in respect of all other Departments, but
                this role could not be permitted to become a process of
                bureaucratic strangulation of the function of the other
                Departments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Herein is the nub of the issue. I recognise
                that there are many possible permutations, and I do not want to
                run headlong into change for the sake of change. I want, through
                consultation, to arrive at a situation whereby environmental
                protection in Northern Ireland becomes an example to the world
                of how things should be done. While sharing the impatience of
                others to get on with the job, I would caution against undue
                haste in respect of any piecemeal revamp or interim or temporary
                change.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The people of Northern&nbsp;Ireland deserve
                value for money, given that they have had some 30 years of an
                ever expanding public-service sector which fails my test of
                efficiency and value for money.</p>
