                </font></b><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is with regret that I advise the Assembly
                of the tragic death in a racing accident of the motorcycle ace
                Mr&nbsp;Joey&nbsp;Dunlop.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure
                (Mr&nbsp;McGimpsey): </b>There can be no one in the Assembly, in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland or further afield, or in the world of
                sport generally, who has not yet heard the tragic news of the
                death of Joey Dunlop. He reached the pinnacle of his sport of
                road racing. He was idolised by legions of fans throughout the
                world. His untimely death has left a void, both in Northern
                Ireland and in motorcycle racing, that will never be filled.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Only two weeks ago, I had the pleasure of
                meeting Joey at a reception in Ballymoney. I was immediately
                struck by his modesty and the high esteem in which he was held
                by the people of his home town. He was never too busy to help
                others. He found time to carry out charity work for those less
                well off in Romania and the Balkan countries. His huge talent on
                the motorcycle was matched by his generosity of spirit. We will
                never see his like again.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am sure I speak for all Members and for
                everyone in Northern&nbsp;Ireland in offering my condolences to
                his wife Linda and to his family and friends.
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland has lost one of her finest sons: Joey
                Dunlop.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister (Mr Mallon):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I add my condolences and those of my party to
                those expressed by the Minister. Very few sportsmen, from
                whatever sport, are known by their Christian names. Joey Dunlop
                was never known as anything in Northern Ireland but Joey, and
                everybody knew immediately who was being talking about. They
                also knew the quality of commitment and expertise that he
                brought to his sport.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is a tragedy, not just for his sport,
                for his family and for his community, but for those of us who
                value sport in our lives and who value the example of someone
                who really did set a remarkable example of courage down through
                the years. He will be sadly missed but we are the better for
                having had Joey as a representative of our community, both at
                home and abroad, for so many years.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr Ian Paisley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When I paid tribute to his last races and the
                victories that he won — three in a row — little did I think
                that I would be standing here today to lament with all of
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland and his fans throughout the world the
                tragic death of Joey Dunlop. It has been well said that great
                grief is not good at talking. The language of grief is the tear,
                the lump in the throat, and the feeling of a kindly pressure
                upon the hand. We want Linda and the family to know that this is
                how we feel today.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To the God of all comfort and grace, we
                commend the family at this time. They are passing through a very
                dark valley, and they need all the support and prayers that we
                can offer them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We salute the memory of Joey Dunlop. He was a
                legend in his own right, and he can never be replaced. He
                remains, and will remain, the &quot;King of the Road&quot;.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McElduff:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. As a
                member of the Culture, Arts and Leisure Committee and on behalf
                of my party I add my voice to the messages of sympathy to
                Joey&nbsp;Dunlop’s wife Linda and their children.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We all regarded Joey Dunlop as a tremendous
                sporting hero and a great sporting ambassador who achieved
                excellence in his lifetime, in his disciplined contribution to
                his sport. His death is a great loss to the entire community.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Neeson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On behalf of the Alliance Party and the Women’s
                Coalition, I would like to express the great shock I felt when I
                heard the news yesterday of Joey Dunlop’s untimely death. He
                was undoubtedly one of Northern Ireland’s greatest
                ambassadors. He had support across the community, and he was a
                giant among sports people in the Province. He was a legend in
                his lifetime.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I met him on several occasions, and he was a
                very sincere, warm family man. Not only did he care for his own,
                but this modest man cared for others, particularly in the
                Balkans.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the last Assembly Joey was honoured by the
                Speaker when a special event was organised for him in 1985. I
                had hoped that this Assembly would have a similar opportunity.
                Sadly, this is not to be. To his wife Linda, his family and the
                rest of his friends, we extend our deepest sympathy at this very
                sad hour.</p>

                Party, I express our sympathy to the family circle on their sad
                and tragic loss and offer our thoughts and prayers to them at
                this time.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </font></b><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the sitting of 27&nbsp;June, a number
                of matters were drawn to the attention of the
                Deputy&nbsp;Speakers with which I will now deal.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As recorded in Hansard, page 357,
                Mr&nbsp;Gregory Campbell asked for a ruling on an alleged threat
                from another Member. From a reading of Hansard I can say that
                there is nothing unparliamentary in the language that was used.
                However, from viewing the videotape recording it is clear that,
                on all sides, tempers were beginning to rise. I would remind
                Members that they are all required, whether speaking or
                sedentary, to observe due courtesy to other Members at all
                times, particularly, but not only, during sittings of the
                Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During a later part of the same speech —
                Hansard, page&nbsp;358 — an exchange between Mr&nbsp;Conor&nbsp;Murphy
                and Junior Minister Mr&nbsp;Dermot&nbsp;Nesbitt revolved around
                whether Members should address each other in the Chamber even
                when asking a direct question. Members should always speak
                through the Chair, and should be aware that when in a speech
                they say &quot;you&quot;, they will be taken as referring to the
                Chair. Even when making a request that another Member give way,
                the request should be made through the Chair, although clearly
                it will be for the Member speaking to decide whether he will
                give way.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would remind Members that there is no such
                thing in parliamentary practice as a point of information. A
                Member may seek to intervene, and the Member speaking may choose
                to give way or otherwise. Members may also make points of order,
                which are ruled upon from the Chair.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Also, Mr&nbsp;Hussey — Hansard,
                page&nbsp;363 — asked for a ruling on whether unparliamentary
                language had been used when a Member referred to civil servants.
                I have read Hansard and there is nothing unparliamentary about
                what was said. However, perhaps this is an opportunity to set
                down how such references should be made. References to officials
                should always be to an official position rather than to a named
                individual. It is in the nature of government that officials
                carry out a wide range of responsibilities on behalf of their
                Ministers. Officials given discretion in these circumstances
                must be accountable for their decisions in the same way as
                Ministers. Equally, officials should expect some degree of
                protection from public castigation because they cannot respond
                for themselves in an equally public way. However, officials who
                have made public statements on their own initiative cannot
                necessarily expect that these statements will be immune from
                comment in the Assembly or indeed outside it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I remind Members that it is not in order to
                refer to officials of the Assembly at any time. Clerks and their
                staff are here to assist Members in the performance of their
                duties but are at all times under the direction of Members.
                Members themselves must bear responsibility for the actions
                carried out on their behalf. On occasion, this means, of course,
                that the Chair must take responsibility for certain matters.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Shannon:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr Speaker. I want to
                ask a question about Hansard, page&nbsp;334. This relates to the
                arts and culture debate last week. How come there are 11 or 12
                spelling mistakes in the Ulster-Scots transcription? I would
                like your assurance, Mr&nbsp;Speaker, that whenever Ulster-Scots
                is used in the Assembly, it will be transcribed correctly in
                Hansard.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will attempt to review the Hansard record
                as requested by the Member. I would, however, draw two matters
                to his attention. First, a transcription is provided, not a
                translation. Secondly, I regret to say that in trying to provide
                this facility, we have had substantial difficulty in finding any
                agreed grammar or syntax for the language in question. I will,
                however, review the matter and respond to the Member.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Shannon:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I gave the Hansard staff a copy of what I
                said, word for word. They asked for it, and I gave it to them.
                However, they ignored it and put their own grammar in. I took
                the time and made the effort to have it done correctly through
                the Ulster-Scots Heritage Society, so they had absolutely no
                reason for not transcribing it correctly.</p>
                <i>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order. I fear that the Member does not
                entirely understand the Hansard process. If the Member reads
                what is said in English in Hansard, and then views the video
                tape of what was said, he will find — on occasions to his
                pleasure — that the editorial staff have made substantial
                corrections to clarify what was said in English.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Official Report is not meant to be
                verbatim; it is meant to be a proper report. I suggest that when
                Members read what they have said they will often be rather more
                pleased than they are sometimes justified in being. Having said
                all that, and being no authority at all on Ulster-Scots, I will,
                as I have said, review the matter that the Member has raised and
                be in touch with him about it.</p>

                </font></b><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With permission, Mr Speaker, we wish to make
                a statement on the agenda for Government. This is the first
                opportunity we have had to make a statement to the House on this
                issue. I am making this statement on behalf of the Executive as
                a whole, and individual Ministers will, in the course of this
                week, be making more detailed statements on aspects of the
                agenda.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Following last Thursday’s Executive
                Committee meeting the Deputy First Minister and I announced an
                agenda of actions to address some key concerns and help to
                improve and modernise services. We wanted to announce the agenda
                at that stage when the Executive was together — giving visible
                expression to our overarching theme: &quot;Moving Forward
                Together&quot;. However, the Executive recognises that full and
                further information must be presented to the Assembly, which is
                why we are making this detailed statement this morning.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Devolution is about local politicians taking
                responsibility and decisions on local issues. People will expect
                the Executive and the Assembly to pursue policies and programmes
                which make a difference to their lives. We, for our part, need
                to listen to people to find out what is important to them and
                what changes they would like to see. In taking forward the work
                on the programme for Government with the Assembly and its
                Committees, we will be doing just that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We will need to decide on strategies,
                objectives, policies and programmes which will help to improve
                and modernise Northern Ireland in the first few years of this
                new century. In doing so, we will wish to draw together the work
                of different Departments and agencies. Often it is only when we
                bring together the resources of different Departments that we
                can start to crack the major problems that we face. At the same
                time we will need to decide how to make best use of the
                resources available, and link the programme for Government to
                the budget. We are going to have to face difficult decisions on
                priorities. We will be seeking views on what our programme for
                Government should contain. Ministers are already seeking
                Committees’ initial views on the programme, but I can assure
                Members that we will be coming back on a number of occasions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Later this year we will be presenting the
                outcome of the work on the programme in draft form for the
                Assembly and its Committees to consider. The programme for
                Government will take effect in the next and following years.
                Preparatory work is proceeding. Our more immediate issue is what
                we should and can do in the remainder of this year to start us
                in the right direction.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have identified five clear areas in the
                agenda covering the economy, health and education, the
                environment, tackling disadvantage and social exclusion and
                modern and accessible public services, and we have identified
                actions which will contribute to dealing with those areas. We
                wish to see a step change in the economy by which we mean
                increased growth and employment taking advantage fully of the
                opportunities that a peaceful society will bring. There is
                significant scope for our economy to advance. We should
                therefore ensure that our economic development agencies are best
                organised to meet the new challenges. This change was also
                recommended by the ‘Strategy 2010’ review.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need to encourage and develop the
                information-age society. In the short term we intend to help
                accelerate work on the ‘Leapfrog to the Information Age’
                initiative, which is intended to progress Northern Ireland
                towards a highly attractive, dynamic and supportive
                knowledge-based society.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On 19&nbsp;June the Minister for Higher and
                Further Education, Training and Employment announced the new
                support programme for university research to the House, which
                will develop the local universities’ research capacity and
                strengthen their research base, increasing the amount of
                research of the highest international standard. The support
                programme will be funded partly by the private sector. The work
                on developing the research programme is included in our agenda
                and it will help to contribute to the creation of the
                knowledge-based society.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive also agrees that we need to do
                more for the long-suffering agriculture industry. We are working
                for the achievement of low BSE incidence status, and we have
                allocated £500,000 to enable the beef industry to avail fully
                of export opportunities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are also addressing the need of farmers to
                benefit from the new technology-based society. We will be
                enhancing the access of farmers to information technology,
                focusing particularly on farmers in the west, where progress in
                training farmers and members of farm families has been slower
                than in the east of Northern Ireland. Farmers will also be given
                electronic access to high quality, user-friendly business
                support information to help them run their businesses.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Better health and education are important to
                us all. We want to ensure that our schools have the information
                technology they need to improve the skills of our young people.
                We also want to improve the condition of schools, in
                particularly to upgrade sub-standard facilities in smaller
                primary schools. On health we need to improve the situation with
                waiting lists, and we have allocated £5&nbsp;million for this
                programme.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must also give emphasis to the importance
                of public health. The Health Minister is planning to launch a
                new public-health strategy to improve our health status, which
                is among the worst in Europe, and to address the significant
                inequalities that exist. The strategy will be wide ranging and
                will include accident prevention, the need to improve the health
                and well-being of the elderly and action on the high levels of
                teenage parenthood in Northern Ireland, and it will involve
                other Departments where relevant.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister (Mr Mallon):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive has also agreed that we should
                highlight examples of actions which we wish to undertake in the
                coming weeks and months, areas where urgent and early action is
                needed. The agenda demonstrates that the Executive Committee can
                agree, and has agreed, a package of measures targeting specific
                needs. These measures are additional to the already agreed
                programmes and activities which Ministers and their Departments
                will be taking forward and developing this year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In drawing up the agenda we have decided that
                it should be resourced from a modernising fund. That fund will
                support the projects that we are highlighting this morning,
                amounting to £27.6&nbsp;million in total; a second tranche will
                be available to support additional actions later in this year.
                Allocations made from the fund are solely for the specific
                purposes identified.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First&nbsp;Minister has already detailed
                some actions to improve the economy and to achieve better
                education and health. I will now cover actions which will
                support our aims of tackling disadvantage and social exclusion,
                making the environment safer and providing improved, modern and
                accessible services.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must tackle disadvantage and social
                exclusion and the agenda includes a number of actions which are
                intended to do just that. We know of the concerns that there
                will be a gap in EU funding for certain groups and projects.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have allocated £3.2&nbsp;million to
                tackle that problem. We want to do more for the disabled. A
                number of actions in the agenda will benefit the disabled
                including housing adaptations, work on accessibility to cultural
                and sporting events and the implementation of the new disability
                legislation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have also committed ourselves to important
                initiatives on targeting social need (TSN) and equality
                legislation. On TSN we have allocated finance to enhance
                research so that we can ensure that the programme is fully
                evaluated and monitored. Work will commence on a single equality
                Act to extend protection to groups not already covered by
                anti-discrimination legislation and, where appropriate, to
                harmonise protection upwards. This is a key objective.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In relation to the environment, we need to
                address the most urgent health and safety work on the railways
                pending the completion of the railway task force’s work on the
                long-term future of the rail system. We are aware of the need to
                improve safety on our roads, where we continue to see an
                appalling loss of life and injury. The additional resources will
                allow us to appoint 10 new road safety education officers to
                enhance contacts with schools. There will also be an
                intensification of the road safety advertising campaign,
                focusing on young drivers and, especially, drink driving.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With our aim of a better, safer environment
                we will also target some resources on improving health and
                safety at sports grounds.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to planning matters, we are
                providing additional resources to initiate work quickly on the
                Belfast metropolitan plan covering the six relevant district
                council areas. We are also taking steps to reduce the planning
                applications backlog.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We also plan an arts and culture programme of
                events to develop a better appreciation of our cultural
                diversity.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The people of Northern&nbsp;Ireland deserve
                better and more modern services. We will set in hand over the
                coming months a fundamental appraisal of the structures and
                location of public service. We will open a representative office
                in Brussels to improve our links with Europe. We will progress
                North/South co-operation through the establishment of the
                tourism company by the autumn and an action plan to reduce the
                barriers in place for those who move from one side of the border
                to the other on a short-or long-term basis.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The agenda represents examples of what we
                will be doing. The actions indicate our determination to work
                together for the benefit of all. We know that we can make real
                improvements to people’s lives when we move forward
                effectively together.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Perhaps I can answer that question, Mr
                Speaker. We have endeavoured to identify resources that can be
                used for the agenda for Government and group them together under
                the heading of a modernisation fund. We intend to have a second
                tranche in the autumn; part of the reason for this is to allow
                time for further work to be done on this for consideration after
                the summer. We must be prudent since, by then, there may be
                other activities requiring extra resources that will have to be
                considered. We will decide on the extent of the second tranche
                after the summer recess.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I too welcome the statement and the level of
                detail that the Ministers have provided on what they can achieve
                over the next number of months.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.00 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I certainly hope that the fundamental
                appraisal of the structures and location of public services will
                ultimately lead to a decentralisation of public sector
                employment, because that is central to the well-being of rural
                and border constituencies. I also hope that it will lead to a
                rationalisation of the plethora of boards, trusts, councils and
                agencies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My specific point though is much more
                parochial. I welcome the fact that there is going to be more
                investment in and new structures for North/South co-operation.
                However, it is not just in the public sector where we need some
                regulation and some help. Can the Ministers tell us how they can
                reduce the disadvantages people experience in living on one side
                of the border and working on the other. They suffer difficulties
                with currency, taxation and all of the problems associated with
                having banking and other services in another jurisdiction.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Member for the question. The
                issue of decentralisation will be central to the review of
                public services. It would be unwise to speculate on the nature
                or the extent of that review at this stage. However, it is a
                review which must be fundamental in the sense that the Member
                has spoken about. Like him, I am aware of the difficulties that
                people face in their everyday lives and in the area of
                North/South co-operation. Our office, which has overall
                responsibility for that, is becoming more and more aware of the
                difficulties faced by citizens moving North or South to pursue
                careers. Difficulties arise for such citizens especially if they
                are establishing residence. The problems are not dissimilar in
                many ways to difficulties encountered between other European
                states.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Therefore, we propose to consider ways in
                which institutions, public and private, can reduce obstacles in
                the range of areas that matter to each person who falls into
                this category. Such areas include housing, health, education,
                childcare, taxation, social security, pensions, vehicle
                registration, telephones and banking. People face a very
                comprehensive range of problems, and we hope to be able to bring
                in agreed proposals before the plenary North/South Ministerial
                Council meeting planned for early autumn.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr Ian Paisley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is to be regretted that the Executive has
                set a precedent by going to the press before consulting the
                House about its statements. It would be better if the House were
                to hear first what it intends to do and what public moneys it
                intends to spend and had the first opportunity to question
                Ministers about these matters.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The statement says that the Executive
                recognises that full and further information is needed. Would
                the Chief Minister care to tell the House what that full and
                further information is that was not given at the press
                conference? That is the first thing that the House is entitled
                to know.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When it comes to the matter of money for
                helping our beef industry — when we do obtain low BSE
                incidence status — the statement says we have a sum of
                £500,000. However, the following paragraph talks about farmers.
                How much money will be made available directly to the farmers,
                because it is they who are facing the burden and heat of the
                day? I do not hear many meat plant owners or directors saying
                that they are going to commit suicide or that the banks are
                pressing them and they have to buy a smaller car. The farmers
                are feeling those pressures. Perhaps the First Minister will
                tell us the amount of money he is prepared to give to farmers to
                help them look after their farms as time progresses.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Page 3 of the agenda for Government states
                that there is a gap in EU funding for certain groups and
                projects. Will the Minister list the groups and projects that he
                has in mind? I am sure that the people concerned are anxious to
                know whether they are included in that list.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The statement refers to a better appreciation
                of our cultural diversity. Our cultural diversity would be best
                served if people who have been attending church services over
                many years were permitted to return home from them. We should
                face up to the sort of cultural pressure that is put on people
                attending their places of worship on the sabbath day — a
                practice that has continued for at least 150 years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the £400,000 per annum, which
                the Minister of Finance and Personnel said would have to be
                spent, what percentage of that money will go towards the
                salaries of the people employed in the Brussels Office?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Paisley has raised a range of points.
                First, on his point about cultural diversity, he was of course
                referring to the difficulties at Drumcree. The Assembly has no
                responsibility for that matter, although many might wish that we
                had such responsibility. There are a range of views in the
                Assembly on that issue. The hon Member will recall that I
                expressed my views on that subject at some length at the
                weekend. I may repeat them on occasion, but this is not the
                time. We are discussing the agenda for Government at present.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I understand the points that were raised
                about holding a press conference on Thursday, before making this
                statement. One has to bear in mind the consequences of the
                Assembly’s sitting for only two days a week. If we were to try
                to adopt the rule that is honoured sometimes more in the breach
                than in the observance across the water, we would have
                considerable difficulty, unless the Assembly sittings were to
                change. I am not suggesting that the sittings of the Assembly
                should be changed, as there were good reasons for choosing the
                pattern that we have adopted. However, there will be days when
                the Assembly does not sit, and following an Executive meeting,
                such as we had on Thursday, there will be important matters to
                put into the public domain. I believe that our course of action
                was reasonable. My statement contains further information than
                that contained in the press release last week. I cannot look at
                that press statement now and compare it with this one, but I am
                sure that this one contains further information. Even more
                information will be available during the week, as Ministers make
                detailed statements on the measures that I and the Deputy First
                Minister have outlined.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member raised a number of questions with
                regard to the funding arrangements for agriculture. Dr Paisley
                knows that none of this money will go directly to farmers.
                European state aid rules prohibit the Executive from offering
                direct grants to farmers, and the Assembly cannot breach those
                rules. It would be nice if we could, but we cannot. There is
                £500,000 to take advantage of the low-incidence BSE status
                which we hope will be achieved before long. Arrangements will
                have to be made, but it is too early to say precisely how that
                money will be spent.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We wish to offer the industry whatever
                support is needed. That could take the form of additional
                marketing support, or resources could be deployed to support
                meat plants taking necessary measures. All of this is, of
                course, subject to discussions with the industry and the
                European Commission.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There will be an additional £560,000 for the
                other measures included in the statement regarding enhanced
                access to information technology. The sum for helping small
                farmers run their businesses more competitively by using
                information and communication technology will be £240,000.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a problem with gap funding in the
                community and voluntary sector, since the detailed negotiations
                on the next round of European structural funds will not be
                completed until autumn. We are pursuing this matter as
                vigorously as possible. We are on target to meet the autumn
                deadline and have managed to make up some ground on the issue
                since resumption.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not, of course, in a position to list
                all the community projects in receipt of EU funding or to say
                which projects will be assisted by this gap funding. The
                Departments and other organisations responsible for overseeing
                these funds are seeking to identify projects facing a threat to
                which assistance could be given. Not all schemes will require
                such assistance, since not all of them have spent all their
                money. This will be taken into account when deciding whether gap
                funding will be supported. Not all existing schemes supported
                under Peace I will be supported under Peace II, a consideration
                one must also take into account.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The funding for the European office includes
                both capital and recurrent expenditure. I am not presently in a
                position to make a statement on how much will be spent on
                salaries.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Maskey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle.
                Cuirim fáilte roimh an ráiteas na maidne seo faoin chlár
                rialtais. Ba mhaith liom díriú ar chupla pointe agus cupla
                ceist a chur.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the statement. In essence, the
                Executive is trying to develop a coherent way of redistributing
                the available finance, particularly in the run up to the
                agreement on a programme for Government. I suppose suspension
                has prevented the various departmental Committees from having
                any real input into this agenda.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In specific terms, I welcome the announcement
                of £3.2&nbsp;million towards bridging the gap in European
                funding. The First Minister and the Deputy First Minister have
                already addressed this matter, but I am anxious to know, if
                possible at this stage, how far that £3.2&nbsp;million will go
                towards meeting the needs of these groups?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Can the First Minister or the Deputy First
                Minister tell us when we shall be able to measure what effect
                the new TSN will have on those areas most in need?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Member for his question. It is
                impossible to make a projection on the £3.2&nbsp;million, since
                there is never enough money in any allocation, however much it
                might be. However, it is an indication of our intent to ensure
                that whatever hiatus there may be is dealt with as effectively
                as possible.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the Member will realise, new TSN is a huge
                cross-departmental task. The Departments have made their initial
                responses, which are being assessed. It is very difficult to
                ensure that commitments under new TSN are carried out in a
                co-ordinated way so that essential assessment can be made of
                them. We have agreed ongoing assessment to monitor the effects.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Regarding the specific element, one of the
                important factors in new TSN is making sure that we have the
                statistical analyses required for the basic assumptions. No
                formula ever works completely, but we have to get a programme in
                terms of those analyses, whatever form or shape they take, so
                that we know we are working on the basis of proper information.
                If we have, and when we have, as we will have, the proper
                information, it will be for the entire political process to
                ensure that the new TSN is working as it was designed to work,
                to benefit those who are disadvantaged or marginalised in
                whatever way they are.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, the Deputy First Minister did not
                have the opportunity to answer the question I asked last week
                about the new office in Brussels. How does the Executive propose
                to recognise the work of the Northern Ireland Centre in Europe
                (NICE)?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The proposal is to reorganise the development
                agencies as suggested in ‘Strategy 2010’. We need to bring
                that work up-to-date, and we hope that there will be a number of
                options to be looked at and considered. I cannot add to that at
                this stage. There will be consultation with the Assembly, with
                industry and with other interested bodies. The object of the
                exercise is to ensure that we are providing an efficient and
                effective service in support of economic development. It is
                about delivery of service. The objective is to be
                customer-orientated, open, accountable and accessible. I know
                that sounds a little like &quot;motherhood and apple pie&quot;,
                but the objective is to try to streamline in that direction.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the question of the European office, yes,
                we acknowledge the work that has been done by the Northern
                Ireland Centre in Europe. That has been quite important, and I
                am sure that it will continue to be important. Discussions are
                ongoing between our office and NICE about the future. I am not
                in a position to say more than that because the discussions have
                not been concluded. We would like to see a co-operative
                relationship with NICE, but we need to know first of all what
                NICE’s plans are. How does it propose to carry forward its
                work and how can we help it?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We welcome the statement and particularly the
                reference to the joined-up aspect of government which we believe
                will be very important in future years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister mentioned, and we welcome
                it, a plan of action on the high levels of teenage parenthood in
                Northern Ireland. The Women’s Coalition would be particularly
                interested in an explanation of what type of action is
                envisaged.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, there was a reference to the aim of
                achieving a better and safer environment. While we welcome this
                important move with regard to road and rail safety, we would
                like to understand why there has been no mention, indeed, a sad
                lack of mention, of tackling the important issues of pollution,
                recycling and waste disposal. What are the intentions there?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Member for the questions. We have
                to focus on the fact that this agenda for government is not
                all-encompassing. It does not claim to be and, by its very
                nature, it is not. It is a selection of areas that should be
                dealt with, and I repeat that it is not totally comprehensive.
                It cannot be. I recognise the problems that the Member mentions,
                for example pollution. It is something which I feel very
                strongly about, but that will be dealt with by the Departments.
                I said Departments, because it is a matter that concerns the
                administration and budgets of a number of Departments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Teenage parenthood is a cross-cutting issue
                and will be dealt with by the Department of Health. It is going
                to be central to the Minister’s approach and to her proposals.
                The equality aspect will also affect the Office of the Centre.
                The Office of the First and the Deputy First Ministers and the
                Minister of Health will both be dealing very closely with the
                matter, as will the Department of Education.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When we discuss this programme for government
                we see how much there is in it which is actually cross-cutting.
                Nothing can simply be corralled in terms of one Department, and
                the more we are able to equip ourselves to deal with the
                cross-cutting issues, the more effectively we will deal with
                them.</p>

                Ministers for their report. My question relates to the reference
                made by the Deputy First Minister to bridging moneys for
                community groups, hitherto supported by &quot;Peace I&quot;,
                during the gap until &quot;Peace II&quot; flows out. There has
                been recent disquieting evidence that some &quot;Peace I&quot;
                supported projects are unlikely to be sustainable in the long
                term. Indeed, in some cases there has been the possibility of
                the dubious use of money by such projects. Can either the First
                or the Deputy First Minister say how such bridging moneys are to
                be targeted to avoid the repetition of such mistakes in the

                cover or help with the gap that the community and voluntary
                sector can expect is in the region of £2&nbsp;million from the
                Department for Social Development and £1.2&nbsp;million from

                bridge the gap. Obviously that help will be selective. It will
                depend on circumstances that I mentioned earlier. Whether
                projects are likely to be supported under Peace II is one
                consideration that will have to be made.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member mentioned the question of whether
                all proposals and schemes supported under Peace I have been as
                well administered as they could have been. This, of course, is a
                perennial concern with regard to European money generally and,
                indeed, the peace programme in particular. When we were in
                Brussels, Commissioner Barnier, who is responsible for this,
                made it very clear that one of his key concerns is that European
                money is spent in an appropriate manner. He wanted to be assured
                that the local Administration responsible for supervising
                expenditures would take all the measures possible to ensure that
                there is not misappropriation of funding. In the United Kingdom
                we have a very strong framework through audit and other means to
                ensure that money is spent appropriately. That is reflected in
                reports made by the Audit Office from time to time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The point that the hon Member made about
                sustainability is very appropriate. We cannot repeat too often
                that this is likely to be the last significant amount of money
                coming from Europe under the likes of the peace or regional
                programmes. With a change in priorities in the European Union
                after enlargement it is unlikely that this will come again for
                us. Consequently, all community programmes of this nature need
                to have a strategy to deal with this. They need to have it
                thought through so that in a number of years’ time they do not
                simply fall off the edge of the cliff. They need to have worked
                out how a project is going to be sustained or how it is going to
                be handed over to someone else or completed in the period
                concerned.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At present we are simply providing funding
                for a short gap until the autumn when we expect the money from
                the next round of structural funds to be available. The amount
                of funding may be modest, but I am sure that it will be welcomed
                by the community sector.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Lewsley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the statement this morning and, in
                particular, references to equality and disability. Are we
                talking about the budget for housing adaptations? I assume this
                will come out of the housing budget. Does the Deputy First
                Minister agree that part of the money for that should come from
                the health budget given that some of the services delivered in
                housing adaptations are delivered by occupational therapists? I
                welcome the addition of 10 more road safety officers and the
                fact that support staff are to be put in place to enable this
                programme to be delivered and implemented properly.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is a very relevant question. We all know
                that one of the difficulties with housing adaptations for the
                disabled is the logjam in the occupational therapist’s
                department and that the Housing Executive cannot move until it
                receives the reports from them. The resulting delays are quite
                staggering. I do not blame individual occupational therapists,
                nor do I blame them collectively. There are not enough
                occupational therapists to deal with the growing problem. This
                is one of the attempts to ease that burden. There was discussion
                as to whether it would be administered by the Department of
                Health, Social Services and Public Safety or the Department for
                Social Development, and we decided upon the latter.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The £2&nbsp;million will help provide much
                needed assistance in this important area, which demands
                continued growth and places pressures on other parts of the
                housing budget. The Housing Executive has confirmed that it will
                be able to spend the additional £2&nbsp;million on the basis of
                referrals that have already been completed by occupational
                therapists.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the health budget this year an extra
                £200,000 is being spent on the occupational therapy service. A
                further £400,000 has been put into the budget for disability
                aids and appliances. We should all be looking very carefully at
                how the Department is equipped to deal with these occupational
                therapy reports, because unless we deal with them, no matter how
                much money is allocated, if the blockage remains, delay will be
                inevitable.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dodds:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the First Minister agree that the
                information provided to the House today is substantially less
                detailed than that which was provided to the media on Thursday?
                Will he confirm that the media were provided with the detailed
                figures allocated to various programmes and Departments on
                Thursday, which were printed in some papers on Friday, and that
                this statement today does not contain many of these.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No reference is made anywhere to the figure
                of £2&nbsp;million for housing adaptations for the disabled in
                this statement. There is not further and fuller information;
                there is substantially less information. That is a disgrace and
                a shame and it is discourteous to the House. Just because he
                wanted to get a press headline on Thursday, the First Minister
                could not wait to make an announcement to the House today. Will
                he not also agree that other decisions were taken at the
                Executive which, for reasons of confidentiality, I cannot make
                reference to, but which will no doubt be made public in due
                course? Those decisions were not released to the press in
                advance of a statement to the House.</p>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a second point, may I ask the First
                Minister, and I would be interested in the Deputy First Minister’s
                comments on this also — I suspect that he was in the lead on
                this one — if he intends to continue as part of his great
                theme of moving forward together, his futile action against the
                DUP while, at the same time, refusing to take any action against
                Sinn Féin/IRA Ministers for their complicity in the murder of
                Mr&nbsp;McCoy or their refusal to fly the national flag on
                Government buildings?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Can we now get a detailed breakdown of
                allocations for programmes from each Department? The First
                Minister may need to refer to Thursday’s press statement and,
                although that information was not in today’s statement, it
                would be of considerable help to the House if he would read it
                out.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the statements we will have today will
                be from the Finance Minister on the normal monitoring round. As
                Members know, in the course of a year, there are a number of
                monitoring rounds where we consider the allocation of moneys to
                be made available through extra receipts or underspends and so
                on. That will happen in the normal way. Last Thursday we made
                the significant point — and I think everybody in Northern
                Ireland recognised this — that this Administration is
                determined to make a difference; it will not simply be a
                continuation of direct rule. It involves locally elected Members
                working together, identifying their priorities and pursuing
                them. This we wish to do. The Minister has repeatedly asked me
                if we will continue with various matters. We might very well ask
                the Minister if he is going to resign and continue to be part of

                small farmers with information technology and communication
                technology. That adds up to a total of £1·3 million.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is not a panacea for agriculture’s
                ills, but it lays a basis for dealing with the question of
                markets when the BSE issue is resolved. It has been recognised
                by the agricultural community as a good step, and I commend it
                to the Assembly as such.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Close:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I rise with trepidation after that
                ministerial tiff. I hope that if Ministers are treated like
                that, the Deputy First Minister will not launch into attacks on
                ordinary Members.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">By and large, I welcome the allocation of
                moneys in this agenda for government, but I am extremely
                disappointed by the manner in which it was done. Do the First
                Minister, the Deputy First Minister and the other members of the
                Executive, not recognise that this establishment operates on a
                Committee system? There are scrutiny Committees. Why was the
                Finance and Personnel Committee, for example, not taken fully
                into consideration before these sums were allocated?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In this House — and certainly in this party
                — we do not want to be faced with what can only be referred to
                as a form of drip-feed of the programme for government. That
                must be made known in full. I fear that this is the start of the
                drip-feed, and I seek reassurances that I am wrong about this.
                Also, how was this money arrived at? How much of this money came
                from the Chancellor of the Exchequer’s March Budget? How much
                of this money is end-of-year flexibility and how much has been
                arrived at by the monitoring round which was discussed by the
                Finance and Personnel Committee? Can the First and the Deputy
                First Ministers understand how I felt early on Thursday morning
                when, having attended a meeting the previous day of the Finance
                and Personnel Committee, I discovered that I had been denied
                access to these additional figures? The press rang me up to ask
                for a comment on the agenda for government, and I did not know
                what they were talking about.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I raise these points in all sincerity, not to
                make some cheap criticism but to enable us in this House to
                begin operating fully, as it was intended that we should. The
                Scrutiny Committees need to be able to function fully. I have
                concerns, as a member of the Finance and Personnel Committee,
                about the amount of information that is made available to us. If
                we are to perform a proper scrutiny role, particularly when it
                relates to finance, it is vital that we are equipped with the
                full information.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I can understand the Member’s annoyance at
                being asked for comment on figures on Thursday morning. I would
                have been equally annoyed had the journalists phoned me; indeed
                they would have got a pretty sharp response. There is a serious
                weakness somewhere in the system if details of policies, which
                at that stage were entirely confidential and had not then been
                considered by the Executive, were being circulated. This is a
                matter of great concern. We are ourselves greatly concerned
                about confidentiality problems with regard to Executive
                business. On Thursday morning nothing had been decided, and
                these matters were waiting to be considered by the Executive.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I appreciate the concern about making a press
                statement before coming to this Chamber, but if we were always
                to come here first, we would have problems with the sittings. If
                there are problems with information being leaked even before an
                Executive Committee meeting, consider how many more problems
                there would be, for example, in the interval between an
                Executive Committee meeting and a sitting of the Assembly in
                terms of a drip-feed of information coming through.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have to consider how to do things in a
                structured way. The object of the agenda for government was to
                show that we in the Executive are, for the first time, beginning
                to identify some priorities ourselves. This is only a first step
                towards a programme for government. It is not intended to
                replace the work on the programme for government and there is
                not, as the Member suggests, going to be a drip-feed of the
                programme for government. The programme for government will be
                prepared in a coherent manner. The work is ongoing and we will
                come to the Assembly and the Committees in the autumn with the
                intention of deciding final policy towards the end of the year.
                It will then be considered in the Budget. This is the intention.
                We felt — and Members may appreciate this — that to sit
                between now and November without having the opportunity, as a
                new Administration, to indicate our priorities and what we want
                to achieve would be seen with considerable disappointment by the
                Assembly and by society as a whole.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the specific question of the sources of
                the money, those programmes and actions which are receiving
                additional resources will be funded from unallocated resources
                identified at this stage of the year. That does involve some of
                the additional spending that came from the March Budget. There
                was a certain unallocated amount. That was considered together
                with other funds coming mainly from underspends carried forward
                from last year under year-end flexibility arrangements. Indeed,
                some other additional resources have been identified, and
                significant among those were the receipts from house sales.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The agenda is not simply about putting extra
                money into specific actions. A number of actions are being
                pursued within existing budgets. Rather, it is about
                highlighting matters which we, as an Executive, have agreed to
                undertake in the coming weeks and months to underline our wish
                to improve and modernise Northern Ireland and to identify and
                tackle key issues.</p>

                serious underfunding in the structural maintenance of roads. I
                ask the First and the Deputy First Ministers why roads’
                maintenance is not on the agenda.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Member for his question. We have
                not yet had the opportunity to consider fully the
                recommendations and the observations of the audit report
                published last week. We wish to see a full report from the
                Minister, Mr Peter Robinson, to the Executive Committee, on
                this. Like the Audit Office, we want the Department for Regional
                Development and its Minister rapidly to address the strategic
                issues relating to roads. Indeed, this must be looked at in the
                much wider context of an overall transport strategy. There is no
                doubt that it is a major issue. It affects everyone in the North
                of Ireland, and it affects all policy areas. That is why we
                believe that it is the duty of Mr Robinson to come and discuss
                these issues with the rest of the Executive Committee. We are
                fully aware of the difficulties with the underfunding of
                infrastructure, and that includes railways and school buildings
                especially. We are trying to do what we can immediately for
                school buildings, and we want to do the same for roads. However,
                it makes it all the more difficult, and disadvantages people in
                the North of Ireland all the more, if those Ministers who are
                supposed to be dealing with these matters do not come to the
                Executive Committee to bring forward, with their Colleagues, the
                types of proposal that the hon Member is rightly seeking. They
                will have to be made, with or without the Minister, at some

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Member for his question. There
                are a number of ways in which the agenda that has been announced
                demonstrates commitment to encouraging the information-age
                society. This is relevant to the university research programme
                to which we referred, to the Classroom 2000 projects for
                schools, to information technology for farmers, and to the
                allocation of an additional £1·4&nbsp;million in support of
                the information-age initiative. The plan is entitled ‘Leapfrog
                to the Information Age’. This reflects the importance that the
                Executive attaches to the development of the knowledge-based
                economy in Northern Ireland and was a key theme in ‘Strategy
                2010’. The information age initiative stressed that
                information and communication technologies must be a top
                priority for economic growth in Northern Ireland. The funds now
                being made available will be used to support and provide further
                impetus to the 25 actions detailed in ‘Leapfrog to the
                Information Age’ document, thus helping to drive forward the

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the opportunity to ask questions on
                the statement, although, like other Members in the DUP, and in
                other parties, I would reiterate the point about questions being
                asked by the press on Thursday while, four days later, Members
                still do not have the details of the expenditure commitments
                that were given to the press. This is Monday morning, and we
                still do not have them. I hope that the First and the Deputy
                First Ministers will rectify that problem.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have a second question. The Deputy First
                Minister made a fleeting reference towards the end of the
                statement to an arts and culture programme of events to aid a
                better appreciation of our cultural diversity. What plans, if
                any, are in place for a more equitable funding programme to
                promote the cultural outlook of the pro-Union community in
                Northern Ireland?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister also commented on
                the need to address urgently health and safety work on the
                railways pending the completion of the task force’s work on
                their long-term future. Was it an unfortunate error or a
                deliberate omission not to include any commitment to the
                long-term development and viability of the rail network in
                Northern Ireland?</p>

                start to address some of the problems that the Minister and his

                First of all, I would like to welcome this morning’s statement
                by the First and the Deputy First Ministers. It is important
                that we get a clear picture of what is happening. It is
                unfortunate that time has been wasted by Ministers, who should
                be sitting in the Executive, asking questions in the House the
                answers to which they should already know.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I especially welcome the announcement of the
                money going to the health service. That is a very important
                subject, particularly with regard to waiting lists. There are
                extremely long waiting lists at Craigavon Hospital because of
                the transfer of patients there from South Tyrone. At last week’s
                board meeting it was clear that the cost of the transfers last
                year was in the region of £1.5m. There is a deficit before we
                even start. It is important to keep this in mind for the future.
                We must realise the cost of temporary transfers and try instead
                to provide a proper service in the area.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also welcome the announcement on gap
                funding. At last week’s hearing the Northern Ireland Voluntary
                Trust said that the different groups that they were associated
                with already needed gap funding of £1.5&nbsp;million in order
                to continue on to Peace II. It is welcome that the Department of
                Health, Social Services and Public Safety has put together
                funding to help that situation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important to do research into TSN and
                tackle social need. We need to have some sort of injection of
                funds to ensure that we can reverse the discrimination of the
                past and redress the imbalance that exists between east and west
                of the Bann. We must ensure that people living west of the Bann
                have proper hospital services and the new schools that are
                required. There also is a need for a proper roads infrastructure
                in there areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am certain that when we start to tackle
                social need those are issues that the Executive will want to
                deal with.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the railway task force — and
                I know the Minister is not present at the moment — we need to

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Molloy:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have raised a number of issues. One was
                that we need a great deal more additional funds to enable us to
                tackle all these areas. I welcome the fact that the Executive is
                dealing with the issue of rural planning and area plans. Will
                the Executive confirm that there is money available to put all
                the area plans in place, not just the Belfast one, so that there
                are no further delays?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member touched on a wide range of issues,
                and I hope he will forgive me if I do not manage to cover all of
                them. On planning, there are significant additional resources
                there to help, particularly to speed up appeals and</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">deal with area plans. I do have to tell him,
                however, that one of the key focuses of the area plans — or at
                least the additional money that has gone in to it — is that
                the metropolitan plan for Belfast move forward. There is
                £250,000 under that heading, which is very urgently needed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the comments that the Member made
                with regard about additional money for health. This is a matter
                of very great concern to us. We are trying to target this money
                on waiting lists. One of the most important things for people is
                speed of access to medical services. The waiting-list situation
                here continues to concern us and, indeed, the continuing
                increase in waiting lists is partly due to winter pressures and
                partly to a failure by the former Administration to target this
                problem in previous years. As a result of that we have the worst
                waiting-list situation in the United Kingdom. Our waiting lists
                are significantly worse than those of Scotland, Wales and
                England, so we are putting additional money in to try to deal
                with that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Obviously the location of hospital services
                is also important although, in terms of what the public want, it
                comes second after access. One needs to bear that in mind. There
                is a particular problem that has been mentioned with regard to
                South Tyrone. The Southern Board has informed the Minister of
                its decision to temporarily transfer acute in-patient medical
                services from South Tyrone to Craigavon. It is for Ms de Brún
                to consider the board’s decision and the reasons for it before
                deciding on the way forward. I understand that she has made it
                clear that she would accept a decision to transfer services only
                if she were satisfied that that was unavoidable and that any
                changes must be the minimum necessary to ensure safety and
                quality and must also be temporary.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of course the Member is quite right to say
                that this has consequential effects on Craigavon. As a result of
                the transfer of acute services, Craigavon has not been able to
                offer the same range of elective and outpatient services to
                people, because of the way it has been affected. We all hope
                that this will be a temporary situation.</p>

                During the course of questions I rose to make a point of order.
                Given the prolonged questioning by Mr Dodds as Minister for
                Social Development, and given the bizarre and rather pathetic
                nature of his questioning of the Deputy First Minister and the
                First Minister and the spectacle he made of himself — <i>[Interruption]</i>
                Let me continue my point of order.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is it in order that a Minister — or someone
                who purports to be a Minister — should so demean himself as to
                ask a question that should properly have been asked at the
                Executive table and not in this Chamber?</p>

                has demeaned himself or otherwise is not a point of order. You
                may be aware that it is the convention in another place for a
                Minister not to ask questions of another Minister, but we do not
                have corresponding Standing Orders in this House. Perhaps, at
                some stage, the Procedures Committee will wish to consider
                altering that discrepancy in Standing Orders.</p>

                referred to the Procedures Committee so that such a serious
                issue can be properly addressed and our Standing Orders amended

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On Thursday 29&nbsp;June the First Minister
                and the Deputy First Minister launched the agenda for
                government, which sets out how the Executive is tackling a range
                of issues immediately to demonstrate the difference that
                devolution makes for the benefit of all our people.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That included the allocation of
                £27&nbsp;million of additional public expenditure to some of
                the action points in the agenda. This was possible in the
                context of a wider review of spending allocations, and my
                statement provides fuller details of the total picture to the
                Assembly. Members will find, attached to the copies of my
                statement, a table summarising the items which are receiving
                additional spending provision in this exercise. That table and
                the details of the statement are also being made available to
                the press.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is in the nature of budget management that
                changes need to be dealt with, and the pattern of change can
                vary considerably from one year to the next, or indeed from one
                quarter to the next, given the wide range of unpredictable
                factors which can affect the planning and management of spending
                programmes. In this case, some £90&nbsp;million of spending
                provision became available for reallocation by the Executive
                Committee. The Executive Committee judged that £63&nbsp;million
                should be provided for a range of requirements and bids for a
                wide range of public services; in addition £27&nbsp;million was
                available for commitment to the actions in the agenda for
                government. This is a first tranche of support for the agenda
                for government. Further support will be made available in the
                autumn.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This £90&nbsp;million came from several
                sources. Eighteen million was available from the allocations
                added to Northern Ireland’s budget by the Chancellor of the
                Exchequer in his March Budget. That had been envisaged by the
                Secretary of State before the restoration of devolution as being
                for particular aspects of transport and education spending.
                However, the Executive Committee thought it right to take a
                fresh view on this as part of our overall review of immediate
                spending priorities, and in essence the £18&nbsp;million became
                part of our total for reallocation rather than remaining a
                distinct pot of money. This meant that the Executive Committee
                was able to look across the whole range of issues and then judge
                how best to proceed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second major source of resources was the
                End Year Flexibility arrangements, which allow for money which
                has been unspent in one year to be carried forward into the
                following year — either to the same area, or elsewhere. This
                source, including £6&nbsp;million of additional receipts from
                the regional rate, accounted for £42&nbsp;million of the sums
                which the Executive Committee addressed in this re-allocation
                exercise. These allocations include some quite novel allocations
                which show the Executive Committee making use of the available
                resources more actively and distinctly than would have been the
                case before devolution. In other cases, where we judged that the
                funds were best used in the area from which they had originally
                arisen, they were allowed to remain in that sector. In all
                cases, the criterion was the same: where was the money most
                needed, where would it give most benefit.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The final component of the £90&nbsp;million
                available was in the form of £30&nbsp;million of additional
                receipts or reduced requirements from the Departments which have
                become available in recent weeks. Savings from such sources are
                central to the in-year reviews of public spending, and again we
                are operating on the principle that all savings that arise in
                individual public services can and should be brought to the
                Executive Committee for allocation. If windfalls were left with
                the public service where they happen to arise, this could lead
                to substantial distortion of spending priorities which would not
                be in anyone’s interest. Thus, it is regarded as very
                important that savings of this nature are brought back for
                reallocation by the Executive Committee. Again our aim is to
                reach conscious decisions on the best use for such funds, not
                simply to let them lie where they fall.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As many Members are aware, the largest
                component of savings came from additional receipts from house
                sales by the Northern Ireland Housing Executive, amounting to
                £25&nbsp;million. As I explained last week, extra receipts —
                that is those over and above the level planned in the public
                spending allocations at the start of the year — should be at
                the disposal of the Executive Committee and the Assembly, to be
                used to address emerging pressures.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other savings which were also brought back
                for reallocation by the Executive Committee included £4 million
                which arose from unavoidable and unforeseen delays in the
                progress of roads capital projects and £1 million through a
                rephasing of the planned expenditure on the Springvale project.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These then are the three main components of
                the £90 million, which were considered for reallocation by the
                Executive Committee last Thursday.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I must stress to Members that it is unusual
                at this stage of the financial year to have available such a
                large sum for reallocation, and they should not expect this to
                be repeated during further monitoring exercises later in the
                year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not propose in this statement to set out
                on a line-by-line basis the individual items which are receiving
                additional spending provision in their budgets as a result of
                this exercise. Many reflect routine estimating changes which
                need to be addressed to ensure the continued delivery of public
                services at an appropriate standard to the public.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I should also point out that these proposals
                are not concerned with the running-costs pressures which
                Departments have identified for this year. A separate exercise
                later in the year will deal with running-costs issues.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">More widely, it has proved an extremely
                valuable opportunity in addressing needs which have arisen since
                the budget was agreed by the Executive Committee in December of
                last year. Through the availability of the additional resources
                from the Chancellor’s Budget and the savings from Departments,
                it is now possible to meet a wide range of budgetary pressures,
                including the needs of the Northern Ireland Transport Holding
                Company for the public service obligation (£6 million);
                Department of Agriculture and Rural Development’s animal
                health programme (£8 million); the IDB’s selective financial
                assistance budget (£6·4 million); and capital programmes for
                voluntary schools and the pre-school initiative (£7 million).</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All these reallocations will be subject to
                Assembly approval through Supplementary Estimates in due course.
                It will take some time for the detail of the decisions taken by
                the Executive Committee last week to be translated into detailed
                redistribution at the level set out in the Estimates such as
                those recently approved by the Assembly. When that detailed
                process has been completed, Supplementary Estimates will be
                brought before the Assembly and a new Appropriation Bill will
                need to be introduced. This will pave the way for full and
                proper authorisation of the proposed additional expenditure.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I believe that these reallocations are clear
                evidence that the Executive Committee is in the business of
                sound management of our finances. This means that the agenda for
                government, and, in due course, the programme for government,
                can be built on the very solid foundations which are represented
                by the reallocations of resources which I am announcing today.
                And the two aspects of this review of spending allocations in
                2000-01 are highly complementary — the agenda on the one hand
                setting out some of the Executive’s early initiatives for the
                region for the next nine months, and, on the other hand, the
                redeployment of resources to better effect within the wide range
                of ongoing policies and services, which I am addressing today.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I believe that the content of my announcement
                this afternoon is very positive from the point of view of those
                who depend on the public services which we are funding. We have
                redeployed the resources available from areas where they are no
                longer needed or from centrally available resources to the
                pressures which are the most acute. I recognise that it is
                impossible to please everyone or deal with all the pressures on
                budgets that may exist. The Executive Committee has taken the
                opportunity to make some innovative actions in the agenda for
                government, but this would not have been possible without the
                resources available from sound oversight and management of
                public finances, and it remains our determination that this
                should continue. We will also ensure that the Assembly is kept
                informed of the proposals which may emerge through the various
                monitoring reviews during the course of the year.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairman of the Finance and Personnel
                Committee (Mr Molloy): </b>A LeasCheann Comhairle, go raibh
                maith agat. As Chairman of the Finance and Personnel Committee,
                I wish to welcome the Minister’s important general statement
                today. We must have more detail, with as much advance notice as
                possible, in all these statements so that the Committees can
                start work on them. I know there are difficulties dealing with
                this in the Executive and when the Minister has to make a
                statement himself.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important that we view today’s
                announcement in the overall context to see how this will affect
                us in future. This monitoring round has turned up a number of
                reallocations. Can the Minister state exactly when he expects
                the next round? Does he expect to turn up additional funds every
                time we have a monitoring round? Do we simply receive budget
                allocations which are then reallocated? If we achieve a tighter
                control of the budget, surely monitoring will not turn up a
                large amount of money for the finances of the Assembly will be
                more tightly controlled.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I draw particular attention to the £4
                million for roads, which has been reallocated because of
                unavoidable and unforeseen delays. I know of my own area’s
                demand for improvements to the road infrastructure. We heard
                about the condition of rural roads in the debate last week, and
                it seems strange that we should have to reallocate now, for
                there are a number of major projects. I could talk about the A29
                from Dungannon to Cookstown or the A4 to Ballygawley, both
                extremely dangerous roads much in need of finances. Yet we are
                told that this is part of a long-term budget. I should
                appreciate an explanation of how this comes about.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The addendum to the statement mentions the
                Department of Agriculture and Rural Development and reduced
                income from timber sales. Is this another injection into the
                timber sales or the same one we discussed earlier in the year
                where money was put into the Department of Agriculture and Rural
                Development as compensation?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Chairman of the Finance and
                Personnel Committee for his comments. First, I have recognised
                before here and with the Finance and Personnel Committee that we
                have difficulties regarding the quality and timing of
                information that can be made available to the departmental
                Committee for its consideration. In many such issues, we in the
                Department are clearly dealing with bids and proposals from
                other Departments, not all of whom have necessarily shared their
                ideas with their own departmental Committees. That puts some
                constraints on us regarding the timing and scope of the
                information that we can present to the departmental Committee.
                Given the need for the Executive Committee’s good conduct and
                a degree of confidentiality regarding certain proposals,
                exchanges and decision-making, these decisions are obviously for
                the Executive Committee itself. It puts constraints on what we
                are able to make available to Committees, the Finance and
                Personnel Committee in particular.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must try to continue to improve this
                position, since I recognise Committee members’ frustration. I
                share that frustration, since I would prefer more active and
                open engagement with the Committee. We tried to make such
                information as we could available regarding moneys accessible to
                us. We asked the Committee for its views and recommendations on
                possible allocations and on the pressures there are.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This monitoring exercise identifies money
                available through underspends and additional receipts, but let
                us also remember that it identifies where there are serious
                pressures in programmes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In future, the monitoring exercise will
                identify pressures in certain areas of the budget; if we are
                lucky, it will also identify further available resources. As I
                said, we should not expect resources of this order to be the
                natural or likely outcome in future monitoring exercises.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Two questions were raised, the first of which
                concerned the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development
                and timber sales. This is not a repeat of the old moneys; it is
                new money, but the reason for it is the same — the pressures
                created by the reduced price of timber, which is a global issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the second question, the
                £4&nbsp;million that was yielded by the Department for Regional
                Development was for the roads programme and capital work which,
                for operational reasons, has not been spent this year. Further
                pressures on roads maintenance have not been addressed in this
                set of allocations, and those pressures will have to be
                considered later.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr B Bell:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Minister’s statement, but I
                have a question on the issue of flexibility. About
                £6&nbsp;million additional receipts were obtained from the
                regional rate. I wonder whether the Minister considered carrying
                that forward to alleviate this year’s regional rate — I have
                asked questions on the regional rate before.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A question was asked earlier about the
                Finance and Personnel Committee not receiving answers to
                questions. Last Wednesday, an officer from that Department was
                unable to answer questions on any issue. That was frustrating,
                and perhaps this question could have been asked then — had we
                been allowed to ask it and to receive answers. I welcome the
                First Minister’s assurances that that will not happen in
                future and that Committees will be taken further into account
                when dealing with budgets.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Member for his question, and I
                simply repeat what I said earlier. I recognise the frustration
                felt by members of the Finance and Personnel Committee. I stress
                that it is somewhat frustrating for me too, as a Minister, that
                we cannot engage in the open flow of information in automatic
                response to all the questions that Members have, when these
                matters are being discussed by the Executive. That issue applies
                to other departmental Committees at the stage when proposals or
                measures for their Departments are the subject of Executive
                consideration. I ask Members to appreciate that such constraints
                create difficulties for officials as well. Officials want to be
                helpful, and I believe that they have a very good relationship
                with the Finance and Personnel Committee. However, there are
                constraints by virtue of the fact that we service the decisions
                made by the Executive. We are not at liberty to fully disclose
                all information. It is not our information — much of it is
                confidential Executive information.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The £6&nbsp;million extra in rates came as a
                result of a higher yield from greater buoyancy. There are
                greater returns because of more new properties, and that is
                where that £6&nbsp;million came from.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The rate has already been set for next year
                so there is no point in seeking to revise it downwards. The
                £6&nbsp;million is a useful contribution to the moneys that we
                now have available. It is being allocated appropriately and will
                be spent well, as part of the wider £90&nbsp;million. Perhaps
                the Member wants to identify which measures he believes should
                not be funded in our allocation exercise.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dallat:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also welcome the Minister’s statement. It
                represents the very positive side of the work of the Assembly,
                which is in stark contrast to the earlier scenes that were
                witnessed by a large group of young children of impressionable
                age in the Public Gallery.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is the Minister satisfied that the additional
                moneys available for voluntary and community sector projects is
                adequate to ensure that the Assembly delivers on new TSN in
                rural and socially deprived urban areas?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Member for his question. We
                should be clear that we are talking about some additional
                allocations. Given the scale of those allocations, I would not
                pretend that they are going to be sufficient to ensure that
                Departments or, indeed, the community and voluntary sector are
                best able to meet their responsibilities under TSN.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The work on TSN across the full range of
                Government Departments is developing. It is work that is being
                co-ordinated by the Equality Unit in the Office of the First
                Minister and the Deputy First Minister. These allocations are
                obviously supplementing what is already in budgets, and all
                Departments should increasingly be using sound TSN
                considerations as they are shaping and sharing out their various
                budgets and programmes. That is something we will continue to
                do.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the allocations I am announcing and those
                announced by the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister in
                the agenda for government, we have tried to deal with some of
                the pressures in the community and the voluntary sector, not
                least, but not only, in respect of the question of the gap in
                peace moneys.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr William McCrea:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Minister’s statement. It is
                in stark contrast to the fiasco we had to endure earlier. He
                said the decision was taken last Thursday, seemingly at the same
                meeting that we heard about earlier. There was no public fanfare
                about this. Respect was shown to the Assembly, and the detail,
                which we would expect, has certainly come.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am somewhat surprised that the Department
                of the Environment allocation is only £530,000 for the Planning
                Appeals Commission. As Members will know, a number of areas in
                the Province, outside of Belfast, are behind in their area
                plans. That has curbed the natural development of those areas,
                their plans being out of date. My Committee, the Environment
                Committee, had highlighted that, and a proper allocation could
                have ensured that this was taken forward.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the Department of Education he mentioned
                the pre-school initiative. Can the Minister now assure us that
                all pre-school places for children of the appropriate age will
                be guaranteed? I know of some children who are 4&nbsp;years of
                age and yet are not getting any pre-school education.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Regarding the Department for Regional
                Development, we had a debate on this matter. There was, in the
                Chancellor’s statement, a direct allocation for roads. Has any
                of this money been syphoned off? How does that sit alongside the
                disquiet that we all unanimously expressed in the Chamber last
                week in the emergency debate on the need for expenditure on
                roads and railways?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, on the Department for Social
                Development, we notice that a large part of the money is the
                £25&nbsp;million that has been additional receipts from house
                sales. How does removing that amount from the Housing Executive
                sit with a current shortfall of £13&nbsp;million? Many of the
                urgent adaptations for houses for the elderly, and the disabled
                have been put back. Money from house sales ought to have been
                allocated to remove the £13&nbsp;million shortfall.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It would have been appropriate for the
                Minister to allow that money to have been covered, to allow the
                weak, the disabled and the disadvantaged in the community to
                have a proper standard of services.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Member for his questions.
                However, I am unsure whether to thank him for the earlier
                compliments in his contribution. I will attempt to deal with
                some of the questions that have been raised regarding the
                pressures in the Planning Service. We tried, in the overall
                exercise, to respond to a range of pressures present throughout
                the budget. In this allocation we have added further money to
                the Planning Appeals Commission, as a large part of the backlog
                relates to congestion at that end of the planning system. The
                Member will also be aware of remedial action we took earlier in
                the year in giving the Department of the Environment permission
                to use some of its receipts to target some of the pressures
                building there. That was relief and assistance received by the
                Department in that area.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In terms of the education issue the Member
                raised, the money being provided for the capital work on the
                pre-school initiative is to enable the Department to achieve the
                target of 85% of the pre-school cohort to be in pre-school
                education by the start of 2002. The target for next September is
                75%, and that capital is being provided to help the Department
                meet that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member also raised the issue of the £25
                million of additional receipts for the Housing Executive in
                respect of house sales. As I said in my statement, I do not
                think we can accept the premise that any programme that
                generates additional receipts should automatically retain them.
                All additional receipts should be available to the Executive
                Committee for allocation across all Government Departments. Many
                Departments and programmes are under budgetary pressure, not
                just the housing budget. Not all Departments or services can
                show receipts. Many are not run in a way that would enable them
                to generate receipts. Remember that in the past, many other
                services have yielded funds for priorities in the housing
                programme. It would be wrong, therefore, to treat that money as
                simply housing money and not make it available for wider
                allocation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member mentioned the £13·7 million
                shortfall that the Housing Executive has talked about. Let us
                remember that £6·8 million of that stated shortfall is a
                result of the reduction in the Chancellor’s initiative money.
                The Chancellor’s initiative money, offered in terms of the
                worst estates scheme, was £7·5 million last year. That was a
                one-off amount of money. The Chancellor’s initiative money is
                £700,000 this year. It is incorrect for people to talk about
                the £13·7 million shortfall. People will be aware from the two
                exercises we have addressed this morning — the agenda for
                government and this allocation exercise — that, in fact, a
                further £5·9&nbsp;million has been given to the Housing
                Executive. An amount of £2 million has been earmarked for
                adaptations for people with disabilities, £2 million to the
                SPED scheme — the Social Development Committee identified a
                £2 million gap there — and £1·9&nbsp;million will go
                towards the Housing Executive administration grant. An
                additional £5·9 million is being put into housing. We were not
                able to address road priority issues in this allocation round;
                they will have to be considered later.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">May I remind Members that the time will be up
                at 12.50 pm, and for that reason I ask them to keep their
                questions as brief and concise as possible.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Close:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister for his statement which
                puts some flesh on the bones of the First and Deputy First
                Ministers’ statement earlier today. I do have to ask why the
                various figures included in the Minister’s statement were not
                available to the Finance and Personnel Committee when it met on
                28&nbsp;June — the day before the announcement was made. Some
                of these figures are from the March budget allocation from the
                end-of-year flexibility. I believe, and members of the Finance
                and Personnel Committee believe, that, even though we were
                suspended for a long time, there was adequate time for these
                figures to have been given further scrutiny by that Committee.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the Minister ensure that reference has
                been made to the second tranche of the agenda for government
                money and that those figures will be made available to the
                Finance and Personnel Committee in sufficient time to enable it
                to have an input? May I also ask for an assurance that the
                moneys for the autumn monitoring round will also be made
                available to the Committee in adequate time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister referred to drugs savings and to
                an allocation of £2·4&nbsp;million. It strikes me that there
                is some contradiction here. I am a little confused as to the
                allocation of £2·4&nbsp;million on drugs savings. Also, can
                the Minister give me more information on the additional moneys
                for the Water Service for operating costs of
                £3·5&nbsp;million?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, I would like to welcome the
                additional allocation of £3&nbsp;million to the Down Lisburn
                Trust for capital purposes.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Seamus&nbsp;Close is another member of the
                Finance and Personnel Committee who has contributed to the
                debate today. I repeat that I fully appreciate how frustrated
                members of that Committee are.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us also be conscious of the fact that the
                Department of Finance and Personnel, in carrying out these
                exercises, is serving and supporting the Executive Committee. So
                the information is to that extent in the possession of the
                Executive Committee. As far as this matter is concerned, I will
                continue to reflect the concerns and interests of members of the
                Finance and Personnel Committee to the Executive Committee. We
                will try to see what better means can be found to provide
                information to members of the Committee and to secure more
                useful and more effective input for the members of that
                Committee. This is something that we will continue to explore
                and improve on. I cannot at this stage give the categorical
                assurances that Mr&nbsp;Close is seeking, simply because they
                involve decisions that the Executive Committee will have to
                make, such as what information should be made available and
                when. The issues arising here involve a range of Departments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People are concerned about almost getting
                into an open bidding exercise with every Department’s bid
                published and that in turn tending to create inflationary
                pressures on the bids. Everybody has to be seen to be bidding so
                he can cover himself, and the departmental Committees may be
                adding to that bidding exercise. These are the sorts of concerns
                that people have had and the reasons for taking a more limited
                approach. This does need to be sorted out and worked through.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member asked about the second tranche. It
                is intended that there will be a second tranche in the autumn. I
                failed to make the point earlier, in response to a question from
                Mr&nbsp;Molloy, that the next normal monitoring round will be in
                October, so in September we will be looking at what that
                monitoring round is offering us. It will be in that context that
                the second tranche of money from the agenda for government will
                be dealt with.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As for the question on drugs savings, that
                really relates to GP fundholders. That funding is to cover the
                restoration of the fundholder savings that were borrowed to help
                address winter pressures last year. Those savings are a
                statutory entitlement and can be drawn down by the fundholders
                over three to four years.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr B Hutchinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There have been a number of criticisms this
                morning of the way in which the First Minister and the Deputy
                First Minister handled their announcement. I have been pleased
                by the way the Minister of Finance and Personnel has handled
                his, and particularly by the amount of information he has given
                us.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister said that one of the
                reasons he could not wait until the Assembly sat was for fear of
                leaks. Why did the Minister of Finance and Personnel not feel
                the need to make his announcement at a press conference? Was it
                because he was confident that there would be no leaks from his
                Department?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Member for his question. The
                Executive took several decisions on Thursday. The Executive
                decided that the decision on the agenda for government should be
                the subject of a press announcement by the First Minister and
                the Deputy First Minister with the rest of us in attendance. The
                Executive Committee also decided that I should make a statement
                on the remaining moneys for allocation here today. I was not
                going to do a press conference beforehand or separately. I
                believe that, as with the budget statement, matters of routine
                budgetary operation are appropriately presented by myself, once
                I am in possession of an Executive Committee decision, here
                before the House. That is consistent with Standing Orders and
                with the legislation, and that is the approach I have taken.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was not free of leaks. At the press
                conference given by the First Minister and the Deputy First
                Minister last Thursday, one journalist asked about a further
                £64 million for allocation. Somebody somewhere had the
                information. Thankfully no one was sufficiently motivated to
                follow that up, otherwise I would have been in difficulties
                before the House this morning.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Leslie:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister for his statement. I
                heard his cautionary remarks on the potential size of future
                outcomes from in-year monitoring. However, the Deputy First
                Minister seems optimistic. He is clearly expecting further
                largesse next time round. He promised a further tranche, and we
                must hope that he keeps on &quot;tranching&quot;.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister referred to these reallocations
                being subject to Assembly approval through Supplementary
                Estimates in due course. This is a little misleading.
                Essentially the Supplementary Estimates will be a <i>post facto </i>confirmation
                of the decisions announced today. His wording did not reflect
                the true position. I have no particular objection to that course
                of action. The key point, which has been highlighted many times,
                is that normally we would have a longer run-up to these
                decisions with more opportunity for them to be discussed. I do
                not expect the Minister to reiterate his remarks in that regard.
                We are all aware that there is quite often a difference between
                the apparent import of a statement and the actual effect of the
                small print.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the Minister comment on the
                £4&nbsp;million clawed back from the roads budget due to
                unfinished projects? Under resource budget accounting, would the
                same thing happen or would a capital allocation of that kind
                become inalienably part of the budget to which it had been
                allocated?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Member for his points. First,
                with regard to the Estimates, these must, by their nature,
                reflect decisions that have already been taken. It would be
                bizarre if I, as Minister of Finance, were to bring forward
                Estimates that had not been adopted or agreed by the Executive.
                Serious difficulties arise if Ministers appear to be acting in a
                somewhat semi-detached basis from the Executive Committee. I can
                only bring forward Estimates that are based on decisions that
                have been made by the Executive Committee.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In any other Chamber of this nature debates
                on Estimates and appropriation tend to follow decisions or clear
                statements of intent that have been made by the Administration.
                This is not always pleasing to Members, and we need to improve
                the current systems. These issues will be addressed by the
                Committee on Procedures, among others.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We cannot take it for granted that such
                moneys will continue to be available. Some moneys were available
                in the last monitoring round which came from the previous period
                of devolution. However, I hope this does not create
                habit-forming expectations of certain moneys. There are also
                very real pressures, such as the costs of running Departments.
                These costs are building up very seriously in some Departments,
                and members of the departmental Committees are aware of this. We
                will not have much latitude in these exercises.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member asked about the implications of
                monitoring exercises. He gave the example of the roads budget
                and the £4&nbsp;million that was underspent last year. He also
                asked whether in future this money would fall back into the
                programme. We will be putting forward legislation to bring in a
                full resource accounting and budgeting scheme. The thinking
                behind this is to ensure that the budget is conducted on a more
                programmed basis and that there is a strong focus on output
                rather than the conventional emphasis on input. We will be
                trying to change that. The monitoring round for the resource
                accounting budget will still exist, although the nature of this
                will change. The moneys available and assumed entitlements will
                change, partly because the nature of budgetary commitments will
                change. The move to resource accounting, however, will not
                necessarily mean that Departments will automatically retain any
                underspend from the previous year.</p>

                sad that the Minister has had to allocate £2&nbsp;million
                towards the special purchase of evacuated dwellings. In my
                constituency, only this morning, there was an attack on a
                family, who happened to be Catholic. Unfortunately that family

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First and the Deputy First Ministers
                previously announced an allocation under the agenda for

                supplements that with a further £6&nbsp;million allocation to
                the Northern Ireland Transport Holding Company in respect of its
                public service obligations. That makes a total of
                £9&nbsp;million. Members will be aware that the indication at
                the time was that £18&nbsp;million was still unallocated from
                the Chancellor’s Budget and that the Secretary of State had
                suggested that £8&nbsp;million go to transport. The Executive

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the other point, it is a matter of regret
                that we are having to allocate further moneys to support the
                special purchase of evacuated dwellings schemes. Clearly, that
                is an area in which we would like to see expenditure reducing.
                It is a programme that all Members want to see ending in
                circumstances where the difficulties and untoward activities
                giving rise to the need for that programme have completely
                abated and been abandoned in society. However, we recognise the
                pressure that is there, and I know that the Social Development
                Committee had identified it. We understood that, while
                £1·5&nbsp;million was provided in the original budget, on
                current unhappy trends about £3·5&nbsp;million will probably
                be needed. That is why we have had to make the additional
                allocation of £2&nbsp;million. It is regrettable and deplorable
                that the intimidation of Protestants and Catholics gives rise to
                the need for that budget.</p>

                you to advise the House on the timing of the issuing of
                ministerial statements. My understanding is that they were to be
                issued one hour before the statement itself. Consequently, at
                the end of the First and Deputy First Ministers’ statement,
                but before they started questions at 10.50&nbsp;am, I went
                outside to collect the statement that we have just heard from
                the Minister of Finance and Personnel, which was not available
                at that time. I returned to the Chamber and went out again about
                half an hour later, by which time it was available. Fortunately
                for the Minister, due to events beyond his control, the start of
                his statement was a little later than 11.50&nbsp;am, which was
                implied by the timing of the previous statement. It may well be
                that that statement got under the wire in terms of being
                available one hour before. However, if my understanding of the
                one-hour rule is correct, then, in principle, that statement
                should have been available at 10.50&nbsp;am.</p>

                raise an issue that occurred at the beginning of this question
                and answer session. Certain remarks were made that were quite
                audible on this side of the Chamber, but perhaps not in your
                hearing. They emanated from Mr Peter Robinson. The gist of those
                remarks, which were directed at you, Mr&nbsp;Deputy Speaker —
                and I will rely on Hansard to confirm them — was that we need
                somebody decent in the Chair. Those remarks, to my hearing, were
                clearly levelled at you. I am sure that in the difficult period
                that you were experiencing at that time in the Chair, because of
                the general unruliness of the House, you did not hear them.
                However, I regard those remarks, as I am sure other Colleagues
                who heard them do, as showing contempt for the Chair, and an
                attack on your personal integrity and the integrity of the
                Chair. I ask you, Mr Deputy Speaker, to consult with Colleagues
                and to check Hansard to see if, in fact, the remarks were made
                and, if so, to ask the Member to withdraw them.</p>

                Ministerial Council in sectoral format for inland waterways and
                languages took place in Belfast on Wednesday 21&nbsp;June. The
                inland waterways meeting was held in the morning, followed by
                language in the afternoon. Following nomination by the First
                Minister and the Deputy First Minister, Ms&nbsp;Bairbre&nbsp;de&nbsp;Brún
                and I represented the Executive Committee. The Irish Government
                was represented at the waterways meeting by Silé&nbsp;de&nbsp;Valera
                TD, the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands,

                State. I am making this report on behalf of myself and
                Ms&nbsp;de&nbsp;Brún, who has approved the report.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The inland waterways meeting opened with an
                oral progress report from Mr&nbsp;John&nbsp;Mahony, interim
                chief executive. The council noted that Waterways Ireland had
                responsibility for the Shannon Erne waterway from
                2&nbsp;December&nbsp;1999, and from 1&nbsp;April&nbsp;2000 it
                had responsibility for Lough&nbsp;Erne and the Lower Bann
                navigations in Northern Ireland, and the Royal Canal, the Grand
                Canal, the Barrow navigation and the Shannon navigation in the
                Republic of Ireland. Ownership of Shannon Erne Waterway
                Promotion&nbsp;Limited transferred to Waterways Ireland on
                16&nbsp;June&nbsp;2000. Waterways&nbsp;Ireland will have its
                headquarters in Enniskillen with regional offices in Dublin,
                Carrick-on-Shannon and Scariff in County Clare. The council
                noted that temporary premises had been established at each of
                these locations and that options on sites for permanent premises
                were being pursued. To date 230 staff have been seconded to
                Waterways Ireland.</p>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The council noted that ESB International and
                Ferguson McIlveen have been commissioned to update their earlier
                feasibility study on the restoration of the Ulster Canal. This
                will provide an updated cost estimate for the project.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The council approved Waterways Ireland’s
                proposed activities for the period up to December&nbsp;2000,
                including a detailed programme of works, estimates of
                expenditure and targets for other work including staff
                recruitment, financial arrangements, equality and human rights
                issues, development of a promotion strategy, property
                acquisition, health and safety issues, liaison with user groups
                and proposals to commence reviews of by-laws.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The council also considered and agreed
                Waterways Ireland’s proposals for its organisational structure
                and staffing levels, the distribution of functions between
                headquarters and regional offices, and interim pay and grading
                proposals. When Waterways Ireland is fully operational it will
                have around 381 staff, of which 257 will be industrial and 124
                professional, technical and administrative. Of the 124
                non-industrial staff, 70 will be based in Enniskillen, and the
                majority of these will be new posts.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The council also agreed to Waterways Ireland’s
                outline draft equality scheme. Following public consultation the
                scheme will be referred back to the North/South Ministerial
                Council in final format before submission to the Equality
                Commission. That completes the statement on Waterways Ireland.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the Minister give us an assurance that
                established groups like the Inland Waterways Association of
                Ireland and the Ulster Waterways Group, who have an interest in
                the waterways of Ireland, will be consulted and kept informed of
                development plans by Waterways Ireland as they unfold? I am
                assuming that he will keep the House informed of such plans.
                Will the Minister also elaborate on how he thinks Enniskillen
                will benefit from having the headquarters of Waterways Ireland
                there?</p>

                As I indicated, Enniskillen will benefit from 70 jobs. We
                estimate that about 80% of those will be new posts, so around 55
                to 60 new professional, technical and administrative jobs will
                be created.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will certainly keep the House informed of
                developments on the Waterways Ireland board. As we get reports
                through I will make them known automatically to the House. It is
                very important that interested groups are kept fully up to speed
                about and consulted on the work of Waterways Ireland and all
                such similar bodies. The development of waterways will
                complement other public and private sector businesses who will
                be consulted, including the Tourist Board, local authorities and
                — and this is very important — other groups who have an
                interest in waterways.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the meeting by the Minister of
                Culture, Arts and Leisure and representatives from the Irish
                Government on the waterways strategy. It certainly makes good
                sense to have co-operation right across the island and at the
                highest level. Waterways Ireland has the potential to capitalise
                on a huge tourist business throughout the island and in Northern
                Ireland, in particular. To date the inland waterways in Northern
                Ireland have experienced a great many problems and continue to
                be at a great disadvantage to those in the Republic. The
                Culture, Arts and Leisure Committee is presently engaged in a
                full public inquiry to see what the problems associated with the
                angling and fishing fraternity are. Can the Minister assure the
                House that sooner rather than later Northern Ireland will enjoy
                the benefits of easy, accessible, enjoyable and affordable
                activities for everyone on all our waterways?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of particular interest to some Members is the
                large investment in Lagan navigation. This is also of particular
                interest to Lisburn Borough Council. Will the Minister agree
                that his Department has a responsibility to promote the Lagan
                navigation and will he look for support, if necessary, through
                the North/South Ministerial Council?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGimpsey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yes, I agree completely that the inland
                waterways activities is a navigation body. The benefits will be
                primarily economic. There is an enormous potential out there to
                attract tourists. We have only got to look south of the border
                in the Irish Republic and in England at the sort of experience
                they have with their inland waterways. Also on the Continent
                where they see the huge potential for water-borne tourism.
                People like to have their holidays on water, using canals, or
                cabin cruisers. We have an enormous potential in this area, and
                that is what we are looking to capitalise on.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Currently, we have only two navigable
                waterways. One is the Lower Bann and the other is
                Lough&nbsp;Erne. Canals formerly in existence are now defunct.
                The Ulster canal is one, the Newry canal is another, and the
                Member is quite right about the Lagan&nbsp;navigation. Some work
                is being done on that by Laganside in the City Council boundary
                and also by Lisburn Borough Council. We would see that as very
                much part of the priorities and of the agenda to get the Lagan
                navigation and the Ulster canal into operation. That brings up
                the fact that Lough&nbsp;Neagh does not have a navigable
                process, or navigable channels. Therefore navigation will have
                to be looked at in Lough Neagh.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The benefits are primarily economic, and
                there is potential for those rural communities along the path of
                the canal to ease their difficulties by tapping into those
                benefits through the development of arts and tourist craft
                shops, restaurants, pubs and so on. That is the experience in
                other parts of Europe.</p>

                would like to welcome the Minister’s statement. I am pleased

                waterways have the potential to create both tourism and jobs.
                May I ask the Minister whether Waterways Ireland will give some
                consideration to the issue of licence differential?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As he will know, the Culture, Arts and
                Leisure Committee is currently conducting an inquiry into
                fisheries, fishing and the angling fraternity. One problem that
                surfaces frequently is licence differential and the effect that
                that has on the angling community and tourism. This is an
                important issue requiring serious attention.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">May I also ask the Minister how Waterways
                Ireland proposes to examine the various concerns about
                hydroelectric schemes. The Erne Anglers Association gave
                evidence at the inquiry and raised serious concerns about the
                Ballyshannon hydroelectric scheme. However, we also have a host
                of these in the North, and these schemes sometimes operate
                illegally. It seems that the problems raised by anglers and the
                impact that these have on the angling fraternity have no means
                of being addressed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, will the Minister say how the new
                body will relate to the various other regions? I am thinking of
                the Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission and the
                Fisheries Conservancy Board for Northern Ireland in particular.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with the underlying issue raised by
                Mrs&nbsp;Nelis about licence differentials and the associated
                concerns and difficulties. However, the meeting on inland
                waterways was not concerned with fishing licences or angling. It
                was concerned with navigation and the Lough Erne and lower Bann
                navigation ways. It was also concerned with the economic
                benefits that can flow from developing our inland waterways.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The licence differentials are primarily the
                concern of the Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission
                and the Fisheries Conservancy Board for Northern Ireland.
                Previously if one wanted to fish in the Foyle Fisheries
                catchment area and used an FCB licence one could have it
                endorsed accordingly, or one could buy a licence for one area
                and a licence for the other, or one licence for one area and
                have it endorsed for the other.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That process now continues except that
                Carlingford Lough is out of the Fisheries Conservancy Board for
                Northern Ireland’s area and part of the Foyle, Carlingford and
                Irish Lights Commission’s area. However, that cross-border
                body is not under my area of responsibility; it is under the
                responsibility of the Department of Agriculture and Rural
                Development. Whilst I can talk about licences from the Fisheries
                Conservancy Board for Northern Ireland, I do not have the
                authority to discuss licensing for Foyle.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the report from the Minister and
                wish to ask him what arrangements exist between the North/South
                body for waterways and the Rivers Agency in the Department of
                Agriculture and Rural Development to ensure the cost effective
                management of flood defence. Also what is the extent of staff
                transfers from the Rivers Agency to this North/South body?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGimpsey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will answer the last part of the question
                first. As regards transferring staff, the Rivers Agency is
                currently carrying out work for Waterways Ireland under a
                service level agreement that will last for two years. The Rivers
                Agency has 460 staff and 10 are being transferred to Waterways
                Ireland — it is only a very small part of the total. Waterways
                Ireland does not have responsibility for flood defence, that
                lies with the Rivers Agency. Waterways Ireland is concerned with
                navigation, and in Northern Ireland terms, we are talking about
                Lough Erne and the lower Bann. Flood defences remain a matter
                for the Rivers Agency.</p>

                basis on which we are employing an extra 70 members of staff and
                what impact that will have on the amount of money required by
                the Culture, Arts and Leisure Department to pay for that.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The current year funding for Waterways
                Ireland is £11·5 million. Northern Ireland’s contribution is
                £1·3 million, and that has been allowed for in the budget. The
                creation of 70 jobs in Enniskillen — of which we estimate 80%
                will be new jobs — is essentially for headquarters,
                administrative and technical staff. A major item of work is the
                feasibility study into the Ulster canal and how it can be
                opened. That is a major project with large sums of money
                attached.</p>

                every effort to co-operate. One of the prime raisons d’être
                for this initiative is tourism, and one of the main features for
                the tourist body in selling tourism and in attracting tourists
                will be the potential of our waterways. In terms of canal
                development, we are a long way behind the Irish Republic where
                there is an extensive and well-developed canal system. Our canal
                system is not developed, and that is what we are looking to do.
                Major benefits will come from that, and it will be one of the
                selling points for a tourist body in attracting people.</p>

                Department taken to stop the pollution of inland waterways, and
                would the Minister agree that such pollution discourages the
                angling aspect of tourism?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGimpsey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Member for his question.
                Waterways Ireland does not have a responsibility as regards
                pollution. That responsibility lies with other Departments.
                Pollution is obviously a matter of enormous importance, and if
                we are trying to sell water-borne tourism by developing canals,
                and the water quality is poor, that will have an impact on the
                project’s feasibility.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The matter is one which requires joined-up
                Government and the ability of Departments to sympathetically
                work together and complement each other. I take the Member’s
                point and I assure the House that it is something we are trying
                to achieve. To be specific, water quality would be a matter for
                the Department of the Environment and the Department of
                Agriculture and Rural Development.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Carson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Minister’s report, especially
                since the Enniskillen jobs are in my constituency, and 70 new
                jobs in that area will be welcome.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the statement that there is going
                to be a feasibility study for the restoration of the Ulster
                canal. I hope that the study will also incorporate the
                Coalisland canal in that area. It is a pity this body was not up
                and running a few years ago, so that we could have had more
                control over the waterways coming into the Erne system. There
                has been an infestation of zebra mussels from the Shannon
                system, and I hope the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure
                will endeavour to make sure that this manifestation is contained
                and does not develop further.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I look forward to the Minister’s paying
                close attention to this environmental issue, if it is part of
                his remit, and to his addressing other issues, such as the craft
                that are coming onto our waterways from the South of Ireland. I
                also hope that the Department will institute a feasibility study
                into the size and power of the craft on inland waterways; some
                of them are no longer suitable for inland waterways. I look
                forward, with interest, to seeing how this new body works for
                the advantage of Northern Ireland’s waterways.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGimpsey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Matters such as the size of craft reflect
                back to the question Mr&nbsp;Wilson asked earlier and also the
                ability of Waterways Ireland to take on board the views of
                interest groups, local authorities and other Departments. It is
                very important that that be done and that issues such as the
                size of craft and jet skiing are taken on board.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issue of zebra mussels is not
                specifically the responsibility of Waterways Ireland, but it is
                the responsibility of the Department of Culture, Arts and
                Leisure in terms of the angling estate, and the reality is that
                there is no answer to zebra mussels. In fact, I had never heard
                of zebra mussels until a few months ago. Apparently they are
                very small mussels the size of your thumb; they are inedible and
                have come in from the Caspian Sea. There are no natural
                predators, and their population is exploding. Our concern is
                that they are consuming the habitat that native fish rely on.
                Queen’s University and other universities throughout Europe
                are looking at the issue, but, to date, nobody has come up with
                an answer of how to control them.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat a LeasCheann Comhairle. I
                want to re-enforce the point made earlier by Mrs&nbsp;Carson
                about the Ulster canal and the need to include in the
                feasibility study the Coalisland canal. There is a need to have
                access to the town of Coalisland from the Ulster canal up the
                Coalisland canal. The two are interlinked, and it is very
                important that they be done at the same time in order to
                establish that link.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, with regard to the issue of zebra
                mussels, there needs to be some way of controlling vessels
                travelling from the Shannon waterway, which is infected, right
                up the Blackwater and into Lough Neagh, which is not infected.
                If there are no controls, the fishing stock in Lough Neagh will
                be severely damaged. We need some way of ensuring that when
                boats come into Lough Neagh they are clean and safe.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the placement of the office in
                Enniskillen, and I seek reassurance from the Minister that those
                who will be employed there will be new employees and that
                equality will become a main part of the agenda in the
                recruitment of staff for that office.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will answer the questions in reverse order.
                The Waterways Ireland Board, under the agreement, is currently
                producing its equality scheme which, in common with all other
                Government Departments, bodies and public authorities, will be
                lodged with the Equality Commission in September.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of the estimated 70 jobs for Enniskillen, 80%
                will be new, many of them locally recruited, depending on skills
                available in the area. The head office, which will be the main
                focus for the Waterways Ireland operation, will be in
                Enniskillen. If the Ulster canal were open now, there would be
                difficulty avoiding the transfer of the infamous zebra mussels.
                That would have to come as part and parcel of the planning study
                as the Ulster canal is developed, since we recognise the danger
                to Lough Neagh. There are means to ensure that boats are
                sanitised as they move from one waterway into the other, pending
                our developing a means of controlling the mussels.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Ulster canal is a big scheme, half lying
                in the Irish Republic, and half in Northern Ireland. The last
                estimate for its renovation, in 1998, was £70 million. We are
                now looking at an update of that cost, and how we address it
                will be another matter. The Ulster canal will link with Lough
                Neagh, which will require work on a navigation way through it,
                since there is none at present.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Relating to another question, the Lagan
                navigation — the linkage from Belfast — will also be
                connected. Our future plan is that one will be able to get into
                a boat in Belfast and travel to Dublin using canals and
                waterways.</p>

                Irish language activists on the ground in local communities. How
                much money has been invested to date in this body, and how much
                have the respective Governments invested? When will the funding
                be released to Irish language groups so that they can make
                future provision for programme content to enable them to forward
                plan in terms of employing people to deliver these projects?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am very conscious of the urgency regarding
                this matter given that the Good Friday Agreement compels
                statutory agencies to take resolute action to promote language
                and that very many so far are failing to live up to their
                obligations. Three examples are the courts; directional road
                signs and broadcasting agencies such as UTV, which does not
                appear to acknowledge that the Irish language even exists.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGimpsey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Madam Deputy Speaker, I will try to answer
                all of the points, and please forgive me if I miss some. No
                doubt Mr McElduff will come back to me if I do.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the allocations, the
                indicative funding for 2000-2001 will be £7,879,000. Northern
                Ireland will provide £2,300,000 of that. The Ulster-Scots
                Agency will receive £667,000 and the Irish Language Agency will
                receive £7·2 million. This roughly equates, for the Irish
                Language Agency, to level funding over a number of years when
                one takes into account previous funding through Northern Ireland
                and also through the Irish Republic and Bord na Gaeilge. There
                is roughly a flat funding, as I understand it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For the Ulster-Scots Agency it represents
                roughly a fourfold increase in funding up to £667,000. That is
                the funding that is available indicatively. Because of
                suspension and the interregnum, work on applications was
                suspended so there is work to be done there. As I indicated, the
                board, in the report to the meeting, said it was looking forward
                to coming forward with its strategy. It will be the body
                responsible through the Irish Language Agency and the
                Ulster-Scots Agency for funding the various groups the Member
                mentioned. I imagine that that will be in common with normal
                funding in terms of the criteria set and also the level of
                demand, and, of course, that has to relate to the resources
                available.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not capable at this time of giving a
                definitive answer. I will have to wait until I see the
                strategies and corporate plans from the various bodies before we
                can begin to project. Indicative funding is based on experience
                in the past, and we will take it further on that basis.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The agreement charges us with promoting Irish
                and Ulster-Scots — for example, where there is appropriate
                demand. Mr McElduff mentioned road signs. I do not have any
                response to make with regard to the demand for bi-lingual road
                signs. We will take such matters as they arise, and every issue
                will be examined and determined on its own merit. The main
                responsibility for street names lies with local authorities, and
                therefore is not necessarily the responsibility of the Language
                Body.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Shannon:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have a number of questions for the
                Minister. In the report on languages, paragraph 10 refers to a
                &quot;corporate strategy&quot;. Can the Minister indicate when
                the corporate strategy will be finalised, and when the core
                issues for Ulster-Scots will be addressed?</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.30 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In his previous answer, the Minister said
                that Irish language resources will be £7·2&nbsp;million and
                that resources for Ulster-Scots will be approximately £700,000.
                When does the Minister hope to see parity and financial equality
                for both languages? Lip-service is only being paid to the
                Ulster-Scots language, which is completely inadequate and
                unfair. It does not reflect the opinion in the Province and of
                those who regard themselves as Ulster-Scots people.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Paragraph&nbsp;12 of the report states that
                the council considered a request by the chairperson of the board
                of the Irish Language Agency. Will the Minister clarify what
                that request was? Was it for financial, manpower or womanpower
                assistance? What are the agreed means referred to in the
                statement?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Paragraph 13, where will the funding to
                set up the temporary office in Belfast come from? Obviously,
                secretarial help will also be provided for the temporary office.
                Will the budget for Ulster-Scots be financially disadvantaged as
                a result? Where will the temporary office in Belfast be located,
                and will it become a permanent office, as sometimes happens?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also have a question about Ulster-Scots and
                tourism. Has the Minister given any thought or consideration to
                the introduction of Ulster-Scots’ trails, or something
                similar, to take into account the 250,000&nbsp;people who come
                from Scotland to Northern&nbsp;Ireland every year, to see what
                we have in Northern&nbsp;Ireland? What steps are being taken to
                take advantage of the income that would be generated and the
                interest that people have in the Ulster-Scots language,
                traditions, culture and history?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGimpsey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Member for those questions. As
                with previous questions, I shall try to catch them all. On
                support to the chair of the Irish Language Agency, we are
                talking about appointing a deputy chair, as it is an unpaid,
                voluntary post which has been much more time consuming than was
                previously thought. It is not anticipated that there will be
                financial consequences, and it is certainly not anticipated that
                there will be any disadvantages for Ulster-Scots.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A corporate strategy for the Ulster-Scots
                Agency is currently under way, as I said in my report. The
                strategy and corporate plans of the Ulster-Scots Agency and the
                Irish Language Agency will inform the Language Body. Those two
                reports — on Ulster-Scots and Irish — are necessary to
                inform the Department, to allow us to develop our strategy. We
                have a duty to be as best informed as we can.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is a matter for the Irish body to
                determine where its temporary office will be. I am on record as
                saying that it should be in a neutral venue, and the same
                applies to the Ulster-Scots Agency, which will also have an
                office in Belfast. It will also begin with a temporary office
                and a search by both bodies is under way. On the difficulties of
                parity between Ulster-Scots and Irish, I do not agree that there
                is unequal treatment. My policy is to provide fair treatment for
                everybody in the community, including those of Ulster-Scots and
                Irish identity. Like Mr Shannon, I am an ‘Ards man, so I am
                very familiar with growing up in an Ulster-Scots environment,
                although I was not aware of the heritage and identity that I had
                when I was growing up. The vernacular and the way we spoke was
                just something that we all did. We simply had an understanding
                that it was not quite English.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have no hesitation in saying that there
                will be equal treatment for everyone, and also fair treatment
                for the languages of ethnic communities. It is wrong to use the
                treatment of one language as a benchmark for the treatment of
                the other, because one is not comparing like with like.
                Ulster-Scots as a language, a culture and a heritage is in its
                infancy compared with Irish and Gaelic. There is a great deal of
                work to do. Under direct rule the funding for Ulster-Scots was
                £118,000. Under this process funding will be £667,000 in the
                first year. That is a fourfold increase. There is a limit to the
                ability of the Ulster-Scots community to absorb resources and
                use them profitably in order to develop. There is a lot of work
                going on with the agency, the Ulster-Scots Heritage Council and
                the Ulster-Scots Language Society.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Mr&nbsp;Shannon is aware, and this
                reflects an earlier point he made, one of the problems that
                Hansard is encountering and that the Agency has identified and
                is working hard on is the codifying of Ulster-Scots. It has
                never been codified. Work on a dictionary and the grammar is
                currently underway. There is also discussion about whether to
                rely on Scots or to go back to the seventeenth century and try
                to build it up from the roots. I know they are working hard to
                resolve that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As far as Ulster-Scots heritage trails are
                concerned, I entirely agree that there is a huge tourist
                potential there. In Irish America, approximately 40&nbsp;million
                Americans consider themselves Irish, and about 56% of them, at
                the last estimate, consider themselves Scotch-Irish or
                Ulster-Scots. They call it Scotch-Irish; we call it
                Ulster-Scots. There is a massive tourist resource for Northern
                Ireland on that side of things. The Ulster-American Folk Park is
                an example of how things can develop. There are exciting
                prospects for developing not just the language, but also the
                culture and heritage, and how that can be sold in terms of
                cultural tourism.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister for his report on inland

                pronunciation of the Gaelic.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report says that the Irish Language
                Agency has continued to carry forward the work of these various
                agencies. I am familiar with the work of the former Bord na
                Gaeilge and An Gúm, but I am not as familiar with the
                Terminology Committee. Could the Minister tell us a little about
                the Terminology Committee, what its functions have been and how
                these will be progressed in the new Irish language body?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGimpsey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The short answer is that I am not familiar
                with the actual details of the body and of An Coiste
                Téarmaíochta, the Terminology Committee, and how that
                integrates. That would be a matter for the Irish language
                Agency, reporting to the Language Body. I imagine they are
                carrying on as in previous years, using that as their precedent.
                Again, I am not familiar with the details. I can certainly make
                an effort to find out, and I will write to Dr&nbsp;Adamson on
                that. Neither the agencies or the body have produced a corporate
                plan. It is behind time, but that is to do with the interregnum
                and the suspension. They are working hard on that, and the
                functions of the Terminology Committee should be spelt out
                clearly when it is published.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McMenamin:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister and welcome his report.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Irish and Ulster-Scots, at present, are seen
                in Northern Ireland as foreign languages. Does the Minister
                believe that it is imperative to establish a cultural heritage
                programme to co-ordinate and focus efforts to put young people
                in Northern Ireland in touch with vital elements of their
                culture such as language? Does the Minister agree that more
                Irish language teachers and special language counsellors need to
                be appointed to assist our young people to offer Irish and
                Ulster-Scots as attractive choices?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGimpsey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In terms of our cultural heritage — and it
                is a shared heritage — I believe strongly that mutual
                co-operation in the form of working and helping everyone to
                understand our cultural heritage will help foster greater
                understanding and respect among our society. I come from an
                Ulster-Scots background but did not understand it as I was
                growing up.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important that we understand where we
                are coming from. In terms of the instruction of the Irish
                language, if the Member is referring to its role in the
                classroom or as a form of Irish language medium education, that
                would be a matter for the Department of Education. With regard
                to promoting the Irish language, that is something we are
                already doing. We are also promoting Ulster-Scots and the
                languages of our ethnic communities; it is important we do not
                forget about them. I was at a linguistic diversity conference
                last week in the Indian Centre in Clifton Street. It was
                remarkable to discover the number of ethnic minorities who are
                now indigenous to Northern Ireland and who have been almost
                subsumed or buried underneath the Irish, the Ulster-Scots and
                the English heritage. This is another important area which has
                to be promoted. The Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure will
                specifically promote the language of ethnic minorities as well
                as Irish and Ulster-Scots. How they do this is a matter for the
                agencies and a matter for the body.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Birnie:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to ask the Minister two questions
                about the Ulster-Scots Agency. First, can he elaborate on
                measures being put in place to promote that culture in broad
                terms, broader terms than simply the language, important though
                that might be? Secondly, can he comment on measures being put in
                place to promote liaison between the Ulster-Scots Agency and any
                relevant institutions outside of Northern Ireland, particularly
                and obviously in Scotland?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGimpsey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In terms of liaison with other groups it is
                very important to develop the link between the Ulster-Scots
                agency and its work in Scotland. It is a matter for the
                Ulster-Scots Agency to determine how they are going to do this.
                We have a mechanism through the British/Irish Council, as
                Dr&nbsp;Birnie is aware, which is a very important function of
                the British/Irish Council, allowing us to promote Ulster-Scots
                through that linkage. In terms of codifying the Ulster-Scots,
                the Scots have already done much work on this in Scotland for
                Lannans and also for Doric, and I think the Ulster-Scots are
                hoping to learn from their experience.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a discussion going on about whether
                they should base their codification on the experience in
                Scotland or whether they should be looking at how the language
                has developed in Northern Ireland historically. In terms of
                promoting the Ulster-Scots culture, that, as I said, is a matter
                for the Ulster-Scots Agency, and it has its corporate plan to
                bring forward. It is currently working hard on it, and I know
                that the chair of the Ulster-Scots Agency and the body itself
                are keenly aware of the potential of promoting the Ulster-Scots

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the Minister confirm that, as Mr Speaker

                that will benefit everyone, not only ourselves in Northern

                fulfilling exercise for a large section of the population. It is
                a serious operation. The organisations involved, such as the

                come before the House to make a report on Ulster-Scots. We are
                talking about equitable treatment. Whatever principle applies to

                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Agriculture and Rural
                Development (Ms Rodgers): </b>I should like to report to the
                Assembly on the meeting of the North/South Ministerial Council
                in sectoral format in Dublin on Monday 26 June 2000. Mr Dermot
                Nesbitt and I attended that meeting. The Government of the
                Republic of Ireland was represented by Mr Joe Walsh TD, Minister
                for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. This report has
                been approved by Mr&nbsp;Nesbitt and is also made on his behalf.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This was the first meeting of the council in
                its agriculture sectoral format and the areas of co-operation as
                presented to the plenary meeting on 13&nbsp;December 1999 were
                agreed. The broad areas of co-operation are: common agricultural
                policy (CAP) issues; animal and plant health research and
                development; and rural development. Within these areas the
                council reviewed the high level of existing co-operation between
                the two Departments and discussed a range of matters for
                enhanced co-operation. The council recognised the important
                contribution already being made to the development of
                agriculture by the two Departments and endorsed a proposal that
                officials prepare a detailed programme for joint action for
                consideration at the next council meeting in sectoral format.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On specific issues, the council noted the
                difficulties in both the North and the South in implementing new
                area-based schemes for less favoured area payments. In seeking
                to secure European Commission approval, the Agriculture
                Departments in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland are
                working to minimise the risk of their new schemes producing big
                winners and big losers while at the same time ensuring that
                their schemes comply with EU regulations. Both Departments
                agreed to keep in touch regarding these difficulties and in
                their respective negotiations with the European Commission. On
                BSE the council noted my continuing efforts to achieve low BSE
                incidence status for Northern Ireland. In particular I welcomed
                the support of Minister&nbsp;Walsh and that of EU
                Commissioner&nbsp;Byrne.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The council also noted the activity which has
                taken place in the area of animal and plant health and research
                and development, and officials in the two Departments will now
                consider how continued activity might be formalised. For the
                next meeting of the North/South Ministerial Council in its
                agriculture sectoral format, officials will produce a programme
                of work identifying those areas with the greatest potential for
                enhanced co-operation, together with a timetable for further
                work.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The council received a progress report on the
                joint study of the pig meat processing capacity in Ireland
                commissioned by both Agriculture Departments in
                December&nbsp;1999. The council acknowledged the very severe
                contraction in the pig industry, particularly in Northern
                Ireland and noted that the study, together with the views of the
                two Agriculture Departments, would be presented to the next
                North/South Ministerial Council meeting in its agriculture
                sectoral format. We also noted that there has been an
                improvement in the price of pigs in recent times, which is very
                welcome.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the broader rural development front, the
                council agreed to reconstitute a steering committee on
                cross-border rural development. The terms of reference of this
                committee, together with the rules of procedure, were agreed.
                The committee, which was first established in 1991, comprises
                senior officials from both Departments. It will consider ways to
                promote maximum co-operation in the implementation of rural
                development and EU programmes. The committee will also exchange
                information on experience and best practice in both
                jurisdictions in relation to rural development. It will also
                continue to develop common approaches to cross-border area-based
                strategies and rural development research.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A detailed work programme will be drawn up,
                and the agreed proposals will be tabled for endorsement at the
                next meeting of the North/South Ministerial Council in its
                agriculture sectoral format. The council agreed that it will
                meet on a quarterly basis in this format and that the next
                meeting will take place in October in Northern Ireland. The
                council also agreed the text of a joint communiqué, which was
                issued following the meeting. A copy of the communiqué has been
                placed in the Assembly Library.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairman of the Agriculture and Rural

                much time was spent discussing the number of BSE cases in the
                Irish Republic? These seem to be increasing. The figures that I
                have before me are quite alarming. They show that in Northern
                Ireland there were six cases in 1998-99. I understand that so
                far this year there has been one case, whereas the numbers in
                the Irish Republic go into hundreds. Did the Minister take time
                with her colleague to discuss that matter? It seems strange that
                she is delighted that the Minister in the South is backing her
                case for low incidence BSE status for Northern Ireland, while at
                the same time there seems to be a rising tide of BSE cases in
                the Irish Republic.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Member for his question. My main
                concern is to get low incidence BSE status for Northern Ireland.
                I am aware that the Northern Ireland figures are better than
                those in the Republic, and it is for this reason that I am
                actively pursuing low incidence status for Northern Ireland. I
                did not discuss the situation in the Republic. I am pleased to
                inform the Member that, in relation to low incidence BSE status
                for Northern Ireland, I have the full support of the Minister
                for Agriculture, Joe Walsh, and that will be extremely important
                when our case reaches the stage of going before the member
                states.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister for her report. Has the
                Minister any views on the development of a common approach to
                developing cross-border rural development strategies?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Rodgers:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I think that developing cross-border rural
                development strategies is extremely important, and they have
                been very beneficial to areas on both sides of the border. For
                example, in the integrated approach involving the Clogher Valley
                and Ballyhaise in Cavan, farmers on both sides have co-operated
                in improving their situation. One of the problems for such areas
                in the past has been that they have, in a sense, developed in a
                back-to-back approach, which has had a negative impact on areas
                on both sides. There is now the potential, within the developing
                cross-border rural development strategy, to allow those areas to
                work in an integrated basis using EU funds. This can be of real
                benefit to the rural communities on both sides of the border
                that have suffered from a back-to-back approach in the past.
                They can now work together on the basis of an integrated
                approach.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thank you, A LeasCheann Comhairle. I welcome
                the Minister’s statement. Can the Minister have any input to
                the question of planning in rural areas? Is there any way of
                alleviating the difficulties that the farming community is
                experiencing presently by, for example, trying to encourage
                planners not to be so restrictive in relation to planning where
                land has become almost obsolete and is the only form of income a
                farmer might have at present?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Also, while the rural development programme

                revitalisation of deprived rural areas throughout the North of
                Ireland, would she give consideration to ensuring that all
                sections of the rural community are involved in their own rural

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Member for his two questions. I
                have no formal role in planning. That particular area is the
                responsibility of the Department of the Environment, but I hope
                to work closely with it because I recognise that there are
                problems relating to planning, particularly for diversification
                in rural areas. I will work closely with the Department of the
                Environment, but I do not have a formal role in the development
                of the planning strategies.</p>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second part of the Member’s question
                concerned the involvement of rural communities. There has been
                quite a lot of welcome involvement by rural communities in the
                designing of their projects and in identifying their needs.
                Because rural communities know their needs better than anyone
                else, they are best placed to identify those needs. That has
                been going on with the help of officials. Local involvement is
                an integral part of the rural development programme, and I hope
                that the new rural development strategy continues to strengthen
                and encourage it.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ford:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the Minister permits, I will ask two
                questions. First, I welcome the reconstitution of the steering
                committee on rural development, but I note that the Minister’s
                statement specifically says that it comprises senior officials
                from both jurisdictions. Is there any value in senior officials
                exchanging information if that information does not reach the
                ground where it might be of direct benefit? Can she explain how
                that will happen? I suspect that at times we have an information
                overload at senior level, yet sometimes the practical examples
                are not communicated to people working on the ground.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, the Minister referred earlier to
                the difficulties in implementing the new area-based schemes
                under the less favoured areas (LFA) proposals. Both
                jurisdictions are having difficulties getting those plans
                approved in Brussels. Can the Minister provide some more detail
                on when Northern Ireland farmers are likely to hear anything
                concrete on that? Unfortunately, to hear that we have problems
                with Brussels is not new; it would be much more beneficial if we
                could hear when those problems were likely to be resolved.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Member for his two questions. I
                will try to oblige and be very patient. I hope that everyone is
                not going to ask me two questions together.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In response to the Member’s first question
                about people at senior level, officials take on board the views
                of everyone when discussing these issues. In the rural
                development programme people are involved at all levels, and
                local people are particularly involved in local action groups,
                the INTERREG programme and community networks. Although senior
                officials are clearly the people who will be steering it along,
                as has been the case in the past, it will be in conjunction with
                rural communities and the people on the ground. Their views will
                be taken on board.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In relation to the LFA schemes, we are, as
                the Member is aware, currently revising our proposals. There
                will be further discussions with Brussels this month and after
                that there will be further consultation. The reality is that
                Brussels sent back the scheme that we put forward for the less
                favoured areas, as it sent back the schemes put forward by other
                UK regions and the Government in the Republic of Ireland. Our
                scheme was aimed at minimising the numbers of losers and winners
                and had an environmental component based on area rather than on
                headage. I am afraid that, in conjunction with the less favoured
                area farmers, we did not quite succeed in getting what we
                wanted. It is difficult to say when the proposals will be ready,
                but I can tell the Member that we are working on them and that
                they will be ready as soon as possible.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It comes as no surprise that Mr Walsh TD is
                fully backing our case for low incidence BSE status. If I were
                sitting with one hundred times the cases of BSE that another
                country had, I would be backing its arguments for low incidence
                BSE status. It will help his case significantly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since devolution, has the Minister at any
                point questioned the Irish Republic’s Minister about BSE
                cases? Does she recognise that it will impinge upon Northern
                Ireland’s case because cattle imported from the Irish Republic
                may contaminate livestock in Northern Ireland with BSE?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Also, has she raised the problem of the
                higher levels of tuberculosis and brucellosis in the Irish
                livestock herd compared to those in Northern Ireland’s?
                Finally, will she outline the proposals which she has been
                making to Brussels regarding the area payments?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Rodgers:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I cannot remember how many questions I have
                had on that, but I will take the last first and then work my way
                back. The last one was about what proposals we are making in
                relation to LFA. I would need to have had a secretary beside me
                to keep track of all those questions — was it four? I am not
                sure. In relation to the LFA we are looking at putting forward
                new proposals which we hope to finalise very soon. We are
                looking at various areas, for instance, the idea of capping
                payments, raising the minimal acreage or hectarage for
                eligibility and at various proposals which will help us to
                ensure that the redistribution does not have a negative impact
                which it might otherwise have on our farmers. We want the
                redistribution to be as fair as possible and to have the minimum
                number of winners and the minimum number of losers. That is what
                we are working on. We are also looking at the situation of
                phasing in the changes over three years. We have not finalised
                our proposals yet, but those are the kind of areas that we are
                looking at. My priority is to ensure that the redistribution
                will not have a negative impact on those who most need help in
                the less favoured areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the low-incidence status, the
                Northern Ireland case is separate from that of the Republic of
                Ireland. Its position will not affect ours. Therefore, it is not
                necessary for me to raise the points that the Member mentioned.
                What we are looking for is low-incidence status for Northern
                Ireland. Northern Ireland will, in that situation, be treated as
                a region of the United Kingdom with separate status from the
                other regions of the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland.
                Our main priority is to ensure that we get that low-incidence
                status; that it will be based on the strong case that we know we
                have because of the fact that last year we had only six cases.
                That is my main priority. It is not necessary to raise anything
                relating to the Republic’s incidence.</p>

                fluctuations in BSE promoted by elected representatives at a
                time when there is a real chance of putting the problem in its
                true perspective, which, I understand, is that the scourge is
                minimal compared to other European countries. In relation to
                cross-border rural development, what has the steering committee

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since 1991, when the steering group was set
                up, it has acted as a useful forum for exchanging information,
                for example, on the evaluation of European Union programmes,
                such as LEADER II. It has also encouraged LEADER transnational
                co-operation and has reconciled policy and practice on both
                sides of the border to facilitate progress on rural development
                initiatives, for example, exchange of guidelines on LEADER II.
                Reports on progress were presented to the Intergovernmental

                the initiative in promoting rural development to its full
                potential in this Province which is her responsibility. It seems
                ludicrous for the Minister to be in discussions with the
                Minister of the Irish Republic in connection with areas of
                common interest at a time when no clear indication of policy on
                rural development has been made to the Assembly’s Department
                of Agriculture and Rural Development Committee. When will the

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member will understand that in this
                report I am dealing with the North/South Ministerial Council in
                its sectoral meeting, which is specifically dealing with
                North/South issues, and for that reason the emphasis has been on
                North/South co-operation in rural development and other areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In relation to rural development in Northern
                Ireland, I can assure the Member that, for me, that issue is a
                high priority. It is an area that is close to my heart. I
                recognise the need to provide support and economic regeneration
                for deprived rural areas in Northern Ireland, which, given the
                changes in agriculture and world markets, are under severe

                strategy, and I am taking a keen personal interest. I hope that

                I can assure Mr Kane that as soon as it is available, I will

                I welcome the Minister’s report, and especially the references
                to the reconstruction of the steering committee on cross-border
                and rural development, promoting co-operation and the
                implementation of rural development. Does the Minister agree
                that it is about time that we had an agreed agricultural policy
                on the island?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Rodgers:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member will realise that as we are
                presently part of the United Kingdom we have to work within its
                framework. The United Kingdom is the member state; that is how
                Europe works, and we must work within the context of being a
                region of the United Kingdom.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is not to say that we are not able to
                find common cause with the Irish Government on many areas within
                Europe, and a perfect example is our search for low-incidence
                BSE status. We have been guaranteed the full support of the
                Irish Government and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and
                Rural Development in the Irish Government, Joe&nbsp;Walsh TD,
                when we come to put our case to the member states. We want to
                co-operate strongly with them on such issues.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I recognise the Member’s point about common
                agricultural interest, North and South, but we have to live in
                the real world, and, at the moment, we are working through the
                United Kingdom Government as a region of the United Kingdom.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I noted in the Minister’s statement that
                she acknowledges the severe contraction in the pig industry, but
                is she aware of just how severe it is? Something like 60% of the
                pig industry has now disappeared. What steps is the Minister
                going to take to stop this trend? If we have to wait for another
                long period before there is an announcement or a statement from
                the Minister, the pig industry will have retracted further.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the moment pig prices are such that there
                is no profit in Northern Ireland pig production, and that
                situation cannot continue. Is the Minister aware of that crisis,
                and will she assure this House that she will not wait for action
                by her counterparts across the border, whose position is less
                severe, but will take all the necessary steps to rejuvenate this
                sector of the agriculture industry?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Member for his question. It is
                not related to my report, but I will attempt to deal with it as
                best I can. The Member will note that that is one of the first
                issues that I discussed at my first informal meeting with the
                Minister in the Republic as soon as I became Minister. The
                crisis in the pig industry was the main issue of discussion, and
                the Member will be glad to learn that at that meeting we decided
                to set up a joint study of processing capacity on the island in
                recognition of the processing capacity problem experienced at
                that time, particularly in the North.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That study has been put in place, and we will
                hopefully receive a report on how it has been going at the next
                meeting in October. The study will cost approximately £100,000,
                and Northern Ireland will contribute 25% of the cost, which will
                be shared equally between the Department of Agriculture and
                Rural Development and the Industrial Development Board. The
                Republic of Ireland will pay the rest. That was one clear
                benefit which accrued from our first meeting and which is
                ongoing in relation to helping the pig producers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member will also be aware that help for
                the pig sector was put in place at the Prime Minister’s summit
                in March. The pig scheme, which is actually being processed at
                the moment, is to help outgoers and those who wish to remain in
                the pig business. The outgoers scheme will be retrospective and
                will help those who have already left. Ongoers will be helped as
                regards interest payments. The Member will also be aware that
                one of the problems in the pig industry is oversupply.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In relation to the Member’s point about the
                pig crisis, I was speaking only two hours ago to two young
                farmers, and they were confirming the price of pigs. About 10
                days ago the price was about 89p per kilo and then it went to
                93p per kilo. The price of 89p per kilo was just about the
                break-even point. Now the industry is barely in profit. I am not
                suggesting that that is in any way satisfactory — it is not at
                all — but it is at least some improvement on the position
                where they were losing all the time. I welcomed that as a sign
                of movement. However, it is a little chink of light on the
                horizon. The other matters I have referred to will also be put
                in place. I am keenly aware of the very difficult situation pig
                farmers have been in. I have pig farmers in my constituency, and
                I well know the problems they have been facing. I am doing all
                that I can to help them, within the constraints of the European
                regulations.</p>

                However, I cannot at the moment answer the question because the
                matter is not part of my report since it was not discussed.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have several points to raise before moving
                to questions. First, during Question Time on Monday
                26&nbsp;June, Mr&nbsp;Derek&nbsp;Hussey asked me to review
                Hansard of 12&nbsp;June, at pages 84-85, to determine whether
                the Minister had provided an answer to his question. I have read
                Hansard again, as well as the ruling that I gave immediately
                before Mr&nbsp;Hussey raised his point of order on 26&nbsp;June.
                As I said then, it is very difficult for the Chair to rule on
                whether or not a question has been answered as clearly and as
                fully as possible. However, if the House is dissatisfied with a
                ministerial response, there is opportunity within the time
                allotted for supplementary questions to be pressed. On the
                question to which the Member referred, a number of other Members
                took up the cudgels on behalf of the Member’s question —
                metaphorically — and pressed the matter further. That is the
                proper way for the Assembly to hold Ministers to account.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, on this morning’s question from
                Mr&nbsp;Jim Shannon, further to the advice that I gave at the
                time, I can inform the House that, just as the Hansard
                sub-editors make spelling, grammatical and other changes to the
                speeches made in English, using standard English rules, and to
                those in Irish, using Ulster Irish as the standard, the same
                process is undertaken by the Ulster-Scots sub-editor of Hansard,
                using the Scots Language Society’s list of spellings. I
                understand that there is currently no agreed Ulster-Scots list
                of spellings or grammar. Therefore the use by Hansard of the
                Scots Language Society’s list seems reasonable in the current
                climate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thirdly, earlier today a number of Members
                raised the issue of questions being put to Ministers by other
                Ministers. The Deputy Speaker pointed out, quite rightly, that
                current Standing Orders do not prohibit any Member from putting
                questions to Ministers. The arrangements for the Executive in
                this Assembly are unique. Conventions observed in another place
                operate in the context of collective Cabinet responsibility. To
                date in the Assembly, there is no evidence of Ministers putting
                down questions for written or oral answer, although that would
                not be prohibited by Standing Orders. It should be welcomed that
                Ministers have chosen to follow that approach, and I hope that
                they will continue to do so.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issue of questions to Ministers following
                statements arose this morning. Once again, Standing Orders are
                not directive. However, it seems to me that although a Minister,
                as Minister, should not use the Chamber to question another
                Minister, he or she may do so as a private Member. Accordingly,
                this morning when I called Mr&nbsp;Dodds to put a question to
                the First and Deputy First Ministers, Members will have observed
                that I called him as Mr&nbsp;Dodds, and deliberately not as the
                Minister for Social Development. To emphasise the difference, I
                suggest that when Ministers wish to speak in a private Member
                capacity, whether in debate or during questions or statements,
                they should show that distinction by speaking from other than
                the Front Benches. I am aware that a number of Ministers already
                observe that convention, and I commend the practice to the
                House.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also commend Mr&nbsp;Hussey, who, when
                raising his point of order, identified the Standing Order to
                which he was referring. That is also a practice that I commend
                to the House.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Making the case for Northern Ireland to be
                accepted as a BSE low incidence region is my highest priority.
                One of the first things I did when I resumed my position as
                Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development was to have an
                early meeting with Nick&nbsp;Brown to make sure that he
                understood my desire to keep this matter moving. I also changed
                my Assembly business commitments on 19&nbsp;June to allow me to
                travel to Luxembourg to meet personally with
                Commissioner&nbsp;Byrne. I have also met Joe&nbsp;Walsh to
                ensure that I could count on his support for the case when it
                comes to the negotiating stages in Brussels. I also raised the
                issue in the North/South Ministerial Council to ensure that that
                body was fully aware of the priority that I attach to the
                matter.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In relation to the current position, I had a
                very positive meeting with Commissioner&nbsp;Byrne in
                Luxembourg. He accepted the economic importance of the measure
                to the whole of the beef industry in Northern Ireland and
                reaffirmed his support for the case. There are still some
                technical details to be worked out, and my officials are working
                closely with the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and
                with the Commission officials to resolve them. I hope that as a
                result of these discussions it will be possible to issue a
                consultation document on the case within the next few weeks,
                perhaps even within the next number of days. The response to the
                consultation will be vital in helping to shape the subsequent
                negotiations with the Commission.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yes, I have to say that Nick&nbsp;Brown is
                fully behind our attempts to get low-incidence status and has
                been extremely supportive. I suppose you could say that Scotland
                is not as happy as it might be about it. In fairness to
                Ross&nbsp;Finnie, the Scottish Minister, he has been supportive
                of my efforts and has assured me of his support. I am quite
                happy that Nick&nbsp;Brown is fully behind me. He has been
                extremely helpful in every possible way.</p>

                farmers who originally thought up this policy of low-incidence
                BSE status? They would be on hand to advise her, her
                departmental officials and the UK representative during these
                important negotiations. Further to that, can she explain to the
                House the timetable that the Department and the Ministry of
                Agriculture, Fisheries and Food have and are working to in order
                to achieve low-incidence BSE status for Northern&nbsp;Ireland?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Rodgers:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In relation to bringing a delegation from the
                UFU with me to Brussels, I have to inform the Member that I am
                very happy with the work that is being done by my Department.
                Its officials are treating this with the priority that I wish
                them to. They are working extremely hard on all fronts with
                officials from the commission. I have and will continue to
                consult with both the UFU and the Northern Ireland Agricultural
                Producers’ Association (NIAPA), both of whom are extremely
                anxious — and they have made it clear to me — that this be a
                priority for the farming community which both those
                organisations represent. I have consulted with them, and I will
                continue to do so. Of course, I have also consulted with the
                rest of the industry that has an interest in this rather complex
                issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In relation to the timetable, the answer to
                Mr&nbsp;Paisley’s question is that I would like low-incidence
                status tomorrow morning, but this is a complex issue, and it is
                impossible to put a timescale on it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I had hoped that it would have been possible
                to achieve it by the end of the year. Because of some
                difficulties, I now understand that it may be a few months
                later. These arose due to concerns the commission had with
                putting the right controls in place and ensuring there would not
                be a back-door passage for British beef products through
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland into Europe. I am pleased to say that
                those have now been ironed out, and we are back on course.
                However, we are committed to a consultation period of
                8&nbsp;weeks.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Once the proposals go to the commission,
                which I hope will be days rather than weeks, it will then go out
                for simultaneous consultation with industry and the general
                public. That will last for eight weeks, which will bring us into
                September. At that stage we should be able to bring it to the
                member states to look at it. The Standing Veterinary Committee
                will have to look at it, and there will be inspections in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland to verify that all the controls are in
                place and working. That is a complex process and cannot be done
                overnight. I share the Ulster Farmers’ Union, the Northern
                Ireland Agricultural Producers’ Association and the Members’
                concerns that we should get low-incidence status as soon as
                possible.</p>

                major supermarkets and retailers must sell beef from Northern
                Ireland, what safeguards can the Minister put in place to
                protect existing trade between mainland United&nbsp;Kingdom and

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is, as I have already mentioned, one of
                the considerations that we have had to deal with. We did consult
                with the whole industry, and the meat processors would have
                difficulty if carcass meat could not come across from England or
                Scotland. We have looked at that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My officials are working on proposals to
                ensure that trade will not be disrupted and that established
                trade links can continue with maximum economic benefit for the
                industry as a whole. Those are the proposals that are being
                worked on at the moment.</p>

                (Rev Dr Ian Paisley): </b>Does the Minister find it strange that
                countries with increasing incidences of BSE are sitting in
                condemnation of Northern&nbsp;Ireland’s case? For instance,
                Portugal’s BSE&nbsp;cases rose last year to 330, the Irish
                Republic’s to 410, while here there were six cases last year
                and one this year. Surely it is unfair that countries with a
                rising BSE crisis are sitting on their hands and holding back
                when we, according to the Minister’s statement in the House
                today, have to wait until next spring before we have an answer.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I share the Member’s frustration, as does
                the farming community in Northern&nbsp;Ireland, at the situation
                in which we find ourselves. However, the reason we find
                ourselves in this position is that we were treated as a part of
                the United&nbsp;Kingdom, which had a high incidence of BSE, when
                we had a very low incidence.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In my view we should never have been in the
                situation we are now. The reason we are is that we were linked
                to the high incidence in the United&nbsp;Kingdom. I am
                responsible for Northern&nbsp;Ireland low-incidence status. I am
                doing my best. It is not my responsibility to look at other
                countries. I understand the frustrations, but it is in our
                interest to get the support of the member states in moving our
                case forward. I do not think it would help our case if I were to
                start criticising the other member states when, in fact, we will
                be looking for their strong support in the next part of the

                the £500,000 to be given to the beef industry to help promote
                itself under the agenda for government will be contingent on
                achievement of low-incidence BSE status, or whether, in her

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The £500,000 which has been set aside will
                be ring-fenced to deal with the resource implications of getting
                low incidence BSE. This achievement of low incidence BSE will
                create the framework for our beef industry to commence exports
                on a meaningful scale. Much work has to be done with previous
                and potential customers by individual companies and the
                Livestock and Meat Commission, but additional costs will be
                inevitable if we are to build up exports quickly. These will
                include costs associated with additional testing to demonstrate
                our low level of BSE and the achievement of internationally
                recognised accreditation of our quality assurance scheme. We
                want the industry to suggest how the £500,000 can best be
                spent. The reason that I have applied for that in this round of
                funding is that I want us to be ready so that as soon as we get
                low incidence BSE the resources are there to enable us to start
                building up our exports immediately.</p>

                conditions over and above those consistent with the operation of
                good agricultural practice. There was concern that additional

                have funds available for modulation and, I hope, environmental
                schemes. The LFA scheme does have an environmental aspect to it,
                although it is not an environmental scheme per se, but it will
                have environmental conditions attached. It will not be
                permissable to remove hedgerows without consent, and there will
                be penalties if they are removed, and so on. I will be looking

                constant crises that have been endured by many farmers, whether
                they be pig farmers, beef farmers, sheep farmers or milk
                farmers? Do the numbers entering Greenmount College not show
                that there is great concern in the farming community? It is
                vital that we ensure that the numbers of students and graduates
                from that college increase. That can only happen with the
                impetus of financial assistance from the Minister’s

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am aware of the concern in the farming
                community. Even people who are not involved in agriculture are
                aware of the difficulties that farmers face, although I am
                hoping that there will now be an upturn.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There has been an increase in enrolments in
                1998-99. That was due to the introduction of new courses to meet
                industry demand and the addition of flexible courses. Again,
                that was an attempt to meet the needs of the farming community.
                If there is more flexibility that allows students to study at a
                rate that suits their requirements, clearly that will help them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The new programme with the biggest impact on
                enrolments was the pilot multiskilling programme, through which
                young people can achieve an NVQ level 3 qualification in
                agriculture in parallel with an NVQ level 3 qualification in
                another discipline. This prepares them to seek employment at the
                farm at home and also on a part-time basis. We are trying to be
                flexible, to look at the needs of the farming community and to
                provide the courses which suit them in a situation where there
                will have to be off-farm work and diversification. We need times
                that suit them.</p>

                was reached at the April meeting of the EU Council of
                Agriculture Ministers. From September 2000, all cuts of beef
                will have to be labelled with the country of slaughter, the
                country of cutting, the category of animal and a reference code
                that will allow the beef to be traced back to the animal or
                group of animals from which it is derived. In the case of mince,
                the country of processing will also have to be shown.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">From 1 January 2002, additional details will
                have to be included covering the country of birth and the
                country of rearing. These general rules now have to be
                considered by the European Parliament. The environment committee
                of that Parliament is to vote on the labelling rules this week.
                The European Commission has also brought forward to the beef
                management committee draft detailed rules to give effect to the
                agreement reached by the Council of Ministers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am fully aware of the industry’s concerns

                requirement. I have discussed the issue with Mr Brown and other
                regional agriculture ministers. We are agreed on the need to
                ensure that the final labelling system does not present

                John&nbsp;Hume. He is fully aware of the difficulties created by
                the current beef-labelling proposals, and he has assured me that
                he will do what he can to gain whatever easement possible
                through the European Parliament. Dr&nbsp;Ian&nbsp;Paisley and Mr
                Jim Nicholson are also aware of the difficulties and will do

                Within the European Union we cannot prevent pig meat from member
                countries from coming in to Northern Ireland. What we can do —
                and we have put £400,000 into this — is to assist our farmers
                in marketing Northern Ireland pig meat and hope that people will

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Agriculture Ministers are currently reviewing
                these arrangements. The existing approach seems unfair to
                specialist cereal growers who consider that, on an individual
                crop basis, their yields are on a par with similar producers in
                England. However, due to the current method of calculating
                payments, they receive lower direct subsidies. Scottish
                producers have also felt aggrieved by the regime. Ross Finnie,
                the Scottish Minister, and I have both written to
                Nick&nbsp;Brown seeking his co-operation in securing change.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If our plans are successful the Northern
                Irish, Scottish and Welsh producers would receive higher
                payments than they do at present. This can be achieved only at
                the expense of producers in England. However, given that English
                producers would receive only a small percentage reduction, while
                those in Scotland and Northern Ireland would achieve a large
                percentage increase if the system were changed, I will continue
                to press the case.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It must be recognised, however, that there is
                nothing in this proposition for English producers, and
                resolution of the problem will be difficult unless, and until,
                farming organisations across the United&nbsp;Kingdom can agree a
                solution acceptable to them.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister for her reply. With the
                exceptionally wet weather over the past two years and the poor
                growing season at the beginning of this year, the current
                growing season has been particularly poor. Does Minister agree
                that cereal growing in Northern Ireland needs some form of
                additional revenue as a boost for the farmers?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree, but I have to work within budgetary
                constraints and the constraints of EU regulations. That is the
                reality. I realise that I am beginning to sound like a parrot.
                Unfortunately, when one is in politics one has to deal with the
                reality and not just the aspiration. I agree with the Member, I
                am pressing the case very hard, and I have the support of
                Ross&nbsp;Finnie. The National Farmers’ Union in England has
                set its face against any change in the system that would give
                higher payments to our cereal growers. I think that the increase
                would be 10% to 14%. That is the reality, and I will continue to
                press the case.</p>

                be next year before any changes to the regionalisation plan
                could take effect. However, if the current proposals for a
                change to the plan were to be agreed at both UK and EU levels
                then, on the assumption of the average areas claim for 1997 to
                1999, and the 1999 Euro to sterling exchange rate, all UK
                producers growing crops other than maize would receive a payment
                of £236·52 per hectare. This would mean an increase of some
                14% and 10% in Northern Ireland less favoured area and non-less
                favoured area payments respectively. English payments would be
                reduced by around £3 per hectare, which would represent a 1%
                reduction.</p>

                supported from existing baselines plus funds raised from
                modulation. While existing budget baselines are sufficient to
                support the continuation of the environmentally sensitive areas
                schemes, meaningful development of the organic farming scheme
                and the countryside management scheme depends in large measure
                on the additional funds delivered by modulation. It is
                anticipated in the rural development regulation plan, submitted
                to Brussels on 1&nbsp;February 2000, that, by 2006, the organic
                farming scheme will grow from its present level of 20 farmers
                with 1000 hectares under agreement, to 1000 farmers with 30,000
                hectares.</p>

                expansion of the countryside management scheme, when it comes
                in, is needed to help such farmers to enhance the rural
                environment while improving their own financial situation? Does

                through community groups and not actually get to the farmers?
                The farmers need assistance. They need to be brought fully on
                board, and the money must go directly into their hands.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The agri-environmental schemes are aimed at
                helping farmers to improve the environment and to improve their
                farm management. In that sense many of the environmental schemes
                do benefit farmers directly. They help the rural community. It
                is not helpful to try to set one section of the rural community
                against the other, because some in the farming communities will
                find that they cannot make a full-time living from farming and
                will go into diversification schemes. That will help farming
                families. The environmental schemes are designed to support
                those who are active farmers, full-time farmers and those who
                can no longer earn an adequate income from farming and want to
                diversify. They will also help families who find that their farm
                can no longer support more than one person.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am sure that Dr Adamson is better informed
                about this than I am. One of the things I made a point of
                informing myself about when I became Minister of Culture, Arts
                and Leisure was the different Irish dialects. I am aware that
                the Gaelic languages were brought to the British Isles by Celtic
                peoples.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My understanding is that Irish is the form of
                the Gaelic language that has traditionally been spoken
                throughout the island of Ireland for several thousand years. It
                has gone through a series of developments and changes as you
                would expect.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A form of Gaelic is also found in the Isle of
                Man, and the language was also taken across from Ireland to
                Scotland. The language in Ireland was given a standardised
                updated format in the 1940s and the 1950s. I think that is what
                the Member was referring to as de Valéra Gaelic in one of his
                other comments. Any regional variations found in Ulster and the
                other Provinces relate largely to syntax, vocabulary and
                pronunciation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All forms of Irish, as I understand it, are
                mutually intelligible. Not all forms of Gaelic are mutually
                intelligible. Gaelic is divided into Manx, Scots Gallic and
                Irish. Irish is divided into four dialects, rather than any
                other Celtic language, such as Welsh, Breton or Cornish. So the
                forms of Irish spoken and taught in Northern&nbsp;Ireland are
                usually based on the Ulster dialect. The Good Friday Agreement
                calls for tolerance, respect and understanding for linguistic
                diversity. This should extend to an appreciation of the richness
                of local forms of Irish and an awareness of the close links with
                the various forms of Gaelic spoken elsewhere.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first corporate plan of the Museums and
                Art Galleries for Northern Ireland (MAGNI) fully recognises the
                importance of maritime history and heritage in Northen&nbsp;Ireland
                and identifies this as a major theme for future development. I
                am fully behind MAGNI’s proposal to provide a maritime museum
                to tell the story of our long and rich maritime history.
                Northern Ireland is famous worldwide for its historic role in
                the development of iron and steel shipbuilding technology. The
                mere mention of the Titanic, the world’s most famous ship,
                evokes strong images of the shipbuilding industry from days gone
                by. It would be inexcusable not to capitalise on the economic
                and educational potential of this country’s maritime heritage
                and invest in the development of cultural tourism.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ford:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome that very positive and helpful
                response from the Minister. It was, however, somewhat
                unspecific. The need for a maritime museum was identified as far
                back as the Wilson review. While I welcome his statement in
                principle, I wonder if it would be possible for his Department
                to give us a timescale for the recognition of the maritime
                heritage of which he spoke. Our maritime heritage is, of course,
                about more than shipbuilding in Belfast. The role of Northern
                Ireland’s ports in Atlantic crossings to the United States and
                Canada is also a part of it. Can the Minister perhaps be a
                little more specific and give us a timescale for progress?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGimpsey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In terms of specifics, because of the costs
                of a maritime museum we would also expect to incorporate
                aviation and industry into it. We have to remember that Belfast,
                in the early years of this century, was at the absolute
                technological cutting edge of shipbuilding and aviation. So
                there are two stories. In fact there is also a third story and
                that is of the industry that was in Belfast, and I am thinking
                of the Ropeworks, for example — the largest ropeworks in the
                world. Of the people who worked there and understand the old
                traditional methods very few are left. This is a story that
                needs to be told, and there is an urgency here. We also had a
                very important ceramic and glass industry around that time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The idea is to incorporate them all together
                into that type of museum. Mr Ford rightly referred also to the
                immigrants, and it will tell that story as well. We estimate
                that it will cost around £30&nbsp;million. I cannot be definite
                until I have worked out how we will address that funding need,
                and clearly we will have to be imaginative and creative in that.
                I cannot simply walk in here and say &quot;Please may I have
                £30&nbsp;million?&quot; — I know what the answer will be.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have to work out the concept and the
                feasibility before we can address the revenue consequences. How
                we will find the money is something that we are working on
                urgently, not least because of the important rich resources
                which are our industrial, shipbuilding and aviation heritage.
                There is added urgency because the workforces from these
                industries who applied the traditional methods have largely,
                through the fullness of time, passed away, and it is important
                that their experiences are incorporated in the development.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Without being flippant, I would say that I am
                not aware of the history of the Bangor shipyards. However, I can
                say that no definitive location has been agreed yet, although it
                seems that the obvious, logical location for a maritime museum
                would be the Abercorn basin in the Queens Island area of
                Belfast. That is where shipbuilding essentially began.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Workman and Clark, on one side of Clarendon
                Dock, and Harland and Wolff, began at the Abercorn basin. The
                Odyssey complex is next door, and one will feed off the other.
                As part of the Odyssey complex there will be a W5 science
                centre, which is coming forward and being developed at the
                moment. I see a symbiotic relationship developing there.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is also a fact that we not only have
                simply a shipbuilding story. One of the features of Harland and
                Wolff’s working practices was that when the ships got bigger,
                they abandoned the old dry docks and slipways and built new
                ones. What we now have is probably the best example anywhere in
                the world of how graving docks, dry docks and slipways
                developed. So we have a big story in terms of the physical
                features extant there, never mind the development that we would
                be looking at in terms of a maritime museum.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Sports Council for Northern Ireland has
                statutory responsibility for the distribution of grants
                including lottery grants to sports bodies in the Province. The
                Motorcycle Union of Ireland (MCUI) is the governing body for the
                sport of road and short circuit motor cycling racing. To date,
                the following sums have been allocated for road/short circuit
                racing. The MCUI has received a grant of £1,250 this year for
                ongoing running costs. Under the Sports Lottery &quot;Talented
                Athlete Scheme&quot; an award of £27,000 has been agreed for
                Adrian Coates for the period from January 2000 to
                December&nbsp;2001. A bid of £5,000 for the Sunflower Trophy
                was unsuccessful on the grounds that that particular event
                received funding for each of the three previous years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not aware of other funding bids for the
                MCUI for the years in question. The Sports Council is currently
                developing a new challenge-based development plan scheme. From
                2001, each governing body will be competing with each other for
                funding in line with the Sports Council for Northern Ireland
                priorities. Therefore it is not possible to confirm resource
                commitment for motorcycling for the period 2001 to 2003 at this
                stage.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Motorcycle racing is one of the most exciting
                and popular sports in Northern Ireland with a worldwide
                reputation. It is somewhat poignant that we are talking about
                this particular topic today of all days. I would encourage the
                MCUI to avail of every opportunity to secure funding for its
                sport.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given the tragic loss to motorcycle sport,
                and indeed to the world of motorcycle racing at the weekend, I
                am sure the Minister will agree that road racing in Northern
                Ireland will possibly never be the same again. Can he confirm
                that road racing brings thousands of tourists and indeed
                millions of pounds of revenue to Northern Ireland? Those
                millions of pounds are largely lost in the promotion of the
                sport and in enhancing the safety of the sport. Can he tell us
                what he is going to do, or what his Department will be able to
                do, in order to rectify that balance? Would he be prepared to
                seriously consider the development of an international
                motorcycle circuit, or indeed, a formula one Grand Prix racing
                circuit, which would bring more tourists and more revenue to
                Northern Ireland. That would enable people to perform these
                exhilerating yet dangerous sports under safe conditions and in a
                way in which Government revenue could be used directly for the
                promotion of these exciting sports?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGimpsey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The question of a national racing circuit for
                the Province is one that has been under consideration for the
                last 18&nbsp;months, and it is Ballymena District Council’s
                original motion for the establishment of a company or trust to
                undertake a feasibility study into the development of a national
                racing circuit. I know that that was circulated among Members of
                the Assembly as well as other local councils, and many Members,
                including myself, have signed in support of the concept of the
                motion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Any proposal for the development of the sport
                rests with the Motor Cycle Union of Ireland, the governing body,
                and the matter would then be considered by the Sports Council
                for Northern&nbsp;Ireland, which has the statutory
                responsibility for the development of sport in the Province,
                including assistance to bodies involved in providing facilities.
                To date no development proposals have been placed before the
                sports council or my Department. I am not aware of where the
                proposal sits with the Motor Cycle Union of Ireland or how far
                it has taken the concept articulated by Ballymena District
                Council. I concur with Mr&nbsp;Paisley&nbsp;Jnr in saying that
                we share the concerns over the fatalities that occur in road
                racing, and, given the nature of the sport, there is always the
                underlying risk of serious injury. Whilst I cannot pre-empt what
                the Motor Cycle Union of Ireland is going to say or propose, I
                will certainly be listening to its views and proposals very
                sympathetically, and I know that any applications that it takes
                forward to the sports council will be similarly viewed. It is a
                fact that there are fewer fatalities in short-circuit racing.
                Motorcycle road racing is an extremely dangerous sport. It is
                also a completely different type of motorcycle racing, and that
                is where the argument and the debate has been — how closely
                allied they are, and would road-racers be prepared to go on the
                short circuits. That, again, is a matter for the Motor Cycle
                Union of Ireland.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Minister agree that the one sporting
                event which takes place in Northern Ireland every year that
                attracts the largest number of spectators is the North-West 200?
                On the day of the race over 100,000 people from all over, not
                only the United Kingdom but much further afield, attend. Does
                the Minister agree that the sport is very much underfunded and
                dependent on a large body of volunteer workers to make it
                possible?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGimpsey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with Mr&nbsp;McClarty. Having gone to
                the North-West 200 for a number of years, I know from personal
                experience that it is truly an amazing spectacle. The excitement
                and the skill employed, not least, of course, by
                Joey&nbsp;Dunlop is something that everyone should see, at least
                once. The North-West 200 is seriously underfunded and relies
                almost entirely on volunteers to make it work, and if it were
                not for their working free of charge, it would not work. I would
                encourage the Motor Cycle Union of Ireland to take applications
                forward to the sports council. The sports council can provide
                funding under a development scheme, under a talented athlete
                scheme and under a major home-events funding. Up until now
                £1,250 a year was made available which was recurrent funding,
                paid automatically without application, but the situation is
                changing, and in future, applications will have to be made under
                a development scheme. That would be a good discipline for all
                the organisations. The talented athlete lottery funding is also
                available, and I have referred to funding for
                Adrian&nbsp;Coates. There is also the major home-events funding,
                and the North-West 200 is as major a home event as you can get.
                I am not aware, certainly in the recent past, of any
                applications that have come from the Motor Cycle Union of
                Ireland. I am not saying that these things will be automatic,
                but I would have thought that the North-West 200 meets a number
                of criteria.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must remember that it is a road race. An
                effort must be made to make the circuit safer, something which
                to a large extent can be done at no great cost — changing
                upright kerbs to drop kerbs, moving concrete lamp standards away
                from the circuit, taking away walls and fences or changing them
                so that when a rider comes off a bike and slides, he does not
                impact into an object and get severely hurt. That is the way
                forward for the North-West 200, which, if it can be made safe,
                will be the greatest motorcycling race anyone will see in
                Europe.</p>

                and officials to combat sectarianism and racism in all their
                forms must be welcomed. I was delighted to hear a radio
                programme this morning where a Member of the Scottish Parliament
                paid tribute to the good behaviour of both Irish and Scottish
                soccer fans. That is the good image and reputation about which
                we wish to hear. Does the Minister agree that the plight in
                which probably all our football clubs find themselves regarding
                viability stems from a long period of sectarian chanting and an
                unwelcome atmosphere in grounds which kept genuine fans from
                supporting their clubs? The sooner the legislation is in place,
                the better for both clubs and supporters.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member’s comment and question were
                wide-ranging. The Department and I recognise the plight soccer
                is in and that most of Northern Ireland’s stadia have seen no
                investment for decades, with the result that they lack basic
                health-and-safety measures. That was why, in January, I
                announced an initial scheme drawing on £800,000 from the
                Football Trust, plus a further £300,000 per annum from the
                Sports Council for two, or, it is to be hoped, three years. Last
                week we were able to announce a further increase of
                £2&nbsp;million to that interim scheme. The £2&nbsp;million
                will go forward and, whilst football will be a beneficiary, I
                should emphasise that Gaelic games and rugby will also be
                entitled to apply and benefit.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The moneys will go forward divided into
                roughly £750,000 for major works, £1&nbsp;million for urgent
                first-aid work and £250,000 for safety management, which
                includes stewarding and training for those involved in crowd
                control.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a condition for the grant under the
                interim scheme, clubs will be required to put in place a child
                protection policy approved by the Sports Council and formulate
                an equity statement. The equity statement will highlight
                practical measures to address family, disability and sectarian
                issues. As I have said, part of the moneys will be available for
                stewarding and training and for safety management, and this will
                also help address sectarian behaviour among spectators.</p>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Taylor Report, which came in the wake of
                the Hillsborough disaster, initiated these measures. Taylor said
                that, if people were treated like animals, they would behave
                like animals. Football crowds are fenced in behind cages, and
                some of the grounds look like a throwback to Bellevue zoo before
                it was redeveloped. Work needs to be done on the development of
                football generally, not just senior football, but junior and
                schoolboy soccer. It must all come together as a package. I
                shall be aiming at a holistic view in the future. When the money
                on football grounds was spent in England, Scotland and Wales
                there was a 60% to 70% increase at the gate, and an increase of
                26% in the number of women attending football matches. If there
                were such a response in Northern Ireland, it would be wonderful,
                not only for the game, but for all of us.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, will the Minister say how many times
                the RUC has been involved in taking football hooligans out of
                Irish league grounds this season in reaction to sectarian
                violence?. I do not know of any, but perhaps the Minister can
                answer that question. Secondly, is the Minister aware that,
                clubs such as Linfield and Glentoran have introduced schemes to
                try to deal with the problem? Linfield Football Club has
                introduced a scheme, based at Dundalk, aimed at tackling the
                issue. Does the Minister also agree that all the media attention
                on sectarianism is not at Irish league matches but at
                international matches played at Windsor Park? One of the
                problems is that the media objects to people singing ‘God Save
                the Queen’. During Euro 2000, we heard it more than once from
                England fans, and no one in the media said then that it was
                sectarian.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGimpsey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My response to the problem is a scheme to
                highlight family, disability and sectarian issues. That is for
                all sports — not just for football or local sports, but for
                international events as well. I am aware that there are schemes
                run by football clubs such as Glentoran and Linfield. I
                understand that Crusaders Football Club is attempting to address
                the issue as well.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not know how many people have been
                thrown out of football grounds by the RUC because of sectarian
                issues. Indeed, I do not know how many people have been thrown
                out of football grounds for any reason, but judging from the
                size of the gate of some clubs, it would surprise me if the
                number was large. Football is not drawing large numbers. That is
                the problem that it must address. Whether it is a real problem
                or one of perception, it must be addressed for the health of the
                game. As for singing ‘God Save the Queen’, at international
                games, Mr&nbsp;Hutchinson will be aware that there is more than
                ‘God Save the Queen’ sung at Windsor Park. The Irish
                Football Association (IFA) and the Sports Council are
                considering that issue seriously, and I shall know more about
                their views when I meet them on 7&nbsp;July. We want football
                grounds where everyone feels comfortable.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was rather concerned at the wording of the
                original question, which refers to sectarianism in association
                with football. The matter needs to be clarified, as
                Mr&nbsp;Hutchinson has tried to do. Clubs are working very hard
                on this issue, and we may be talking about something that is
                perhaps peripheral. Will the Minister say whether legislation
                could be introduced to cover the sport of Gaelic association
                football? It is guilty of sectarianism with its exclusion
                clause, disallowing certain people from participating in the
                sport.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On Mr&nbsp;Hussey’s question, I shall take
                the first part referring to measures to be taken. I repeat that
                the matter is not simply about association football. Legislation
                currently operates in the rest of the kingdom which creates
                three offences of disorderly behaviour: throwing an object
                either at the pitch or a spectator without lawful authority;
                taking part in indecent or racist chanting; and going on to the
                pitch without lawful authority. There is a recognition here that
                it is much more than just singing. Also it amends it so that
                taking part in racist or indecent chanting, whether alone or in
                concert with others, is an offence. That is the type of
                legislation in the rest of the kingdom, and the type of
                legislation that the IFA and the Sports Council are considering.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rule 21 in Gaelic bans members of the
                security forces from the GAA. It dates back to 1887 and, apart
                from a 10-year lapse from 1893 to 1902, has been there ever
                since. I would welcome the ending of Rule&nbsp;21 — it is
                wrong that it exists. Again that is not a matter for me; it is
                for the Gaelic authorities. Their position has been softening in
                recent times, and they are reviewing the ban. Certainly the
                general belief is that Rule&nbsp;21 will go sooner rather than
                later, and I would welcome that.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McMenamin:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have been a supporter of Derry City
                Football Club for the last 30 to 40&nbsp;years. The RUC do not
                patrol within the football ground. The club’s own stewards do
                it. Both sets of supporters mix together, and there is no
                segregation at any time, regardless of who is playing. That may
                be the way forward.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My question is in relation to the Minister’s
                recent announcement of £2&nbsp;million for upgrading sports
                grounds. Will this grant apply to smaller grounds? If so, when
                will the grant become available?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGimpsey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We would expect the £2&nbsp;million to be
                released and spent over the next 12&nbsp;months. I am very
                anxious that spectators will see an appreciative difference
                sooner rather than later. And it is not just a promise; they
                will be able to see it in the grounds quickly. With regard to
                targeting of football clubs, 10 premier and 10 first division
                clubs will be targeted as well as six county and six designated
                secondary Gaelic grounds, rugby clubs and Derry City. It is in
                Northern Ireland and is entitled to apply. It will be treated
                the same as everybody else.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the matter of crowd control and behaviour,
                stewarding and safety measures to control crowds will be under
                consideration as part of this scheme. Mr&nbsp;McMenamin
                mentioned that the RUC are never in Brandywell for Derry City
                matches because there is no need. They are needed in other
                grounds. The reality is that no club in Northern Ireland, as I
                understand it, pays the RUC for that level of support. However,
                in England clubs have to pay, and it is inevitable that clubs
                here will have that bill to face. Therefore it is better that
                they look after it themselves and do it properly, rather than
                having to bring in and pay the RUC. Clubs have enough financial
                difficulties without having that as an extra burden.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On 29&nbsp;March 1999 the Commission received
                a report from the Gift Shop Committee, chaired by
                Mrs&nbsp;Iris&nbsp;Robinson, which recommended the establishment
                of an Assembly gift shop in the South Division Lobby and, as an
                interim arrangement, the expansion of the product range in the
                basement shop and the establishment of the display facility in
                the Senate Rotunda. The Commission endorsed the Gift Shop
                Committee’s recommendations but decided not to press ahead
                immediately with the proposal to establish a gift shop beside
                the Senate Chamber until there was a better understanding of the
                requirement to use the Senate Chamber for Committee meetings.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members will know that there is significant
                pressure on accommodation in Parliament Buildings and that the
                Senate Chamber is in regular use. This would require the gift
                shop, if operating from the Division Lobby, to relocate to the
                Senate Rotunda area during Committee meetings.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Subsequently, the Catering and Functions
                Committee, chaired by Sir John Gorman, commissioned a study on
                the future delivery of catering in Parliament Buildings. The
                Committee will bring the study’s findings to the Commission in
                the near future. I believe that one of the recommendations is to
                relocate the basement shop to the post office. That may offer
                another way of implementing the Committee’s recommendation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In summary, the Commission will consider, at
                the earliest opportunity, the establishment of an Assembly gift
                shop to replace the interim arrangements which currently operate
                from the basement shop.</p>

                problems since then, especially for school parties seeking to
                buy souvenirs in this building? Is not it time that the

                Committee to ensure that something better is done before the

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The term &quot;attack&quot;, as used in the
              existing legislation, is very wide and relates not only to
              physical assault. It includes situations when a person is
              terrified by a dog, even if he or she is not actually bitten.
              Although there are relatively few cases each year of destruction
              orders being made, it is appropriate that there should be a
              measure of discretion for courts and resident magistrates in
              determining the fate of a dog.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill will provide the courts and resident
              magistrates with limited discretion. A number of changes are
              proposed. First, as well as being able to order the destruction of
              a dog, the court can instead opt not to have the dog destroyed,
              but to make an order requiring certain specific measures to be
              taken to prevent the dog from being a danger to the public or
              livestock. These measures may include fitting a muzzle, keeping
              the dog confined in such a way that it cannot escape, excluding it
              from places specified in the order or having it neutered if it is
              a male dog.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Sir John Gorman] in the
              Chair)</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, the Bill will change the law when a
              person has been convicted of an offence relating to a dangerous
              dog. At present, the court has no discretion other than to make an
              order for the destruction of a dangerous dog. Under the Dogs
              (Northern Ireland) Order1983, as amended by the Dangerous Dogs
              (Northern Ireland) Order 1991, these include pitbull terriers and
              Japanese tosas. Under the provisions of the Bill the court will
              have discretion to decide not to order the destruction of a dog if
              it is satisfied that the dog will not be a danger to the public.
              The Bill proposes the same limited discretion in the matter of the
              destruction of any other dangerous dog that the Department may
              prescribe. It has not prescribed any other type of dog so far.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The third change relates to the powers of
              resident magistrates in connection with the seizure of dogs. Under
              the present law, when a district council seizes a dangerous dog, a
              resident magistrate must order its destruction. The Bill proposes
              that the resident magistrate must still order the destruction of
              the dog, but it will allow a person to apply for a certificate of
              exemption from the requirement to have the dog destroyed, the
              conditions of which must be complied with within two months of the
              date of the order.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.45 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In relation to all other seized dogs, the Bill
              now proposes that the resident magistrate would have discretion
              not to order the destruction of such a dog where he is satisfied
              that it is not a danger to the public.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, the Bill would also allow cases where
              a court or resident magistrate has ordered the destruction of a
              dog under the existing legislation but the dog has not yet been
              destroyed to be reconsidered by a court or resident magistrate.
              The destruction of dogs is an emotive issue for pet owners and pet
              lovers, one that is highlighted in the press from time to time
              with heart-rending stories. I believe that it would be appropriate
              for a court or a resident magistrate to have a degree of
              discretion in this matter so that, where circumstances dictate, a
              lesser penalty than destruction could be imposed. I hope that
              Members will agree with me that the measures I have proposed,
              which are supported by animal welfare interests and district
              councils, are sensible and should be carried through. I ask the
              Assembly to approve this Second Stage of the Bill and to support
              the motion that will allow the Department of Agriculture and Rural
              Development Committee to take the Committee Stage.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most Members would generally welcome a Bill
              that gives the magistrate a discretionary power to make decisions
              in areas that are sometimes grey, as opposed to black and white,
              and this Bill does exactly that. However, it requires some
              clarification, and I hope that the Minister can give that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This Bill gives discretion to the magistrate.
              Most people, especially farmers, would be worried about having
              their animals disturbed by dangerous animals, or animals that are
              not properly under the control of their master. They would be
              concerned that the discretionary power, instead of being a
              discretionary power that allows the magistrate to rule that a dog
              should not be destroyed if it damages or causes concern to flocks
              of sheep, becomes the norm.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It would be a sad reflection if this House were
              to pass a Bill that, instead of acknowledging that from time to
              time there are grey areas, makes more of them. I hope that the
              discretion posed in the Bill does not become the norm but is used
              for those few select cases where an animal should not be put down.
              The judge should have the opportunity to take a different course
              of action and show some leniency. I hope that the Bill does lead
              towards sensible acts. Of course, if passed, it will largely be in
              the hands of the magistrate and not in the hands of the Minister.
              This House should at least make that point of view known to the
              magistrate.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One other point concerns me about the drawing
              up of this Bill. It has been largely non-controversial. However, I
              noticed in the explanatory and financial memorandum that
              accompanied the Bill that there was no consultation — or should
              I say that it had not been subject to public consultation. People
              have asked me why has that been the case, and the Department
              should provide us with answers on that point. If this Bill is
              largely noncontroversial, there should have been wide
              consultation, providing us with a great deal of opinion across the
              board, and we could then have gone forward today in the full
              knowledge that we had widespread support. Most people want to see
              this Bill, if it becomes an Act, administered fairly. They do not
              want to see dogs put down because they might scare a passer-by.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I noticed recently that one particular
              passer-by in Ballymena got a little bit of a fright from a dog —
              a police dog named Sky from Ballymena RUC station. One would hate
              to think of a dog that was doing its duty being put down for
              growling at the Secretary of State. A lot of people in Ballymena
              would like that dog to get a medal.</p>

              that there are some areas where legislation appears to be
              administered more forcefully. I am referring, in particular, to
              his question (AQW 686/99) on dog fouling prosecutions. If you take
              your dog to Ballymena you are more likely to be prosecuted if it
              fouls in a street than you are if you take it to Antrim, Belfast,
              Ards or, indeed, North Down. The lesson there is: &quot;Do not let

              is important to have legislation to clearly define the roles of
              district councils and dog wardens. There is a need for legislation
              and for some means of having discretion over whether dogs are put
              down or not. If this is a means of doing that, it is welcome. The
              main thing is to protect the public. There are a number of owners
              who train dogs in a vicious way, which means that when the dogs
              wander the public streets they are dangerous. I noted in the
              discussion this morning that there may be some means of
              controlling that other than putting them down. It is worthwhile
              for the court to have discretion, so that it is not automatic —</p>

              up the issue that a dog cannot be judged by its looks alone, or
              even by some of its statements. It is important to flag up the
              cases where court orders are not adhered to. If dog owners are
              given leeway, we need to monitor that and ensure that the dogs are
              then kept under control and are not a danger to the public. That
              is the main thing. We also need legislation to deal with the
              number of dogs on housing estates and in built-up areas that are
              under no control. There is a great danger to children and to
              others there. I hope that this legislation will be a first step in
              legislating, monitoring and controlling the whole issue of dogs
              running about estates.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ford:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I too welcome the general provisions of the
              Bill. I have a few questions which, unfortunately, as a member of
              the appropriate Committee, I am going to end up having to discuss
              in detail at the later stages of this Bill. The Minister herself
              highlighted the fact that, while the present legislation refers to
              dogs &quot;attacking&quot;, the Bill refers to
              &quot;worrying&quot;. I worry that we do not have a firm enough
              definition of &quot;worrying&quot; to ensure that this Bill can go
              through in the way that the main provisions are intended.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clearly there are problems with mandatory
              sentences. I should be cautious in case I say too much about
              mandatory sentences with regard to other crimes. Clearly there is
              a need for the discretion which is missing at the moment and which
              has been highlighted in the few cases — only a few, but enough
              to reach the press — that have created difficulties. There will
              always be cases where discretion is needed. Discretion should be
              introduced into the primary legislation to ensure it goes through.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am concerned about some of the implications,
              particularly for district councils. The statement accompanying the
              Bill says that there are no financial implications for the
              exchequer. That is indeed a happy position for the exchequer to be
              in. However, there are likely to be significant financial
              considerations for district councils. One of the reasons so few
              cases are prosecuted at the moment is that there is a natural
              reluctance to prosecute where a dog has had perhaps one bite, and
              people feel that if it is kept under control there will be no
              further problems, and they do not wish to proceed with an action
              that could lead to a destruction order.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If people see a careless owner being fined, or
              an order to keep a dog under control, then there may be greater
              incentive to proceed down the legislative route. That route may
              result in significant costs for district councils — and I say
              that as someone whose council took the first test case under the
              dangerous dogs legislation some years ago. The decision to take a
              test case on behalf of the Department and every other council in
              Northern Ireland resulted in an increase of 0·5p to the
              ratepayers of the borough of Antrim.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are clear issues for us all if we do not
              deal with the problem of dangerous dogs; of pit bull terriers that
              put children at risk. I think Antrim Borough Council took the
              correct decision. Unlike the Members on my left, we were not
              fools. We did our duty by the people of Northern Ireland, but,
              unfortunately, our ratepayers paid for it. I hope that those
              events do not happen in Lisburn or North Down or Mr Poots and Mr
              Weir will not be smiling in the future. Mr Weir is still smiling.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need to look at the financial effects of
              prosecution and the issue about the conditions that may be
              applied. The Bill is a little unclear about how we will ensure
              those conditions are to be applied. I suspect that the issue of
              having a dog neutered would be easily assessed on a one-off basis.
              However, I am not sure that preventing dogs going into particular
              public places, having them confined in yards or houses, or having
              them muzzled will be assessable on a one-off basis. If it means
              district council dog wardens having to ensure that the conditions
              are complied with then there will be greater difficulties, and the
              suggestion that there are no financial implications will be a
              little unfair. Perhaps the Minister could address some of those
              matters in her response.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have a few concerns about the Bill. As
              councillors, we have been consulted about the Bill — and I know
              that Ards councillors have commented on it. Some of the changes
              are those we would wish to see. The present legislation, as we all
              know — some to our cost — exists to address the issue of the
              destruction of dogs. However, it lacks flexibility, and that is
              why we need the proposed changes.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have got to look at the matter from the
              perspective of the dog and the dog owner. Under the Dogs (Northern
              Ireland) Order 1983, a dog that has attacked a person or livestock
              shall be subject to a destruction order, and there is no reprieve
              or second chance. If a dog falls into that category, it is
              finished, and the courts have absolutely no power or discretion.
              That clearly illustrates where the problems lie. There is no room
              for movement or discussion on the circumstances of any particular
              reported attack. There are no provisions for extenuating
              circumstances.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In some cases there were extenuating
              circumstances in which we believed the dog should not have been
              put down. As a result of the nature and implementation of this
              legislation there exists the real possibility that animals could
              be destroyed without good reason, as did happen, and there is no
              opportunity for action to be taken by the owner to ensure that
              such attacks would not be repeated.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In relation to the whole subject, I am saying
              that there have been occasions when dogs have been destroyed when
              they did not draw blood. That is an issue which should be looked
              at. That is also why this amendment is very important. Nobody
              would agree, or accept, that any dog that has injured or viciously
              attacked a child or livestock should live. If a dog has done that,
              it should be put down, and we are in no doubt about that. However,
              we have to look at cases in which that has not happened, and the
              Bill makes provision for the cases that fall into that category.
              Every incident will be dealt with on its own merit. One such
              incident occurred in my constituency not long ago when it was
              alleged that a dog had attacked a young child. It turned out that
              the dog had not drawn blood.</p>

              had no chance of a reprieve. The existing legislation, prior to
              this amendment, would have meant that that dog’s fate would have
              been sealed. That would have been unfair to the owner, who had a
              love for his dog, and for the dog, which had no reported past
              cases or history of harming anyone.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There must be differentiation to take account
              of minor attacks by dogs that are not classed as dangerous and
              where violent and aggressive behaviour is not a genetic
              characteristic. In these cases, measures could be taken like
              fitting a muzzle, ensuring that the dog is securely confined,
              excluding it from places specified in an Order, or having it
              neutered. As stated in the explanatory and financial memorandum,
              there are no exchequer costs or staffing implications related to
              this Bill and, in the name of fairness for both dogs and owners,
              it should be supported.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is another well-known example in the sad
              tale of a dog called Kaiser — a dog who lived in Ballygowan some
              years ago. Kaiser was unfortunately involved in a violent act of
              unprovoked terror on an individual in the district. He was
              apprehended and charged accordingly. Just one day before his
              execution, however, Kaiser went missing. Kaiser has been on the
              run since that time. Some say that he lives in a number of safe
              kennels in South Armagh, while others say that he got a boat to
              the United States. Sightings have also been reported elsewhere.
              Kaiser has been in contact, dare I say it, with the President of
              the USA, with the FBI, and with the British Prime Minister. We are
              being a bit facetious —</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the Member comment on rumours that Kaiser
              went back to his old kennels in Londonderry and talked about his
              days on the run?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Shannon:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Member for his interjection. It
              obviously fits into the category of this story. The point we are
              trying to make is that Kaiser had not done any irreparable damage
              or hurt to the person. The dog had no record of causing injury to
              any person. Had the law been in at that time, Kaiser would be a
              &quot;free dog&quot;, and he could return from wherever he may be.
              I am not sure where he is, but we want to illustrate the case, and
              the case is quite simple. If a dog attacks and injures someone
              very seriously, or attacks livestock, or does something that is
              wrong, then it deserves to be put down. However, if a dog is
              playful and has not injured anyone, but just knocks someone over
              and does not draw blood, then there must be a differentiation in
              the policy to reflect that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Under the Dogs (Amendment) Bill we have that
              opportunity. I say to the Minister that what we need, and what we
              now have, is that opportunity. That will be welcomed by people
              whose dogs have perhaps done something but deserve to live on as
              the incidents were not too bad.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Rodgers:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome Members’ comments, which have been
              both helpful and balanced. In response to Mr Paisley Jnr, the
              discretionary power is limited, and it will apply only in a small
              number of cases. The Member is no longer here, but I will reply to
              his points anyway. I would like to think he was interested in
              hearing my views.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The points he made seemed to imply that the
              courts might not be able to deal with this issue. I take the view
              that the courts will be able to deal with the issue in a sensible
              and balanced way. It will only apply in a small number of cases. I
              appreciate that the Bill has not gone out to public consultation,
              but, given its nature, it was felt that it should be put to the
              Assembly as quickly as possible. On the whole it is
              uncontroversial.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In relation to Mr McMenamin’s question, dogs
              already on death row may, under this Bill, have their cases
              reconsidered. That is the good news.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to Mr&nbsp;Molloy’s remarks, I am
              looking at the wider aspects of dog control and am currently
              taking the views of district councils who will be responsible for
              enforcing any changes in the legislation. I know that there are
              many issues surrounding dog control which might be slightly more
              controversial than what is in the present Bill.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;Ford’s initial remarks about the
              interpretation of words would be better dealt with in detail at
              Committee stage. In relation to district councils, the position
              will not change significantly — only a very small number of dogs
              will be affected, and it will be up to the council as to the
              numbers and types of cases taken to court. For instance, in the
              last year approximately 50&nbsp;dogs were destroyed throughout the
              whole of Northern Ireland. It will not have any major implications
              for district councils.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am pleased to say that I can agree with
              everything that Mr Shannon said, and the Bill clearly deals with
              the concerns he expressed. He has taken a balanced view which
              takes account of the need to protect the public from dangerous and
              vicious dogs and the need to provide flexibility in situations
              where perhaps the dog is provoked and then subsequently put down.
              This Bill allows for flexibility. A court will be able to decide
              that a dog should not be put down if it can assure itself that the
              dog is not a danger to the public through the use of means such as
              muzzling or whatever is considered necessary. I thank all the
              Members for their comments, and I believe I have dealt with
              everything that was raised.</p>
