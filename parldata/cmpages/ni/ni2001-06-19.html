                Finance and Personnel that he wishes to make a statement on
                issues affecting budgetary planning and preparation for the
                financial year 2002-03.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Finance and Personnel (Mr
                Durkan):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister and the Deputy First
                Minister have already outlined the considerations that affect
                our approach to the preparation of Programme for Government
                proposals for 2002-03 in their letter to the Chairpersons of the
                Assembly Committees. The position report attached to their
                letter is the joint responsibility of the Office of the First
                Minister and the Deputy First Minister and the Department of
                Finance and Personnel. I shall complement what they say by
                covering the financial considerations in some more detail and
                emphasising some of the main points that will affect our public
                expenditure planning for the next year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the letter from the First Minister and the
                Deputy First Minister, especially the attached position report,
                and in this statement, the Executive seek to provide a basis for
                the Assembly’s consideration of the Programme for Government
                and the Budget for 2002-03. I particularly want to emphasise
                that our scrutiny needs to cover the full range of policy areas
                and actions in the public service. We must look at what is
                provided from the expenditure for which we are responsible. That
                means that our focus cannot be solely, or even mainly, on the
                bids that Departments have lodged for additional resources. We
                must look at the outputs that are being obtained to be sure that
                they are the best way to fulfil the Department’s objectives.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need indicators of how Departments’
                plans are progressing. We need a public service planning
                process, not an exercise in tallying up bids for more.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I emphasise that the development of
                priorities and actions in the Programme for Government must be
                the guide to our work on financial allocations. We need to avoid
                being drawn to focus mainly on financial pressures. We can
                ensure that we make a difference if we focus on our policy
                objectives and priorities. Those are set out in the Programme
                for Government section of the position report. I encourage all
                Committees and Members to take the opportunity to respond to the
                Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister on
                that aspect of the work. The Programme for Government must guide
                the Budget, and shape our programmes and actions to emphasise
                the devolution difference.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our approach this year to financial issues
                reflects the fact that this cycle is transitional between two
                Treasury spending reviews. Spending review 2000 gave us
                substantial increased expenditure as a consequence of the major
                increases announced by the Chancellor last July. Next year, the
                spending review 2002 will see the completion of the transition
                to resource accounting and budgeting with, for the first time, a
                need to take direct account of non-cash items in the spending
                plans. That will have profound and important consequences for us
                well above the level of technical financial analysis. In the
                longer term it could affect our spending power quite
                significantly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At this stage of the cycle the total
                resources available to the Executive are fixed. Following last
                year’s spending review, and after the addition of
                £18&nbsp;million a year in the Chancellor’s March Budget, we
                have a departmental expenditure limit (DEL) for 2002-03 of
                £6,091&nbsp;million. That is an increase of 5·8% over the
                current year. The statement and the position report concentrate
                mainly on the expenditure in the DEL. However, the Budget will
                also include coverage of the main aspects of spending, which are
                treated as annually managed expenditure (AME).</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have not yet allocated the
                £18&nbsp;million that was added to our DEL in March 2001. That
                represents a small amount of unallocated resource. Therefore we
                are in a very different context by comparison with the situation
                during last year’s spending review. Last year’s addition to
                our provision for 2002-03 through the Barnett formula was £580
                million. A large proportion of that was required to fund ongoing
                services. We also held some of it back to create the Executive
                programme funds, which are now progressing well. However, we did
                not keep a general contingency reserve.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Members are aware, there is a pattern of
                changes in departmental estimating. Therefore, resources tend to
                become available for reallocation through our monitoring system.
                In that context, holding unallocated provision has not been
                necessary and may have been unhelpful.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I emphasise that there is fast growth in our
                spending trends at present. As a consequence of the decisions
                announced by the Chancellor last year, the growth rate of
                spending here is as rapid, in real terms, as at any time in
                recent years, and it is in considerable contrast to the pattern
                for most of the 1990s. In that respect the context is
                favourable. Although we dislike the fact that the Barnett
                formula does not give us as high a rate of growth as that
                available for comparable services in England, we have still
                gained substantial increases in real spending power.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is not an appropriate time for
                substantial discussion or analysis of the Barnett formula.
                However, I shall comment briefly on that important subject. We
                can establish that Barnett causes us difficulties on major
                services such as health and education, where the growth of
                spending has been rapid and where our needs are significant.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have said before that we must not
                underestimate the great difficulty of making progress on
                improving the Barnett formula. We have to face the fact that our
                spending is high. On some services, as a result of historic
                patterns and post priorities, it is very high compared with that
                in England, Scotland and Wales. There are also profound
                differences in the amounts that are raised locally through the
                rates and in the funding of water and sewerage services. From an
                English point of view, we are regarded as very well funded.
                While we have a case to make, especially over capital assets and
                the future treatment of the Barnett formula under resource
                accounting and budgeting, we have to face the fact that making
                that case on Barnett will be difficult. It certainly will not
                lead to rapid change, and for the foreseeable future we shall
                have to work within the totals fixed by the current approach.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Against that background, the position report
                sent to Members highlights issues to be addressed as we develop
                the Programme for Government and the Budget for 2002-03. The
                Executive are determined to make a difference through the
                services and policies for which we are responsible. We want to
                take the opportunities to break away from approaches that are no
                longer effective and relevant to the Northern Ireland’s best
                interests.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Spending pressures are, not surprisingly,
                intensified, despite the relatively favourable conditions
                presented by a rising trend in real spending terms, and there
                are significant backlogs of investment and great demands on some
                programmes. For that reason, we have emphasised in the position
                report the need to consider seriously and extensively the scope
                for reprioritising spending. We must focus more carefully and
                effectively on the Administration’s top priorities, the region’s
                most strategic requirements and the community’s most pressing
                needs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Efficiency must be improved. Section 2 of the
                position report highlights a range of activities that could
                ensure better use of resources. We must decide how to deal with
                public-sector pay, which is a major driver of our spending, and
                explore how private-sector finance and expertise can contribute
                to the delivery of services.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some spending issues highlighted by
                Departments must be thought about very carefully in preparation
                for the Executive’s Budget deliberations in September. It is
                important to focus on issues and not only on bids. The value of
                programmes should be considered rather than additional money
                simply being sought. We must ask &quot;Why?&quot; until we are
                satisfied or see what alternatives could be adopted. Resource
                accounting and budgeting should help to break old patterns and
                promote our priorities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I emphasise again, however, that we work
                within a fixed total. There are many substantial demands on
                future spending power, and resources could be put to a host of
                useful and desirable purposes. The plain fact is that the
                majority of pressures will have to be absorbed through
                prioritisation in individual Departments’ budgets. The
                indicative figures set for 2002-03 in last year’s Budget can
                be changed at departmental level if the Executive can agree a
                new pattern. However, the process is about total public
                expenditure plans — how best to use the money we have to
                fulfil the Programme for Government — and not only the bids.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is profoundly important that, as we go
                through the process, we remember that what is vital is what we
                can produce and deliver for the services for which we are
                responsible. All services, to one degree or another, benefit
                everyone, and that should influence our judgements.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">10.45 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All of us, whether we are Ministers,
                Committee Chairpersons or other Members, need to seek a
                combination of spending plans that can best fulfil the new
                institutions’ responsibilities. That means that we must look
                carefully at the contribution that each Department, North/South
                body and service can make to the wider objectives. The needs of
                big programmes can easily consume substantial resources. We also
                need to bear in mind the opportunities for benefit through other
                activities, while finding the balance between that consideration
                and the need to ensure that the resources are well spent.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We shall need to reflect that the indicative
                figures, as set out in December 2000’s Budget, assumed a level
                of revenue from the regional rate that depended on the increases
                that were planned at that time. Lower increases will constrain
                spending provision; indeed, the lower increases that were
                approved earlier this year for 2001-02 will have a knock-on
                effect. That point is drawn out in the position report, and it
                would be helpful if the Assembly and its Committees could
                address it carefully.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is serious and difficult business. It is
                at the heart of the nature of our role and responsibilities as a
                devolved Administration. With spending rising substantially in
                last year’s cycle, it was possible to give relatively generous
                and substantial allocations to many spending programmes. The key
                point this year is that those allocations have continued in
                large measure across many programmes, as is shown in the
                indicative allocations for 2002-03 that were published in last
                year’s Budget.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is a profound time for agriculture and
                rural development. The foot-and-mouth disease crisis has made it
                all the more important that the vision group’s work on the
                future of the industry addresses structural and strategic
                issues. Our per capita spending is high compared with that in
                England. That is to be expected, given the much greater
                significance of the agriculture sector to our economy. Much of
                that is driven by EU obligations on member states on matters
                such as animal health. We must think carefully about how the
                agriculture budget can best be deployed and about what changes
                may be necessary and appropriate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are new opportunities to make a
                difference and benefit the public through the creative
                application of ideas in the culture, arts and leisure sector.
                There are also significant spending pressures, not least from
                the issue of librarians’ pay.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The education sector is greatly significant
                for all concerned. The indicative figures do not show a
                sufficient uplift to cover some basic costs when compared to
                2001-02. Therefore it is obvious that the indicative figures
                must be re-examined. Moreover, we must think carefully about the
                longer-term implications of the review of post- primary
                education. As the review body’s recommendations are not yet
                available, we cannot at present gauge the extent to which that
                issue will affect our spending plans for 2002-03. However, it
                must be borne in mind as we move forward.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We also want to ensure that the development
                of a common local management of schools (LMS) formula for all
                schools, which is important in the interests of equality and
                equity of treatment, is addressed. The education sector, like
                several others, faces major infrastructure issues. The Minister
                of Education has announced a balanced programme of conventional
                capital procurement and exploration of a public-private
                partnership approach for several important projects. Those and
                other issues identified in the position report must be
                considered seriously as we proceed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The major developments in the enterprise,
                trade and investment sector that flow from strategic thinking
                about the future of the Northern Ireland economy are mainly for
                consideration in the context of the Executive programme funds.
                We are carefully considering the issues of infrastructure
                development for energy and telecommunications. We also want to
                look carefully at the effectiveness of spending on industrial
                support and industrial derating to ensure that spending on that
                sector is as effective as possible. That is one of our needs and
                effectiveness evaluations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The main spending issues for my Department
                concern Government office accommodation and ensuring that the
                services that the Department of Finance and Personnel provides
                to Ministers, the Executive, the Assembly and the public are
                based on the best possible analysis and evidence. Alongside the
                Economic Policy Unit, it is important that we lead the way in
                improving the effectiveness of spending. Some investment in that
                is likely to yield worthwhile returns by improving the way
                spending is used. We also want to ensure that the procurement
                review produces results that are fully effective in pursuit of
                our economic and social objectives.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The 2000 Budget has provided significant
                resources for new student support measures to cater for the high
                demand for participation in post-16 and higher education. The
                needs and effectiveness evaluation, which is currently
                considering training and vocational education needs, will
                provide a better analysis of relative spending levels on those
                services.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of Higher and Further
                Education, Training and Employment has identified several
                spending issues. In the area of training and employment, the
                uptake for the preparation for work programmes and community
                projects has been greater than expected. In higher and further
                education, pressures are expected because of the need to meet
                higher-than-planned pay settlements for further education
                lecturers and non-industrial staff, and to adapt buildings to
                comply with disability legislation. Savings are expected,
                however, in the Springvale project.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The demands and pressures on the Health
                Service remain significant. Extensive work is being undertaken
                at present by nine different working groups to analyse the need
                for and effectiveness of health and social care spending here.
                We want to be able to make the best possible analytical
                comparisons with other countries and regions. Those will make a
                major contribution to the debate that we need to have on the
                application of the Barnett formula.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the meantime, there are genuine pressures
                on the Health Service because of unmet need and rising demand,
                as well as the regular introduction of new and higher clinical
                standards. As is the case throughout the world, expectations of
                health services are rising significantly. The health sector is,
                by a considerable margin, our largest spending programme, and it
                is therefore all the more important that the resources available
                are used as effectively as possible.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some hard choices have already been made, and
                we must be realistic about what efficiency gains are achievable.
                However, it is vital that we make use of that spending in the
                best possible way. I expect that the Assembly will sometimes set
                aside purely local considerations in order to ensure that
                resources are used in the best way from the point of view of the
                entire region. I stress that that includes equity of treatment
                for all parts of the region, and that calls for careful analysis
                of the relevant indicators so that those decisions can be taken
                objectively. We simply cannot afford not to do that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of the Environment received
                significant increased spending power in 2001-02 to make up for
                past underinvestment in the pursuit of environmental obligations
                under European Directives. That programme must continue,
                although again we need to ensure that available resources are
                used as effectively and carefully as possible. Demands have been
                made for grants for historic buildings, which have recently been
                the subject of moratoria. However, it will be as important to
                analyse needs and effectiveness in that sector as it is in any
                other as the Executive move towards public spending decisions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department for Regional Development faces
                a range of difficult infrastructure issues. Last year, we took
                the first step in responding to the issues of rail safety that
                were highlighted in the A D Little Report following the report
                of the railways task force. The Executive programme fund
                allocations included some important new road schemes. We have
                confirmed the growth in spending on investment in the water and
                sewerage infrastructure. We have that spending rolled forward
                into future years so that means we cannot use that money for
                other spending programmes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In England, the consumer pays directly for
                the investment programmes for the water and sewerage service
                providers. Therefore, funds cannot be read across through the
                Barnett formula for that sector.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must consider what steps might be required
                in public transport beyond the rail safety expenditure that has
                already been approved. The scale of the bids received from the
                Department for Regional Development is described as very high;
                it is beyond what can be afforded through available resources
                for 2002-03. However, it is important that we think about those
                profound issues so that they can be addressed in the long term.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department for Social Development has
                registered some important issues about fuel poverty and housing
                that must be considered carefully. The Executive are analysing
                the need for and effectiveness of current spending in five
                areas, while giving due regard to considerations of New TSN and
                equality of opportunity. Housing is one of those areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another key area for the Department for
                Social Development is the development of a new regeneration
                strategy for Belfast. The Department is consulting with relevant
                organisations and groups in the public, community, voluntary and
                private sectors in that regard. Among the Department’s other
                priorities is the welfare modernisation programme, for which
                significant provision was made in the last year’s Budget. The
                programme will secure major improvements to the social security
                system with the key aim of providing work for those who can
                work, and support for those who cannot.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Office of the First Minister and the
                Deputy First Minister has important responsibilities for the
                modernisation programme of the Executive’s Departments as a
                whole, and for that of a range of central co-ordination and
                secretariat functions that are vital to the operation of the new
                institutions. Our spending plans must reflect recognition of
                that, as we cannot advance the development of the agreement and
                the servicing of the devolved Administration without also
                willing the means in OFMDFM and other Departments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those are only a few of the issues that we
                must address in the forthcoming Budget round. The situation is
                covered much more fully in the position report. Some of the work
                that we shall carry out from now until December will be
                relevant, not just to 2002-03 but to the years ahead.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">From early next year, we shall be engaged in
                a full-scale spending review with the Treasury, and we shall try
                to resolve how the Barnett formula will be applied to resource
                accounting and budgeting. There has been concern about the
                timetable for that process. In my statement of 29 May, I
                emphasised that there is scope for considerable discussion
                despite inevitable constraints on the timetables. We have asked
                for preliminary views to be brought to us quickly, but that is
                because the Assembly has asked for the Budget to be presented
                earlier than it was last year. We could provide longer for the
                initial stage of comment if the Assembly could wait until later
                in the autumn to have the Executive’s Budget proposals.
                However, that would not be the best way to proceed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I accept that there is room for more
                improvement by way of pre-Budget input from Committees, but I
                would also like to point out that Committees are free to query
                their Department’s existing spending priorities or propose new
                ones. Neither my Department nor I wish to inhibit our Committees’
                scrutiny of their respective Department’s spending, or the
                exercise of their policy development role.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must also bear in mind the Executive’s
                key responsibilities and the need to ensure that the Programme
                for Government drives the Budget as it should. Together with all
                Departments and Committees, and in time for next year’s cycle,
                we need to establish arrangements that ensure full dialogue on
                the spending plans for all programmes and how they relate to the
                Programme for Government. Committees can and should be able to
                influence the approach that their Department is taking to the
                Programme for Government and Budget work.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that all Committees and Members will
                now be able to play an important role during this cycle and as
                the process progresses. This is a preparatory stage, but the
                more important stage will begin after the Executive make
                specific proposals for the 2002-03 Budget in September. I hope
                that, as a result of the position report, and the deliberations
                of the weeks and months to come, everyone concerned will be well
                prepared by that stage and there can be constructive and
                positive engagement.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister for his detailed
                statement, which contained some interesting observations. I
                note, in particular, his comments on public sector pay, which is
                a major driver of our spending. Will he also be examining the
                overall size of the public sector — a matter about which I
                have tackled him before — to check whether there is capacity
                to reduce the overall size of this bill?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He laid considerable emphasis on the
                importance of finding other means of paying the bills. In
                particular, the Minister made it clear that there are
                insufficient existing resources to address the infrastructure
                deficit faced by the Department for Regional Development. Has he
                considered pursuing other means of raising revenue, such as
                tolling, congestion charging or water rates, to address the
                deficit in a timely manner? Does he agree that the tough
                decision-making and the potential for short-term unpopularity
                that such responsibility entails are not characteristics
                normally associated with the party responsible for that
                Department?</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The scale and scope of the public sector are
                relevant considerations in the overall review of public
                administration. They are also relevant to our financial
                planning, because we want to ensure that we are not spending
                money on Government activities that do not benefit our citizens.
                We are therefore happy to carry out the work constructively and
                based on policy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We want to ensure that the Assembly and the
                public have a realistic understanding of the resources that we
                have available to fund services. Under the Barnett formula we
                get no money for water and sewerage, because there is no public
                expenditure on such infrastructure across the water. Therefore
                we can not be given a Barnett consequential. We must find the
                public expenditure needed to fund water and sewerage, and the
                Executive recognise that there has been historic underinvestment
                that needs to be remedied.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must find the resources needed to fund
                this infrastructure out of funds that are essentially intended
                to provide other services. Our only means of supplementing the
                Barnett formula moneys is through the rates. The Assembly has
                already indicated that there are sensitivities about seeking
                increases in rate revenue to support our expenditure in several
                areas. In the context of the rating review, we have to look at
                alternatives while recasting the rating policy itself. We must
                find other ways to raise funds to support much-needed investment
                in services. It will be for the Department responsible for each
                service, rather than the Minister of Finance and Personnel, to
                explore the possibility of imposing charges or taxes to fund
                that provision.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Leslie is correct to acknowledge that we
                must be realistic and recognise that those issues must be dealt
                with.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we are not prepared to ask ourselves those
                questions, we shall find in any attempt to review the Barnett
                formula that the Treasury will be asking us those questions,
                perhaps in more uncomfortable terms.</p>

                from the Programme for Government. Can the Minister give details
                as to when the needs and effectiveness reviews will be complete?
                If they are not ready in time for the work on this year’s
                Budget, will Ministers be encouraged to rigorously interrogate
                their Departments to ensure that wasteful bureaucracy is
                removed, and that the structures and quangos developed under
                direct rule are tested to see whether they meet the needs of
                Northern Ireland?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The needs and effectiveness reviews to which
                Patricia Lewsley referred are an important tool to help to
                identify all our requirements and to ascertain the degree to
                which we are using our resources to best effect. The initial
                five reviews are under way, and we expect to see some
                preliminary results on relative needs soon. The work on
                effectiveness will necessarily take longer, but I hope that
                useable results will emerge to inform the Budget exercise.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive expect each Department to
                conduct its business with the greatest possible efficiency, and
                the review of public administration to which we are committed
                will look thoroughly at opportunities for improving the delivery
                of public services. I emphasise that each Minister should be a
                value-for-money Minister. I also remind Committees, in the
                context of the position reports going to the Committees, that
                each Committee should be a value-for-money Committee. Patricia

                there are serious pressures on the Health Service. However,
                there have also been significant increases in expenditure. The
                Executive made more money available for Health Service
                expenditure from the additional resources that we got from the
                Chancellor’s spending review than would have been the Barnett
                consequential for health. We therefore do recognise the priority
                attaching to the Health Service. We also recognise that even
                those significant allocations that we could make will not always
                enable us to keep pace with all the pressures that arise. There
                are technological costs and implications for services, some
                structural changes and the service pressures through patient and
                client demand.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the rural economy, the Executive are
                committed to rural proofing right across their programme. In
                relation to support for the rural economy, we should be thinking
                of more than just one or two particular budget lines. We should
                be trying to make sure that all Departments bend and lend their
                programmes to ensure that the rural community is supported in
                every possible way. It is not a matter of getting a single turn
                out of a single budget.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Maskey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I
                too thank the Minister for his comprehensive statement. The
                Minister reiterated that this is not the time to further analyse
                the entire Barnett formula.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to make the point again that I would
                be more content if I were assured of the Executive’s
                commitment to securing the necessary changes to the Barnett
                formula to take into account the gross underfunding that a large
                number of our services have endured for many years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, the Minister will be aware that it
                is important to build on the relationships between himself, the
                Department and the Committee. The Minister will know that
                Members have varying degrees of satisfaction, and perhaps even
                dissatisfaction, with the degree of timely consultation with,
                and scrutiny by, the Finance and Personnel Committee of
                financial matters in the Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, the Minister has dealt with the need
                for such proper scrutiny in his speech. However, Departments
                must retain responsibility but that does not absolve the
                Committees. That is right, and I thank the Minister for pointing
                that out. There is a significant onus on the Department to
                ensure that there is proper sequencing of the deliveries
                throughout the financial year. The Department can and should
                lead the way. As I said, that does not remove responsibility
                from the Committees to do their job of scrutinising or coming
                forward with their own proposals, but the Minister and his
                Department are central to the Executive’s financial operation.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to reply to several of Mr Maskey’s
                points. I welcome his continued interest in the need for us to
                try to challenge and change the Barnett formula. We must raise
                issues that relate to the Barnett formula, not only because of
                the implications that the ongoing taper on our expenditure
                increases have for some of our key service programmes, but
                because of the implications of resource accounting and
                budgeting.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must also deal with issues to do with our
                capital assets in the public sector such as water, sewerage and
                roads. Across the water, local authorities usually deal with
                those issues, so they do not count, therefore, in the
                departmental expenditure limit (DEL), unlike here. That not only
                concerns the amounts made available to us through the Barnett
                formula, but what capital charges are counted in the ambit of
                the DEL. The Executive are committed to trying to pursue those
                questions, and the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister
                are especially committed to playing a strong striker role as
                they represent the Administration and the region.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I acknowledge that there have been
                frustrations and criticisms from members of the Finance and
                Personnel Committee and others about the flow, cycle and
                availability of information at different times. With this
                exercise, the statement that I made on 29 May that set out an
                approach to timetable, the pre-Budget statement now, and the
                position reports sent by the First Minister and the Deputy First
                Minister to all Committee Chairpersons, we are trying to ensure
                that all Committees have an early input. I remind Members that
                the position reports that Committee Chairpersons received
                yesterday were received by Ministers only in the middle of last
                week. There has been no Executive consideration as such of those
                position reports, and no bids have been weeded or screened out.
                From the point of view of the Executive planning process, the
                Committees and their Chairpersons were furnished with
                information almost as soon as Executive members.</p>

                that I found to be tantalising disclosures? The first concerned
                the needs and effectiveness evaluation relating to training and
                vocational education. This is the first occasion on which my
                Committee has been aware of that. I would be grateful for any
                further information, in particular on who will conduct that
                evaluation. External evaluation can achieve a more objective

                pay settlement is envisaged for those staff?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am surprised that the Committee for Higher
                and Further Education, Training and Employment was not aware of
                the needs and effectiveness evaluations, and I cannot understand
                how that has happened.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive instituted an exercise that
                involved five needs and effectiveness evaluations, as mentioned
                in my statement, and that is one of them. It has been mentioned
                in various communications and also in the Chamber. In future, we
                must ensure that any such decisions are communicated to those
                people who have a direct interest.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The needs and effectiveness evaluations are
                being done for our own purposes. This is a significant programme
                with a large amount of expenditure involved. It is an important
                area as far as the Executive’s priorities in the Programme for
                Government are concerned. We are also conscious that we might
                want to challenge — and be challenged — on some of those
                issues on any approach we make in relation to the Barnett
                formula. Like the other needs and effectiveness evaluations, it
                is there to assist the Executive and the region in ensuring that
                we have optimum public spending patterns and levels.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to be careful about singling out any
                one group on the subject of pay pressures. As well as the
                reference to further education lecturers, elsewhere in the
                statement I referred to public sector pay’s being a
                significant driver of our spending. I do not want to speak out
                of turn and imply that any one group of staff in any service is
                a problem, or that its pay award may lead to pressures. I hope
                that all Committees will note that we face significant pressures
                on public sector pay; the uplifts on public sector pay consume
                considerable amounts of our available additional resources. That
                means that people who need increases in services are often not
                getting as much as they would like.</p>

                that the resources received from the Treasury are insufficient
                to meet them. Consequently, can the Minister advise the Assembly
                what action he has initiated to identify alternative sources of
                funding to augment the Barnett-based allocations, and what
                actions will his fellow Ministers take to help to get a greater
                return from the resources that we have?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with the Member that public finances
                can be complex, but we must never lose focus on the essentials,
                which are to obtain an appropriate share of the resources
                available and to use them effectively to meet our needs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive have made no secret of the fact
                that we believe that a better needs-based mechanism to replace
                the Barnett formula is required. We are pursuing that goal, as I
                have already indicated.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive are also determined to make
                maximum use of the existing funding opportunities. We have set
                up several needs and effectiveness studies in key areas in order
                to better inform policy-making. We have also announced a
                high-powered working group that will look at the scope for using
                public-private partnerships to help deliver public services. My
                Executive Colleagues have pledged their full support for those
                initiatives.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I note the Minister’s comments that the
                Minister of Education has announced a balanced programme of
                conventional capital procurement and exploration of
                public-private partnerships. I assume that Mr Durkan’s view of
                a balanced programme relates to public-private partnerships as
                opposed to spending from the public purse, and that it does not
                include the two-to-one ratio of spending that the Minister of
                Education announced for maintained and controlled schools, which
                discriminated against the controlled sector.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There was some confusion last year as to
                whether Northern Ireland would benefit from the &quot;Prescott
                package&quot;. Can the Minister confirm that we are entitled to
                our element under the Barnett formula, given the case of the
                London Underground and other circumstances that prevailed in the
                UK? If that will be the case, can the Minister assure us that
                the money will stay in the public transport sector?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I addressed Mr Poots’s point about the
                balanced programme for education yesterday. The spending on
                schools’ capital is properly needs-based, whether it is
                announced by the Minister of Education with respect to his
                Department’s Budget allocation or by me on behalf of the
                Executive programme funds. Information on the working lists of
                projects awaiting investment has been furnished to Members who
                wished to see it. Decisions were properly needs-based.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If people are saying that we should only give
                equal amounts to school sectors regardless of the needs of
                particular schools, that could be discriminatory. We would be
                saying that we could not fund certain schools because they were
                in a particular sector, but that we would fund schools in
                another sector that had less need, or whose building project was
                less ready for funding.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to assure the House that there is no
                discrimination in those areas of spending. There are means
                available for Members to pursue issues for which they believe
                that equality implications arise. Members are not using those
                means but are continually reciting this criticism or allegation
                every time I make a statement on spending.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We received a Barnett share from the money
                announced in the &quot;Prescott package&quot;. Large additions
                were made to road and rail in 2001-02 in the past year and in
                the Executive programme fund allocations. Although the money
                that we get through the Barnett formula derives from expenditure
                decisions across a range of programmes in England, we, as a
                devolved region, have discretion on how we should spend that
                money.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Savage has asked a number of questions and
                made some salient points about the pressures and difficulties
                facing agriculture — and not just the pressures from the
                immediate fallout and impact of foot-and-mouth disease, but some
                of the longer-term structural challenges.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is an area in which I want to be
                careful. After all, we are at preparatory stage for the Budget,
                and I look forward, on the basis of Mr Savage’s remarks, to
                the views and insights that will come from the Agriculture and

                of agriculture.</p>

                invitation to make a specific call for restructuring, wholesale
                restructuring or whatever. Many people in agriculture might make
                a benign response to a call from him phrased in those terms, but
                they might not make such a benign response to a similar call
                from the Minister of Finance and Personnel. People tend to look

                which was established in February 2001, is reviewing procurement
                policy and procedures with very much the purpose that Mr Bradley
                has referred to in mind. The findings of the initial review,
                which was conducted before devolution, indicated that, if we
                were to set similar targets to those set for Departments in
                Great Britain, we could achieve procurement savings of £30
                million.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Such significant savings for a devolved
                Administration to administer and direct towards some of our
                spending priorities would be useful. The more efficient our
                procurement procedures are, the more value for money can be
                achieved, and, in turn, the more money can be allocated to other
                public service needs.</p>

                there are several important provincial towns that also need
                investment? Some of those towns have been allowed to fall into a
                terrible state because of sectarian trouble, population movement

                Roger Hutchinson mentioned. Today we are allowing for pre-Budget

                stating what might be spent in the next round in areas that we
                consider priorities, and with how we might approach that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Britain, the Ministry of Agriculture,

                upon the Assembly’s views on how to prioritise spending for
                agriculture in our Budget? Will this perceived movement away
                from agriculture by the British Government impact on how the
                Executive might view priority spending for agriculture in the
                next round?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive are alert to the importance of
                the agriculture sector in our economy and its importance to the
                whole region. The implications of the changes in departmental
                designations in Whitehall will not make any material difference
                to how we set our priorities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is for the First Minister and the Deputy
                First Minister to determine what Departments we have and to
                designate their structures and titles. The move to a dedicated
                Department of Agriculture and Rural Development is supported by
                the Assembly. It is a Department that is working hard to serve
                the needs of its sector and one that is co-operating with the
                Committee.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive will be as supportive and as
                responsive as possible to the needs and services that are
                represented in the work of all Departments, including the
                Department of Agriculture and Rural Development. Changes in
                departmental designations will not materially affect the
                priority that we want to see accorded to agriculture, and the
                type of support and intervention that we want to undertake in
                agriculture.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It might make some difference at
                representational level. It might affect how well our needs are
                reflected at UK level when it comes to some EU considerations.
                There may be some change at representational level and in the
                European policy-influencing area, but not in our own priorities.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Committee for Social
                Development (Mr Cobain):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to raise a number of issues on behalf
                of the Social Development Committee. First, it is important to
                target social need. Housing is central to that. This year we
                shall spend less on housing than we did last year. Next year we
                shall spend less again. The Housing Executive has targeted north
                Belfast, citing it as having the worst housing conditions in
                western Europe and highlighting the need for £157 million over
                the next eight years to tackle that. To date, the Executive have
                allocated £5&nbsp;million, and if we continue at that rate, it
                will take 20 or 30 years to address that issue in north Belfast.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, there is the matter of rents. Last
                year’s budget was based on an increase of twice the rate of
                inflation for rents. I benchmark that against targeting social
                need (TSN). People who live in the poorest sections of society,
                such as Housing Executive tenants on housing benefits, had their
                bathroom and kitchen replacement schemes cancelled. That is
                another first for targeting social need.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fuel poverty issues that were agreed by the
                Executive affect a small portion of society. People who are over
                60 and have a small income-related pension are not entitled to
                the fuel poverty entitlements. Similarly, most people who are
                under 60 and who have severe physical disabilities and those who
                are under 60 and have a small family are not entitled to the
                fuel poverty entitlements.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Roger Hutchinson raised an issue about the
                regeneration of towns and cities. We are spending less this year
                than we did last year, and according to the Budget we shall
                spend less next year than we did this year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I ask the Minister to take on board the
                concerns of the Social Development Committee. Unless the
                Executive take those issues on board and allocates sufficient
                funds that will tackle some of those needs, we are in for a
                lively Budget debate in November.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Mr Cobain for his warning and the
                points that he made. Our spending on housing was not reduced
                last year. We reversed a pattern and saw an increase in housing
                expenditure last year. The Executive, when budgeting for
                services for which charges are made, such as rents, will
                allocate moneys based on certain assumptions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those are the working assumptions on which
                the Executive allocates the money. I indicated at the draft
                Budget stage and at other points of consideration that, in
                relation to the Housing Executive budget, the Executive were
                working on the assumption of rent increases of GDP plus 2%. The
                Housing Executive was funded on that basis. However, it fell to
                the Minister and the Department to decide whether that would be
                the case in practice. The option to go for a lower rate increase
                of GDP plus 0·5% was taken, and that in turn meant that there
                would be less rental income and less money to spend on the
                housing programme. That was not the Executive’s choice; it was
                the choice of the Department and the Minister concerned, and was
                made within their budget. The Committee for Social Development
                is free to engage the Minister on that issue in relation to
                further Budget planning.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members referred to what was or was not in
                the statement, and I ask them to look at the overall position
                report. Mr Cobain stressed that the Executive will have to take
                account of the needs that he referred to under the
                responsibilities of the Department for Social Development. I
                hope that all Committees will take account of the wider
                realities and pressures that the Executive face and the service
                issues that the Budget must meet. We cannot go on automatically
                increasing every single Budget line year on year. If we are
                serious about making a difference and about reprioritisation as
                a devolved Assembly, we must spend less on some Budget lines,
                either because success has been registered in meeting particular
                needs and overcoming problems or because there are other new
                needs that take greater priority. We cannot sustain increases in
                every single Budget line — we do not have the additional money
                to do that. We hope that all Committees will be realistic about
                that matter, as well as being assertive in the context of the
                services that they want to see bettered and protected.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Chairperson of the Committee for Regional
                Development I accept that. However, I re-emphasise that there
                has been a historic underfunding of the roads infrastructure,
                which has led to a serious deterioration in the standard of
                roads throughout Northern Ireland. There has also been a
                historic underfunding of water and sewerage, and underinvestment
                in public transport, and that has led to a serious situation.
                All three areas must be addressed, and, unfortunately, they must
                be addressed simultaneously. The high bids are not inflated
                artificially but reflect the growing need in our society for
                better roads, better water and better public transportation.</p>

                there are alternative sources of funding that he or his
                Department can envisage in the near future that would

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I assure Mr Maginness that my reference to
                the scale of bids from the Department for Regional Development
                was not meant to imply that there were inflated bids. I
                reflected on the historical underfunding that exists there. We
                have consultations at Committee and Executive level, and it is
                important to hear the results of deliberations such as those
                from the Committee for Regional Development on issues that are,
                as Mr Maginness acknowledges, profound.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If there has been historical underfunding,
                there is also current underfunding in the Northern Ireland
                budget at large, and we have to work with that reality. We need
                to look at issues that must be addressed to get more resources
                for certain services. That comes back to the issue about charges
                that was raised by Mr Leslie, in particular, for services for
                which we get no money from the Barnett formula. We get no money
                for water and sewerage from the Barnett formula, and we must
                fund those services out of whatever resources we have. We need
                to think about the degrees of priority that we accord to the
                needs that are registered. We shall try to take account of
                particular priorities and pressures that exist across all
                Departments, and we shall take the Committees’ views into
                account. We ask the Committees to look not only at what needs
                more money, but at how to get more money.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Department does not have a &quot;magic
                bullet&quot;. Some people think that there are easy options,
                that it is just a matter of establishing a new super bond.
                Unfortunately, that would not help us under existing Treasury
                rules. We are governed by a departmental expenditure limit. As
                my officials point out, the departmental expenditure limit does
                exactly what it says: it limits the amount of money that
                Departments have to spend. Therefore, if we were to get
                resources by other means, we would still come up against that
                spending limit. That is one of the reasons for having a
                high-powered working group to look at ways of supplementing our
                public spending through other means, including private funding.</p>

                entered our political vocabulary — &quot;rural proofing&quot;.
                I do not regard the rural community as something to be equated
                to vandal proofing, child proofing or theft proofing. The rural
                community is an important part of society. However, the Minister
                of Agriculture and Rural Development introduced that phrase. The
                Programme for Government talks about social inclusion and New

                that we can get an equality of results. I am grateful that the
                Minister has allocated £10 million to the Department of
                Agriculture and Rural Development for a vision for the future of
                agriculture. However, nowhere in today’s statement or
                yesterday’s draft was there any indication of how rural
                proofing would be carried out, whose responsibility it is, which
                Department is in charge or how it will be financed. How will
                rural proofing be carried out to support the rural community?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that Members do not expect the concept
                of rural proofing to be translated into a Budget line of that
                name. The Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development has
                championed and emphasised the concept. Although that Department
                will, obviously, have a particular responsibility for, and
                interest in, ensuring that the needs of the rural community are
                properly met, a similar responsibility will fall to all
                Departments that provide services across the region, including
                those services to people in rural communities. The issue can
                also be usefully taken up through the channels available to the
                various departmental Committees, which can question how well
                rural proofing is done by the corresponding Departments as far
                as their particular spending programmes are concerned.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In a draft or revised Budget, I present the
                spending decisions made, in broad terms, at Executive level. It
                is then the responsibility of individual Departments and
                Ministers to translate those into specific spending decisions
                that support services across the region. I reiterate that
                Committees are free to explore and interrogate those detailed
                spending issues. Questions on those issues should not be asked
                in a setting such as this, but should be taken up with the
                various Departments.</p>

                commitments are of similar importance. We have made clear that
                money could be available from the Executive programme fund for
                infrastructure for projects like the gas pipeline. That
                obviously depends on the value and economic strength of the

                the creation of the Programme for Government, the agreed Budget

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The agriculture industry is a shambles, and
                most of the budget is spent on administration. Is the budget too
                small, or is the Department not efficient enough? That question
                must be addressed by the Executive. Agriculture must be
                restructured so that farmers in Northern&nbsp;Ireland can have a
                fair day’s pay for producing a superior product. Farmers are
                living on the knife-edge of bankruptcy. We cannot sell the goose
                that lays the golden eggs.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I note Mr&nbsp;Armstrong’s point, but I
                shall not borrow the phrase that he used, because the wrong
                connotation would be put on it. The Member asked whether the
                budget for agriculture is inadequate, or whether the Department,
                or the plans that are in place, are efficient enough. It may be
                either or both. However, this exercise, with the pre-Budget
                reflections and the consideration when it comes to the draft
                Budget, allows departmental Committees to explore those issues
                with their Departments and Ministers. Our total Budget is not
                adequate to meet all our needs and service demands. We also must
                ask whether our existing spending plans and patterns are as

                in the Programme for Government. How will that impact on our
                future spending powers? Does the Minister envisage discussion
                with the Treasury leading to an improvement of the Barnett
                allocation to Northern Ireland, given the limiting factors that
                we currently have?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have already touched on some of the points
                that Mr&nbsp;Byrne raises. The Executive are trying to address
                with the Treasury the difficulties that the Barnett formula
                gives us. I have said that it is not just the amount, which is
                the usual issue with which everyone readily identifies, but some
                of the implications of resource accounting and budgeting. That
                is a complex issue, but we must note that the move to resource
                accounting does not, in itself, have implications for our
                spending power. However, a fundamental principle of resource
                accounting is that budgets have to bear a cost in respect of
                assets held. That will have implications, because, as I have
                already said, we have a much larger asset base than England.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive — while trying to address
                those allocation and ambit issues of the Barnett formula with
                the Treasury — are establishing a high-powered working group
                to look at other means of supplementing and supporting our
                public expenditure needs.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I regret the fact that some Members who
                wished to ask the Minister questions were not able to do so in
                the maximum time available under Standing Orders. Several
                Members asked questions that were almost identical to some that
                had already been asked. In some cases, Members had an excuse as
                they were not in the Chamber when the questions were asked.
                However, some Members were in the Chamber when questions were
                asked, and they asked exactly the same questions again, which is
                perhaps less excusable. I am sure that the Environment Committee
                will be happy about the recycling nature of this, but for the
                rest of the Assembly it is not particularly the best way to use
                the very limited time available for such a broad issue.</p>

                Second Stage.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is a short but significant reforming
                Bill that will best serve the interests of children, their
                unmarried fathers and step-parents. Generally, it will support
                strong, healthy family relationships. Equally, the parentage of
                a child will be more easily established when that is in dispute,
                and certain presumptions of paternity will be set down in
                statute.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I sponsored the Bill, as law reform falls
                within my departmental responsibility. At the Second Stage, it
                became apparent that the Health, Social Services and Public
                Safety Committee had an obvious interest in the subject matter.
                The Finance and Personnel Committee was obliging in allowing
                another Committee to conduct the scrutiny stage of the Bill. As
                a direct result of the deliberations of the Health, Social
                Services and Public Safety Committee, five amendments were
                tabled in my name at Consideration Stage. I thank those
                Committee members.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although only one of the five amendments was
                substantive in nature, it significantly improved the Bill in the
                way in which it amends the Children (Northern Ireland) Order
                1995. The amended provision directs courts to look to the best
                interests of the child when considering an application to make a
                parental responsibility order in favour of an unmarried father
                or a step-parent.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I said in an earlier debate, our
                legislation on the interests of the child is more advanced than
                that in other jurisdictions on these islands. Another innovation
                that others are following is the conferral of joint parental
                responsibility on those who jointly register the birth of their
                child. We all agree that that is a common sense measure that
                most people already assume to be the law.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members are interested to know when the
                reforms will come into operation — should the Bill be passed.
                I cannot give a precise commencement date, but it is likely that
                the Bill’s substantive provisions will come into force in the
                autumn. The reason for the delay is that, although the Bill is
                short, there are a considerable number of court Rules and other
                Regulations that must be made so that the reforms can operate as
                intended.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For the most part, those Rules are the
                responsibility of the Northern Ireland Court Service, and they
                are subject to scrutiny and endorsement by the Lord Chancellor.
                A complicating factor is the interaction between this Bill and

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion to amend Standing Order 47(7), a
                Cheann Comhairle, is required after advice from the Assembly
                Commission that it is actively exploring proposals to provide
                several of off-site locations to facilitate Committee meetings.
                The aim is to allow local people to have greater access to
                Assembly Committees and, equally, to allow Committees to
                interface with local communities. I am aware that several
                Committees have already undertaken oral evidence sessions
                outside Parliament Buildings. It is likely that that practice
                will increase.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the key issues raised by Committee
                Chairpersons in the Commission’s consultations about off-site
                meetings was the feasibility of using video conferencing. That
                raised the issue of whether a Committee meeting would be in
                quorum should video conferencing be used with, for example,
                three members in Parliament Buildings and two members in Omagh.
                The Assembly’s legal adviser has stated that, although the
                existing Standing Order 47 could be interpreted as permitting a
                quorum when members are linked by video, it would be better if
                the Standing Order made it absolutely clear that a quorum can be
                achieved in such instances. The Committee on Procedures accepts
                that advice and proposes the amendment to Standing Orders.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Leslie:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I listened carefully to Mr Murphy, and,
                although for the most part this seems to be a sensible measure,
                it occurred to me that there might be one problem with it. The
                circumstances to which the Member referred were essentially in
                the context of a public Committee hearing, and I do not see any
                difficulty there. However, if for some reason a Committee does
                part of its business in private, how can it be certain that
                those persons who are participating in the meeting by video link
                are equally conducting their business in private? Although I
                regret to say that I did not think of that in time to table down
                an amendment, I wonder whether the Chairperson of the Committee
                might like to reflect on that matter for future reference.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr C Murphy:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Mr Leslie for his observation. Of
                course, Standing Orders provide that it is up to the Committees
                to set their own procedures on many of the issues. I am sure
                that that advice could be relayed to Committee Chairpersons who
                are intent on setting up an outside meeting with a video
                conference link. If some of the business must be done in
                private, they obviously need to reflect on that and set their
                own procedures in that regard.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I imagine that only certain types of meeting
                would be held outside of Committee rooms. To date, the only
                meetings of that nature have been to hear oral evidence. Those
                are the sorts of meetings — rather than private, in-house
                meetings about sensitive issues — that people would want to
                hold in the community. Once the motion to amend has been passed,
                the Members’ Committee can pass on observations and advice to
                the Committee Chairpersons through the Chairpersons’ liaison
                group.</p>

                questions to Ministers from all sides of the House, including
                the Member’s side, in the past hour and a half that were well
                wide of the mark. The Chairman of the Committee on Procedures

                continue to move forward. This motion to amend Standing Orders
                is part of the Committee on Procedures’ ongoing work to
                clarify, where necessary, the existing Standing Orders. In this
                instance, the motion has been moved to clarify the meaning of
                Standing Order 72, which allows for the suspension of Standing
                Orders to facilitate the Assembly’s plenary business in
                unusual circumstances or because of an unforeseen event.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Experience has shown that it has been used on
                several occasions, and that sometimes only part of a Standing
                Order has had to be suspended. The current wording of Standing
                Order 72 makes reference to &quot;one or more Standing
                Orders&quot;, and my legal advice is that the reference to one
                may be interpreted to include part of a Standing Order. The
                Committee has been advised that the wording of that Standing
                Order should be tightened to make it clear that part of a
                Standing Order can also be suspended.</p>

                mechanisms exist. Those are being developed taking account of
                initial views from the voluntary sector and will be subject to
                full consultation covering any associated equality implications
                over the summer and early autumn. When the consultation exercise
                is complete and the arrangements are finalised, we will move
                quickly to invite bids for support from the children’s fund
                and assess those in line with our final criteria. We hope that
                the timescale will ensure that the final arrangements reflect

                allocations for disabled children; £1·3 million for specialist
                residential units; £1·6 million for the Families for Life
                regional adopting service; £1·2 million for counselling

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The criteria will be governed by their

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are very pleased that the voluntary sector
                has been involved in helping officials to develop proposals for
                the management of the children’s fund and hope to build on
                that productive relationship as we take the children’s fund
                forward.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some time ago the First Minister and I had a
                valuable meeting with a large range of organisations connected
                with children. That type of dialogue has continued with
                officials, and it will develop. We recognise the sector’s key
                role in supporting children in need and young people at risk and
                the importance of ensuring that it is involved in distributing
                funding in future bidding rounds. After the Executive have had
                an opportunity to consider proposals for future allocations from
                the children’s fund, we are planning full consultation with
                the sector and other interested parties. Those proposals
                envisage the sector’s being actively involved in a number of
                aspects of that fund.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition we are committed to putting in
                place a comprehensive strategy on children’s rights and needs.
                The strategy will set out the Executive’s vision, values,
                strategic goals and specific objectives for children. It will
                also include a strong focus on children in need and young people
                at risk. The development of that strategy is being informed by
                experience gained through the operation of the children’s
                fund. It will be important to have consistency between the goals
                in the strategy and the long-term aims of the children’s fund,
                and we are committed to making sure that that will happen.</p>

                not be used directly, or indirectly, for other things or to

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first and obvious reply is vigilance to
                ensure that if money is channelled towards children in need or
                at risk that is where it goes. Funding from the Executive
                programme funds is ring- fenced within the respective Department
                baselines, thereby ensuring that it can only be used for the
                specific purpose for which it was made available. That will also
                ensure that any allocated funding no longer required must be
                returned for reallocation. I repeat: it must be returned for
                reallocation, and funds will be allocated to other bodies,
                whether in the statutory, voluntary or community sectors, on the
                same basis.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Officials are developing arrangements to
                ensure that all Executive programme fund allocations can be
                effectively monitored and accounted for. There will be no hiding
                place for those who try to divert money for children in need or
                at risk into other purposes; there will be no hiding place in
                the Administration, in the voluntary sector, in the community
                sector or in any other sector.</p>

                be available on Thursday, and copies will be placed in the
                Assembly Library.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Through the plan the Office of the First
                Minister and the Deputy First Minister as a Department seeks to
                promote good government and has several strategic aims. The
                first aim is to promote corporate thinking and collectivity in
                all institutions of the Government and to ensure that the
                Administration’s key policies are agreed and delivered. Other
                aims include ensuring the effective operation of all
                institutions; developing relations internationally and within
                these islands; communicating the policies and activities of
                Ministers and institutions of Government; building a Programme
                for Government and modernising the Government’s programme; and
                promoting better community relations in a culture of equality
                and human rights.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Members will know, considerable progress
                has been made in realising those strategic aims, not least
                through the development of a programme for Government,
                including, for the first time, public service agreements, and
                also through the introduction of the concept of a single
                equality Bill and the implementation of evaluation of New TSN.</p>

                will be particularly anxious to do that. Of course, many of the
                aims and objectives of the Office of the First Minister and the
                Deputy First Minister are directed towards co-ordinating the
                work of the Administration as a whole. In effect, our success

                framed, because Dr Paisley was clearly expressing his concern
                about the future of this institution, and he was clearly
                indicating his desire to see it continue. That, of course, is
                entirely in accordance with the manifesto of that party, which

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In relation to the Disability Discrimination
                Act, the Equality Commission has a role similar to that of the
                Disability Rights Commission in Great Britain. The Equality
                Commission has specific duties in relation to disability. Those
                include: to work towards the elimination of discrimination and
                promote the equalisation of opportunities for disabled people;
                to keep the legislation under review; to undertake formal
                investigations; to prepare statutory codes of practice giving
                practical guidance on how to comply with the law; and to provide
                information advice to employers and service providers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Great Britain, the Government have
                referred a number of the task force’s recommendations to the
                Disability Rights Commission as part of its role to monitor and
                review the operation of the Disability Discrimination Act. As
                the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland has a similar role
                to perform in relation to the Act as it applies in Northern
                Ireland, we have already asked the Equality Commission to work
                in tandem with the Disability Rights Commission on those
                particular task force recommendations.</p>

                additional legislation for Northern Ireland. The situation will
                be reviewed in the light of our experience with the operation of
                the Freedom of Information Act 2000. The Westminster Freedom of
                Information Act at present extends to Northern Ireland. That Act
                must come into force within five years, and the Lord Chancellor
                has the responsibility for appointing dates for the different
                provisions to take effect.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister’s response is extremely
                disappointing. I am sure that both he and his Colleague are
                aware of the fact that freedom of information was made a
                priority by the incoming Scottish Executive. As a result, the
                system of government in Scotland is considerably more open than
                in the UK as a whole.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we are going to show the way forward in
                this Assembly, we should be seeking to do rather better than the
                very tardy progress in Westminster, which it appears the
                Ministers are satisfied with.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member is wrong on two counts. First, the
                Executive decided in February 2000 that the Freedom of
                Information Bill, which was passing through Parliament, should
                apply to Northern Ireland, because in the time available it
                would not have been possible to have had a freedom of
                information Bill on the statute book in this Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Hence we would have been without any freedom
                of information Bill. A decision has to be taken by the Executive
                either to continue with that or to draw up a freedom of
                information Bill for Northern Ireland. That is what many Members
                favour.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Freedom of Information Act 2000 does not
                cover the devolved Administration in Scotland. The Scottish
                Executive recently published a consultation document on draft
                freedom of information legislation. The proposals follow
                closely, but not exactly, the structure of the United Kingdom
                Act, and they are broadly similar in their provisions. As in the
                United Kingdom Act they propose to confer rights to information
                rather than access to documents and that there will be a roughly
                equivalent enforcement regime. A similar period of five years is
                proposed for the implementation following the enactment of the
                legislation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Therefore there is no statutory regime in
                Scotland. There is no freedom of information legislation
                applying to Scotland. It is at the consultation period. I
                suggest to the Member that there was more wisdom in the decision
                taken by the Executive here to at least have a freedom of
                information Bill until such time as we could produce a better
                one, unlike Scotland which left itself without any and finds
                itself consulting.</p>

                First Minister, who takes his advice on many things and who
                regularly consults with him on every decision that he makes, and
                ask him to include details of his current resignation letter
                which has been kept hidden, his original resignation letter and
                the letter relating to policing that Mr John D Taylor received
                from the Prime Minister? Perhaps he could even throw in the

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is our aim that the assistance available
                here should be no less beneficial than that available in similar
                circumstances in Great Britain. Where there are legislative and
                other constraints, as in the case of rate relief, alternative
                ways of achieving the objective are being developed. Officials
                from our Department continue to attend the Whitehall rural task
                force to keep abreast of developments and wider economic issues
                in Great Britain, and I am sure that Northern Ireland benefits
                from any national schemes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the Member knows, the measures available
                in Northern Ireland include the following: the help for business
                scheme; the small firms loan guarantee scheme; the deferral of
                tax, VAT and National Insurance payments; business advice from
                LEDU and the IDB; marketing Northern Ireland and attracting
                promoters through the tourism recovery strategy; advice on
                alternative training and employment opportunities; advice on
                benefits and advice to farmers on farm business. The information
                leaflet published by the Executive entitled ‘Coping with
                Foot-and-Mouth Disease — Help for Businesses’ provides
                further details including contact numbers, and those can also be
                obtained from the web site.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a way of showing that the assistance is as
                beneficial here as it is in Great Britain I would like to cite
                the marketing tourism scheme. We invested £1 million in the
                scheme — on a per capita basis adjusted for the size of
                Northern Ireland compared with GB — which is higher than the
                equivalent figures for across the water.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I indicated in my replies to recent similar
                questions that I am conscious that existing levels of funding to
                maintain and improve the road network fall short of the
                requirements. I will be considering the scale of the
                infrastructure investment required on roads, including rural
                roads, as part of the work underway to develop a 10-year

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The regional transportation strategy will
                consider ways of increasing investment in transport

                I hope to be in a position to present my draft regional
                transportation strategy to the Committee for Regional
                Development this autumn. Until the strategy is in place I will
                continue to press for additional funds for the road network at
                every opportunity. In the meantime I assure the House that my
                Department will continue to make the best use of the resources
                currently available to develop and maintain the rural road
                network.</p>

                brought to my attention, along with every Member in the House
                who has been canvassing recently, was the state of rural roads.
                I am pleased with the Minister’s answer. The rural network
                away from the main roads is particularly bad, and there are a
                lot of potholes. People in rural areas pay the same taxes as
                everyone else, and they are entitled to equal services. Go raibh

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am concerned about the maintenance and
                improvement of the rural roads network. We will spend
                approximately £44 million in the current financial year on
                structural maintenance of all roads. Some of that will be on
                rural roads.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That figure compares favourably with last
                year’s initial allocation of £39 million. The Roads Service
                and I have to constantly reappraise the need to improve the
                infrastructure of rural roads. The restrictive allocation of
                funding is a continual problem, which I know applies to other
                Departments as well. We will continue to keep that matter under

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I consider that the new Northern Ireland
                Railways (NIR) timetable provides appropriate levels of service,
                bearing in mind the limited rolling stock currently available.
                Because of the reopening on 10 June of the direct rail link
                between Antrim and Belfast, the new timetable provides journey
                time reductions of over 30 minutes for travel between Belfast
                and Antrim and all stations north and west of Antrim.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those reductions have also enabled Translink
                to use its available rolling stock to provide a better service
                on the Londonderry to Belfast line. For example, there are now
                nine scheduled services each way on weekdays, compared to seven
                northbound and six southbound prior to the reopening of the
                line.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are clearly benefits in the new
                timetable for the northern part of the region and for those
                travelling from the Waterside to Antrim and on to Belfast. How
                can the Minister assess the value of the Knockmore line, as he
                plans to do over the next year, when the only morning train from
                Antrim to Belfast via Lisburn is timed to suit school students
                who must be in Lisburn before 7.30 and workers who must be in
                Belfast before 8.00? Is it realistic to base any assessment on
                such a timetable?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the Member knows, I am acutely aware of
                the problem. I received a number of deputations about the Antrim
                to Knockmore line and spoke to a number of people in the area
                before the decision to preserve the line for a further year was
                taken. I also spoke to people who were still lobbying when the
                announcement was made.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So, if there is a section of rail line in
                Northern Ireland that I am aware of, it is the Antrim to
                Knockmore section. My difficulty is that Northern Ireland
                Railways told me that it was in the unenviable position of
                having to open a new line. It cost approximately
                £17&nbsp;million to provide an efficient, effective service and
                increase and improve the level of service for the thousands of
                people who use that line. The line is now open. Unfortunately,
                the corollary of that was that the Antrim to Knockmore line
                could not be supplemented and built up to the same degree.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was not prepared to contemplate the closure
                of the Antrim to Knockmore line, and I am still not prepared to
                contemplate it. I understand and accept the Member’s point
                that the current reduced service is not the best way of
                measuring the effectiveness of any service beyond the 12-month
                extension. Unfortunately, it is the only method that we have. I
                hope that we will be able to look again at the Antrim to
                Knockmore line in the regional transportation strategy, and I
                view its continued usage with sympathy and support. I hope that
                we will be able to preserve it, but I cannot say more than that.</p>

                stock be used at more appropriate hours so that peak-period

                Unfortunately, it will take approximately two years to acquire
                the new rolling stock. However, it is not as straightforward or
                as simple as preserving the line until new rolling stock becomes
                available and then transferring some of it to the Antrim to
                Knockmore line. We must also remember that there is a
                significant and substantial cost implication for preserving the
                line on safety grounds in the next three years or so. It will
                cost millions of pounds. The Member has raised the issue and I,
                as Minister, have already raised the issue in the Department. If
                it provides a possible source of preserving the line, I am open

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I understand the Member’s concern about the
                removal. The UK Water Research Centre carried out a review on
                the use of asbestos in the major European countries, the United
                States of America, Australia and Japan. It was found that most
                of those countries surveyed had stopped using asbestos cement
                pipes and that they had no plans to replace existing asbestos
                cement pipes, as these were not considered to present a health
                risk.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not in possession of information that
                indicates that there would be a substantial risk with the
                removal or replacement of those pipes. If I were, however, the
                position would be revised. The ongoing replacement of asbestos
                pipes will take some time to complete. At the moment, fewer than
                10% of water mains are made of asbestos.</p>

                graffiti and the flying of flags on departmental property. It
                has been said many times that the Department will try to remove
                from its property any illegal flags and graffiti that are a

                danger, in spite of there being no legislative requirement to do
                so, the Roads Service will seek to remove such material on the
                advice of the RUC and where there is strong local support. The
                problem is that often the removal of flags leads to the erection
                of more flags than there were before. That is why the Roads
                Service places great importance on local community support for
                the removal of flags. There is concern about the flying of flags
                in communities during a few weeks in the summer, but also about
                those areas where flags fly all year. Those flags are equally
                unacceptable.</p>

                third parties, but they can make representations on planning
                applications. As I have said, such appeals would cause delays

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Department has estimated that the
                introduction of a third-party right of appeal could result in an
                additional 700 appeals a year, which is quite a number compared
                to approximately 350 appeals a year at present. That would cost
                upwards of £1&nbsp;million a year. I am not sure that the
                system would be able to take such an increase at this time
                without more resources. It is a difficult issue.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am very disappointed with the Minister’s
                response on this occasion. He must get real on this issue.
                People are not satisfied with what is currently on offer. He
                mentions the planning problems experienced by people in
                business. What about the problems of the individuals whose human
                rights are being damaged by many large businesses that have
                trampled and abused the planning system for years? When are
                those peoples’ rights going to be recognised?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Foster:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Everyone is equal as far as we are concerned,
                whether their business is large or small. There is no
                discrimination — each planning application is taken on its own
                merits. I recognise that the Human Rights Act places increased
                emphasis on the protection of individual rights. The rights of
                third parties are well protected under the current planning
                system. However, as I said, this is an evolving area, and my
                Department is continuing to keep policy and procedures under
                very close review.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I regret that I have only recently been able
                to write to the Member to provide the information that he sought
                in the supplementary question some time ago.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My officials have estimated that the direct
                staff costs of establishing and providing support for a coastal
                forum could well exceed £100,000 per annum. However, that
                figure takes no account of the senior staff time that my
                Department would have to devote to supporting the work of a
                coastal forum. Nor does it take account of the input that would
                be needed from other Departments, or of other probable costs
                such as expenditure on research, travel, and so forth. Therefore
                the true cost of establishing and supporting the work of a
                coastal forum is likely to be much higher.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I made clear in responses to earlier
                questions, the additional resources made available in the Budget
                last year were not sufficient to enable my Department to
                establish and support a forum. I have said that I see some merit
                in the proposal. However, meeting my Department’s commitments
                in the Programme for Government and the public service agreement
                must have first claim on resources.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister for the responses that I
                received last week to my questions of some months ago.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I accept his point that there is a cost
                attached to setting up a coastal forum. However, does he not
                agree that, in the absence of a coastal forum, senior staff time
                is likely to be taken up with dealing with those issues anyway?
                Given the importance of the issues that a coastal forum would
                deal with, and the cross- departmental themes involving the
                Department of Agriculture and Rural Development and the
                Department for Regional Development, is it not time that the
                Department submitted a bid under the Executive programme funds
                to ensure that the small amount of money that could be produced
                for overall benefits is committed in future spending rounds?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I said, the additional resources made
                available in the Budget last year were not sufficient to enable

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Moreover, in view of the potential
                cross-cutting nature of the role of such a body, any decision to

                its remit. Therefore I have written to Minister Rodgers and
                Minister Campbell, whose Departments would have the most direct
                interest in such a body, to seek their views on the merits of
                the proposal — subject to resources of course.</p>

                guidance is good enough, as this is a major problem in many
                coastal areas? People can either take guidance or ignore it, and

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We all need guidance of some kind in every
                aspect of life, and guidance is important in policies. The
                objective of planning policy must be to accommodate the growing
                demand for affordable housing, which is driven by demographic

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The regional development strategy will set a
                target for growth in the number of new dwellings to be provided
                in existing urban areas. The Planning Service has been engaged

                and Rural Development, the Department of Culture, Arts and
                Leisure and the Department for Regional Development have
                established an interdepartmental group to co-ordinate action on
                this problem. Waterways Ireland and Queen’s University are
                also represented. The Department of Agriculture and Rural
                Development has initiated a three-year study of the ecological
                impacts of the mussels on Lough Erne. That study is
                investigating changes in algae, water clarity, nutrient levels
                and the impact on native swan mussel beds. It has found that
                zebra mussels have consumed much of the algae in the lake and
                that water clarity is at the highest level ever recorded.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The majority of the native swan mussel beds
                have been colonised, and there is a threat of local extinction
                of those mussels. Further research, funded by my Department, is
                now being undertaken to predict the impacts and to assess the
                effectiveness of control measures for other lakes in Northern
                Ireland. However, it is impossible to control the zebra mussel
                infestation in Lough Erne. They have become densely established
                on all available hard surfaces throughout both the upper and
                lower loughs. I am disappointed about that, as I come from that
                part of the world myself. It is a difficult situation.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I echo the Minister’s concern. His reply
                has been useful, but I am particularly concerned about the cost
                to Northern Ireland. Can we recoup some of the costs from the
                Republic, where the infestation came from? I am concerned that
                we have lost algae and some of the pondweeds and the plankton
                that the fish eat. How will the Minister and his Department
                ensure that the fish stocks in both loughs will not be
                endangered?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Foster:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I have said, zebra mussels are now very
                abundant in Upper and Lower Lough Erne but have not spread
                elsewhere in Northern Ireland. The most obvious effect has been
                an increase in the clarity of the water in shallow areas. This
                is mostly because zebra mussels feed by filtering the water and
                extracting the microscopic aquatic life.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The effect of zebra mussels on fish stocks is
                very worrying. The effect will be indirect, and it will take
                some time to become fully apparent. It is expected that changes
                to water quality, bottom sediments and ultimately the fish food
                chain will affect fish populations to some extent. Ongoing work
                by the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development on fish
                stocks in Lough Erne will indicate future changes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It could be very difficult to get money from
                the Republic of Ireland, but zebra mussels did come through from
                the Shannon into Lough Erne. That is rather sad. I would advise
                people to closely monitor their boats to ensure that no more of
                them come in. Take ultimate precautions, hose down well, scrub
                and be very watchful and careful. Once they are in, they are
                difficult to control.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of the Environment, Transport
                and the Regions completed a research project last year on
                intelligent speed adaptation systems. Those can automatically
                restrict the maximum speed of vehicles to the relevant speed
                limit. The Department of the Environment, Transport and the
                Regions has recently begun a further research project examining
                how intelligent speed adaptation might affect driving behaviour.
                That work is complementary to work being carried out in other
                European countries, particularly Sweden and the Netherlands.
                Initial results suggest that those systems offer the prospect of
                significantly reducing the number and severity of speed-related
                collisions. However, vehicle construction standards are governed
                by EU Regulations, and any requirement for the compulsory
                fitting of intelligent speed limiters would therefore need to be
                agreed at European level.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Discussions at European level are under way,
                although those are still at an early stage. My Department will
                continue to monitor developments in this area through its

                application of speed limitation devices is still at an
                exploratory stage and would require widespread public
                consultation. It is not, therefore, a feasible option in the
                short term, but given sufficient public support, intelligent
                speed limiters could in future make a contribution to preventing
                collisions or reducing their severity.</p>

                Many people would consider that most of the speed measures are
                another means of collecting money from the public who use the
                roads. Are there statistics that show the impact of slow
                drivers? Sometimes they are farmers. Slow driving can have an
                impact on road accidents. Is the Minister doing anything to
                educate people about how slow driving, as well as speed, is a
                major cause of road accidents?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Excessive speed remains the most common cause
                of collisions, but there is no doubt that slow drivers also
                create problems. Drivers lose their patience with slow drivers
                and try to overtake.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Excessive speed accounted for almost a fifth
                of all collisions that resulted in fatalities or serious
                casualties between 1994 and 1998. The ‘Northern Ireland Road
                Safety Strategy 2001-2010’ consultation document invites
                comments on proposed new initiatives to improve driver ability
                and significantly change the public’s attitude to excessive
                speed. New initiatives aim to persuade drivers that neither
                experience nor advanced car technology makes it safe or
                acceptable to drive at excessive speed. Responses to the
                consultation document can be made before 27 July. If the Member
                or any other Members have a useful response to make, we would be
                receptive to it.</p>

                draw your attention to the fact that question 2 on the Order
                Paper, posed by Mrs Courtney, who is no longer in her place,
                appears to have been ignored. May I ask for an explanation?</p>

                Regional Development and will receive a written answer.</p>
