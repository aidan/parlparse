                </font></b><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order. During Question Time on Tuesday 8 May,
                the Deputy Speaker, Mr McClelland, was asked to rule on whether
                Standing Order 19(2)(b) had been breached during a supplementary
                question by Mr McGrady to the Minister for Social Development. I
                have read Hansard Volume 11 No 1, pages 21 and 24, and I am
                satisfied that Mr McGrady was asserting variability of quality
                in the work of housing associations. The Member’s remark was
                not, in itself, an allegation of malpractice, and I do not
                believe that a breach of that Standing Order occurred.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Later that day, during the debate on the
                motion of no confidence in the Minister of Education, I was
                asked to rule on an allegation that Rev Dr Ian Paisley had made
                unparliamentary remarks from a sedentary position. I remind
                Members of my previous ruling of 4 December 2000, recorded on
                page 425 of Hansard, that unparliamentary remarks made from a
                sedentary position are no more acceptable than those made from a
                standing position.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have examined Hansard and found some
                ambiguity over whether Dr Paisley was referring to Mr Adams, the
                Member speaking at the time, or to the person being quoted by Mr
                Adams. Mr Peter Robinson made clear his view of to whom Dr
                Paisley was referring, but I have also previously ruled that no
                Member may make an interpretation of what another Member said. I
                therefore call on Dr Paisley to say to whom he was referring and
                to clarify his remark.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr Ian Paisley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Page 40 of Hansard clearly shows that what I
                said was in relation to the letter and to the accusation made in
                it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was not referring to the Member. I was
                referring to the man whom he quoted as having made the very
                serious statement that I was trying to set up Roman Catholic
                people, probably to be murdered.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A remark can be unparliamentary only if it
                refers to other Members. If, as Dr Paisley has clarified, he was
                referring not to Mr Adams but to the man whom Mr Adams was
                quoting, then the remark cannot be deemed to be unparliamentary.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Paisley also rose on a point of order,
                contending that the remarks were not true and that they were an
                incorrect quotation of him. That in itself would be
                unparliamentary. Therefore, I ask Mr Adams whether he accepts Dr
                Paisley’s contention that the remarks that he quoted were not
                remarks that Dr Paisley had made.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Adams:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I accept your ruling on the matter but draw
                your attention to when Dr Paisley made his interruption. I had
                said that</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Dr Paisley asked the people of the
                Shankill what was wrong with them, because there were papists
                living at 425 Shankill Road, 56 Aden Street and 38 Crimea
                Street. I forgive the Rev Dr Ian Paisley for these
                remarks.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Then he interrupted to say &quot;Liar&quot;.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, I believe that what I read is an
                accurate reflection of a report of remarks made by Dr Paisley at
                that time.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member has said that, at that point, he
                was not quoting from the person from whom he had earlier been
                quoting but was speaking in his own right. That is a
                clarification of Hansard. However, Dr Paisley’s point is that
                the report was not factually correct and that that is not what
                he said. That is what the Member maintains. To quote a Member as
                having said something that he or she did not say is
                unparliamentary. Dr Paisley has said &quot;This is not what I
                said.&quot; It may be that someone else put it in a newspaper,
                but I have often said that newspapers are not entirely reliable
                in some of these matters. Does Mr Adams accept Dr Paisley’s
                contention that he, Dr Paisley, did not say the things that he
                was quoted as having said?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Adams:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not accept his contention. I note what
                Dr Paisley has said, but I only have his assertion about this. I
                believe fundamentally that he addressed the word
                &quot;liar&quot; to me and not to anyone else.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will have to give further consideration to
                the matter, because when a Member says quite clearly that the
                report that another Member is quoting from is not true, it is
                normal practice to accept that. The Member is saying that he
                does not accept the contention that the Member makes and that it
                is not a true report. It may be a report that was given in all
                good faith — indeed, if it were not, that would be
                unparliamentary — but that is not the question. The question
                is whether the Member now accepts Dr Paisley’s contention that
                he did not say these things and that they are not true.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Adams:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not accept his contention, but I have
                noted what he has to say. In fairness to him, I will check the
                report, and if it is then my view that I am wrong, of course I
                will come back and make that clear.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will make two points, and the Member will
                be given an opportunity to respond.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Whether it is a correct quotation of a
                newspaper report is not actually the point, because the
                newspaper report may not be true. That would be the reporting of
                an untruth, if one accepts what Dr Paisley has said.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member will, of course, have an
                opportunity to reflect, as will I, and to review Hansard. I
                emphasise the view about what would constitute unparliamentary
                language. Whether a report is true is another matter.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr Ian Paisley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not need the forgiveness of a man of the
                ilk of the Member for West Belfast. I never made any such
                statement, and if he was so keen to search for and get one, why
                did he not bring the proof? Other matters were mentioned, and we
                now have Hansard to refer to. I will be making a personal
                statement to the House about other matters that are incorrect
                and untrue.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I ask Members to reflect on what they have
                said and what has been said. I will be reflecting upon the
                matter, studying Hansard and taking a view on what Members
                subsequently say. I hope that I have made the position clear. If
                any Members are in doubt, they should consult ‘Erskine May’.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the same debate on 8 May, my attention
                was drawn to an allegation that a Member made gestures across
                the Chamber. These were not observed by the Speaker. I asked for
                the videotape of the proceedings to be viewed, but no gestures
                were recorded.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are some circumstances where gestures
                between Members would be a return to a more primitive form of
                communication. Sometimes it may be the only direct form of
                communication between Members, and in such circumstances it may
                be interpreted as an advance. I have consulted ‘Erskine May’,
                and there is no indication of what may constitute
                unparliamentary gestures. They do not seem to have needed to
                rule on this matter in other Chambers. It is difficult enough to
                identify unparliamentary words, without trying to identify
                unparliamentary gestures. One could understand that there would
                be some gestures that would not only be unparliamentary but
                would also be extremely rude. I hope that such behaviour would
                not become practice in the Chamber.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On page 389 of the current edition of ‘Erskine
                May’, the Speaker rules on the question of Members using
                diagrams to elucidate their statements. The Speaker has said
                that</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Members should be sufficiently
                articulate to express what they want to say without
                diagrams.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I trust that I may refer to this as a
                precedent for gestures or hand signals. I emphasise that Members
                should communicate only through the Speaker — and in words.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Adams:</p>

                investigating my complaint. Did you ask the Member, Bob
                McCartney, about the gesture he made?</p>

                be in touch with any Members on whom a ruling is going to be
                made in order that they can be in the Chamber if possible.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is not always possible actually to speak
                with such a Member, but I do try to make contact with him or his
                representative. However, I was able to make contact with Mr
                McCartney and meet him.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member and the House know that it is not
                appropriate for me to divulge what happens or is said between a
                Member and the Speaker. I treat such meetings less as time in
                the confessional and more like appointments I would have had
                during my previous professional practice. However, as a result
                of that meeting, I am satisfied that no untoward intent was
                meant by any of the gestures or gesticulations made in any part
                of the Chamber at that time — I am content about that, and I
                think that I have followed the matter up with some due
                diligence.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I trust this is of some reassurance to the
                Member — although perhaps not a full reassurance. Members from
                all parties often have conversations with me, and it would be
                wrong to divulge those conversations other than as I have done.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Adams:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Further to that point of order. It may be
                appropriate for you, as a former psychiatrist, to use those
                rules. I welcome your ruling about hand signals or gestures.
                However, my Colleague gestured towards me as if pointing a gun
                and pulling the trigger, and I want that on the record.</p>

                — almost a macabre joke — that the president of a party
                inextricably linked with an organisation reeking with blood
                should suggest —</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order. An accusation has been made. If the
                Member wishes to respond to the specifics of that — to whether
                the accusation is true — he may do so briefly in context.
                However, this is not an opportunity for a speech on the matter.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I accept that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member suggested that I made a gesture as
                if pointing a gun, and that needs explanation. After a
                particularly unctuous speech by the Member, in which he talked
                about cleansing streams flowing under bridges, he sat down,
                looked across the Chamber at me and put up his hands as if in
                resignation or supplication — looking hard at me. I indicated
                to him by gesture — because I do not converse with the
                representatives of terror — the following: shaking my head,
                which meant &quot;No&quot;, and making a gesture with my hand,
                which meant &quot;guns&quot;. I will have discussions at any
                time with any representative of a political party, whatever his
                previous background, when he no longer fronts organisations
                armed and dedicated to terror, whether Republican or Loyalist.
                That explains entirely my response by gesture to the good Mr
                Adams, who had just made this horribly unctuous address.</p>

                was was by way of hand signals. I am hesitant to intrude upon

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I regret that it has taken 20 minutes to get
                to this very serious issue, about which people are extremely
                concerned. There has been some unfortunate point scoring, but as
                you say, Mr Speaker, if there is communication, at whatever
                level, that is all to the good.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Because I have been awaiting the final test
                result from the laboratory in Pirbright, Members will not have
                received a copy of my statement in accordance with Standing
                Order 18(1). I apologise for that. Copies are available from the
                Business Office.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to spend a little time bringing
                Members up to date with the current Northern Ireland
                foot-and-mouth disease position. I would then like to refer
                briefly to my policy on movement controls before explaining
                something about the testing work that my Department is doing,
                which seems, judging from the media coverage it occasionally
                gets, to be poorly understood.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The position remains as it has been for some
                weeks now, with a total of four confirmed outbreaks – one at
                Meigh, County Armagh; two at Ardboe, County Tyrone; and one at
                Cushendall, County Antrim. In addition to those confirmed
                outbreaks, we receive from farmers and vets regular reports of
                suspicious symptoms, which we thoroughly investigate. We are
                also performing blood tests on sheep to determine whether any of
                them have been exposed to, or are harbouring, foot-and-mouth
                disease. I shall say more about that in a moment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Members will be aware, we have been
                investigating one suspect case relating to sheep at Ballycastle
                that were exhibiting some suspicious symptoms. Samples have been
                at Pirbright for testing, and I am happy to confirm that the
                definitive results — which I received this morning — are
                negative.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Department’s vets are continuing to
                follow up a number of tests that require further investigation.
                For reasons I will explain in a moment, we can expect that
                pattern to continue over the coming months, but, as far as those
                particular investigations are concerned, it is fair to say that
                we are not unduly worried about any of them at present.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That sums up the present situation.
                Encouraging though that is, I am acutely aware of the effects
                that the livestock movement controls have had on the industry
                since I had to ban all movements just before Easter. Over the
                last three weeks or so, I have been able to ease that ban
                progressively. Doing so is a balancing act between the risk of
                spreading the disease and allowing some semblance of normal
                farming practices. I have, therefore, permitted the movement of
                certain livestock in certain circumstances, provided that the
                necessary disease control conditions are met. I have agreed that
                my Department will meet the costs of veterinary certification in
                those cases.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Assuming there is no radical change in the
                underlying disease situation, further relaxation of the movement
                controls will be permitted next week. I have already announced
                the relevant details, in response to calls from Members and from
                the industry, to allow people to plan accordingly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have also announced a further limited
                welfare disposal scheme for cull sows, which at present have
                only very limited market outlets available. Members may also be
                aware that, following representations to the European
                Commission, I have secured a concession in relation to the
                completion of integrated administration and control system (IACS)
                forms in Northern Ireland. While the deadline for the submission
                of those forms is tomorrow, 15 May, farmers will have until 30
                June to make amendments to their forms.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, I have been conscious of the
                difficulties that the foot-and-mouth disease controls pose for
                the beef special premium scheme. My staff have been unable to
                carry out the necessary inspections and ear notching. Therefore
                I have arranged that when movement controls are relaxed on 23
                May and farm-to-farm sales resume, farmers will be able to
                phone, fax or write to the Department and, on the basis of the
                relevant ear-tag numbers, establish the premium status of the
                animals that they are considering buying.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that Members will agree that those
                measures represent a reasonable response to the industry’s
                most pressing needs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want briefly to clarify the blood testing
                programme that my Department is currently undertaking. It is a
                screening programme designed to determine whether foot-and-mouth
                disease is still present in Northern Ireland. It is likely to
                extend over the coming summer to all the areas where sheep are
                traditionally kept. We are starting with the surveillance zones
                and any related tracings before moving out to the main sheep
                areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The testing is known as serology testing, and
                it looks for antibodies to the foot-and-mouth disease virus. The
                presence of those antibodies means that the sheep has been
                exposed to the virus at some point. Such sheep do not have
                clinical foot-and-mouth disease, so the discovery of antibodies
                does not constitute an outbreak.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They do, however, pose a potential threat to
                other livestock, which could in turn develop foot-and-mouth
                disease, so our policy is to slaughter them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The serology testing is carried out by my
                Department’s veterinary science division at Stormont, which
                has the capacity to handle 10,000 tests per day. Over 82,000
                blood samples have been processed up to 10 May, 43,000 of those
                in the previous week. This is only a screening test, and it is
                not 100% accurate. It will produce some false positives. That
                means that all positive results from serology testing are sent
                to Pirbright for more exacting tests, and this process can take
                up to one week. Unfortunately, some of these cases have been
                picked up by the media and presented as Northern Ireland’s
                next outbreak. That announcement is at best premature, and at
                worst wrong. We are not complacent when such a result emerges.
                The flock involved will be visited, restricted and clinically
                examined, and additional blood samples may be taken. As we are
                dealing with a screening test which is a relatively blunt
                instrument, we can expect to see flocks restricted in various
                parts of Northern Ireland over the next few months. There will
                also be an occasional sheep cull. None of this means that we
                have serious fears that the flocks in question are infected; it
                means that we are taking no chances.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Looking further ahead, I intend to reopen the
                case for Northern Ireland to be regionalised for foot-and-mouth
                disease control purposes. The results of the serology- testing
                regime will be crucial in achieving that status and reopening
                our export trade.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Even though we have had no new outbreaks for
                several weeks, it is vital that we keep up our guard. We have
                been here before, just prior to the Ardboe outbreak at Easter.
                While we still do not know how the disease got from Meigh to
                Ardboe, it is certain that illegal movement of livestock was to
                blame. It is important that farmers continue to practise
                fortress farming, and that everyone continues to adhere to the
                movement controls that are in place. Our biggest threat
                continues to be complacency.</p>

                on the mountain tracks, it would have been impossible to contain
                the disease. Is this the final statement from Pirbright?</p>

                Down remains as I have previously explained. The force majeure
                concession cannot be applied in 2001 because the grazing ban has
                now been in place for some time and must be taken into account.
                Farmers were aware of that in time to make other plans.
                Consequently, the farmers affected cannot claim the Silent
                Valley land in their integrated administration and control
                system (IACS) land declarations for 2001.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As far as I am aware, the compensation paid
                to date is almost £1·3 million, and that is just in the Meigh

                has been paid to date, but I hope that it will be fairly soon.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is gratifying to note that there are no
                more outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease and that that is the
                final report from Pirbright. I also welcome the news that the
                cull sow scheme has started to get under way. It is long
                overdue. There are many things that one could say about the
                present situation. Dr Paisley raised the issue of compensation
                for farmers affected by this disease. I hope that something can
                be done about that fairly soon.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We can all learn from what has happened. We

                between the actions of the two Departments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have been taking many calls over the
                weekend about the Minister’s decision to ban horse racing,
                especially at Downpatrick. I ask the Minister to look very
                seriously at that, because this is an industry that has come
                through a lot. There are so many people involved in the horse
                racing world. If they do not get a race or two, all their work
                over the last year will have been to no avail. The situation in
                the South is totally different to what it is up here. I know
                that she is very conscious of the regionalisation system, but I

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In relation to a common enforcement policy
                North and South, I am very much aware of the need to co-ordinate
                our efforts throughout the island in order to ensure that we are
                not faced with similar difficulties again. I have, as Mr Savage
                will be aware, asked the vision group, or a sub-committee of the
                group, to look at the lessons to be learned. One of the things
                that they will be looking at is the need for the tightening up
                of legislation on ear tagging. I am in discussion with Minister
                Joe Walsh about those very issues, because they are looking at
                the same things. We will be co-ordinating our approach, because
                I think that that is important, and I take the point.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also take the point that horse racing is an
                important industry. I had a meeting last week with the industry

                be considering the matter this week, and at that point I will be

                shearing are causing welfare problems. The season is upon us,
                and it cannot wait. It also creates real risks, particularly for
                those farmers who no longer do their own shearing and have to
                bring in contract shearers. I do not have to spell out the risks
                of having contract shearers moving from farm to farm. I am
                reviewing the situation. My officials have been working on
                protocols. I hope to have the protocols in place by next
                Wednesday, so that sheep shearing can then begin in, I repeat,
                extreme welfare cases only because of the risk.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The protocols will be in place and will be in
                the farming papers, but where farmers are doing the shearing
                themselves, they will be given advice about the procedures to
                follow. Licensed contact shearers will be given very strict
                protocols about cleansing and disinfection when they move on to
                the next farm. However, I am aware that this is a very real
                problem; it is being reviewed, and I hope that it will be dealt
                with very soon.</p>

                I welcome the Minister’s statement and the news that the
                recent testing has proved negative. The Minister indicated that
                she and her officials do not know precisely how the disease got
                from Meigh to Ardboe, and that indicates that they are firm in
                the belief that the disease originated in Meigh. What evidence
                is there of that, and is there any evidence of where the
                outbreak in Antrim originated?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, is there any indication yet of when
                the marts will be reopened for sales? Although farm sales may be
                welcomed, there is a severe loss of business as a result of the
                closure of marts, and it does not benefit farmers to have to
                sell on a farm-to-farm basis. There is much greater benefit from
                selling in the mart scenario.</p>
                <b>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In relation to Meigh and Ardboe, I was simply
                making the point that we had one case in Meigh and that the next
                case was in Ardboe. I am not saying that there is a connection
                but rather that we have not been able to establish whether the
                disease came from Meigh to Ardboe and, if so, how. I am not
                making any assumptions except that illegal trading was clearly
                the cause of it. We have traced back all the possible legal
                traces, and it did not come from those sources. Members can draw
                their conclusions from that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In relation to marts, Members should
                understand that we have not completed serology testing, and even
                when we have completed it, we will not be in a position to know
                that we have dealt with the infection that is in the sheep
                flock. To reopen marts before we are sure of that would be
                taking too much of a risk.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I understand and recognise the difficulties,
                and that is why we are taking the step next Wednesday to allow
                farm-to-farm sales. I also understand that the owners of the
                marts are looking at other ways of facilitating sales, perhaps
                video sales, for instance. Certainly I am anxious to look at
                that as soon as it is possible to do so without risk, but, at
                present, we are quite a bit away from that.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I too welcome the Minister’s statement and
                the continuing efforts that she and her Department are making.
                The Minister referred to extending serology testing to all areas
                where sheep are traditionally kept. My understanding was that
                serology testing was to be extended to the whole of Northern
                Ireland, particularly in the light of what she has just said to
                Mr Conor Murphy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Can the Minister say whether this is indeed
                to happen and, if so, what is the anticipated timescale? Would
                it be possible to have any trade in sheep before the tests were
                completed? This could take until the autumn and would probably
                present major problems until then.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, with regard to a potential mass
                burial site, which we pray will not be needed, have any sites
                been identified yet, and should I believe the words of Sam
                Foster or David Burnside in that Nutt’s Corner is a possible
                location.</p>

                lowlands. We intend to get to all sheep flocks, because
                otherwise we could not be certain that we had dealt with all
                possible infection. That testing will take some time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In relation to a burial site, as the Member
                will be aware, the Executive decided that we need contingency
                plans for the worse-case scenario, and my Department was asked
                to employ a consultant to identify possible sites.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Work is in progress on that. I do not yet
                have a final report, but the Executive will discuss the matter
                this week. However, with regard to Nutt’s Corner, no burial

                Minister has permitted the movement of certain livestock in
                certain circumstances. What impact will that have on the
                movement of animals between England, Scotland, Wales and
                Northern Ireland and on cross-border movement? Is the Minister
                satisfied that the controls in place at ports, et cetera, are
                effective enough to ensure that the disease does not continue to

                Farmers are facing some practical problems. Following a cull
                they are left with meal, which in some cases is worth thousands
                of pounds. Will farmers receive compensation for that? Some
                farmers have also had to make workers redundant after a cull,
                and redundancy payments have had to be made. Will they be
                compensated for that?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">May I ask the Minister if there is any news
                about rate relief for the livestock market providers, given the
                redundancies that have occurred in those markets? Will they get
                rate relief? We do want the markets opened as a matter of
                urgency, but in the meantime can Members be assured that the
                livestock market owners will get financial relief?</p>

                Unfortunately, meal that has been left over comes into the realm
                of a consequential; it is not a direct result. However, the
                Department of Agriculture and Rural Development will pay for any
                meal that it has confiscated due to fear of contamination. As
                the Member will be aware, consequential compensation is being
                looked at on a national level, and I will ensure that Northern
                Ireland is not treated any less favourably than anywhere else in
                the United Kingdom.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The redundancy of some workers is an
                unfortunate consequence of the present terrible situation, and
                it is a matter for the Department for Social Development. That
                Department has made special arrangements to help people in such
                situations, and one person has been designated to deal with the
                farming community. People who have been made redundant will get
                some assistance from the Department for Social Development.</p>

                marts that have been put completely out of business. That matter
                is being looked at by the Department of Finance and Personnel,

                They have wisely postponed their meetings and have now obtained
                from the Jockey Club the dates of 1&nbsp;June and 2 June. Taking
                into account all the protocols they have put in place, it is
                imperative that the Minister give the green light to that event.
                Otherwise that company, the Maze company and much of the
                horse-breeding, rearing and training fraternity in the North

                farmers that their sheep would not be allowed onto the mountain,
                force majeure could not be used this year, as the sheep farmers
                were warned well in advance.</p>

                distress in the area with the loss of tourism and business. I am
                aware that there are animals in the vicinity and that that is
                the reason for the closure. Surely something can be done to
                alleviate this problem and get Gosford Forest Park reopened.</p>

                response to demands and concerns expressed by the industry. As I
                understand the situation, the factory concerned would not be
                able to take all of the cull sows. The opportunity exists to
                bring the cull sows to the factory or to put them into the
                welfare scheme. There is not much difference in price. The same
                price for the cull sow scheme is being paid in GB.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are susceptible animals in Gosford
                Forest Park, and that is the reason the park has not yet been
                opened. Above all, the Department has to be seen to be abiding
                by its own guidelines, and I will continue to be guided by the
                veterinary advice on that matter. I do recognise the problem,

                misunderstanding about that, I will be able to clear it up. I
                made the position clear at the industry meeting 10 days ago. The
                farmer does not pay the private vet, but the vet is paid
                directly by the Department on production of the necessary

                This means staying away from farm land and farm animals. I do
                not need to spell out that people traipsing from farm to farm
                would be extremely risky. I want to underline that, because

                there may be some candidates who are not as aware of the risks

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I too welcome the Minister’s statement and
                the good news about the tests on flocks in north Antrim, as will
                many people in that area. I understand that compensation has
                been paid for only 11,000 of the 46,000 animals that have been
                culled to date in Northern Ireland. Can the Minister explain
                what has caused the delay in paying three quarters of those who
                have lost animals?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I understand that 10,000 serology tests can
                be carried out per day. Is the Minister convinced that she has
                adequate resources to deal with the extensive serology testing
                required? How soon does she expect to have those tests
                completed?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, can she tell the House whether the
                Department of Agriculture and Rural Development has traced all
                the sheep that were unaccounted for at the beginning of this
                crisis — and which appear to lie at the heart of this disease
                — so that we can ensure that the disease does not spread any
                further? I also endorse the comments that have been made by
                several Members, right across the House, about the equestrian
                industry. I hope that special relief can be given to that
                industry so that those involved do not lose further income.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Mr Paisley Jnr for his question.
                There is no delay in the compensation payments. They are being
                processed, and they will be paid out as soon as that has been
                done. We have accounted for all of the sheep that came in the
                consignment that caused the initial concern.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They have all been accounted for and have
                been culled or had already been slaughtered in abattoirs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I cannot remember the other question.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When we initially began the serology testing,
                we clearly had to get up to speed. The problem was not the
                capacity to do 10,000 tests a day, but rather the capacity to
                take 10,000 blood samples a day. We have brought in private vets
                to help and are also bringing in other people in the Department
                who have expertise in taking bloods.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are almost at 10,000 tests a day. I am
                happy that we are able to deal with that number. Clearly it
                would be better if we could do 20,000 tests a day, but 10,000 a
                day are as much as we can deal with. Unfortunately, it will take
                a few weeks to finish the serology tests.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the cull sow scheme, which will
                alleviate many of the stock problems on the pig farms. It is
                very disappointing that the fixed amount is only £30 — again,
                somebody is making a great deal of money out of the farmers.
                However, it is very good news that the farmers have up to 30
                June to complete the IACS form.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the Minister consider letting beef
                cattle that would be over-30-months old before the 10 km area
                ban is lifted move to abattoirs on welfare grounds? I believe
                that her officials, and a meat plant, are in favour of that type

                Antrim, I echo the considerable sigh of relief following the
                news that there was not a further case of foot-and-mouth disease
                in the Ballycastle area.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I commend the Minister and her Department on
                the serology programme. I must say that processing 43,000 tests
                in a week is a very impressive figure — I trust that the
                testing is, indeed, robust. The Minister has pointed out that
                the testing may produce false positives, but I trust that it
                will not produce false negatives. The results of the testing so
                far seem to completely contradict the view of the rumour
                factory. That is a great relief, and I hope that that will
                continue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To what does the Minister attribute the

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does she consider that this resulted from the
                illegal movement of animals, and, if so, where did those animals
                come from?</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The results of blood tests so far confirm our
                suspicion that there is blatant infection in the sheep flock.
                Fifty-five cases recorded with the ELISA titres were sent to
                Pirbright, as they were inconclusive or false positives. Of
                those, three proved positive on the Pirbright test, which meant
                that although they did not have the disease, they had been
                exposed to it. In the case of one inconclusive result at
                Pirbright, we have restricted the herd and are clinically
                inspecting and resampling it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the three positive results
                that were found, one small flock of approximately 64&nbsp;sheep
                was culled, and the other two had already been culled under the
                precautionary measures. We are discovering that there is a
                danger in some cases, and we are getting to it little by little.
                I cannot answer the question about the Cushendall outbreak,
                because we have not reached its source. However, it is being
                investigated and followed up. In those cases we follow up all
                known connections with any other flocks or movements, but we can
                run into a blank wall. This is not necessarily the fault of the
                farmer concerned, but it can suggest that somewhere along the
                line there has been illegal movement. However, I cannot say at
                present.</p>

                to amendments 2, 3, 4 and 5.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Amendment 1 corrects an inaccurate reference
                to the legislation in Scotland dealing with the joint
                registration of births by unmarried parents. There has been some
                confusion about the appropriate sections of the Scottish
                legislation to which this Bill should refer.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Amendment 2 is a drafting amendment and is
                consequential to amendment 3. Although amendment 2 is a drafting
                amendment, it does not stand alone. Amendments 3 to 5 depend on
                amendment 2’s being passed. Amendment 3 is the only
                substantive amendment to clause 1.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It requires a court, when making an order
                under article 7 of the Children (Northern Ireland) Order 1995,
                to have specific regard to the best interests of the child. In
                particular, it requires the court to take account of the wishes
                and feelings of the child when making a parental responsibility
                order in favour of the child in respect of an unmarried father
                or a step-parent. This amendment flows from the Committee Stage
                of the Bill, and I am happy to take it forward.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Amendments 4 and 5 are, again, purely
                drafting and technical amendments following from amendment 3.
                They in no way alter the substance of the Bill. They reflect the
                way in which amendment 3 has been drafted.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Committee for Health,

                brought forward by the Minister in relation to the principle of
                the best interests of the child. I am particularly pleased that
                the Committee’s report on the Family Law Bill, which deals
                primarily with the acquisition of parental responsibility by
                unmarried fathers and step-parents, enjoys the unanimous support
                of the Committee. I thank all the members for their industry and
                commitment in considering the detailed and sometimes complex
                arguments in relation to this short but significant Bill.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On behalf of the Committee, I also extend my
                appreciation to the Committee for Finance and Personnel for its
                co-operation in affording us the opportunity of scrutinising the
                Bill, which makes appropriate amendments to the Children
                (Northern Ireland) Order 1995. The Committee further wishes to
                place on record its gratitude to the 16 individuals and
                organisations who provided such a high standard of detailed
                written and oral evidence.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill, although short and containing only
                five clauses, was widely accepted as significant but complex,
                and, in addressing three broad areas, it provoked a series of
                arguments relating to sometimes competing equality and human
                rights issues. It was with particular regard to the rights of
                the child that the Committee sought the amendments to clause 1
                that have been brought forward by the Minister. They basically
                reinforce article 3 of the 1995 Order, which states that courts
                must place paramount consideration on the best interests of the
                child when making a decision on its upbringing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill relates to three broad areas. First,
                it provides that an unmarried father who jointly registers the
                birth of his child with the child’s mother shall have parental
                responsibility for that child. It also provides for a step-
                parent to apply to a court for an order conferring parental
                responsibility on the step-parent in relation to a child of his
                or her spouse.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, the Bill creates a statutory
                presumption of paternity where a man was married to a child’s
                mother at any time between the child’s conception and birth,
                and where he has been registered as the child’s father in the
                Register of Births, Deaths and Marriages. In both cases, that
                parental responsibility may be terminated only by a court order.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thirdly, the Bill updates the law by enabling
                courts to direct the taking and testing of bodily samples to
                prove or disprove a child’s parentage. Currently, the courts
                are confined to directing the taking and testing of blood.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The backdrop to this Bill lies with the
                Government’s recognition of the changing patterns of family
                life. Fewer people are marrying, and increasing numbers are
                choosing to live together. In 1999, almost 7,000 children were
                born outside marriage in Northern Ireland, representing 30·3%
                of all live births. Of those, 4,487 — 64·5% — were jointly
                registered by the unmarried father and mother.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Under the 1995 Order, unmarried fathers can
                acquire parental responsibility for their child only by entering
                into a parental responsibility agreement with the mother of
                their child, or by obtaining an order from the court. However,
                the level of take-up through these mechanisms has been low. In
                1999, less than 200 parental responsibility orders were made in
                respect of unmarried fathers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nonetheless, it appears that that trend does
                not reflect unwillingness on the part of unmarried fathers to
                assume parental responsibility, given that substantial numbers
                of live births outside of marriage are registered jointly by the
                mother and father. As current legislation does not confer
                parental responsibility on the unmarried father who registers
                the birth of the child, the vast majority of unmarried fathers
                have no formal relationship with their children.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is, therefore, widely accepted that clause
                1 of the Bill is fraught with difficulty; it involves competing
                human rights and equality arguments. Some say that the Bill
                discriminates against unmarried fathers by not granting them
                automatic parental responsibility for their children. The
                Committee acknowledges that the rights of unmarried fathers are
                firmly embedded in the rights of children and mothers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In that context, the Committee had particular
                regard to the case of McMichael versus UK. The European Court of
                Human Rights found that the rights of an unmarried father were
                not infringed by the fact that he did not have parental
                responsibility. The court upheld the UK Government’s view that
                the non-automatic granting of parental rights to unmarried
                fathers was a justified interference in family life to protect
                the rights of mothers and children from unworthy or abusive
                fathers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Therefore, favouring a degree of caution, the
                Committee took the view that any differential treatment between
                parents on the basis of gender or marital status in articles 8
                and 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights was reasonably
                justifiable on the basis of the need for protection for mothers,
                fathers and children.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee was content with the provision
                in clause 1 for a step-parent to apply for a court order
                conferring parental responsibility for a child of his or her
                spouse. It accepts that in many second marriages a strong bond
                is built between a step-parent and a child who may have lost
                contact with the natural parent. From a practical perspective,
                for taking decisions with the other parent on the child’s
                education and welfare, it is important that a legal relationship
                be established between the step-parent and his or her new
                children.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The fact that the natural parents will
                continue to have parental responsibility and can alert the court
                to objections that they may have — objections that it must
                take on board — provides for fair representation and should
                help to guard against the absent natural parents being
                sidelined. The inclusion of the best interest test, for the
                court to consider when making an order to confer parental
                responsibility on the step-parent by way of the proposed
                amendment to clause 1, is most welcome. The rights of children
                lie at the heart of the Bill. Consequently, there is a clear
                duty to protect their best interests.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee is satisfied that the Bill
                provides a mechanism for the courts to divest unmarried fathers
                and step-parents of parental responsibility, which is viewed as
                a sensible safeguard to protect children and mothers from
                violence, abuse and intimidation. The Committee also considered
                the argument that the Bill should provide equally for married
                parents to lose parental responsibility where the circumstances
                warrant it. However, the Committee was satisfied with the
                current provision in such circumstances, whereby parental
                responsibility can be held additionally by the health and social
                services where it is felt that the child is suffering
                significant harm and will be taken into care.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee considered the arguments for
                the Bill to have retrospective effect but concluded that that
                could impose unfair obligations on the unmarried father who had
                not registered his children with the intention of securing
                parental responsibility. On the other hand, an unmarried father
                can avail of the existing procedure of entering into a parental
                responsibility agreement if he wants to establish a legal
                relationship with a child born prior to the commencement of the
                new legislation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several witnesses made compelling arguments
                for the acquisition of parental responsibility to be linked to
                the provision of emotional and practical care, direction and
                guidance to the child. Some proposed that the definition of
                parental responsibility in the Children (Northern Ireland) Order
                1995 be amended.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Mr Speaker in the Chair)</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although the Committee accepts the arguments
                against redefining parental responsibility, particularly because
                this would have effects outside the Family Law Bill, it strongly
                agrees with the many witnesses who stressed the importance of
                developing an effective, high-profile and widespread publicity
                campaign about its implications.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A public information document about how to
                obtain parental responsibility must be made available to all new
                parents, and the document must set out what parental
                responsibility entails in clear terms. The publicity campaign
                must place as strong an emphasis on rights and powers as it does
                on the duty to provide emotional care, direction and guidance
                for the child. The importance of showing respect and support to
                the mother should also be highlighted.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clause 2 is accepted as a sensible provision.
                It puts the common law presumption that a man who is married to
                a woman between the conception and birth of a child is the
                father of that child and the new legal presumption that any
                unmarried man who is registered as the father of a child is the
                father of the child on a statutory footing. The Committee was
                satisfied that the Bill provides for the presumption of
                paternity in both instances to be rebutted on the balance of
                probabilities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clause 3 is a welcome, technical measure that
                will provide the courts with additional powers to help determine
                the parentage of a child in a less invasive and distressing way.
                Existing mechanisms allow for blood samples to be taken only
                from the child or putative father. However, the new legislation
                will provide for courts to direct that bodily samples, such as
                saliva or hair, be taken for the purposes of scientific tests to
                determine parentage.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee was satisfied with the Office
                of Law Reform’s assurance that, under article 3 of the
                Children (Northern Ireland) Order 1995, a court shall have
                regard to the wishes and feelings of the child in relation to
                tests for determining parentage. Members were satisfied with the
                general principle that responsibility for the costs of
                determining parentage will be decided after the event. If a
                parent with care instigates proceedings to obtain a declaration
                of parentage and is successful, the absent parent who has
                disputed parentage will pay the costs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I commend the Bill, as amended , as a
                progressive and balanced piece of legislation that takes account
                of the rapidly changing basis on which people are choosing to
                live together by encouraging unmarried fathers to have
                meaningful and legal relationships with their children. The Bill
                sensibly seeks to recognise and accommodate changes in family
                structures. However, the Committee is satisfied that it contains
                safeguards to ensure that the rights of children are promoted
                and not compromised.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to say something to ensure that
                a precedent is not established here. The Chairperson referred
                not only to the matter under debate — the amendments to clause
                1 — but to a number of other clauses as well, for which he
                provided explanation and comment. This is a reasonably short
                Bill, and it was not necessarily an unreasonable thing to do at
                this juncture. However, it is important that it should not set a
                precedent. Chairpersons, when dealing with one clause, cannot,
                for instance, take into account the following 65 clauses that
                some more substantial Bills may have.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member referred to the Bill as amended. I
                have little doubt about what the House will do, but at this
                point it is not amended — he should have referred to the Bill
                as presented.</p>

                Durkan):</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome Dr Hendron’s comments on the
                amendments and some of his broader remarks. I am glad that he is
                able to record the Committee’s support for the amendments as
                well as for the broad purposes of the Bill. The Committee for
                Health, Social Services and Public Safety scrutinised this short
                but significant Bill thoroughly, and that thoroughness was
                reflected in Dr Hendron’s coverage of the issues that were of
                particular concern and interest to the Committee.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am grateful for the role that he and
                Committee members have played, and, like him and his Committee,
                I am grateful for the role of the Committee for Finance and
                Personnel in allowing scrutiny in this particular way. I welcome
                the fact that the Committee has been able to give the Bill some
                thought and that its thinking has facilitated some of the
                amendments before us. I am glad too that the good working
                relationship that I have previously acknowledged between the
                Office of Law Reform and the Committee for Finance and Personnel
                has been matched by the relationship between the Office of Law
                Reform and the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I refer to the draft code of practice on
                access to workers during recognition and derecognition ballots
                as the draft code. It was laid before the Assembly on 13 April
                2001 and is subject to the affirmative resolution procedure of
                the Assembly. I will provide background information for Members.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">From 8 March 2001, under the trade union
                recognition process, trade unions were given a statutory right
                to seek recognition for the purpose of conducting collective
                bargaining in the areas of pay, hours, holidays and other agreed
                matters. There is also a right for employers to seek
                derecognition of a trade union where the statutory acceptance
                criteria no longer apply. Where disputes arise about
                recognition, they may be referred for adjudication to the
                Industrial Court, the Northern Ireland body equivalent to the
                Central Arbitration Committee (CAC) in Great Britain.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The draft code corresponds closely with that
                in operation in Great Britain from June 2000. It is important to
                emphasise that that code only comes into play in limited
                circumstances, when the Industrial Court orders a ballot to be
                held. That would happen at the later stages of the adjudication
                process on trade union recognition. The court will give notice
                to both the employer and union that a ballot is to be held. The
                aim of the draft code is to provide practical guidance to both
                employers and employees about the issues that arise in such
                circumstances.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given the purpose of the legislation, focus
                is placed on the rights of unions and workers in relation to
                employers. However, it is important to appreciate that that
                rests on the presumption that a voluntary agreement should
                always be preferable. That presumption is demonstrable at every
                stage of the adjudication process and in the code of practice.
                It follows that unions and employers are expected to show good
                faith and act reasonably and responsibly throughout the process.
                If the question of recognition comes to be resolved by ballot,
                which implies at least some degree of impasse in resolving it,
                the draft code sets out how employers and trade unions are
                expected to conduct themselves before and during the ballot
                arrangements.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The code itself does not impose legal
                obligations, and failure to observe it does not, in itself,
                leave anyone open to legal proceedings. However, it is important
                to appreciate that provisions of the code are admissible in
                evidence, and are to be taken into account before any court,
                tribunal or, indeed, the Industrial Court itself, where
                considered relevant. It is also important to appreciate that
                full consultation has taken place in Northern Ireland on the
                code’s content. I understand that there is general and
                widespread acceptance of its provisions. The code itself has
                also been subject to some discussion and deliberation in the
                departmental Committee.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I commend the code to the Assembly.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for
                Higher and Further Education, Training and Employment (Mr
                Carrick):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members of the Committee are grateful that
                the Department consulted us on the draft code of practice,
                enabling us to examine it in detail and to highlight several
                concerns.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee notes that the code of practice
                should take effect only towards the end of a potentially lengthy
                adjudication process, based on the Employment Relations
                (Northern Ireland) Order 1999, which gives new rights,
                principally to workers and trade unions. However, there is also
                a right contained in the legislation for employers to seek
                derecognition of a trade union. Both the legislation and the
                code of practice presume that a voluntary agreement is always
                preferable. Unions and employers are expected to act reasonably
                and responsibly throughout the process. The Committee welcomes
                the fact, in the light of its response to the Minister, that
                that duty is now more explicitly stated in the code.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members also questioned where more guidance
                was needed in the code to cover situations when agreement cannot
                be reached on access to workers. We have noted the Minister’s
                response that a more prescriptive approach may be neither
                practicable nor successful in that area, given that individual
                circumstances are likely to be highly varied. We also note that
                the Industrial Court panel has been empowered to stipulate
                access provisions in such cases when necessary.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.30 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are also potential difficulties for
                employers when any multiple-union applications are made. We have
                noted that the industrial court will not accept competing
                applications on the presumption that it would not be appropriate
                for it to adjudicate on that matter, nor to become involved in
                inter-union disputes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Great Britain, the Trades Union Congress
                (TUC) has confirmed its commitment to resolving such inter-
                union issues before application stage. In Northern Ireland, the
                Northern Ireland Committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions
                (NIC-ICTU) expects to adopt a similar stance. Multi-union
                applications are very much the exception rather than the rule,
                and they are likely to remain so.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I approve of the principles contained in the
                code and note that an almost identical code of practice has been
                operating in Great Britain since June 2000. Very few cases have
                needed to proceed as far as a ballot, and there has been no
                indication of difficulties with the laid-down procedures.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department is aware that the code cannot
                be a static document and will need to keep pace with
                developments. The Minister has given a commitment that this area
                will be closely monitored over the coming months to ensure that
                the intention of the code is being delivered. The Higher and
                Further Education, Training and Employment Committee looks
                forward to receiving the results of that monitoring in the
                future and will be keen to ensure that the code of practice is
                operating effectively in Northern Ireland. I commend the motion
                to the House.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dallat:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion, and I thank the
                Minister for bringing it to the House. As indicated, the nature
                of the legislation dictates that it will come into force only in
                the very rare circumstances when voluntary agreements between
                employers and unions cannot be reached. One hopes that the
                voluntary route would be used more often. Indeed, that has been
                the case in Britain. The motion recognises the preference for
                voluntary settlements and facilitates that. However, it also
                sends an important message from the Assembly that it will, if
                necessary, empower the unions to have access to their members.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must not forget that the unions have
                played a key role in the development of labour relations and in
                the evolution of modern industry and commerce. We salute the
                work of the unions in many fields, which has transformed the
                rights of workers, not simply in terms of pay, but also in
                conditions of employment, health and safety and as partners in
                the development of successful businesses. Unions will continue
                to play a key role as we enter a new era, which is fraught with
                difficulty but also brings exciting challenges.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have concentrated in the Chamber recently
                on the issue of skill shortages in certain sectors. The
                Committee is currently looking at the relationship between
                industry and further education. These are good times for the
                economy — unemployment is at an all-time low, and there are
                many more people in employment in Northern Ireland than ever
                before. Nevertheless, progress brings with it problems — real
                problems in which the unions have a critical role to play.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, we must not forget the bad times.
                Just over 10 years ago, unemployment stood at more than 15%.
                Economic times were not so good, and industrial relations may
                not have been as good either. It is important that we bear that
                in mind when considering the motion.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Farren:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I express my thanks to the Members who have
                spoken, particularly those on the Committee for the
                consideration they have given to the code of practice and for
                the general support they have expressed for that. I have been
                pleased to take account of some of the comments that have come
                from Committee members, and those have been incorporated into
                the code. I want to emphasise that the code represents a further
                step in the strengthening of rights on both sides in the work
                place — the rights of employers and, significantly, the rights
                of people in the workforce and the rights of the trade union
                movement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In recent years, we have seen a series of
                measures adopted with respect to industrial relations and
                employment legislation that have sought to strengthen those
                rights. The code will be monitored, and I want to emphasise the
                voluntary approach to recognition and derecognition. The code
                will indicate how both sides should proceed on those rare
                occasions where the voluntary approach has not resulted in a
                positive outcome.</p>

                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I seek the Assembly’s approval for a set of
                regulations that support the New Deal pilot scheme for people
                aged 25 and over. There is a range of New Deal schemes. They are
                aimed at specific groups such as lone parents, disabled people
                and the younger long-term unemployed. These regulations are to
                specifically support a pilot scheme for unemployed people aged
                25 and over.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These pilot schemes are part of the
                welfare-to-work strategy and the efforts to tackle long-term
                unemployment. They have been operating in Northern Ireland since
                30 November 1998, testing a variety of innovative ways of
                helping unemployed people into work. They are aimed principally
                at those who have been unemployed for 18 months or more.
                However, there is provision for people unemployed for less than
                18 months and who face particular difficulties in returning to
                the labour market. The pilot schemes have provided individually
                tailored help designed to address barriers to work that had been
                identified, including lack of recent work experience and lack of
                relevant skills.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There were no new places on the New Deal
                pilot schemes after 21 March 2001. From 1 April new provision
                for the long-term unemployed was introduced across the United
                Kingdom under the enhanced New Deal for 25 plus. The new
                programme is designed to reflect the lessons learned from the
                pilot schemes, ensuring that a range of help is always available
                and investing more in advisors to enable them to provide
                continued support. The Department of Higher and Further
                Education, Training and Employment administers the pilot schemes
                and the enhanced New Deal for 25 plus.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To facilitate the operation of the New Deal
                pilots for 25 plus, changes were made to social security
                regulations. This ensured that people could participate in the
                pilot schemes while continuing to meet the conditions for
                receipt of jobseekers’ allowance, and also provided for
                sanctions for non-attendance under the programme. Under the
                provisions of the Jobseekers’ (Northern Ireland) Order 1995,
                the regulations underpinning New Deal pilot schemes can be in
                operation for only 12 months at a time, but they can be renewed
                as required.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They first came into operation on 29 November
                1998 and were renewed in November 1999. The regulations before
                us today renew the provisions that were already in place,
                enabling the pilots to continue for a further twelve months and
                to take people into the scheme until 31 March 2001. Entrants to
                the scheme up to that date may remain on that scheme for the
                full twelve-month period.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not propose to explain the detail of
                each individual regulation, but I shall, of course, be happy to
                respond to Members’ questions. The New Deal pilot regulations
                prescribe the categories of people who are required to
                participate in the New Deal pilots and the impact on their
                benefits of non-participation or leaving the programme without
                good cause. They also ensure that payments that participants may
                receive as part of the pilot, including top-up payments for
                childcare and self-employed earnings, will not affect their
                benefit.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The only substantive change from the earlier
                pilot regulations is that these regulations now define the date
                on which the last participant could join, which was 31 March
                2001. Technical changes reflect the introduction of joint claims
                to the jobseeker’s allowance from 19 March 2001 and the fact
                that some people could enter the pilots for a second time. I
                hope that this opening explanation has helped Members. I commend
                the regulations to the Assembly.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr ONeill:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I rise to lend my support. This House should
                be glad to give its support to the introduction of this
                Statutory Rule. However, the Minister might be able to clarify a
                couple of questions for me. Regulation 5 stipulates that a
                person may be penalised by losing out on benefits if he or she
                fails to participate without good cause. I was unable to
                ascertain the definition of &quot;good cause&quot;. I want the
                Minister to identify that, if possible.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will each case be judged on its own merits?
                How will that be measured? It may seem a small point, but these
                things can sometimes cause quite a lot of difficulty for people
                and their benefits.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Minister’s reference to
                childcare costs and people’s eligibility to continue to
                receive them. However, it appears from the Statutory Rule that
                this applies only to lone parents. What about couples? Is there
                any variation here? There have been some cases in the past where
                childcare allowance has been affected. For example, if it were
                established that a couple could access costs when one of the
                parents is on the New Deal pilot, the regulation would have to
                allow for childcare costs so as not to affect the job seeker’s
                allowance (JSA) of the second parent. That may sound difficult
                to absorb, but I hope that the Minister can pick it up.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Under regulation 15, will the payments be
                disregarded if another parent is on benefits? I would appreciate
                clarification of these small points today or when next possible.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The requirements of the programme are spelled
                out very clearly to participants at all stages. No one is
                sanctioned by accident. Sanctions are a direct result of things
                that people do or fail to do. Operations systems are in place to
                ensure that people are treated sensibly and fairly. The law
                provides for people to be able to demonstrate good cause and
                provides them with the right of appeal. With hardship payments
                to protect the most vulnerable, I think that the system as a
                whole just about strikes the right balance. It is not only firm
                but fair.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr ONeill has also raised a point to which I

                mbliana i gcomparáid le 47 mbliana tá céad bliain ó shin.
                Ach níl staid fhoriomlán ár sláinte go maith. Táimid oiread
                agus trí bliana chun deiridh ar an chuid is fearr de réigiúin
                na hEorpa; tá básanna den ghalar corónach croí beagnach dhá

                dóiche le bás a fháil roimh 65 ná gairmithe nó
                bainisteoirí. Tá páiste sa ghrúpa is lú toice 16 huaire

                sin na gcomhairlí is sláintiúla</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am delighted to have the opportunity to
                introduce this motion in the House today. Members will know that
                our average life expectancy now is longer than ever before —
                77 years, compared with 47 years a century ago. However, the
                overall state of our health is still not good. Compared with
                other regions in Europe we are as much as three years behind the
                best. Deaths from coronary heart disease are nearly double the
                European average. Our lung cancer death rate for women is
                already twice the average, and rising.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Death rates only give a broad overview. For
                everyone who dies from conditions such as I have mentioned —
                often after a long period of illness and disability — many
                more face enormous personal tragedies. The suffering extends to
                families, carers and friends. The annual costs of preventable
                disease and disability to the economy and the Health Service run
                into billions of pounds.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We know from medical research and the
                experiences of other countries that much of the death and
                suffering can be stopped. It can be stopped by advances in
                medicine and in the organisation and resourcing of care and
                treatment services, but, more importantly, it can be stopped
                through Government policies and programmes and by action across
                society. That is what the Executive have committed themselves to
                do.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members will be aware that there are
                substantial inequalities in the health status of different
                groups in the population here which are clearly linked to people’s
                social and economic circumstances. There is clear evidence that
                poverty is the biggest risk factor for health. The better off
                one is, the longer one can expect to live and the less likely
                one is to be ill or suffer from a chronic disease or disability.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That applies all the way up the class ladder.
                Average health prospects improve as one moves up the social
                gradient. The most affluent socio-economic group here live on
                average five years longer than the least affluent. Among men,
                unskilled workers are three times more likely to die before the
                age of 65 than professionals and managers. A child in the least
                affluent group is 16 times more likely to die as a result of a
                house fire, and five times more likely to be injured as a
                pedestrian, than a child from the top group.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Travellers and their health status are an
                extreme illustration of that point. Travellers’ life
                expectancy is almost 20 years less than that of the settled
                community here. A traveller child under 10 years is 10 times
                more likely to die than a settled child. Only 10% of travellers
                are over 40 years, and only 1% is over 65 years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The point can also be illustrated by
                location. Electoral wards with the worst deprivation also have
                the highest death rates. Two thousand premature deaths each year
                could be prevented if we could raise the health status of those
                living in the district councils with the worst rates to that of
                those of the healthiest.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although those facts have been neglected for
                many years, they should not surprise us. Poorer people have less
                money to spend on the physical sources of health such as food
                and comfortable housing, and their children are less likely to
                achieve the educational qualifications that are the key to their
                pulling themselves up the social ladder. They live and work in
                more difficult conditions; they have borne the brunt of the
                conflict, and they lead more stressful lives. They are excluded
                from the benefits of prosperity that the rest of us take for
                granted, and, in a culture that places so much emphasis on
                success and achievement, they are more likely to suffer from low
                self-esteem and to feel powerless and depressed. Those factors
                bear down on the same group of people, and the damage that they
                do to health is cumulative.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This health gap — the inequalities in
                health between rich and poor — is an affront to the principles
                of equality and social justice that unite us. Members cannot
                ignore that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For all the reasons that I have given, the
                Programme for Government recognises the need for major
                improvements in the health of our people. One of the Executive’s
                central priorities under the heading &quot;Working for a
                Healthier People&quot; is to focus on</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;reducing preventable disease,
                ill-health and health inequalities&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To achieve that, the Programme for Government
                commits the Executive to develop a cross-cutting public health
                strategy which maximises efforts to improve health and
                well-being and to reduce health inequalities across all sectors.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This holistic approach is vital if the
                Assembly is to bring about the improvements in health that need
                to be made. It is estimated that 70% of the factors that affect
                our health are outside the responsibility of the Health Service.
                The 30-year gain in average life expectancy over the last 100
                years has been achieved through improvements in areas such as
                education, pay and working conditions, housing, food safety,
                water supplies and waste management.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In July last year, the Executive agreed that
                as Minister for Health, Social Services and Public Safety, I
                should take the lead in drawing up a new public health strategy
                to realise the commitments in the Programme for Government. The
                Executive agreed that all Departments would work closely
                together to ensure success.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a first step, I re-established the
                ministerial group for public health, of which I am chairperson.
                The group is made up of senior officials from all Departments.
                Through this group, each Department is making its contribution
                to making the strategy work. Each member of the group will
                assume responsibility for taking forward action in his or her
                Department.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Last November, the group launched its
                consultation document. It set out the Executive’s proposals
                for the new approach and invites all interested parties —
                which means everyone — to comment on them. We decided to call
                the process ‘Investing for Health’, because we recognised
                that by making a little extra effort now we would be able to
                secure substantial health gains in the future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The purpose of ‘Investing for Health’ is
                twofold. First, to improve the health of our people by bringing
                our health standards up to at least those of the best regions in
                Europe. Secondly, to reduce the inequalities in living and
                working conditions that cause ill health by raising the status
                of those with the worst health to the level of those with the
                best.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">‘Investing for Health’ addresses the
                wider social determinants of health. It aims to improve health
                by improving social and economic conditions, living and working
                environments and people’s ability to cope with difficult
                circumstances. It complements and reinforces the work of other
                cross-departmental initiatives, including the action we are
                taking to ensure equality across the groups identified in
                section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 and the new
                targeting social need initiative.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">‘Investing for Health’ will succeed only
                if it engages energies across the community, including the
                general public. For this reason, we have initiated an unusually
                wide-ranging consultation process. As well as inviting written
                responses to the document, we are seeking to engage individuals
                and groups who may have had difficulty in making their voices
                heard. Often, these are the very people who experience the worst
                health, and it is by helping them that the most improvement
                stands to be gained. To this end, we have designed and are
                running the consultation project in partnership with a
                federation of voluntary and community organisations, the
                community development and health network. We are keen to hear
                the views of as many people as possible about what affects their
                health, what can be done to make it better, who needs to take
                those actions and how they will work together.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My officials have recently given
                presentations on ‘Investing for Health’ to a number of
                Assembly Committees. I see those meetings and today’s debate
                as a very important part of the ongoing process of ‘Investing
                for Health’. The consultation process will continue until 31
                May. We extended it from 10 April due to the impact of
                foot-and-mouth disease on public meetings, particularly in rural
                areas. We will make announcements on the outcome of the strategy
                later in the year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">‘Investing for Health’ is a continuing,
                long-term project and process. There is much to be done, and
                priority areas for action need to be identified. Overall, the
                consultation document focuses on poverty and inequality, since
                poor people suffer the worst health. Beyond this, we propose
                three priority groups for action: the very young, to ensure that
                babies and young children get the best start in life; children
                and young people, to equip them with the knowledge, skills and
                self-esteem to make responsible choices in their lives; and
                older people, both to extend life and to improve the quality of
                life in those added years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">‘Investing for Health’ also proposes that
                action should be organised around settings where people spend
                much of their time, such as homes, schools, workplaces and
                communities. The document suggests seven priority topics,
                factors which we know contribute substantially to death and
                illness. For each of those topics we know that properly
                resourced and effectively organised action can produce results.
                We recognise that transforming ‘Investing for Health’ from a
                vision to a reality will be a challenge. The document sets out
                areas where action is required to ensure success.</p>

                activities have important implications for health, we are
                putting proposals together for assessing the health impacts of
                new policies and programmes. That will enable us to minimise
                their health risks and maximise their health benefits.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have also proposed that four health and
                social services boards should lead local ‘Investing for Health’
                partnerships. These would draw together the key interests in
                each of their areas. There are already good examples of such a
                partnership approach in the health action zones and, at local
                level, in healthy living centres. We intend to build on the best
                of existing good practice.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">‘Investing for Health’ sets out an
                important and challenging agenda for action. It is a great
                opportunity for all of us to work together to make real
                improvements in the health of our people. It provides the
                Administration with an excellent opportunity to promote the
                public interest by breaking down the barriers to co-operation
                between Departments and their agencies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am delighted to take this opportunity to
                pay tribute to the officials from all the Departments on the
                ministerial group, which has already shown enthusiasm in working
                together on the new approach. I look forward to hearing Members’
                views during the debate, and I assure them that these will be
                considered carefully. I ask Members to join us in carrying
                forward this approach and to support the motion.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for
                Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mr Gallagher):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion, and I am sure that none
                here could disagree with its content. However, it remains to be
                seen whether there will be the strong commitment and necessary
                resources from all Departments. We look forward to next year’s
                report on the targets and how they have been met.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Programme for Government makes a
                commitment to raising the quality of the Health Service and
                tackling issues of poor performance. As we discuss this motion,
                we are all embarking on consultation on the issue of primary
                care and awaiting the report of the review group on the acute
                hospital service. We hope that it will be possible to put in
                place measures that will deliver a better primary care service
                to patients and take a greater variety of health care closer to
                people on the ground.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In relation to the review of acute hospital
                services, we know that our waiting lists are the worst in the
                UK, and they continue to increase. There are a variety of issues
                surrounding waiting lists, not least the odd situation that some
                hospital units lie vacant while others are working above
                capacity. That is exerting a particular kind of pressure. On the
                other hand, some hospital units have spare capacity but are
                unable to increase the intake of patients due to lack of money
                for specialist staff. The Health Committee will be looking at
                issues like that when we measure the targets in the Programme
                for Government a year from now.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another concern is what the Minister referred
                to as &quot;equality of access&quot;. That is a major issue,
                whether it relates to access to GP facilities, accident and
                emergency facilities, surgery or any other service. It should be
                the policy and practice of all Government Departments to ensure
                that all members of the community have equal access and fair
                treatment. That applies to the activities of the Department of
                Health, Social Services and Public Safety in particular.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The unacceptably high levels of unfit housing
                have been mentioned in debates on the Programme for Government.
                Everyone knows that there is a direct link between the quality
                of housing and the quality of an individual’s health. Levels
                of unfit housing are still too high in rural areas, especially
                in the west of the Province. People are living in appalling
                conditions in those houses. At the same time, because of the
                legislation on closing orders, those people are being told that
                they should not be living in those houses and by doing so, they
                are breaking the law. Given these serious health and human
                rights issues, the legislation on closing orders must be given a
                high priority.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are also awaiting a report on the
                Ambulance Service. Throughout the North of Ireland, especially
                in rural areas, there is a great deal of dissatisfaction with
                the present service. I welcome the commitment in the Programme
                for Government for an improved ambulance service, and that is a
                key area that must be addressed in the coming year. Members of
                the Health, Social Services and Public Safety Committee would
                also like to see a much improved level of service as quickly as
                possible.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are many concerns about general health,
                and many recent reports will have been brought to the attention
                of Members. Cases of TB are on the increase. Many parents have
                voiced concerns about the safety of immunisation. We need a
                campaign to address those concerns about immunisation. Once they
                have been discussed, we must send out a positive message and
                make clear to parents the need to immunise their children and
                the inherent benefits.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issue of men’s health has previously
                been discussed in the House. A seminar on men’s health is due
                to be held in the Long Gallery on 12 June, and that should be of
                interest to all Members. Twice as many women as men live beyond
                the age of 75, a fact that requires further work and
                investigation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Programme for Government contains a
                welcome commitment for additional occupational therapy staff.
                The figure is quite specific: the aim is to have 20 additional
                staff within the next year. It is hoped that that will happen,
                but there is still a major problem. We must ensure that action
                continues for a number of years to decrease radically the
                waiting times for housing adaptations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recent reports remind us that smoking is on
                the increase, particularly among young girls. That brings us to
                other health matters, such as young mothers and the risks of
                smoking during pregnancy. We must address smoking more
                effectively to turn around this increase.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Adamson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I commend this motion. Belfast is one of many
                European cities struggling with the concept of integrative
                planning for health development. A number of issues and
                developments in the city have combined to have a major impact on
                the population’s health. The consultation process on ‘Towards
                a City Health Plan’ produced in June&nbsp;1998 resulted in the
                identification of four broad themes and provided the opportunity
                for a common framework for strategic planning to respond to the
                health concerns of the citizens of Belfast. These themes were
                outlined in the ‘Belfast Healthy Cities Annual Report’ of
                1999 and included the following strategic aims: to improve
                public transport provision in a co-ordinated approach to
                planning in the city of Belfast; to develop a comprehensive
                integrated information system to increase citizens’
                accessibility to information and increase a sharing of
                information between the public sector bodies in Belfast; to
                provide the people of Belfast with opportunities for lifelong
                learning, increasing participation from disadvantaged
                communities in the formal education system and responding to
                local learning needs; and to improve the mental well-being of
                the citizens of Belfast with an increase in counselling services
                for the well-being and improvement of those with mental health
                problems.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The key role of the Belfast healthy cities
                programme was to facilitate the establishment of intersectoral
                strategic planning groups to support the development of
                integrated planning on all these themes. It has been the most
                difficult stage of the process to date, struggling with complex
                issues and with structures in the city which create barriers to
                integrated planning. There has, however, been real progress with
                two of the strategic planning groups — communication and
                integrated information and mental well-being.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Belfast healthy cities programme has had a
                major impact on the way in which organisations and individuals
                think about health. Direct links are now being made between
                health and transport and information and education, to name but
                a few. The key task for healthy cities over the years has been
                to facilitate the establishment of intersectoral strategic
                planning groups to begin a process of developing integrated
                plans for health. It is an ambitious task but one which Belfast
                healthy cities has endeavoured to take forward. Many challenges
                and barriers have been, and will continue to be, encountered
                along the way. The concept of partnerships for health led by the
                World Health Organisation’s healthy cities project implies a
                common goal and vision and requires new skills, new structures
                and a major shift in cultures and traditions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the Minister so eloquently stated, the new
                Administration here provides a real opportunity to make a
                radical move towards the lateral interdepartmental thinking
                which would enhance the climate in Belfast and Northern Ireland
                as a whole within public sector bodies to develop visible
                joined-up plans and address the fundamental social injustice and
                inequalities of health. The steps taken by Belfast healthy
                cities are early developments in that process. It has been a new
                learning experience for the individuals involved, and it has
                brought with it a mixture of creativity, innovation and the
                inevitable frustration. A change in the strategic direction of
                the organisation resulting in an evaluation and Belfast’s
                redesignation to the third phase of the World Health
                Organisation’s European healthy cities have resulted in a
                draft three-year strategic plan entitled ‘Integrative Planning
                for Health Development 2000-03’, which is also available for
                comment.</p>

                meetings, with participation for the first time by politicians
                and a number of new organisations from the city. Significant
                progress is also being made in the mentoring of Bosnian cities,
                and Belfast will continue to support the establishment of a
                healthy cities network in Bosnia and throughout Europe.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister for Social Development (Mr
                Morrow):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to
                this important debate. It is clear that my Department’s
                responsibilities impact extensively on health and issues of
                well-being. It has a key role in targeting social need by
                tackling disadvantage, improving housing, delivering social
                security benefits, providing child support services,
                strengthening and developing the community infrastructure and
                regenerating the most disadvantaged urban neighbourhoods.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall outline some of the important work of
                my Department. We will consult on comprehensive strategies to
                address the problems of multiple disadvantage in urban areas.
                The strategies will target action in the most disadvantaged
                neighbourhoods and establish new neighbourhood structures as
                partnerships of the community, voluntary, private and public
                sectors. They will seek to commit the Government to long-term
                support for neighbourhood regeneration and support action to
                improve long-term health prospects.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A prerequisite for meaningful neighbourhood
                regeneration is the strengthening of local communities. We
                propose to do this — particularly in the most disadvantaged
                areas — by building a sense of community, encouraging and
                supporting all forms of community development, strengthening
                areas with the weakest community infrastructure and introducing
                community support plans through district councils to underpin
                the work of local voluntary and community groups.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am pleased to say that in addition to
                proposals for new strategies, my Department has for many years
                been active in dealing with health-related issues in
                disadvantaged areas, particularly in Belfast and Londonderry.
                Good and effective working relationships have been developed
                with the relevant health boards on a range of programmes and
                initiatives, from a focus on disability through child- related
                early-years programmes to the health needs of minority groups.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members of the Assembly will know that
                providing decent, affordable housing enhances good health and
                well-being. This has an important role to play in building
                communities and tackling social exclusion. Research tells us
                that deprivation is predominantly concentrated in Belfast, the
                west, Newry and Mourne and Moy. That is why programmes such as
                new TSN have sought to promote an integrated approach to
                tackling the needs of these communities. The improvement of
                public and private sector housing and the renewal of run-down
                estates are recognised as part of the programme. Northern
                Ireland has a good story to tell in this respect. Only 2·4% —
                and I emphasise that figure in relation to some things which
                have been said today — of Northern Ireland Housing Executive
                stock is classed as unfit, compared to 7·3% in England and
                Wales.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must not, however, rest on our laurels.
                Further investment is required to eliminate unfitness and to
                avoid its recurrence. Getting the necessary resources is crucial
                to success. When lobbying for additional funds last year, I was
                particularly pleased to secure £8·5 million for the housing
                budget. Without that, a number of important programmes, such as
                disabled adaptations, would have had to be reduced. That would
                have affected the standard of living of the most vulnerable
                members of the community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Having a decent home is one thing. Heating it
                is equally important. Reducing fuel poverty is a key priority
                for my Department. Fuel poverty — the inability to afford to
                adequately heat a home — is a terrible blight on society.
                Living in cold homes can damage people’s quality of life and
                health, as well as imposing wider costs on the community. While
                the risks from cold-related ill health apply to all people,
                groups such as older householders, families with young children,
                disabled people and those with a long-term illness and on low
                incomes are especially vulnerable, particularly when they have
                to spend long periods of the day — if not all day — at home.
                That is totally unacceptable. Therefore I am dedicated to
                bringing fuel poverty to an end.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have taken the important step of
                introducing a new home energy efficiency grant scheme called
                Warm Homes. Starting in July, the high-risk groups that I
                mentioned earlier will have insulation and central heating
                installed in their homes to improve the home’s heating. The
                concept is being piloted in parts of Northern Ireland and has
                already proven successful, with considerable improvements in
                comfort levels and reductions in fuel bills for the most needy.
                I commend the Warm Homes scheme as a sign of my commitment to
                promoting good health, well-being and social inclusion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In many respects, good housing is the
                keystone for addressing many social problems. A good house
                provides peace of mind, contributing to the overall sense of
                well-being and creating a feel-good factor. Nowhere are the
                links between housing and health more obvious than in the
                travelling community. Their living conditions contribute to poor
                health, low life expectancy and a higher than average infant
                mortality rate. Their children stand more chance of being
                hospitalised with minor illnesses than children in the settled
                community do. My Department is addressing that problem by
                providing travellers with the type of accommodation that they
                need. At the moment, it concentrates its efforts on travellers
                who require bricks and mortar accommodation in either settled
                estates or in group housing schemes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A new housing Bill will extend my Department’s
                role, as it includes provision to transfer responsibility for
                providing and managing sites for travellers in mobile home
                accommodation to the Executive. Many of those sites will require
                work to bring them up to an acceptable standard. They will also
                need a continuing supply of finance to fund routine maintenance.
                If the Programme for Government is serious about reducing
                inequalities in the health status of different groups, my
                Department must be given additional resources so that it can
                speed up that process, make progress on group housing and be
                ready to take over permanent sites.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Getting financial help to those who most need
                it through the social security system is another vital element
                in ensuring a good standard of health in the community. My
                Department is taking the lead by implementing a major programme
                of change and improvement to the welfare and labour market
                services in Northern Ireland. The welfare reform and
                modernisation programme will continue to improve the health and
                well-being of our citizens in three ways: by providing clear and
                accessible gateways to benefit and labour market services for
                all; by tackling potential child poverty; and by helping the
                disabled to get the support that they need to lead a fulfilling
                life with dignity.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The reform of the child support scheme, to be
                introduced by April 2002, will provide prompt and accurate
                assessments of maintenance. It will introduce improved
                arrangements for the regular and reliable collection of that
                maintenance and its payment to the parent. The new system will
                be easier for clients and staff to understand. It will be
                transparent, responsive and accessible. It will get money to
                children more quickly and will be easier to enforce. The new
                scheme calls for a radical change in culture, service and
                approach. Maintenance assessments will be calculated accurately
                in days. Money will flow to parents and children within weeks,
                and defaulters will be pursued quickly and effectively. The
                introduction of those reforms will provide direct support to
                families to ensure that children are raised with an equal level
                of financial security regardless of whether their parents work
                and fulfil their responsibilities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Old people are among the most vulnerable in
                society. A major reform of the pension system will see improved
                advice and support services for pensioners. Steps will be taken
                to ensure that pensioners receive the support that they are
                entitled to in the minimum income guarantee. To prevent people
                becoming dependent after retirement and to help them make
                provision for the future, simplified processes and incentives
                will be used to encourage working people of low to medium income
                to build up an adequate pension. The New Deal project will
                develop measures to assist those with disabilities or
                long-standing illnesses who are currently dependent on benefit
                to move into training or work. It is accepted that continuing
                unemployment can have a detrimental effect on health and
                well-being.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are important developments at the
                delivery end of the social security system, and the ONE service,
                which we will be piloting from 14 May 2001 in Dungannon, is a
                practical example of a joined-up Government in action. This
                service will combine welfare services that are provided by a
                number of agencies including the Training and Employment Agency,
                the Child Support Agency, the Northern Ireland Housing
                Executive, the Rates Collection Agency and the Inland Revenue,
                as well as the Social Security Agency. It will offer a single
                point of entry to the welfare system for people of working age
                and will provide help and advice on work, training and the
                benefit system, linking work-focused interviews to the claims
                process.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another innovation is the partnership between
                the private sector and the Social Security Agency which aims to
                revolutionise benefit processing. The 10-year contract between
                the agency and private sector construction businesses is
                designed to deliver new telephone and technology solutions and
                better information management. The transformation of the three
                disability benefits — disability living allowance, attendance
                allowance and invalid care allowance — will begin in the
                autumn and will be fully implemented by March 2002. Plans will
                then be developed to introduce similar improvements to
                incapacity benefits.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The extensive and challenging programme that
                I have outlined demonstrates both my commitment and that of my
                Department to alleviating the problems caused by poor health
                standards. It is my intention that my Department will continue
                to play a full and useful role in this area, together with other
                Departments.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I remind the House that we must move to
                Question Time at 2.30 pm. If Mr Hutchinson has not finished
                speaking at that time, he will be recalled at the beginning of
                the next section of debate.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr B Hutchinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion, especially after
                hearing what the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public
                Safety and the Minister for Social Development had to say. What
                they have said proves that when people have control and can make
                decisions for their own areas, the right decisions can be made
                for Northern Ireland. I had some difficulty with the wording of
                the motion. As a Whip, I am entitled to attend Business
                Committee meetings. Last week I pointed out that it was not
                clear that the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public
                Safety was talking about investment in health. Neither the
                representative from the Executive nor one of her Whips could
                confirm that that was what she was talking about. However, in
                her speech, she did say that she was talking about investment in
                health.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is great that we can begin to talk about
                joined-up Government, the Programme for Government and the way
                that we spend money. There are a number of layers in the
                structure of the Health Service; these include trusts and
                boards. Too much money is spent on managing health when it
                should be spent on administering health. We need to make speedy
                decisions on how to move forward in health provision and on how
                to cut out the bureaucracy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister for Social Development
                understands the connection between life expectancy and standards
                of working conditions, housing, education, waste management and
                water supply. These are the problems in his Department which
                impact on health. I am pleased that he has recognised the need
                to do something about health problems. The Minister made it
                clear that he could not address the problems without additional
                resources. We all know that those resources are needed, and it
                is up to us to find them. One way to do that is by restructuring
                the Health Service and cutting out all of the bureaucracy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Elderly people are put into different
                brackets. For example, one bracket would cover people aged 60 to
                69. However, people are put into those brackets up until the age
                of about 90. The amount of money spent on elderly people
                increases for each bracket. I think it was the Minister of
                Health, Social Services and Public Safety who spoke about
                inequalities caused by social background.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.30 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is nonsensical to spend £1 on
                sixty-year-olds in north or west Belfast and the same amount on
                people in north Down, although I know that there are areas of
                disadvantage in north Down — I could name a number of estates
                in Bangor where people are totally disadvantaged. The life
                expectancy of people on the Shankill, the Falls, the Oldpark
                Road or the New Lodge Road is shorter than that of people who
                are well off. We must turn the formula around and spend £5 on
                people in those areas at a very early age, reducing it to £1 as
                they get older.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must look at how we actually spend the
                money. Instead of dividing it among electoral constituencies, we
                need to ensure that we actually spend it on those people who are
                disadvantaged and who have reached old age having grown up in a
                disadvantaged situation. We need to turn the situation around.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, there is no provision for young
                people under the age of 18 with mental health problems in north
                and west Belfast, because there is no money. The Minister must
                look at that.</p>

              The first consultation has begun and will continue until early
              August. This intial consultation will address the scope of, and
              the general issues covered in, the proposed Bill. The second phase
              will take place next year. That consultation will address the

              for written comment. I am content that the consultation process

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Deputy First Minister have any idea
              how we escape a mindset whereby we do not consider people’s
              needs until we pigeonhole them and put them into a group? Should
              not equality be as much about individuals as it is about groups?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is a very pertinent observation. The
              reality is that most interest groups in Northern Ireland do
              coalesce. They form groups, and it is the obligation of the
              Administration to consult with those groups. However, any
              individual can make either a written or a verbal submission to the
              consultation. We would welcome the freshness of an approach such
              as that recommended by the Member.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To what extent will the Single Equality Bill
              strengthen our existing equality laws?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The consultation document on the Single
              Equality Bill makes clear that we are committed to promoting best
              practice in equality of opportunity and human rights. The Single
              Equality Bill will not involve a reduction in the protection
              offered by current laws. Rather, it is designed to build on
              existing equality legislation in preventing discrimination and
              promoting equality of opportunity for everyone in our society. We
              will do everything we can to ensure equality of opportunity, and
              the Bill will undergo the strictest scrutiny to ensure that that
              happens.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It will also help us to harmonise, as far as
              practical, all existing anti-discrimination legislation. As no
              reduction in the level of protection is being contemplated,
              harmonisation, in many cases, should strengthen the existing laws.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill will also implement new European
              Directives on equality. This will necessarily involve
              strengthening our laws, in many respects, to prohibit
              discrimination on the grounds of age and sexual orientation. In
              addition, the Bill will allow us to consider other recent
              developments in Britain, Northern Ireland and the South of
              Ireland. Again, this is likely to strengthen the legislation.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, obviously the British /Irish Council
              would be a more appropriate vehicle than the North/South
              Ministerial Council for dealing with discharges into the Irish Sea
              in Cumbria, although an opportunity to discuss the matter will
              arise at the next meeting.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So far, no discussions have taken place at
              North/ South Ministerial Council meetings about the disposal of
              blood and liquid waste from foot-and-mouth carcasses into the
              Irish Sea from the Great Orton burial site. The treatment and
              disposal of such waste in England is a matter for the Ministry of
              Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, so that matter too would seem to
              be more appropriate for discussion in the British/Irish Council.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Environment Agency advises the Ministry of
              Agriculture, Fisheries and Food on the environmentally safe
              disposal of these liquid wastes. Officials in our Department of
              the Environment have been advised by the Environment Agency that
              liquid wastes from the Great Orton burial site are collected and
              treated to eliminate the risk of spreading the foot-and-mouth
              virus. We are told that the waste is taken by tanker to
              waste-water treatment sites at Workington and that the treated
              liquid is discharged into the sea through a three-kilometre
              outfall, which is subject to computer modelling for its
              effectiveness in dispersal. I further understand that the
              Environment Agency regularly samples the discharge to ensure that
              there is no adverse environmental impact.</p>

              these instruments of genocide of the Ulster Protestant population.
              Surely those weapons are detrimental to the environment. Perhaps
              this is another way for the First Minister to boost the SDLP.</p>

              11 in total — only one has any problem meeting the water

              that is needed. I believe that the entire Assembly will join with
              me in condemning the unwarranted attacks on young Australian
              tourists. It is an isolated event, but it is appalling that our
              tourist industry, having already been hit by foot-and- mouth
              disease, should have a further black mark against it at this time.
              I take this opportunity, in the context of the question, to say to
              people visiting Northern Ireland that they will find a welcome and
              a great generosity here. That should not be distorted by those
              actions.</p>

              anytime now, assuming that our summer is not over already — and
              will be taken forward under the chairmanship of Dr Jeremy Harbison.
              It has lengthy terms of reference, from which I shall specify
              three key points: to review the background to and the development
              of existing community relations policy; to identify the aims and
              objectives of existing community relations policy and the policy
              instruments used to achieve them; to examine, in the light of
              relevant developments, the recently completed evaluations of the
              district council community relations programme and the Community
              Relations Council, and to decide whether the aims of community
              relations policy remain appropriate, and whether changes to

              will continue to do so. Perhaps the needs of 2001 are different

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In March 1999, the Prime Minister set a target
              of halving child poverty in the United Kingdom in 10 years and
              eradicating it in 20 years. As well as benefiting from national
              initiatives designed to achieve that target — for example, the
              introduction of the new children’s tax credit — the Executive
              are committed to playing their role in meeting the Prime Minister’s
              target. Our Programme for Government makes clear our commitment to
              combating social exclusion and poverty, with a particular emphasis
              on children.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The children’s fund is one of a range of
              initiatives that will help tackle child poverty. Its principal
              objective is to provide support for children in need and for young
              people at risk. The Executive are making £29 million available
              over the three years to March 2004 for the children’s fund. That
              compares favourably with the amounts allocated to the Chancellor’s
              children’s fund.</p>
              <b>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am glad that the allocation from the
              Executive programme funds is significantly better than the
              Chancellor’s initiative. Does the First Minister agree that the
              operation of the Barnett formula is a major issue? The formula
              should be revised to a needs-based system, so that when the
              regions of England complain about getting inadequate funding, this
              Executive can ensure that such funding is not taken away from
              Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with the Member to some extent. There
              is much ill-informed comment about the Barnett formula, including
              the piece by William Rees-Mogg in ‘The Times’ this morning.
              Clearly, he does not understand the nature of the formula. I agree
              that we should consider needs. We pay the same taxes as other
              citizens of the United Kingdom, and we are entitled to the same
              quality of service. We should receive sufficient funding to
              deliver that quality of service, even if that means more money
              here or less money there.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must consider the issue of needs, in
              particular, very carefully, before rushing into a review. The
              review must be managed properly and to our benefit. When I said
              that our children’s fund compared favourably with the Chancellor’s
              fund, I meant, of course, that it compared well on a per capita
              basis.</p>

              targeted on the sectors in which poverty exists. Every policy
              should take into account all relevant considerations. The
              information that is available through New TSN criteria will be
              taken into account as appropriate. However, I must emphasise that
              child poverty is largely dealt with through the tax system; the
              Chancellor’s child tax credit is a key way of doing that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Child poverty is also a reflection of adult
              poverty. The best way of tackling that is to get people into good,
              well-paid employment. In that — as well as in a whole host of

              interested in the provision of gas, not just to the north-west,

              keeping in close contact with his counterpart in the Republic,
              because there is value in having a North/South link on this and on
              other measures that would open up and liberalise the energy market
              generally. If, in the course of doing that, key projects or key
              ways arise as matters of Government expenditure, then we will look

              road between the Portaferry Road and the Comber Road is phase one
              of the Newtonards southern relief road scheme. The scheme is not
              included in the Department’s major works preparation pool, but
              it is currently being considered for inclusion in the 10-year
              forward planning schedule. I hope to announce details of that
              schedule later this year. At present I am unable to confirm a
              start date for phase one of the scheme.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The response is not what we wished for. Will
              the Minister advise us about the road traffic surveys that have
              been carried out in the area over the past few months? They
              indicate that there is a large amount of traffic using that road
              junction, and the long queues of traffic each day confirm that.
              Would it not be appropriate to bring forward the link road in the
              light of the chronic congestion at the junction?</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I understand the concern, but I am not in a
              position to announce the commencement of the scheme. I understand
              the frustration felt in many areas, including the area in
              Strangford that the Member referred to and other areas for which
              schemes have been shelved because of lack of funds. I find it
              harder to understand how criticism can be levelled when there is
              an announcement for a scheme, and that seems to have occurred on
              some occasions. There is a case for this scheme, but that applies
              to many other schemes, and the limited resources available to me
              mean that we have to prioritise them.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The scheme is currently being considered for
              the forward planning schedule. I can advise the Member that phases
              1 and 2, at present day prices, will cost in excess of £2·7
              million.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister’s reply will come as a great
              disappointment to the people of Newtownards and the surrounding
              district when he begins to talk about a 10-year programme. Ards
              cannot wait that long for this necessary link road. I ask the
              Minister to reconsider his answer. He must recall that five years
              ago this road was originally in the five-year programme and was
              then dropped by some of the direct rule Ministers in favour of the
              Newry bypass. We now ask our new devolved Minister to start giving
              priority to important towns such as Newtownards and to reinstate
              this road as a matter of priority.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Member, and it is good to see him
              back in the Chamber. I have no difficulty in accepting that people
              want to see schemes put into place. Local representatives will
              campaign, pressurise, and lobby to get schemes put into place, and
              that is why they are elected. Some do so more consistently than
              others.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My job is to ensure that the maximum amount of
              resources is available to carry out the greatest number of schemes
              possible. Where demand exceeds resources then there has to be some
              prioritising. The 10-year forward planning schedule applies to all
              road schemes throughout Northern Ireland that are presently not in
              the major works preparation pool.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was my immediate predecessor, Mr Peter
              Robinson, who put the major works preparation pool into place,
              which permitted us to get so many schemes so far advanced. I am
              endeavouring to further those schemes and to get additional
              resources so that we can put more schemes into the major works
              preparation pool and into the construction programme, so that they
              are completed as fast as humanly possible.</p>

              on the agenda for many’s a year.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister for visiting Comber last
              week. Had we thought quickly enough, he might have visited this
              particular area then, because there was a one-way system operating
              in Court Street, and Newtownards was completely blocked off. He
              would have seen at first hand what we have to endure. I urge the
              Minister to go back to his officials. This is delaying the
              redevelopment of that part of Newtownards.</p>

              Comber, and I was happy to respond. I have been going to Comber on
              a regular basis for the past few weeks. It is easier to respond
              when I am invited than when I am not, but that is another issue. I
              will take on board the matter that the Member has raised, and I
              will go to my officials with it. However, I come back to the issue
              that cannot be avoided. If we have a significant number of road
              schemes — which we do — and we have a limited budget for those
              schemes, it is impossible to undertake all of them as quickly as
              the Members and I would like. Therefore we have to prioritise. I
              will speak to my officials, and I will inform the Member of the

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Scheduled passenger services are due to start
              on the Antrim to Bleach Green railway line from Sunday 10 June
              2001. That will significantly reduce the journey times to Belfast
              from stations on the Antrim to Londonderry line. For example, the
              journey from Coleraine to Belfast Central should take just one
              hour and 17 minutes, compared to the current shortest journey time
              via Knockmore of one hour and 45 minutes.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Translink has advised me that while it has an
              ongoing marketing programme for the promotion of the entire
              Northern Ireland railway network, a major marketing communications
              strategy is currently in progress specifically for the promotion
              of the Antrim to Bleach Green line. That strategy highlights such
              benefits as reduced journey times and increased levels of
              passenger comfort. It will include an introductory discounted
              fares promotion to stimulate usage of the new line. Translink has
              previously targeted areas such as the north-west of the Province
              with marketing initiatives, including two-for-one offers. It will
              continue to explore such opportunities now that we have enhanced
              journey times between Londonderry and Belfast.</p>

              a sigh of relief that this new service will be implemented at
              last. Does he agree that it is essential that a first-class,
              high-speed rail service between our two principal cities should be
              put in place at the earliest opportunity? Will he assure the House
              that his Department has briefed the Executive, London and Europe
              on the funding so that the Belfast to Derry line can become a
              critical part of an all-Ireland rail infrastructure, promoting
              commerce, tourism and a cleaner environment?</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no doubt that the reduction in
              commuting times that I referred to, for example the 28-minute
              reduction from Coleraine to Belfast Central, will be significant
              and will benefit commuters. Other Members and I will campaign for
              a steady increase in resources to make all commuting times more
              speedy and comfortable, whether from Londonderry to Belfast, or
              Belfast to Newry and thence to the Republic and Dublin.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are resource implications. The First
              Minister and the Deputy First Minister ought to be in no doubt
              about the resources required. We received £105 million through
              the railways taskforce to upgrade the network over the next three
              years, but only after significant pressure was applied by me and
              by my predecessor.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with the Member on the issues that he
              raises about Northern Ireland Railways. Any process that will lead
              to upgrading the service between Northern Ireland and the Republic
              of Ireland would have to be agreed upon between this
              Administration and the Administration in Dublin. I have no

              saga of the opening of Mossley West station to be brought to a
              successful conclusion? Will he ensure that the 80 newly created
              park-and-ride spaces there will be brought into operation as
              speedily as possible?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There has been investment of £815,000 in the

              bridge at Mossley West and £7,000 worth of damage caused by
              vandalism. Will the Minister assure the House that the station
              will be included in Northern Ireland Railways’s (NIR) timetable
              immediately and that it will be adequately served, particularly in
              the rush hour, by trains that are specially adapted for commuters?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will he say if the station will be subject to a

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have encouraged Translink to be as flexible
              as possible, because the station is an asset to the people of his
              constituency and further afield, and we want to use it as quickly
              as possible. I will do what I can to help resolve the matter, and
              I have made Translink aware of that. The Member has written to me
              on several occasions about Mossley West, and I am determined to
              get the station operational as quickly as possible.</p>

              Green line opens. If he is seeking to generate traffic he should
              certainly consider those two stations but consider increasing the
              rolling stock for the Knockmore to Antrim line to ensure that
              people will add to the traffic generated in Crumlin, Glenavy and

              Over 200,000 passengers will benefit from reduced journey times in
              the first year after the Bleach Green line and station are opened.

              losses were incurred as a result of bombs and bomb threats on

              funds NIR’s running cost deficit.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That means that there will be around £500,000
              less to spend on worthwhile projects in Northern&nbsp;Ireland this
              year. The most recent disruptions in the current financial year
              will increase the losses from £500,000, but it is too soon to
              estimate by how much. The disruption in services also causes great

              that £500,000 is made up. Approximately £250,000 is due to lost
              passenger revenue, mainly on the cross-border Enterprise service,
              and about £200,000 is incurred in bus substitution charges. A
              further £50,000 or thereabouts is included to cover staff
              overtime costs and lost revenue from freight crane hire.</p>

              the whole community in Northern Ireland can be disrupted to the
              extent of £500,000 in the first few months of this year. I hope

              those attacks will be a reduction in tourist revenue and in the
              number of tourists coming to Northern Ireland. There can be no
              doubt about that. I cannot comment upon whether the attacks are
              designed to achieve such an end, but that is the inevitable
              consequence. With regard to the amount and consequence of the
              £500,000 being diverted, the public service obligation which the
              Department for Regional Development paid to Northern Ireland
              Railways for 2001-02 was £12·5&nbsp;million. The £500,000 would
              be in addition to that money and, therefore, would not affect the
              services to which he refers. However, if the attacks continue,
              that £500,000 will escalate in a few months’ time. That is
              money that could be much more usefully applied to building and
              promoting existing services rather than jeopardising them, which
              may happen if the situation continues to escalate.</p>

              pass the buck. Will the Minister take account of the demands of

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am aware of problems concerning a mobile
              phone mast in the Jerrettspass area. I have met residents and
              public representatives on the issue, and my officials are in
              discussion with Crown Castle, the agents for the developer. It is
              a matter for Crown Castle to decide whether to submit fresh
              proposals. To date no proposals have been received.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In parallel, my officials are examining the
              feasibility of taking discontinuance proceedings, although a
              detailed planning case would be necessary to justify such action.
              I must emphasise that discontinuance may not be a practical
              option, and people should not have false hopes. I would also
              re-emphasise that my Department can only take enforcement action
              against unauthorised development. The mast in question received
              prior approval, and our very firm legal advice is that the
              Department has no grounds for challenging its validity.</p>

              at Jerrettspass, I wish to place on record my thanks to the
              Minister for receiving the delegation of the residents, Newry and
              Mourne District Council and myself.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, I am very disappointed with his reply
              concerning the lack of urgency in the consideration of the
              discontinuation notice. The history, as the Minister knows, is
              that incorrect co-ordinates were given for the siting of the mast
              and that initial approval was therefore misconceived and
              misdirected in public. The subsequent rejection was a
              contradiction of the first decision. Are we now in a situation
              where wrong planning decisions — whether administrative or
              policy based — cannot be corrected?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That seems to be what the Minister was saying.
              If that is the case, justice can be done only when the policy is
              changed. The residents were not able, under law, to make
              representations about the first application because it was wrongly
              addressed in the advertisements placed by the Department — not
              the applicant.</p>

              other public representatives.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The decision to grant the first prior approval
              application on 12 June 2000 was made taking account of all the
              relevant factors at that time, and the absence of objections,
              undoubtedly due to the wrong address being in the advertisement,
              was a relevant factor. The decision to refuse a subsequent prior
              approval application on 21 February 2001 took account of
              representations from objectors when the correct address was
              published.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although the objectors were mainly concerned
              with health issues, many raised significant concerns about the
              visual amenity of the proposal. The representations on visual
              amenity persuaded the divisional planning office to take the view
              that, on balance, the proposal was detrimental to the area. The
              office decided that the proposal lacked any features that would
              allow it to be satisfactorily integrated into the local landscape.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I sincerely regret the Planning Service’s
              failure to ensure that the original application was advertised
              with the correct address. It did not give local residents the
              opportunity to voice their concerns. I have asked for a full
              report on the case, with recommendations on the measures that
              could be taken to prevent a recurrence. I am moving as fast as I
              can on the matter, but, as I said in my previous answer, any
              discontinuance action will take some months to complete. In the
              meantime the Department has no powers to remove the mast or
              interfere with its operations.</p>

              Health, Social Services and Public Safety, and that Department’s
              advice is taken into account when planning policy is framed. I
              must emphasise that responsibility for giving permission for the
              masts does not lie solely with the Planning Service; it is subject
              to other exigencies.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Following recent consultation, the Department
              of Health, Social Services and Public Safety confirmed that it
              would not raise any further questions about health when the
              emissions from individual masts are within the International
              Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection (ICNIRP)
              guidelines. That decision is based on the fact that the level of
              exposure to radio frequency radiation from individual masts is a
              small fraction of the level permitted by the ICNIRP guidelines.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of Health, Social Services and

              land, undeveloped land and vacant buildings. That reflects the
              approach taken in the draft regional development strategy (RDS). I

              difficult to quantify how much brownfield there is. We may need a

              and their dams have been used for modern housing. Does the

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I know that the Member has concerns about his
              area. The potential of each urban site for housing would have to
              be assessed against all prevailing and relevant planning policies.
              In particular, the Department is concerned that increasing the
              share of future housing within existing urban areas should not
              give rise to town cramming — of which I believe the Member is
              fearful.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am aware of concerns expressed about the
              redevelopment of housing in existing residential areas. However,
              high-density brownfield development must have a contribution to
              make towards protecting the green belt. I can assure the Chamber
              that, as far as the planning division is concerned, every
              application is examined on its own merits and under the
              requirements of the policies. Nothing is done without due
              consideration’s being given to it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The draft estimates for housing growth are high
              — an additional 160,000 dwellings are needed by 2015. That will
              put additional pressures on all areas, including brownfield and
              greenfield sites. I understand that the regional development
              strategy will provide housing growth indicators up to 2015 for

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The World Wildlife Fund Water and Wetland Index
              Report assesses water quality across Europe. It is mainly based on
              data provided by national environmental authorities. My Department’s
              Environment and Heritage Service provided the data for Northern
              Ireland. The WWF’s report expresses concerns about future
              compliance with the water quality objectives of the new EU Water
              Framework Directive as they become applicable. The report
              identifies, on a sample survey basis, water quality problems for
              the upper Bann and Lagan and, to a lesser extent, the Foyle. My
              Department is aware of those problems and is addressing them as
              part of wider plans to comply with the EU Directive. The Directive
              requires member states to have management plans in place for all
              river basin districts by 2008. Action plans must also be
              implemented to maintain or improve the water quality within all
              catchments. The overall objective is to attain what the Directive
              describes as good quality status for all waterways by 2015.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A key aspect of the Executive’s Programme for
              Government is the protection and enhancement of the Northern
              Ireland environment. In that context I have secured significant
              additional resources to meet, among other things, Northern Ireland’s
              EU obligations, including implementation of the various stages of
              the Water Framework Directive by the required dates. That will
              effectively meet the WWF’s recommendations.</p>

              and lakes are among the most polluted in Europe? He mentioned
              three rivers — the Bann, the Foyle and the Lagan. The WWF report
              also singled out Lough Erne in his constituency, and Lough Neagh

              a reasonable time?</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Foster:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Public Accounts Committee report on river
              pollution dealt largely with pre-devolution matters. It reflected
              the period when the environmental responsibilities of the old DOE
              were badly under- resourced. I am pleased to state that with the
              help of colleagues, and the support of the Environment Committee,
              I was able to secure additional resources that will allow a
              substantial increase in staffing. Nobody wants to see pollution of
              waters. We are all very much against it, but it is due to under-resourcing
              and understaffing.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The number of water quality unit staff will
              increase from 44 to 77 over the next two years due to the moneys
              that I have received. The number of people in the water policy
              team and environmental policy division has been increased by five.
              Twenty of the additional staff will be deployed to implement the
              EU Water Framework Directive.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Following a review, the extent of the river
              network that is monitored by the Environment and Heritage Service
              has more than doubled from 280 sites to 600 sites. That will
              enable 5,200 kilometres of river to be classified biologically and
              4,200 kilometres to be classified chemically.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A fees and charges scheme will be introduced
              shortly to enable full recovery of the Department’s costs in
              administering the discharge consent system. This is the line with
              the &quot;polluter pays&quot; principle. We must get on top of the
              issue, and the Directive will ensure that we do. I assure Mr
              Wilson that we are concerned about the matter. I am delighted that
              we are increasing our staff, because we will then have more
              resources to fight against the difficulties that we have had over
              the years.</p>

              issue. The matter is currently being reviewed by that group to
              take account of the new EU proposals on animal waste.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Minister recognise the difficulties
              that are caused in rural district council areas when fallen
              animals are callously dumped by farmers at, or near, skip sites?
              Often, members of the public contact councillors about this, and
              they, in turn, request that environmental health officers examine
              those sites. That causes a great problem for district councils,
              officials and council workers who may have to rectify the
              situation. Will the Minster give an assurance that he will make
              provision for collaboration and consultation with district
              councillors so that a more effective policy can be developed?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Foster:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is an important question. I have been well
              aware of that problem for a number of years in my council, just
              south of where Mr Byrne comes from. The fallen animals are
              generally under the terms of the EC Animal Waste Directive. That
              is a matter for the Department of Agriculture and Rural
              Development.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I acknowledge that some irresponsible farmers
              have sought to evade their responsibilities by dumping carcasses
              on roadside verges, in waterways or on publicly owned land. That
              is undoubtedly a reprehensible practice. Aside from the nuisance
              and unsightliness it causes, dumping carcasses in that way can
              have implications for health. Accordingly, information on dumped
              carcasses brought to the attention of my Department is passed to
              the relevant district council. The problem of dumped carcasses has
              formed part of the deliberations of the fallen animals liaison
              group to which I have referred. That is primarily a matter for the
              Department of Agriculture and Rural Development. I assure Mr Byrne
              that we will liaise where we can. However, when a health issue is
              involved, the district council must take responsibility.</p>

              results from the dumping of cattle in sensitive areas and in
              waterways? That is a problem in the Fermanagh and the Shannon/Erne
              Waterway areas. What is the extent of the cost to the Department

              It is very difficult to have the information collated and to give
              a definitive cost. If I can establish what that cost might be, I

              as it stands.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is the responsibility of the environmental

              more information.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department’s policy on roadside
              advertising hoardings is set out in policy design principle 9 of
              the Planning Strategy for Rural Northern Ireland. In that there is
              a presumption against the display of advertisements in open
              countryside to protect the rural landscape and prevent traffic
              hazards. Under the Planning (Control of Advertisement) Regulations
              (Northern Ireland) 1992, the display of a roadside advertisement
              is an offence unless the consent of my Department has been
              granted. In assessing whether to initiate court action, my
              Department is guided by legal advice, the impact of advertisements
              on visual amenity and any road safety issues identified by the
              Department for Regional Development. If, after assessment, my
              Department concludes that an advertisement is unacceptable, it
              normally takes court action. At times, persuasion can work.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCarthy:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome today’s debate on inequalities in
              the Health Service of which there are too many, and I am pleased
              that the Executive are determined to tackle them all. I will point
              out some that exist in Northern Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Preventable measures are most welcome. The
              effects of radon gas cause more than 60 deaths a year in Northern
              Ireland. I am disappointed by the lack of urgency to tackle that
              problem, although I am thankful that the issue of smoking is being
              tackled.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to draw the Minister’s attention
              to the problems that cancer patients experience in Belvoir Park
              Hospital, where equipment often breaks down. Everyone knows that
              machines fail, but the machines in question are not due to be
              replaced for a long time, so cancer suffers wait longer and travel
              further for vital treatment. They should not have to wait one hour
              longer, let alone days or weeks, for treatment. Action should be
              taken immediately to see that machines are modernised and replaced
              frequently.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are also deficient in our treatment of
              rheumatoid arthritis. That is a debilitating disease that can
              strike at any age. Drugs exist to treat this condition but are not
              available in some instances because of the cost. We must not
              sentence sufferers of that disease to pain and disability as a
              cost-saving measure. If drugs are required, patients ought to
              receive them. Those are only two instances of inequality in
              healthcare that have come to our attention recently, and no doubt
              there are many more.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The debate gives us an opportunity to discuss
              care for the elderly. As we grow older and our bodies become more
              infirm, we face more obstacles in our daily lives. That is wrong
              and unjust.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We do not need additional obstacles in our
              health system. Unfortunately, that is exactly what happens. We
              know that older patients are often placed at the bottom of waiting
              lists. Their concerns are not being met properly. They do not
              receive first-rate services in all instances. That is a disgrace
              and should not be tolerated. It seems that age can become a
              deciding factor in whether one lives or dies. That is an
              inequality that we must overcome.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thanks to the recommendations in the Sutherland
              Report, we hope that nursing care will be free in all nursing
              homes from October 2001. Those most in need will get help.
              Westminster has recognised that nursing care must be provided as a
              matter of course. However, it has not embraced another Sutherland
              Report recommendation that said that personal care must also be
              freely available, determined only by need and paid for by the
              general taxation. The fact that they have not accepted that
              recommendation is unfair and will mean that there will be
              inequalities.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Growing old should not mean growing in fear,
              worried about how one will pay the cost of living in dignity. For
              many years, the elderly in our society have been afraid that with
              ageing, they will be forced to sell their homes or their
              possessions and use any money that they have saved to provide for
              the basic help that they may need as their bodies grow infirm. To
              combat that fear we must embrace the Sutherland recommendations in
              full. Nursing and personal care must be made available based on
              need and nothing else.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In many ways, the problems faced by our elderly
              are part of the larger problem of an inadequately funded care in
              the community programme. Westminster has not provided the
              resources that are necessary for people to be taken care of in
              their homes, whether they need that help because they are
              disabled, mentally ill or elderly. The Government have declared
              that the need that is brought on by age does not entitle one to
              basic help in living a dignified life. In that way, they do not
              have to fund it. Surely that is an inequality and is wrong.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should not make the lives of our elderly any
              more difficult by denying their basic right to having their needs
              cared for, but that is what we are doing at present. Current
              practice is simply not good enough. We place people in nursing
              homes because they need help, but our system cannot provide that
              help to them in their own homes. They spend nights in the hospital
              because there are no support staff to assist them when they are
              discharged. In short, our system is not based on their needs,
              wants or desires, but gives them a service that they may not want.
              It is most unfair.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Government’s response to Sutherland’s
              idea of providing care based on need is to argue that although
              they have the money to do this, making personal care universally
              free is not the best use of resources. They prefer not to spend
              money to ensure that our elderly can lead lives that are as
              independent and fulfilling as possible. That is contrary to what
              every Member of this House stands for. Surely we in Northern
              Ireland can do better.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the Executive want to fulfil their pledges
              on inequality and targeting social need, they must act in the best
              interests of the elderly in our population. Denying free personal
              care is not unfair just to the elderly. It is specifically unfair
              to those, for instance, who suffer from Alzheimer’s disease, a
              medical condition that leads to more and more disability and
              inability to care for oneself. Dementia is a symptom of that
              disease.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Currently, the Government refuse to fund the
              care needed to alleviate that symptom. That is in complete
              contrast to how it treats the symptoms and outcomes of any other
              disease. That response by the Government says that because someone
              is old, they do not need to provide the necessary personal care.
              The person can provide it him or herself. That surely must be
              totally unfair and unjust. We must and can do better. We must
              treat the elderly with respect and dignity but also fairness. We
              must provide for their needs. We must implement the Sutherland
              report as far as possible, to provide free personal care and
              support to our elderly and the people who care for them. We must
              bring that measure of equality to our Health Service.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, I wish to support the many things that
              Members said this morning about equality in the Health Service,
              which the Minister also mentioned. Now that we have the
              opportunity, let us do it now. I also welcome the Minister for
              Social Development’s contribution to the debate. Together all
              Departments have a duty to stop all those inequalities, and I am
              sure that they will eventually be successful. On my party’s
              behalf, I support the motion.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Carson:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Through the Programme for Government we hope to
              have joined-up Government here. The Department of Health, Social
              Services and Public Safety will take the lead in health. I welcome
              the Executive’s commitment to the Programme for Government,
              through which all Departments will work together to tackle the
              causes of preventable diseases and disability. A holistic approach
              to that should reduce serious pressure on hospital beds and help
              to reduce waiting lists. However, what is the action plan that
              will enable that admirable objective to be realised?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Reducing inequalities in the health status of
              different groups is an excellent aim, but of what groups? We have
              to find out yet, have we not? How many groups will be identified,
              and how will the inequalities be tackled? A list of the groups of
              people who feel excluded from equality of treatment is extremely
              large. Will pensioners have true equality of treatment, and how
              will ethnic minorities be treated? Will they get equality? What
              about our poor practitioners who do not speak the language of many
              of the ethnic minority groups who are now here? I am talking not
              only about the Irish language but about Koreans, Portuguese and
              other minorities.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What about expectant mothers? Will they have
              equality of access to maternity services across Northern Ireland?
              What about Fermanagh and South Tyrone? No later than last Monday,
              an expectant mother from south Tyrone gave birth in an ambulance
              as it travelled to Craigavon. That was our fear when the South
              Tyrone Hospital was closed down, and it is coming to pass.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">About a year ago, we were told that ambulance
              staff were being trained in obstetrics, and I asked whether we
              were to expect mothers now to have children at the side of the
              road. Well, that is what we have heard about already. As a result
              of the heavy emphasis in the health strategy that favours urban
              areas to the detriment of rural ones, incidents such as that will
              happen again and again. There is too much emphasis on urban areas,
              and that affects our ambulance call-out times.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Ambulance Service needs to be considered,
              because it is a bit thin in rural areas. There was a critical
              accident last weekend in Fermanagh and South Tyrone, and the
              ambulance took exactly 21 minutes to arrive — not 20 or 22, but
              21 minutes, so it escaped censure. That is too fine a line to have
              in a serious emergency.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Much has been said about the need for equality
              in health matters in areas of economic disadvantage.
              Centralisation by health authorities is compounding the problems
              by differentiating between urban and rural areas. That is
              especially highlighted because practically all major hospital
              services are located east of the Bann. That has brought about
              inequalities in the entire area west of the Bann, not just for
              specific groups but for the whole population there.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Equality of provision is vital if we are to
              create a healthier population, but I wish to know exactly what
              action plan the Department of Health, Social Services and Public
              Safety will use to bring this about. How will that Department
              co-ordinate with all the other Departments? Reducing inequalities
              in our health status must also include reducing inequalities in
              the provision of medical care, and that must also extend to
              reducing administration in hospitals and addressing the perception
              that patients are numbers to be processed rather than people to be
              tended.</p>

              that review I look forward to a reduction in our health
              inequalities. The Department’s efforts should concentrate on
              Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland has to look at its own problems
              and put its house in order before looking at the problems in the
              Republic of Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion and look forward to
              increased equality of treatment west of the Bann as well as in the
              rest of Northern Ireland. I also look forward to seeing an example
              of joined-up government.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Lewsley:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Programme for Government’s
              commitment to interdepartmental co-operation in addressing the
              underlying causes of preventable disease and disability. However,
              there is little evidence of such Departments getting their houses
              in order to eliminate current inequalities, never mind
              interdepartmental co- ordination to tackle those issues.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Northern Ireland has a significantly higher
              proportion of people with disabilities per capita than the rest of
              the United Kingdom. As such we need to develop and implement a
              comprehensive package to deal with the basic factors behind the
              issue. As has been mentioned, there is still a high incidence of
              health differentials between the rich and the poor. If one looks
              at a map of Northern Ireland and marks out the areas of high
              unemployment and poverty, it is evident that those are the areas
              that also suffer the greatest disadvantage in healthcare, low
              awareness of preventable disease, poor diet, less health education
              and poor access to health services that are taken for granted in
              areas that are better off. All those issues are interrelated.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Statistics show an increase in incidences of
              asthma and coronary and respiratory illnesses in those areas.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Health, Social Services and the
              Public Safety and the Deputy Chairperson of the Health Committee,
              Mr Gallagher, have mentioned many inequalities in health status.
              However, there are also inequalities in provision between the
              health boards. Patients in the Southern Health and Social Services
              Board can avail of a neurocybernetic prosthesis system for
              epileptics, while those a few miles up the road in the Eastern
              Health and Social Services Board cannot. Why is that?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Infertility treatment is also class-oriented,
              because many couples on low incomes cannot access it because of
              the high costs of private treatment.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other areas of long-term illness, or hidden
              long-term illness such as rheumatoid arthritis, do not receive the
              same type of funding or attention as chronic long-term illnesses
              such as the cancers. Will the Minister set out a strategy for
              dealing with patients with those long-term illnesses and provide
              the funding for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and other
              less recognised long-term illnesses? Limited respite care for
              people with disabilities, the elderly and those suffering from
              long-tem illnesses is causing much distress.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Care in the community is underfunded and often
              varies greatly between geographical areas. The Assembly must look
              at the low rates of benefit for carers. Despite extensive savings
              on resources and their invaluable contribution in caring for their
              relatives and friends, many carers suffer extreme financial
              hardship and are caught in the poverty trap because they have to
              depend on the benefits system.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Carers contribute much to the community and
              deserve support and recognition for their work. Without them the
              pressures on an already overburdened system would be impossible to
              cope with. Over the years, with the reduction in social services
              provision for care in the community, these people are often left
              with sole responsibility for someone who is ill or disabled. The
              carer can become isolated and suffer from low self-esteem and low
              self-confidence. Caring for someone should be recognised as a
              profession and not taken for granted because it is seen as a
              family responsibility.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Carers are often put on hold or are totally
              forgotten about when caring for a relative or friend. They deserve
              our respect and recognition. They need support in return for their
              invaluable contribution to society. None need that support more
              than the growing number of children who, from a young age, take on
              the responsibility of caring for a parent, or even parents,
              through circumstance rather than choice.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Day care for people with learning disabilities
              is essential and is a basic human right. It should be mandatory to
              reduce social exclusion and to provide people with training and
              more job opportunities. The impending crisis we face as a result
              of the reduction in European funding, means that many voluntary
              and community groups in the sphere will cease to exist. The
              increased pressure on existing service provision and on the
              individuals concerned could cost society dearly. Closer
              co-ordination between the Department of Health, Social Services
              and Public Safety and the Department of Education is needed to
              alleviate that hardship.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy Chairperson of the Health, Social
              Services and Public Safety Committee talked about immunisation and
              vaccination. However, 5,000 children across Northern Ireland have
              neither been tested for tuberculosis nor given the BCG
              vaccination. Admittedly, there has been a drop in the number of
              cases of TB here, but there are still instances. We could easily
              find ourselves in the same situation as a town in England that had
              an outbreak of TB not so long ago. What action is the Minister’s
              Department taking to address that?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many of the issues cannot be taken in
              isolation. They are not just health issues but have to be viewed
              in terms of human rights, equality, education and social
              development. They need to be tackled on an interdepartmental
              basis. I support the motion.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Robert Coulter:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion and welcome the statement
              by the Minister. I commend the Executive on their initiative for
              an interdepartmental approach to healthcare. The concept that
              health is the sole domain of healthcare practitioners has been
              around for far too long. It is great that the consultation
              document ‘Investing for Health’ recognises that the health of
              the community is the concern of the whole community. The old maxim
              that prevention is better than cure is very relevant today. The
              Executive’s initiative to involve all Departments in making
              health central to all our activities should be supported by
              everyone.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Health education must begin at primary school,
              or even at nursery school. Children should be brought up to
              believe in their community’s health, not just in their own or in
              their family’s health. When that attitude is instilled in the
              mind early in life — although it may take some years to develop
              — it will result in the health of the community becoming central
              to everyone’s thinking.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, there are one or two problems.
              Consider the pollution in some of our rivers and in our
              countryside. Private companies are correctly penalised for
              creating that pollution, yet Government agencies escape with an
              apology when raw sewage escapes into the rivers. Will the Minister
              and the Department see to it that Government agencies do not get
              away with polluting the countryside, leaving private companies to
              pay the bill?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am a little cynical about the boards working
              in partnership. People in the trusts, and particularly the
              regional hospitals, tell us that they cannot get the boards to
              agree on the amount of money to be given to update essential
              equipment. How will the Minister and her Department make sure that
              the boards will work in partnership? A new spirit of co-operation
              among the boards, rather than one of competition, will guarantee
              the health of the community.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is not just the environment. The whole of
              the Health Service in Northern Ireland needs to be looked at from
              top to bottom, or vice versa. It is an indictment of the nature of
              our Health Service when we are told that some cancer patients will
              die without even seeing a consultant, or when we are told that
              someone had to sit for eight hours in an accident and emergency
              unit because that was the only way that the GP could have that
              patient seen by a consultant. Something has gone sadly astray.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are faced with the increase in the elderly
              population. That will demand greater powers for the Health Service
              if we are to cope. Yet I am encouraged; ‘Investing for Health’
              — the health of the community — is something to be commended.
              I commend the Department, the Minister and the Executive on the
              initiative. Together we go forward to a better and healthier
              community.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr McDonnell:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I, in common with other Members who have
              spoken, would like to add my appreciation for the fact that this
              motion is being debated today. I welcome the commitment of the
              Government and the Department of Health, Social Services and
              Public Safety to work energetically to tackle the root causes of
              preventable disease and disability and to reduce the inequalities
              in health status of our different population groups.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Perhaps I speak with a touch of cynicism,
              although I mean no disrespect to the Minister or anyone engaged in
              the struggle. When I first looked at this document I thought that
              it was good, decent, sound and that it reflected the way we wanted
              to go. However, after a second look, I said to myself &quot;How
              much will we achieve? Does this mean anything, and, more
              importantly, will it ever mean anything to the vast majority of
              our people.&quot; I am talking about the ordinary people at street
              level who could be referred to in some circumstances as working
              class — people at the poorer end of the social spectrum.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although I am concerned about the poor levels
              of health, health promotion and disease prevention across Northern
              Ireland, particularly among the working-class people, I am
              concerned about the plight of people in that socio-economic group
              in inner-city Belfast. My concern stems from knowledge gained
              while working for 20 years as a full-time GP in the inner city,
              and I continue to work there part time as circumstances here
              permit. Making my observations from that position, I view the
              health and disease promotion programme as all too often being
              middle class in its attitudes and values. Often it imposes these
              values on a working-class problem, which is not a solution for
              success. Often the language and expectations are different, as is
              the access to wealth.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those who have resources can access better
              quality food, living conditions, housing and everything else. At a
              simple level it is easy to give someone a lecture on the dangers
              of the lard content of the Ulster fry and the risk it carries for
              coronary heart disease.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, in many cases, people do not have —
              or do not perceive that they have — the option to adopt a
              healthier diet.</p>
              <i>

              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a doctor in inner-city Belfast, I noticed
              that many of the resources, facilities and programmes operated out
              of relatively middle-class bases, such as Finaghy, Dunluce Health
              Centre and Holywood Arches. Although Holywood Arches Health Centre
              was adjacent to Sydenham and the working-class area of east
              Belfast, much of its catchment area was the area around Stormont.
              Such facilities were excellent for people with cars, but, in many
              cases, they were inaccessible, because the bus routes were
              unsuitable and, quite often, the people who needed to get to those
              facilities could not walk to them.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I worked in the Health Service on the lower
              Ormeau Road. We worked in the original health centre in three old
              terraced houses. There were few resources and only limited
              facilities to serve a deprived inner-city community that crossed
              the divide. We covered the Markets area, Sandy Row, Donegall Pass,
              lower Ormeau, Annadale and the lower Ravenhill Road. Those were
              the people who could not access the facilities that they needed.
              Not only were those areas deprived, but they were hammered by the
              troubles and the social unrest of the last 30 years.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In that period I and others like me struggled
              to obtain recognition and investment for that deprived inner-city
              community from the former Department of Health and Social
              Services. For all those years, we were on a continuous
              merry-go-round. I first started discussions about a new building
              16 or 17 years ago. The present building has been condemned for
              health and safety reasons, but we must survive in it. There are no
              modern facilities. Indeed, the support services that we had have
              been taken away. I am not talking about my own practice; I am
              talking about a facility that, at one stage, served most of south
              and east Belfast. It has shrunk as other people have picked up
              some of those services, but, by and large, it still delivers a
              service of sorts to the deprived inner city. There has been pain,
              grief, worry and stress in that area. The problem is far too
              important to be entrusted to the Department. The problem is not
              one of bureaucracy or architecture; it is about providing services
              for people, and that is where our Health Service falls down.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People could, perhaps, accuse me of pursuing
              self-interest; that is not so. I intend to withdraw entirely from
              general practice in the next year or two. However, I want to see
              adequate resources and healthcare provided for people in the inner
              city. Judging by what I have seen, there is too much morbidity and
              ill health in that area. Too many people die young from a whole
              range of illnesses. Many cases could have been treated or cured,
              had they not been neglected. Although much of the neglect is the
              responsibility of the patients themselves, the lack of access to
              facilities and the absence of a welcoming centre in that area mean
              that the treatment of cancers, heart disease and other illnesses
              is put on the long finger.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not want to be emotional or sentimental
              about it. There are gaps, and we do pay a lot of lip service. I am
              not accusing our current Minister, because this has gone on for
              many years. However, until something is done about similar
              situations we will not have done anything for the Health Service,
              and we will not have the Health Service of which we want to be
              proud.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We can say that we have lots of wonderful
              programmes and policies. Those dealt with issues such as women’s
              health — an issue that particularly concerns me. While the
              programmes and policies are available, they can only penetrate
              those who can access them intellectually and physically. Many
              programmes miss working class people in the inner city totally.
              They pass those people who have been battered for the past
              30&nbsp;years by social unrest.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At times over the past 12&nbsp;years I have
              been conscious about the problems in women’s health and of the
              fact that a mere male can do only so much. During that time I
              enlisted three female partners in order to set a high priority on
              women’s health. We tried every possible way of communicating
              with the female population, but we could only get a 55% uptake in
              our cervical cytology efforts. Short of physically grabbing people
              in the street we could not get beyond that figure. People felt
              that they could not avail of that service. The Department of
              Health expected us to have a 75% or 80% uptake. We tried to
              communicate in ways that we thought people could relate to, but
              they declined the tests. There is an issue about how we
              communicate with people and encourage them to avail of proper
              healthcare after we have provided the appropriate facilities.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some years ago we thought that we were doing
              very well. I had one male partner and three female partners, and
              we were all gung-ho on women’s health. We decided to
              congratulate ourselves by auditing on our perceived success, and
              we interviewed 200 women between the ages of 45 and 55. We were
              quite sure that we would get a tremendous result of about 80%
              satisfaction because the women were in the surgery every week and,
              therefore, they had to be healthy.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, the reality was that they were there
              every week as messengers for mothers, fathers, grandmothers,
              grandfathers, children, husbands or grandchildren. They were there
              as the contact point — the communicator. In many ways they were
              the secondary providers of healthcare for their families. From the
              200 women we interviewed we found that approximately four were in
              reasonable health. The rest had problems.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not want to go into the gory details, but
              in this day and age, some of the problems were unforgivable. Many
              of the women had a significant degree of incontinence as a result
              of injuries received while giving birth 20 years before, or as a
              result of a clumsy or bad delivery. Many suffered from mental
              illness such as prolonged post-natal depression, which had not
              been diagnosed at the time.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the great revolutions in the Health
              Service was the provision of community psychiatric nurses 12 to 15
              years ago. However, the service has been cut back to the point
              where it is barely viable. Community psychiatric nurses were a
              godsend 15 years ago, yet the service is now tight.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have given you two examples of conditions
              that are unforgivable. I could say a number of other things. We
              pay a lot of lip service. We have a lot of nice reception areas
              and fancy brochures on breast cancer, cervical cancer, ovarian
              cancer and a whole array of things specific to women. We have to
              start putting this into real action and into a form that
              communicates to working-class people in deprived inner-city areas.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have said enough, but I would like to switch
              to the other end of the spectrum before I finish. We spend a lot
              of time talking about cancers. Thank God, we are steadily winning
              the war against cancer, and the percentage curability of cancer
              tends to go up and up — not fast enough, but it is increasing. I
              am proud of my involvement — however limited — with the new
              cancer set-up in Belfast City Hospital. I believe that we will, in
              due course, have a world-class centre there.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am distressed, however, that, in many such
              cases, we can be penny wise and pound foolish. Members are
              probably familiar with the gastroscope, the telescopic instrument
              that is passed down into the patient. That has been modified, and
              a version has been produced with ultrasound. It can produce a
              heart echo or a picture of a baby before it is born and can give
              an exact picture of a tumour. It is one of the most modern and
              essential pieces of equipment for diagnosing and assessing the
              treatability of cancer of the oesophagus, the stomach or the
              gullet. The surgeon knows exactly what he often has to treat.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That equipment costs about £120,000 or
              £130,000: we do not have one. I raised the matter with people in
              Belfast City Hospital and was told that efforts to gather together
              free funds have produced £90,000 to £100,000. In some cases,
              people are vulnerable to surgery. They have tumours in the
              oesophagus or the stomach, but they are perhaps not up to surgery.
              The surgeon needs to know what he or she is faced with before
              starting surgery and whether surgery will be too life-threatening
              to undertake at all. The only access to that equipment on the
              island of Ireland is in Dublin, and I understand that, in some
              cases, patients have been sent by taxi to Dublin.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must get our act together. I emphasise that
              my concerns are in no way attributable to the current Minister,
              who has been in the job for less than two years. I support the
              motion; I say, &quot;Hurrah! Let us get to grips with this!&quot;
              We should get into more detail, and we need more papers on health.
              We should take a serious, practical look at the big gaps in
              provision and at the lack of funding. We must consider how we can
              provide a health service that meets the needs of people, without
              promising the world and only delivering half — or less.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Health, Social Services and
              Public Safety (Ms de Brún):</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.
              Tugaim mo bhuíochas do gach Teachta a labhair sa díospóireacht.
              Tá an-áthas orm gur spreag an t-ábhar oiread díograise, agus
              chuir mé suim sa mhéid a dúradh.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dhearbhaigh an díospóireacht tacaíocht an
              Tionóil do chur chuige láidir trasroinne le sláinte ár bpobail
              a fheabhsú; cur chuige a chuireann cúiseanna sláinte agus
              easláinte go hiomlán san áireamh agus a athníonn go gcaithfidh
              dul i gceann éagothromaíochtaí sláinte go diongbháilte.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am grateful to all the Members who
              contributed to the debate, and I am delighted that the subject has
              engendered so much enthusiasm. I listened with interest to all
              that was said. The debate confirmed — as, I hope, will the vote
              — the Assembly’s support for a strong cross-departmental
              approach to improving the health of our people that takes full
              account of the causes of ill health and recognises the need to act
              resolutely to tackle health inequalities.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several issues that were raised during the
              debate served to reinforce the argument that health improvement
              cannot be left to health services alone, or to Departments alone.
              That is why it is so important that all Departments and all
              sectors and agencies work together. The ministerial group on
              public health, which is made up of officials from all Departments
              and I chair, has designed a consultation process that is well
              beyond the usual and will engage all sections of society.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.45 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several Members pointed to the need to improve
              specific services or ensure that sufficient resources are
              available to strengthen them. I assure Members that I support the
              case for adequate funding for all aspects of health and social
              services including mental health care for young people, the
              Ambulance Service, community care, primary care, acute hospitals
              and all other aspects that were mentioned.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is especially important to ensure that
              health services are of a high quality and fully accessible to
              those who need them most, including people who live in isolated
              rural areas. My Department’s equality scheme sets out how it
              will pursue access for designated equality groups. I outlined in
              previous debates steps that have been, and are being, taken by my
              Department on rurality, and Executive Colleagues outlined other
              steps during the debate on the Programme for Government.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">‘Investing for Health’ is not just about
              treating disease or caring for the sick, vital as those things
              are. It is not a matter of traditional health protection
              activities, such as immunisation or improving food hygiene. It is
              not confined to the traditional health promotion messages to which
              Dr McDonnell referred to. It goes beyond the traditional approach
              to health education with its focus on persuading people to change
              their behaviour. It is not confined to the professional
              disciplines of public health medicine, health promotion or
              environmental health. The World Health Organisation defines health
              as</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;a complete state of physical, mental and
              social well-being and not simply the absence of disease&quot;.</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Public health has been defined as</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;organised social and political effort for
              the benefit of populations and individuals while also involving
              health promotion and personal responsibility for health.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important, therefore, that the emphasis
              in the consultation document is on the wider social determinants
              of health.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am pleased to tell Members that the World
              Health Organisation contributed to the consultation on ‘Investing
              for Health’. Its comments are extremely supportive and endorse
              our proposals as an excellent example of the World Health
              Organisation’s preferred approach.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Carson and other Members asked what we will
              achieve in practical terms. Effective monitoring and
              accountability arrangements will, of course, be essential to the
              success of the strategy and to ensuring that it goes beyond a
              consultation document, a discussion and a strategy. The
              ministerial group on public health consists of senior officials
              from all the Departments, and it has been fully involved in
              developing the strategy. Group members will, in their respective
              fields, continue to play a key role in supporting its
              implementation. The ministerial group on public health that I lead
              will also consider, in the light of the consultation responses,
              what additional monitoring arrangements are needed for the new
              interdepartmental approach to ensure that the strategy happens and
              produces results.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unsurprisingly smoking was referred to. It is
              one of the priority topics identified in ‘Investing for Health’.
              I share the Member’s concern about the number of young women who
              are taking up smoking. Our death rate from lung cancer among young
              women is already twice the western European average. The Health
              Promotion Agency has co-operated with the Midland Health Board
              region in the South to target smoking among young people through a
              television advertisement. We also looked at the importance of
              tackling smoking among young girls at school on an all- Ireland
              basis. The Department of Health and Children in Dublin has
              nominated a representative to our working group on tobacco that is
              developing an action plan to tackle smoking.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Dr Adamson for his contribution about
              the positive role that the Belfast healthy cities project is
              playing. That project is much in keeping with the proposed
              approach outlined in ‘Investing for Health’ by focusing on the
              wider social determinants and working to broaden participation in
              action for health. I am pleased to hear about the progress that is
              being made, and I anticipate that the healthy cities experience
              will be built on as the investing for health process moves
              forward.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Billy Hutchinson highlighted the need to
              maximise efficiency in the Health Service. Management and
              administrative costs in the health and personal social services (HPSS)
              are already closely monitored and controlled in order to maximise
              the resources that are available for care. Those costs amount to
              less than 2% of health and social service boards’ total
              expenditure, and an average of 4.5% of the expenditure of trusts.
              Of course, it is paramount that we stress not only the need to get
              more resources for health, social services and public safety but
              to make the best use of those resources once we have them.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with Mr Gallagher’s comments on the
              significance of the rise of TB. I assure him that the number of
              cases of TB is not increasing here. In the year 2000 the number of
              cases here was at its lowest ever. The schools BCG vaccine and TB
              testing programme has recommenced this term, starting with
              children who are due to leave school this year. Other children who
              have missed the BCG vaccine will have the chance to get it from
              September.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On Mr McCarthy’s point about radon, I am
              informed that the Environment and Heritage Service has offered
              90,000 free radon measurements to households, but so far only 20%
              of households have taken up that offer. If a measurement is above
              the action level set by the National Radiological Protection Board
              (NRPB), remedial action is recommended, and grant assistance might
              be available. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment
              is responsible for ensuring compliance with health and safety
              legislation in public buildings, workplaces and schools.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In regard to the safety of the measles, mumps
              and rubella (MMR) vaccine, my Department issued new information
              materials for parents and professionals in April. I agree with Mr
              Gallagher, who raised the point, and with other Members, that we
              must all stress the benefits and the necessity of immunisation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A common theme that runs through all the issues
              raised by Members is that there not only needs to be action within
              the realm of health and social services, but also on issues that
              do not respect organisational boundaries and that demand
              integrated strategic solutions.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am happy to report that good progress has
              already been made on the cross-departmental approach to addressing
              health issues. People have asked whether that would be a new
              beginning. Mr Morrow highlighted some of the actions that his
              Department is taking, and I am grateful to him and his officials
              for their contribution to the process. The Minister of Enterprise,
              Trade and Investment and I recently signed a joint statement of
              intent to address the issue of workplace health. The cost to the
              local economy of illness is immense, and we are committed to a
              programme of action to make workplaces healthier. I know that work
              will be done to establish an occupational health forum to meet
              these needs.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Department has also been working closely
              with the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development to
              address the serious issue of stress in rural communities.
              Officials in my Department have been working with the Department
              for Regional Development to pilot a health impact assessment of
              that Department’s regional transportation strategy. Those are
              examples of how, by working together, we can make a significant
              contribution to improving people’s health. Through ‘Investing
              for Health’ we will be identifying further opportunities for
              such an approach. That will involve close consideration by all
              agencies of the positive steps that they can take to promote
              health, as well as the monitoring of any negative factors that
              impede good health. Monitoring will be part of the strategy
              development.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">‘Investing for Health’ aims to improve
              health by broadening participation and action through partnerships
              which include community groups, voluntary organisations,
              businesses and statutory partners. It is important that people
              tell us what they need during the consultation period and during
              the implementation of the strategy.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Members who have highlighted that also have
              a vital role to play. I hope that Members will feel stimulated by
              today’s discussion to encourage the many people that they come
              across to respond to the consultation in a variety of forms. We
              have opened this up beyond the normal consultation processes —
              written responses and public meetings — by encouraging
              contributions through videotape or audio tape and other discussion
              forums. We have had a photographic exhibition sponsored by the ‘Belfast
              Telegraph’, and we have had sponsorship of drama from the Arts
              Council of Northern Ireland and others. There are a variety of
              ways in which people can make their views known.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that the Members who have shown such
              interest today will also encourage people to make their views
              known, both before the end of the consultation process on 31 May
              and as the implementation of the strategy develops in the future.
              I also encourage them to ask people to think about what more they
              can do in their own lives to help improve the well-being of their
              families, friends and communities.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the outset of today’s debate I said that I
              wanted the consultation process for ‘Investing for Health’ to
              be truly inclusive. Everyone has the right to have their voice
              heard on issues that affect them, and no issue has more universal
              relevance than health. Therefore I encourage everyone to
              contribute. I will be taking into account all the views put to me,
              and they will be used to draw up proposals for the implementation
              of the strategy, which I intend to put to the Executive in the
              autumn. Those will be published, together with a report on the
              outcome of the consultation process, and there will be an equality
              impact assessment.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The next step is to ensure, as Members have
              said, that we have sufficient arrangements and resources in place
              to ensure effective implementation of the strategy and effective
              monitoring arrangements to see how it is brought forward. My
              intention is that it will come into effect from April 2002.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank all the Members who took part in today’s
              debate. I hope that I have managed to address the issues they
              raised. Officials will scrutinise the record of the debate and, if
              there are points that I have missed, I will write to the Members
              concerned.</p>
