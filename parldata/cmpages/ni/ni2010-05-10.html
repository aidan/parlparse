      <p class="H4StageHeading">High Hedges Bill: Second Stage</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment (Mr Poots)</strong>: I beg to move</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That the Second Stage of the High Hedges Bill [NIA  15/09] be agreed.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The problems caused by high hedges should not be  underestimated. To be constantly in the shadow of a neighbouring high hedge can  significantly impair a person&rsquo;s enjoyment of his or her property. Furthermore,  problems with high hedges can escalate out of all proportion and give rise to  ill feeling and tension between neighbours. I am determined, through the Bill,  to help to resolve matters and to end disputes about high hedges between  neighbours.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">A scoping consultation carried out by my Department in 2005  highlighted the fact that problems relating to large evergreen and  semi-evergreen hedges were commonplace in all council areas. Most respondents  wanted legislation. The Bill introduces a formal system to encourage people to  resolve high hedges issues through negotiation and compromise without having to  take the more formal route of lodging a complaint.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill contains 20 clauses. I do not intend to comment on  every clause, but I would like to highlight the main issues. Clauses 1 and 2  set out the circumstances in which a complaint can be made and define a high  hedge for the purposes of the legislation. A complaint can be made by the owner  or occupier of a domestic property, and only where the reasonable enjoyment of  a property is being adversely affected by the height of a hedge situated in  land owned or occupied by another person will a complaint be valid. The Bill is  specifically designed to address the main problem identified in the scoping  study, namely dense screens of foliage caused by high hedges of an evergreen or  semi-evergreen nature.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 3 sets out the procedure by which councils will  process complaints. A complaint must be made to the council whose area contains  the land on which the hedge is situated. Councils have discretion to set a fee  for the making of a complaint. That is a payment for a service provided to the  complainant by the council. It is intended to enable councils to recover their  costs for administering the system without placing a financial burden on  ratepayers. The existence of a fee should act as a deterrent against frivolous  or vexatious complaints. To avoid the imposition of financial hardship on the  less well off, such as pensioners or those on a low income, a council may  decide to refund, waive or reduce fees as appropriate. A council will not  accept a complaint if it considers that the complainant has not provided  evidence of having taken all reasonable steps to resolve the matter or if it  considers that the complaint is frivolous or vexatious. Evidence of reasonable  steps to resolve the issue may include the keeping of records of discussions or  attempts at discussion between the parties, copies of letters sent to the hedge  owner by the complainant and records of meetings attended by the parties. Where  the council proceeds with the complaint, it must first decide whether the height  of the hedge adversely affects the complainant&rsquo;s reasonable enjoyment of his  property. If so, the council must then consider what action, if any, is  required.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">If the council decides that action should be taken, it will  issue a remedial notice. Clause 4 states that a remedial notice will specify  the height to which a hedge must be reduced. It may specify other actions such  as crown lifting or thinning. The remedial notice will also specify the time  frame within which the work must be carried out. Before issuing any notice,  councils will take into consideration other environmental factors, such as bird  nesting and bat roosts. A remedial notice may not specify the removal of any  hedge or a reduction in its height to less than two metres. That ensures that a  balance is achieved between the right to enjoy property and the benefits and  amenity value that a well-maintained hedge can provide. A remedial notice  remains in force even if a property changes ownership, and it will be  registered as a statutory charge on that property. That means that any new  owners will bear the responsibility for compliance. The remedial notice may  also include maintenance requirements to ensure that the problem does not  recur.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Naturally, the hedge owner and the complainant have the right  of appeal against the issue or non-issue of a remedial notice, or against the  relaxation of its requirements. Clauses 6 and 7 set out details in relation to  the appeals procedure. Appeals will be determined by the Northern Ireland  Valuation Tribunal. That will involve consideration and review of the case  files as well as site visits. Following an appeal, a remedial notice may be  withdrawn or varied, or, in a case where a council has decided not to issue a  remedial notice, the decision may be rescinded and a remedial notice issued on  behalf of the council.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 9 creates an offence of non-compliance with the  terms of a remedial notice that carries a fine of up to &pound;1,000. Continued  failure to carry out the required remedial work may then result in further  fines and, ultimately, daily fines. In cases of non-compliance with the terms  of the remedial notice, councils will have a discretionary power to enter the  land where the hedge is situated and carry out the work specified. The council  will be able to recover the cost of the work from the owner of the hedge. Any  unpaid expenses will be registered as a charge on the property.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 11 protects the council against civil action where  it has acted in a default situation and performed remedial works on a hedge  which has subsequently died. That protection will only apply where a council  has adopted a best practice approach and been non-negligent in its actions. For  a hedge to die as a consequence of council action would be most unusual. A  council official or appeal official making a site visit to inspect the hedge is  required to give at least 24 hours&rsquo; notice to the hedge owner. Councils are  also required to give the hedge owner seven days&rsquo; notice of intention to enter  land to perform remedial work.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The experience of England  and Wales,  where similar legislative provisions have been in place since 2005, indicates  that this issue can be dealt with successfully. My Department will produce  various guidance documents covering all the key issues to accompany the Bill&rsquo;s  operation. They will be developed in liaison with local councils to ensure that  they are relevant and fit for purpose and will include guidance for  complainants and hedge owners, guidance for councils to facilitate the  assessment of cases and guidance with respect to the appeals process.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill will have a positive and practical impact on the  lives of people suffering detriment due to neighbouring high hedges. It will  focus attention on high hedge problems and should, as a consequence, result in  improved relations between neighbours and enable more disputes to be resolved  amicably, without recourse to the lodging of formal complaints. All public  representatives know constituents who have been afflicted by the misery of  having to put up with being next door to an unreasonably high hedge. It really  is an affliction because nothing can be done about it currently. The High  Hedges Bill seeks to remedy that situation, and I commend it to the Assembly.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for the Environment (Mr Boylan)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a  Cheann Comhairle. Mar Chathaoirleach an Choiste Comhshaoil, cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh  an Bhille um F&aacute;lta Ard. As Chairperson of the Committee for the Environment, I  welcome the High Hedges Bill. It contains provisions that will provide a means  of tackling high hedge problems that affect domestic properties. It introduces  a way for people who feel that their domestic property is affected adversely by  a high hedge to lodge a formal complaint with their local council after they  have tried unsuccessfully to resolve the matter through neighbourly discussion.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">At its meeting on 15 April 2010, the Committee was briefed  by officials on the outcome of the departmental consultation on the Bill.  Members were informed that the Bill focuses specifically and narrowly on  dealing with high hedges that relate to problems between neighbours; it does  not cover issues relating to single trees, roots, leaves and so forth.  Nonetheless, I am sure that all Members will welcome the Bill as, no doubt, we  have all come across or heard of disputes between neighbours over what can be  the very divisive issue of nuisance hedges.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">One of the main concerns expressed to officials at the  meeting was the issue of fees. Members were informed that the Department  intends to give individual councils discretion in setting fees for  complainants. The Committee expressed the view that that could lead to big  differences between local authorities: one council could set a fee at &pound;300,  whereas another could set it at &pound;30. Similarly, some types of resident, such as  pensioners, could be required to pay fees in one council area, whereas those in  another could be exempt. The Committee has asked for more information on  charging regimes in other regions and will consider the implications of that  flexible approach during Committee Stage. It is possible that the Committee  will feel that more controls should be incorporated into the legislation to avoid  large discrepancies arising between councils.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Further concerns were expressed about the ability of people  from lower socio-economic groups to pay a fee for complaints and whether that  would end up being prohibitive. There was also concern about paying the costs  of specialists, such as tree surgeons, if required. Officials informed the  Committee that the Minister is minded to include a cap on fees in the  legislation, and the Committee was inclined to agree with that approach.  However, the Committee also feels that guidance on the level of fees would be  useful, and members welcomed the officials&rsquo; commitment to provide guidance to  complainants and councils.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Another concern around fees was the idea of the complainant  paying upfront to try to alleviate problems that they face from the high hedges  of a third party. Officials informed members that the Bill will create a level  playing field and that it is not trying to allocate blame. However, members  felt that the idea of a complainant who has been vindicated but still has to  pick up the tab for a fee is something that they want to look into further. The  feeling was that, if the complainant&rsquo;s neighbour had been more neighbourly,  there would have been no need to complain in the first place. Members were  concerned that the perception will be that the complainant is being penalised  because their neighbour was not prepared to take action. The Committee will, no  doubt, revisit that matter at Committee Stage.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Another area of concern was the appeals body; the Valuation  Tribunal. Members agreed that using a body that is already established is a  good idea, as it removes the need to go through the costly and time-consuming  process of identifying and appointing persons to handle appeals relating to  high hedges. However, there was a concern that, with the appearance of  solicitors and barristers, significant legal costs would start to ensue.  Officials were of the view that there may be a flurry of appeals if and when  this legislation becomes operational but, as time goes by, the number will  diminish rapidly. Members remain concerned that, although the problem is not  envisaged, those disputes can become very hostile and may end up in tribunals  where legal aid costs may start to escalate rapidly. Although the Bill aims to  encourage people to resolve high hedges disputes informally through discussion  and compromise, we all know that, for some people, that is simply not an  option. Again, we will explore that issue further when the Bill comes to the  Committee.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">12.15 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As soon as the House refers the Bill to the Committee, the  Committee will call for written submissions from interested organisations and  individuals, and members will be extremely interested to hear their views. I  look forward to an ongoing good working relationship with officials to ensure  that the Committee is able to scrutinise the legislation properly. Thar ceann  an Choiste Comhshaoil tugaim taca&iacute;ocht do phrionsabail an Bhille. On behalf of  the Committee, I support the principles of the Bill.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>: I  commend Minister Poots for bringing forward legislation that has been sought by  and will have a direct impact on those on the ground and will continue to make  the House relevant to those people&rsquo;s needs and aspirations.The legislation is  balanced and takes a solution-focused approach, and it is weighted  appropriately towards encouraging people to look for sensible negotiations and  compromise before taking legal routes. That is to be commended. In areas where  there are difficulties, people should adopt the spirit of the legislation,  which is, in effect, to seek a solution and to keep a record of that search for  a solution, before resorting to legislation. Environmental concerns about bats  and other species were identified, and they have been addressed appropriately.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As a councillor on Ards Borough Council, I declare an  interest. Councils cannot be expected to constantly pick up the bill for every  piece of legislation that comes along. The fee is appropriate. Equally, it  should be measured. As in all other areas, people who find it difficult to pay  should not be denied access to that form of redress and justice, so the  situation for those on a low income and pensioners should be looked at.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill is a win for ratepayers and, on balance, for  common sense. Hedges, in themselves, provide an amenity, and, if they are well  maintained, they can encourage good neighbourliness and create a win-win  situation for everybody. On the other hand, some people feel that they have no  responsibility to their neighbours. They feel that they have no stewardship  over their own property and that they are not responsible for how it impacts on  the amenities of others, so, rightly, the Bill addresses that problem.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Chairperson spoke well on behalf of the Committee, and  I endorse his comments and the nature of the legislation. Where there are  difficulties, I appeal to people to genuinely seek a spirit of compromise and  to look towards their responsibilities as neighbours and as good stewards.  Prevention is better than cure. Ultimately, however, the Bill is a win for the  House, because it deals with a real issue that has to be addressed. People  asked us to do something about it; however, as the Chairperson said, up to now,  nothing could be done. The House is redressing that situation and giving people  the response that they asked for. I genuinely hope that very few cases will  have to go down the legal route of paying fees.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  Does the Member agree that it is disappointing that the legislation had to be  introduced at all? When a hedge reaches a certain height, common sense should  prevail. Good neighbourliness, civil relationships and common sense could have  removed the need for legislation.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>: The  Member for South Antrim made his point well,  and that is the essence of the legislation. We do not want things to reach that  point, and, in many ways, the legislation will act as a deterrent and a  preventative measure. Equally, people will no longer be able to ignore their  responsibility to respect their neighbours&rsquo; quality of life and amenities. The  House will legislate to ensure that that ignorance comes to an end. I commend  the Minister for bringing that legislation forward.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I  also welcome the progress of a Bill to deal with the problem of high hedges. To  the extent that the Bill recommends that local councils be given a role in  dealing with high hedges, I declare an interest as a member of Carrickfergus  Borough Council.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In common with many Members, I have been contacted by  constituents whose enjoyment of their home and property has been blighted by  inconsiderate neighbours who have allowed their high hedges to cut off  daylight. I had been pursuing a private Member&rsquo;s Bill, particularly after the  previous Minister of the Environment said that he would not pursue such  legislation during the lifetime of the current Assembly. I welcome Minister  Poots&rsquo;s U-turn on his predecessor&rsquo;s approach.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I praise the Assembly&rsquo;s Research Services for providing me  with background information as I pursued the private Member&rsquo;s legislation. In  legislating, one of the most significant decisions to be taken is on the nature  of statutory involvement. The options that were presented to me included a  formal, statutory and expensive bureaucratic role, such as that employed by the  Planning Service. I, in common with the Minister and the Department, concluded  that that would not be appropriate. The Bill outlines the most appropriate  mechanism, which is that neighbours should be required to attempt to resolve  their differences over their hedges before statutory bodies, such as local  councils, become directly involved. I hope that the introduction of that  requirement will resolve many disputes at an early stage and improve relationships  between neighbours, whereas the involvement of the councils has the potential  to make those relationships worse. I hope that the Bill will create pressure  for local resolutions between neighbours without outside involvement. As other  Members said, that is largely the route that has been followed in England and Wales, where it appears to have  been relatively successful.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I will pursue the issue in Committee, but it would be  helpful for the Minister to elaborate on the definition of a high hedge that  has &ldquo;two or more evergreens&rdquo;. In the Bill, an evergreen is defined as:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;an evergreen tree or shrub or a semi-evergreen tree  or shrub.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">What hedges will be excluded by that definition?  Why will such hedges be excluded? Dense hedging can arise from a variety of  other sources. For six months of the year, heavy leafage from other types of  trees and hedges could cause as many difficulties for homeowners. To determine  whether the definition of a high hedge needs to be widened, I would like the  Minister to provide further information.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I agree with the procedures that have been outlined. In the  first instance, neighbours should attempt to resolve the problem. In the  absence of reasonableness at that stage, the relevant council will become  involved. However, to minimise the involvement of statutory agencies and the  associated costs, it would be useful to require neighbours to take the first  step.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As we experience the impact of the new legislation, it will  be important to have a mechanism for dealing with people who make spurious  complaints and involve the councils unnecessarily. Should a neighbour who is  unreasonable in not resolving an issue incur some of the costs of the fee? It  would be unfair for homeowners who have been adversely affected to bear the  entire cost, despite having done everything possible to resolve the problem. It  would be unfair for an unreasonable neighbour who has blighted their enjoyment  of their home to expect them to pay additional fees. An agreement on how to  strike that balance could further incentivise neighbours to reach a local  resolution. The expectation that people who are unreasonable will face  additional fees should increase the likelihood of an early local resolution.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I agree that the involvement of local government in  finalising appropriate guidance would be useful, because a consistent approach  on the part of neighbouring councils would be helpful. We do not want to see  vastly different approaches being taken and the public becoming confused,  should they move from one council area to another and face a similar problem.  It would be helpful to everyone if local government were involved in developing  consistent guidance notes which, ultimately, officers and councils would  follow.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The serving of a remedial notice is a useful mechanism. It  allows defaulting owners to decide whom they will employ or to do the work  themselves and to rectify the situation at minimum cost. I agree that we must  have further legislative powers to ensure that the work is carried out, should  one have an unreasonable neighbour. I agree that any individual who is so  stubborn as to ignore the decision of officers and councillors should be  subject to a fine. Ultimately, there should be a charge on the property so that  there is no doubt or dispute over whether the issue can be dealt with. That  sort of power should encourage more reasonableness between those who are  involved in the process.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I agree that there has to be an appeals mechanism to ensure  a degree of independence in cases where people are dissatisfied with decisions  that have been made. However, we do not want to create another quango. The  Valuation Tribunal comprises individuals who have legal experience and  experience of valuation and properties. With that comes knowledge of properties  and boundaries etc. Again, there is a lay person who is not involved on either  side, and that appears to me to be a reasonable balance.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 8 provides the power to gain access to the relevant  property. That power has to be available in instances in which an assessment  has to be carried out but the neighbour will not provide reasonable access to  appropriately assess the situation. However, it is important that anyone who is  going to enter someone else&rsquo;s property gives notice of his or her intention,  and I see 24 hours being mentioned. Indeed, there should be ID involved, so  that there is no dispute that this person has the appropriate statutory  authority. The boundary or perimeter must also be left as secure as it was in  the first place.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 10 requires the owner to carry out the work and the  occupier, who may be the person who is causing the difficulty, to work and to  enable it to happen. That gives the power to the owner of the property to  ensure that the work will be carried out, even if he or she has an  unco-operative tenant. That is appropriate.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 12 talks about corporate bodies. The neighbour may  well be a company limited by guarantee; it may be a corporate body, rather than  an individual. That is appropriate.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 16 enables the Department to modify the criteria in  the light of experience gained. We should not require extensive new  legislation, if it needs to be altered in the light of experience and it is  appropriate that change can occur through that mechanism. However, there are  some sensitive issues, particularly as we could be affecting people&rsquo;s homes. It  is important that we tread lightly, particularly when changing the legislation,  to ensure that it is appropriate. It would be helpful if the Minister could  clarify why such language is used in clause 18. Why will changes be largely by  negative legislation, rather than by affirmative legislation? Such sensitive  changes affecting a home and one&rsquo;s personal property should occur in a manner  that the Assembly is comfortable with.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In general, I support the legislation as presented.  However, it may be possible to slightly amend and refine it in the light of  experience at Committee Stage.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">12.30 pm</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>: I  am thankful that, on this occasion, I do not have to declare membership of  Coleraine Borough Council, and I am sure that the day will come when no Member  of this august body will have to do that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The debate is welcome. Many people are relieved that the  Bill has progressed to this stage, and I thank the Minister for that.  Nevertheless, there is still some astonishment that we are reaching only this  stage eight years after the same legislation was introduced in Britain.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I should not focus entirely on the much-picked-on  leylandii, which appears to be the greatest offender, because there are others.  Nevertheless, it is an opportunity in planning terms to advise people who are  considering planting hedges to choose varieties that are indigenous to this  country and, as far as possible, not to try other species. I am sure that  people discovered, to their misfortune, that hedges all over the country were  killed off during the recent bad weather because they could not stand the cold.  I cannot blame the Planning Service for those crimes, because it does not  choose tree species.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill is important because it concerns people who have  been robbed of the right to natural daylight. The Minister said that he does  not want to impose his will on local councils, which is understandable and fair  enough. Nevertheless, there is a risk that, without robust control from the Department  of the Environment, local councils may vary widely in the way in which they  deal with the problem. I have been a local councillor for 33 years, and I know  that it is in no one&rsquo;s interests to pick rows or to become an adjudicator  between neighbours. Therefore, ministerial guidance is a necessary part of the  Bill.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  Does the Member accept that the Bill&rsquo;s appeal mechanism should ensure that,  should there be partiality at council level, there is independence? That appeal  mechanism is appropriate to deal with the issue.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>:  The Member mentioned the appeal mechanism in his contribution. It is important,  and it may, to some degree, let local councillors off the hook in deciding what  should happen. However, local councils do not have a good record on  environmental issues. We have only to think of how councils deal with litter  and impose fines on people who are guilty of litter offences. We debated the  issue in the House last week, and it would be interesting if the Minister were  to enquire about how different councils enforce that legislation, which, in  some ways, is similar to the topic of this debate.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The legislation is welcome, and I hope that the Minister&rsquo;s  promise to have it in place before the end of this Assembly&rsquo;s lifetime is  delivered. I do not question that he will do that. I fully understand the  limited time that is available, and we are grateful that the legislation will  go through and will not be cast aside.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Given that local councils will be charged with the  responsibility of administering the legislation, it would be useful for the  Minister to indicate whether he is talking about the current 26 councils or the  elusive 11. My prediction is that it will be the 26 councils. I apologise for  veering slightly off the subject, but I simply ask the Minister to ensure that  the existing councils do not simply pay lip service and that they are given  every support in delivering the Bill.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, despite my reservations, I welcome the Bill.  However, I worry that many people, who are now elderly and living on meagre  pensions, planted leylandii in the past, as I and others did, and they now may  face horrendous bills to have them pruned or removed because they have grown  much higher than was intended. The bill for such work can be horrendous, and  anyone who has employed a tree surgeon knows that they do not come cheap.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill relates to domestic property and the cutting off  of natural light. Members will know that retired people spend a great deal of  time in their gardens either appreciating the plants that they have grown or  simply enjoying the fresh air. I know many people who no longer have that  privilege because the hedges around their gardens have practically engulfed the  daylight. I am not sure that the proposed legislation will deal with that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The main point is to ensure that a consistent approach is  taken, that genuine cases are identified and dealt with and that local councils  do not become bogged down in frivolous complaints that are more about disputes  among neighbours that might go back three or four generations. The Bill should  be about high hedges and nothing more.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Common sense has been mentioned. However, Members know that  common sense does not always prevail. That is why there is legislation for most  aspects of life. It may be that in medieval times, people could actually sit  down, discuss their issues and come to a decision. Today, I am afraid, that is  long since gone.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, I support the Second Stage of the High Hedges  Bill. I apologise to people who have planted leylandii trees, trimmed them and  kept them in good order.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: The  Alliance Party supports the High Hedges Bill. A number of our public  representatives have been approached by residents who have problems with  neighbouring hedges and who have, at times, been unable to achieve resolution  to disputes due to the lack of legislation in Northern Ireland governing the  height and maintenance of hedges.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">However, the Alliance Party is concerned that the proposed  legislation focuses only on problems that are associated with hedges and does  not intend to address problems that relate to roots of trees and single trees.  A single tree can act as a barrier to a property&rsquo;s light. Roots can seriously  affect the garden of an adjacent property or an adjoining driveway. The  proposed legislation should provide a means to address such problems.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Of course, given that councils will administer complaints,  the role that the proposed legislation will give them is highly important. DOE  must provide district councils with the necessary guidance to deal with  complaints, particularly in how a complainant can provide evidence of having  attempted to solve a problem prior to making a complaint. In many cases,  communication or mediation may not have been documented, which means that it  may be difficult for a complainant to provide evidence of it. My party would  like more clarification on how DOE intends to deal with complaints that relate  to land or domestic property that is vacant or for which there is no  identifiable occupier.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Under the English system, someone who wants a high hedge to  be investigated must pay a fee of around &pound;500 or more. There has been some  indication that that fee has meant that people have been deterred from  complaining. DOE needs to provide guidance to councils so that a consistent fee  can be operated across the board. It also needs to consider reduced fees for  elderly people and those who receive means-tested benefits.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Some people who are responsible for problems that are  caused by high hedges may find it financially difficult to employ a tree  surgeon if a notice is served on them. Financial assistance should be  considered, because it may be necessary for people who cannot afford the  required work to carry it out at short notice. The Department must provide  information and educate the public on the new legislation, and resources may be  required to advise individuals on how to maintain hedges and to avoid problems  in the first place.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Dealing with neighbourly disputes can have a detrimental  effect on the health of those involved because of stress and pressure. The  Department must indicate as early as possible the time frame for dealing with  each complaint so that problems are not dragged out and people are not faced  with unnecessary delays, which cause more stress and anxiety.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Alliance Party supports the High Hedges Bill, which  will assist householders when mediation fails. It looks forward to some means  of dealing with the problem to formally resolve disputes between neighbours.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: I  also welcome the High Hedges Bill. It has been much talked about since the  return of devolution, and I am glad that it is now before the House. We have  heard much today of neighbourliness and common sense, and today is one of the  rare occasions on which I have agreed with John Dallat.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Unfortunately, many of us who have dealt with these cases  recognise that there is often a lack of common sense and neighbourliness among  those who are making their neighbours&rsquo; lives a misery. All Members will have  had people coming to them because their neighbour&rsquo;s hedges are blocking their  light or hanging over their property, and often, despite their best efforts to  reach an accommodation with their neighbour, they find that they do not get  very far and need assistance to resolve the issue. In many cases, Members will  also have found that councils are powerless to provide that assistance. They  can go down the route of tackling the matter on environmental health grounds,  but there is no legislation to help councils to take the actions required. At  least this Bill will give councils those powers.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">At Second Stage, we are obviously addressing the broad  principles of the Bill, and I do not believe that any Member will have  difficulties with those. However, there are a few issues, some of which have  already been discussed today, such as which hedges are to be covered by the  legislation, which the Committee looks forward to examining during Committee  Stage.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Another matter that I raised when statements on high hedges  were made previously in the House is that of mediation. I am aware of instances  in my constituency in which elderly people felt uncomfortable about approaching  neighbours about a nuisance hedge because of previous arguments. The Bill  provides that individuals must initially try to find a resolution on their own.  However, it is important that councils are given direction from the Department  on how to help individuals who are nervous about approaching their neighbours.  I recognise that the legislation envisages councils being impartial and  independent third parties in the complaints procedure and that it is difficult  for councils or councillors to provide guidance. However, in many  constituencies, mediation groups and services are available, and perhaps  councils could work with those groups and direct complainants to them.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Another issue that has been discussed today is fees, and  there is broad agreement that that issue must be further examined. Flexibility  will be given to councils, but it is important that guidance is given on the  upper limit to fees that can be applied. Councils will also be given discretion  to provide refunds or discounts to certain vulnerable groups, and although fees  are necessary to stop trivial complaints, it is important that they are not set  at such a level as to disincentivise pensioners and low-income families from  making complaints about nuisance hedges. Indeed, it has been said before that  individuals who do not act in a good neighbourly fashion and who do not take  action on a hedge that causes grief to their neighbours can simply sit back and  do nothing, knowing that the individual who has been impacted upon or the  council and, by extension, the ratepayer, will have to pick up the fee. That is  not particularly good, and we will wish to look at that as a Committee.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">12.45 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">A final issue is whether a mechanism should be included for  a group complaint in the case of a large piece of property that perhaps backs  on to three or four residences. A collective complaint may include those three  or four households or they each may have to make an individual complaint, which  might involve individual fees. The Committee may consider that issue, and the  Minister&rsquo;s guidance on that will be useful.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I support the Bill, and I look forward to examining it in  closer detail in Committee.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McKay</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I support the Bill, which, as other  Members said, is greatly needed. High hedges may seem a minor issue to people  who are not directly affected by them, but they can have a detrimental effect  on people&rsquo;s quality of life. High hedges spoil views, block out sunlight, and  so on. That can often lead to direct conflict between neighbours and to  stressful situations. A process is needed to arrest such situations before they  escalate. It is only right that attempts to resolve the situation take place  between the relevant parties initially and, hopefully, the legislation will be  preventative and the processes will not need to be enacted.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Other Members said that the issue of fees must be  considered further. An assurance should be given that fees will not differ  greatly among councils and that there will be a degree of parity among  councils. That needs to be considered in much greater detail at Committee.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I also agree with the Chairperson and other Members that  the Valuation Tribunal should be used, because that mechanism has already been  established so it will save costs. There is little doubt that the disputes that  we have discussed can become difficult, with opposing parties becoming  increasingly polarised as disputes continue in a number of cases. Therefore, it  is important that the Bill is as fair as possible to the complainant and the  hedge owner and that the process that is put in place is robust. I agree with  the Minister that we need to consider experiences elsewhere to ensure that the  legislation is fit for purpose and does not adversely impact on those on lower  incomes, as the Committee Chairperson and other Members also highlighted.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I will not go into any greater detail, because other  Members have covered the issue well. The Committee looks forward to  scrutinising the Bill in much greater detail. I emphasise the need for people  on lower incomes and those who could be adversely impacted to have some degree  of protection.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  declare as interest as a member of North Down Borough Council. As has been  indicated, the legislation will be administered largely by councils. I see at  least one Member who has freed himself from councils looking a bit demob happy.  He is tut-tutting that I have such links. When John Dallat referred to his  preference that indigenous breeds be planted, I wondered whether, by some  bizarre dream, David Vance had managed to wander into the Chamber.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I also declare an interest as vice-president of the Local  Government Association, and I welcome what everyone will accept as  root-and-branch reform of the legislation. It has received universal welcome. I  was half expecting some Members from the opposite Benches to complain about  Special Branch, but the legislation is something that even they can agree with.  I appreciate that many of the points have been covered, so I do not intend to reiterate  those. The Bill has received a universal welcome from parties in the Chamber,  councils and individual citizens.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As another Member said, the legislation is unusual in that,  in an ideal world, we hope that it is never used. Vast numbers of people have  good relationships with their neighbours and act responsibly when it comes to  their hedges. Therefore, it is a pity that such legislation is necessary. If  everyone were to act responsibly, there would be no need for the Bill.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">An appropriate balance has been struck on fees, and we will  be looking at the detail at a later stage. However, we are all aware of  occasions when a dispute between neighbours in our constituency loses some  perspective. In such situations, unless applicants are required to pay a fee, the  danger is that there could be a rash of utterly vexatious applications.  Therefore, there must be some deterrent to prevent people from causing their  neighbours problems. Irrespective of whether we come from an urban, rural or  suburban constituency, we are aware of many genuine cases in which,  unfortunately, one neighbour has acted irresponsibly. I am aware of cases in  which pensioners have felt intimidated or have been given short shrift by their  neighbour when they try to press the issue. Those people need to be protected.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There have been teething problems with the implementation  of similar legislation in England  and Wales.  Therefore, we must ensure that our legislation is right, and given the time  that has been spent on it so far, I hope that the broad thrust of it is right.  Some details will need to be teased out at Committee Stage. For example, have  we got the balance right between ensuring that there is uniformity across Northern Ireland  and allowing councils a degree of individual action? A cap has been put on  fees, and, in Committee, we will be looking to see whether that cap goes far  enough or whether a tighter regime, with a set fee across Northern Ireland, is  needed.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee will also need to look at the opportunity for  councils either to vary or waive a fee. Members who follow what tends to happen  in the courts will know that there is a broad rule of thumb that, when someone  complains or takes an action against someone else, the winning side does not  have to pay the costs. Another area that needs to be examined is instances in  which neighbours have a genuine complaint. If, after investigation, the  decision is found in their favour, there may be an argument to be made as to  whether the party who transgressed should pick up the entire bill in order that  the applicant might recoup the fee. We may need to look at whether variation  should apply in such situations.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Going by the response of my council and others, the  Committee will need to look at the detail to ensure that councils feel that  they are properly indemnified, as the matter should be cost-neutral to them.  However, the broad thrust of the legislation is welcome.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As Mr Dallat said, the legislation will not make headlines  in the &lsquo;News Letter&rsquo;, &lsquo;The Irish News&rsquo; or the &lsquo;Belfast Telegraph&rsquo;, but to many  people, this is an important issue that affects quality of life. If their light  is being blocked out, or if their enjoyment of their garden, their conservatory  or their back room is consistently being spoiled by an enormous hedge, that  becomes their number one issue. If the Assembly can adopt a common-sense  approach to provide that quality of life, the High Hedges Bill will be  worthwhile, and something of which we can be proud.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As a member of the Committee for the Environment, I look  forward to scrutinising the Bill to ensure that we get the detail and the  implementation right. I strongly support the legislation.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kinahan</strong>:  I am extremely pleased to be able to speak on such an important Bill. It may  seem minor to some, but it is very important to all those who want to enjoy  their houses without experiencing any problems. I also declare an interest as a  councillor in south Antrim.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is worth mentioning that it is sad that we have to bring  such rules and regulations into issues on which people cannot agree. I welcome  the touchy-feely side to the Bill, which makes every effort to make sure that  things are sorted out without confrontation. In many aspects of life, we need  less regulation, and too often we set up rules, regulations and systems that  actually cause confrontation. For example, in the planning world, a developer  tries to put as many houses as he can on a site, and the first time that the  people living next to the site know about it is when they have their chance to  object. Therefore, confrontation starts right at the beginning of the process.  In too many aspects of life, we have confrontation because we have rules.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Today we have something that is very clever, and I  congratulate the Minister, the Department, and, indeed, my colleagues who started  the idea off in the previous Assembly. We are going for something that has a  soft method of dealing with the matters in question, because it starts with the  intention of getting those who are involved to sort the issues out themselves  and then passes them on to councils so that they can be independent and  impartial mediators. If that fails, there are always the MLAs and whoever else  can help &mdash; we do not want to leave ourselves out of the equation.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is essential that the Bill provides for an appeals process  and that any decision that is made will be binding. I welcome many more aspects  of the Bill, and many Members touched on those. I will deal with one or two  little matters that others did not raise. For example, the Bill refers to an  area of 0&middot;2 hectares. That is actually a huge area, and if there are enough  trees in that area, when do they become hedges? We need more clarification on  that. In my constituency of South Antrim,  there are one or two ongoing disputes where trees have become thick hedges that  are stopping the light and making it impossible for the neighbour involved to  live there. We need more clarification on that issue.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Last week, when discussing a different matter, I mentioned  my concern that councils do not know who owns every bit of land. A dispute  could go on and on, because people cannot identify who owns a piece of land.  Councils need to find a way of ascertaining who owns or is responsible for  land, otherwise we will not be able to resolve the issue.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">When cutting hedges, we also need to take care that we  remember the nesting season, the bird life and the insects, and so forth, that  are in those hedges. We cannot just cut them down at any time of year. Also,  when I was canvassing last week, I saw weeds in hedges. It is all very well having  hedges, but I know of somebody who had two or three hedges next to them that  were so full of weeds, they were generating a smell and gathering rubbish. We  should keep that in mind when we look at the Bill in Committee.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I was amused to read towards the end of the Bill the  reference to the right to transmit documents electronically. Much as I love  electronic mail, we must remember that there is a mass of people out there who  do not use it. Therefore, we must use the normal methods of communication at the  same time, rather than relying entirely on e-mail and computers.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I congratulate everyone who has been involved in  formulating the Bill. It is a very clever mechanism to get things resolved, and  I look forward to seeing it come before the Committee and to all of us working  together.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I support the Second Stage of the high trees and hedges legislation. If there  was one issue that was important on the doorsteps, it was this legislation. I  say that in all honesty, because in the past five weeks, I have been tramping  the roads of Strangford and wearing the leather off my shoes at least once &mdash; I  am on to my second pair. There is great interest in the issue, so I am pleased  that Second Stage is before the Assembly today.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">People were encouraged when I mentioned to them that the  Assembly was working on the issue. When the debate is over, I intend to get  extra copies of the Hansard report and to make them available for the people  who contact me. A brave few will get their copy of the Hansard report through the  post in the next day or two, and that will show that the Assembly is making  legislative changes on the things that matter.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">1.00 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">One of people&rsquo;s greatest concerns as the summer approaches  is the growth of trees. Trees that were once 4 ft or 5 ft are now perhaps 30 ft  and are still growing. That is an indication of what people are concerned  about. Over the past few weeks, I visited houses that were all different  heights. Some were surrounded by trees that were higher than the houses, and  the impact of those trees was, therefore, greater than in other places. High  hedges and trees shut out light and prevent people from being able to see the  sun rising and getting value from that. That indicates how important the issue  is. People are also concerned about high trees in strong winds. When trees sway  in particularly strong winds, people think to themselves, &ldquo;My goodness, what  happens if that tree falls on top of my house?&rdquo;. Over the years, many people  have requested that legislation in Northern   Ireland follow the relevant legislation in the UK mainland,  and we are coming close to that. I pay tribute to the Minister of the  Environment, Edwin Poots, for working so hard to bring forward the legislation.  He is a man of the people, because he knows what the issues are, and the issue  of high hedges is a critical one for many people.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to give an example of how high hedges affect people.  I think that my colleague Peter Weir touched on this point earlier. A young  woman, who has a young son, has been crippled with a rare back condition, and I  finally managed to get the Health Department and the Social Development  Department to see sense and build an extension to enable her to move the bed  from her living room into a fit-for-purpose living room. However, the woman found  the room depressing because of the height of the trees, which were only a  matter of feet away. She told me that the light in the room always has to be  switched on, even during daylight, and that she does not liking lying in the  room because it makes her feel down and depressed. That is a critical issue for  someone who is profoundly disabled. I cannot wait for the legislation to be  passed and for the 40 ft trees around her bungalow to be trimmed to an  acceptable height. I am pleased and thankful that the legislation applies to  evergreen and semi-evergreen hedges and trees. That is good news for that  woman.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It seems that high hedges and trees have the capacity to  bring out the worst in some neighbours. I am sure that other elected  representatives will have seen that at times. It is my desire that the  legislation will help to address that matter. The legislation is not a stick  with which to beat the owners of the trees but will work both ways. One of my  constituents has 8 ft trees, and her neighbour wants her to cut them to 5 ft.  The neighbourhood has detached houses with large gardens, and 8 ft trees are  certainly not out of character in the area. The legislation will allow for  proper mediation between neighbours and will, I hope, help to end that dispute.  It is not all about wielding the big stick, which is probably the wrong  terminology to use in that regard.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister and his Department have ensured that  complaints will now be acted on. If a complaint is lodged, the goal is for the  hedges and trees concerned to be cut to an acceptable limit and within a  reasonable period of time, and those who fail to follow the directives to cut  their trees will face fines for non-compliance. It is hoped that the  legislation will help to solve neighbourhood disputes and ensure that a common  sense approach is followed. There will soon be a format and mechanism for  sorting out problems and coming to a sensible, satisfactory conclusion. The  operation of similar legislation on the mainland is already showing the  benefits of that approach.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Members and the public in Strangford know better than most  that I am always ready and willing to help with constituency issues, whatever  they may be. No issue is too small for me. I look forward to the day when,  instead of saying to constituents that nothing can be done, I can point them in  the right direction and get them the help and assistance that they need to  reach a satisfactory conclusion for everyone. I congratulate the Minister and  his Department on the hard work that they have done in making the legislation a  reality. It is long overdue, and shaded neighbours throughout the Province  thank the Minister and his Department for that.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I am grateful for Members&rsquo; valuable and informative  contributions to the debate, and I now wish to respond to a few of them.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Roy Beggs spoke about semi-evergreens, which is a standard  horticultural term. He wanted to know whether evergreens can lose their leaves  in certain climates and regions. He also asked why the owner of a hedge does  not have to pay. A balance must be struck. The complainant is asking for the  high hedge problem to be addressed and, therefore, it is right that he or she  should pay a fee. Hedge owners will have to meet the cost of trimming hedges,  and those who are financially disadvantaged can obtain help from council  services to do so. However, I am open to the suggestion that, where hedge  owners have been particularly negligent and obstructive in dealing with the  issue, councils may be able to impose some of the cost burden on them.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Dallat asked whether we are going to restrict the sale of  leylandii. However, the problem is not evergreen trees; the problem is where  they are planted and how they are maintained. The issue is similar to the one  concerning dangerous dogs: are there bad dogs or just bad owners? Very often,  it is people&rsquo;s ownership and maintenance of hedges that is the problem, not the  hedges themselves. Mr Dallat took the approach that these foreigners are to  blame for everything. However, I caution that we cannot blame foreign species  of trees for everything, because the Castlewellan Gold originated in County Down.  Perhaps the Chairman of the Environment Committee, Mr Boylan, can identify to  Mr Dallat exactly where Castlewellan is.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>: I  assure the Minister that it was not my intention to introduce xenophobia into a  debate on trees. However, I remind him that his Department advises people to  choose natural species.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I am sure Mr Dallat recognises that, on this occasion, I  am being slightly facetious. It is good to have a sense of humour now and  again.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Anna Lo mentioned Land and Property Services. In certain  circumstances, vacant land can revert to the Crown. She also asked why  deciduous trees are not included in the legislation. The scoping consultation  conducted by my Department showed that the main problem is the dense, thick  foliage of high hedges that are near domestic property. The Bill has been  specifically drafted to tackle that considerable problem, which causes so many  neighbourhood disputes. She also asked why tree roots were not included.  However, that matter can be dealt with through civil actions in the courts,  particularly where roots are affecting sewerage pipes, wall foundations or  pathways on other people&rsquo;s properties. In those circumstances, neighbours can  reasonably deal with the issue through the existing system. However, this  legislation is being introduced because there is a gap in the system and no  means of dealing with this particular issue.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Alastair Ross asked whether the Department would provide  mediation services where someone is reticent in asking their neighbours about a  hedge. In such cases, the aggrieved person may ask for help from mediation  services. Organisations provide those services in Northern Ireland, and, in that  instance, councils will be able to facilitate individuals and point them in the  right direction.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Cathal Boylan asked how we will ensure that the fees do not  vary too widely between council areas. Although we are giving councils the  power to set their own fees, the level will be based on the cost of dealing  with the complainant. We anticipate that the levels will be relatively  consistent, and I am sure that local government organisations will apply their  minds to that issue.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Alastair Ross asked whether group complaints could be made.  Each house may be differently impacted by hedges, resulting, therefore, in  several single complaints. However, a council can decide to reduce the fees if  there are a number of complaints about one set of trees.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Peter Weir asked what lessons we could learn from  experiences in England and Wales, where similar  legislation has been in operation for around five years. After the legislation  was introduced, there was an initial surge of complaints, which then tailed  off. Therefore, it appears that, with the legislation in place, people are more  prepared to compromise and co-operate, because they do not want the council to  impose something on them at a later point.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Danny Kinahan asked why areas of 0&middot;2 hectares are excluded.  That is the identifiable scale used in the Forestry Bill.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Electronic communication is included in the Bill as an  option; it is not included to exclude members of the public. People can use  that system, but we will still rely on snail mail where required.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Molloy] in the Chair)</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Once again, I thank Members for their contributions. I look  forward to seeing the Committee&rsquo;s work on the Bill, and, as is usual with  legislation, I am sure that we will have a useful and fruitful exchange with  Committee members.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">When I was thinking about the Bill&rsquo;s Second Stage, I was  reminded of a poem by Robert Frost, &lsquo;Mending Wall&rsquo;, which I was taught at  school. In the poem, two neighbours go out each year to replace the wall  between their properties. One of the neighbours is less inclined to replace the  wall and does not see why the wall is necessary, particularly as there is an  orchard on one side of it. He says:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Something there is that doesn&rsquo;t love a wall&rdquo;.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">His neighbour replies, &ldquo;Good fences make good  neighbors&rdquo;. In this instance, one could say, &ldquo;Something there is that doesn&rsquo;t  love a high hedge&rdquo;. The response to that should be that good hedges, as opposed  to high hedges, make good neighbours.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">My officials and I will work closely with the Environment  Committee, and we look forward to moving the legislation forward in the  Assembly. The Bill will be hugely beneficial to many thousands of people across  Northern Ireland,  because it will deal with a problem that has been with them for many years.  While out canvassing over the past number of weeks, I was regularly asked when  the hedges legislation was coming in. I was able to indicate that we had  started the process. The legislation will be hugely beneficial to the public  and is an example of the sort of thing that the Assembly should be doing for  the benefit of the wider public.</p>

Waste is  an issue of concern for us all, and Members will be aware that the Bill is a  vital part of the legislative package that will help us to meet European  targets for landfill and will enable councils to meet the Department&rsquo;s  commitments under the waste management strategy. It is, therefore, essential  that the Environment Committee takes its time to scrutinise the Bill fully and make  sure that the legislation delivers those objectives effectively.

      <p class="H4StageHeading">Credit Unions</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to one hour and 30  minutes for this debate. The proposer will have 10 minutes to propose the  motion and 10 minutes to make a winding-up speech. All other Members who wish  to speak will have five minutes.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>: I  beg to move</p>
      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly reaffirms its resolution of 17 February  2009 on the report of the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Investment,  unanimously supporting the expansion of credit union services including through  their future regulation by the Financial Services Authority; notes the Treasury  paper of 8 July 2009 which accepted the Assembly&rsquo;s key recommendations on  credit union regulation and service enhancement; regrets that the opportunity  to deliver necessary change in primary legislation through amendment to the  Financial Services Bill in Westminster was lost; welcomes the current  consultation by the Treasury and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment on &ldquo;Proposals for regulatory reform of credit unions in Northern  Ireland&rdquo;; and calls on the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment to  pursue appropriate legislative change with the incoming Chancellor as a matter  of priority.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As the motion indicates, the Assembly has already adopted  unanimously the position that credit unions should be allowed to expand the  range of services that they offer to their many members in Northern Ireland.  The Assembly has recognised that the pathway to that is by way of regulation by  the Financial Services Authority kicking in.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The report that the Assembly adopted unanimously in  February 2009 provided for credit unions to continue to be registered by the  Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment. However, in order to offer a  wider range of services, they would have to be regulated by the Financial  Services Authority. Only such regulation would allow credit unions to offer  those additional services. Financial Services Authority regulation would have  the additional benefit of covering credit union savings with the same  guarantees as apply to banks and building societies. There are a number of  benefits available to the members of credit unions and to the credit unions  themselves as they seek to provide a bigger and better business for their members  in so many communities throughout this region.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Some issues arose in relation to expanding those services.  Some people were confused by the differences between industrial and provident  societies, such as the Presbyterian Mutual Society, and credit unions. However,  the Committee for Enterprise,  Trade and Investment&rsquo;s report clearly focused on the position and the needs of  credit unions and the potential to improve their offerings to their members.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Treasury, in a document of July 2009, recognised the position  that had been outlined by the Assembly in the Committee&rsquo;s report and the  various statements and undertakings of the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment, who, I am glad to see, is here for the debate. On that basis, when  the Financial Services Bill was introduced at Westminster, those of us who sit  in that House sought to table an amendment that would make provision for credit  unions here to come under FSA regulation. It was a straightforward amendment.  However, the Treasury Ministers took a fairly complicated view of the matter  and said that all sorts of long-running consultation would be needed before  such a change could take place. We contested that view at the time. Although I  tabled the amendment, it was supported by DUP MPs and the then UUP MP as well  as by my SDLP colleagues and others. There was no party dispute about the  merits of using that Bill as a means of securing the necessary change in  primary legislation. Even when we get the change in primary legislation, other  measures will be needed by way of secondary legislation. There will also be  issues about memorandums of understanding that would be needed, for example,  between DETI and the FSA about how some of the proposals would work in practice  and the precise interface between registration and regulation.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Although the Treasury took a complicated view at that stage  and tried to blame DETI, we now have, as a result of the efforts between the  Treasury and DETI, a published consultation document on proposals for the  regulatory reform of credit unions in Northern Ireland. That document  handily reflects the key recommendations that were endorsed by the Assembly and  points out some implementation and management issues. The publication of that  document should be regarded as a positive step, and I pay tribute to the  Minister of Enterprise,  Trade and Investment for her help. Many of us were concerned by the line that  the Treasury appeared to take during the passage of the Financial Services  Bill, and the Minister, through further representations to the Treasury,  subsequently clarified that she and her Department had no objection to that  Bill being used to implement the amendment.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Nevertheless, before Parliament was dissolved, although the  Government were ready to table an amendment in the House of Lords that recycled  our amendment from the House of Commons, which was carried, the Tory Party  refused to dispose of the matter as part of the wash-up. That may give us cause  for concern because, although it is positive that DETI and the Treasury produced  the consultation document and the noises from the Treasury are that it would be  committed early in a new Parliament to providing a legislative vehicle to  remedy the anomaly that we identified, questions arise because of the Tory  Party&rsquo;s attitude to the FSA.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The credit union movement here has worked and waited for a  long time to reach the threshold of this change, so it would be a tragedy if,  simply because of the Conservative Party&rsquo;s ideological position of wanting to  do away with the FSA, with everything going back to Bank of England regulation,  we ended up creating new confusion and delays. I am not sure that credit unions  here would be comfortable being regulated by the Bank of England, and I am not  sure that the Bank of England wants to regulate credit unions here or anywhere  else.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There could be a hole in the Conservative Party&rsquo;s policy on  the future regulation of the diversity of financial services. Whoever regulates  banks and whatever argument might be made for the Bank of England regulating  banks, many people are not convinced that that would be an adequate answer for  credit unions. Credit unions are regulated in their own right by the FSA; that  is what currently happens to credit unions across the water and what will  happen in the future.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The motion is an attempt to give the Assembly an  opportunity to reflect positively on the fact that our Minister and the  Treasury have now moved along the lines that the Assembly endorsed in its  backing of the report by the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Investment. It is a  matter of recognising that that has also been welcomed by the credit unions,  which worked for a long time to bring about those changes. The motion is also  about recognising that, just as there were delays and twists in the past, there  are dangers ahead. That is why the motion calls for the Minister to work with  the Chancellor in whatever is the incoming Government at Westminster to progress the matter. It will  not be entirely straightforward, and, although some of us at Westminster  will play our part to try to advance matters, we recognise the key locus for  the Department of Enterprise,  Trade and Investment and, no doubt, for the Committee.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The motion was tabled to register the importance of the  consultation document, to show continuing support for this urgently needed  change, to recognise that there may be some difficulties and to offer our  support and encouragement to the Minister as she faces the difficulties or  twists that might emerge in her ongoing discussions with the Treasury.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">1.30 pm</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the proposers of the  motion, for which Mark Durkan has set out the case. We are still waiting for  the Westminster  authorities to bring forward the necessary changes. I sensed that they were  looking for the longest distance between the two points, because the case was  unanswerable, and it appears that the delays were unnecessary. The protracted  consultation period simply confirmed the resistance to the idea rather than any  well-founded or legitimate reasons for caution. Indeed, we could question why  other regions were to be consulted on legislation that is specific to the  Assembly&rsquo;s adopted position.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">However, throughout the process, we have managed to  maintain momentum and a significant degree of cross-party unanimity. That  demonstrates the strength of the proposition. The motion exhorts the Minister  to engage with the incoming Administration, and I am confident that she will do  exactly that. The Minister has driven the process forward on behalf of the  Assembly. Mark Durkan correctly pointed out that the credit union movement here  is solidly behind the proposition that is outlined in the motion. It looks  forward to the opportunity to expand its range of services and to provide a  competitive alternative to existing service providers. That would be extremely  welcome, particularly given the economic constraints that affect all facets of  life in this region.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I reiterate my party&rsquo;s support for the legislation. I thank  the proposers of the motion and acknowledge the work that the Minister has done  on our behalf.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  I do not have much to say on the issue, other than that I support the motion. I  will take this opportunity to congratulate Mark Durkan and his mate Alasdair on  their success in last week&rsquo;s election. I also congratulate my new MP, Jim  Shannon, who has left the Chamber. Well done to everyone concerned.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank Mark Durkan and his colleagues for bringing the  motion to the Assembly Floor. As a member of a local credit union, I recognise that  the credit union movement has provided an excellent service to all its members  for many years. The Assembly discussed the needs of credit unions in, I think,  February 2007.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>:  It was 2009.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  Sorry, that is right. It was February 2009.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is disappointing, to say the least, that more progress  has not been forthcoming. As with any other issue, circumstances do not stand  still. Credit unions want their members to benefit from new and enhanced  opportunities, and, as a public representative, I fully endorse that ideal. I  am glad that the Minister of Enterprise,  Trade and Investment is with us today. The motion calls on her to pursue the  appropriate legislative change with the incoming Chancellor, and I have no  doubt that she will do so. The Alliance Party fully supports the motion.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>: I  support the motion and wish to express my recognition of the valuable work that  is carried out by credit unions across Northern Ireland. My party&rsquo;s view  remains the same as the one that it expressed in February 2009, and we are  disappointed that there has been only limited progress.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The credit union movement has grown over the past 50 years,  and it continues to have a bright future in Northern Ireland. Credit unions  play an increasing role as financial service providers, particularly to those  on lower incomes. Credit unions in Northern Ireland date back to the  early 1960s, and there are now some 180 unions, with over 400,000 members,  serving 50% of the adult population.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Despite their popularity, and compared with their  counterparts in Great Britain and the Republic of Ireland, credit unions have a  limited opportunity to provide a wide range of services. Also, access to  compensation in the event of failure is uneven in Northern Ireland, as some 26 credit  unions have no protection at all. Bringing credit unions under the regulation  of the Financial Services Authority would provide certainty with regard to  compensation arrangements for all credit union members in Northern Ireland.  At this time of economic uncertainty, it is critical that we protect the most  economically vulnerable in society.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Across the world, credit unions are increasingly integrated  into mainstream financial services regulation and given greater freedom to  offer services to their members and communities. Many in the credit union  movement in Northern Ireland  have campaigned for a long time to have a range of services similar to those  enjoyed by other groups in Great Britain  and the Republic   of Ireland. Most credit  unions welcome the opportunity to extend their services to the community and,  in particular, the opportunity to help people to save. In the current economic  climate, it is important that we encourage everyone to start or to continue  saving. In this instance, there is, however, a need for clearer rules and  greater protection for those savers.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is widely acknowledged that the credit union sector in Northern Ireland  is stable, and there have been no failures for nearly a decade. However, that  does not negate the need for protection. Allowing the FSA to regulate credit  unions in Northern Ireland  would enable compensation of up to &pound;50,000 to be paid in the event of a  failure.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The capacity of credit unions to help the local economy  through supporting community enterprise is another useful benefit. Some local  credit unions will wish to expand that. Reinvestment of assets can bring  significant benefit to community infrastructure.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Like other Members, I call on the Minister of Enterprise,  Trade and Investment to work with whatever new UK Government is formed to  pursue the necessary change in legislation to give credit unions and their  members the appropriate regulation, protection and choice, which is already  bestowed on others in the United    Kingdom. I support the motion.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  It is important to recognise that many in the credit union movement would say  that change is long overdue. Nonetheless, the motion is timely. We are on the  cusp of a change of Government and the formation of a new Parliament at Westminster. Therefore,  the opportunity arises for the necessary amendments to be made to primary  legislation and for the consequent secondary legislation to be introduced. It  is important that those changes take place.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We missed an opportunity in the last Parliament; there is  no doubt about that. Mark Durkan&rsquo;s efforts in that respect should not be  overlooked. They were important. He identified an opportunity, but his efforts  were effectively obstructed; initially, by the Treasury at Westminster and, subsequently, by the British  Conservative Party in the penultimate stage of the last Parliament, during the  wash-up period when issues outstanding in the legislative programme were  settled. That was most unfortunate, and we will have to make up for it in the  new Parliament.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that those who discuss matters of  legislative importance with the incoming Government bring this issue to their  attention, whatever hue that Government might take. Our MPs must emphasise the  importance of tabling an amendment that will provide the necessary legislative  key to unlock the changes that will benefit credit unions here in Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We are the only part of these islands in which credit  unions do not have the extended powers and services that credit unions in Britain and the Republic of Ireland  enjoy. It is wrong for our credit unions, which command very high standing in  the community, to be deprived of that opportunity. Credit unions here are very  important at local and community level. Fifty per cent of the adult population  belong to a credit union, so they are not an insubstantial or inconsequential  element of our society. For many families, their credit union is an important  source of financial potential and stability. It can assist people with home  improvements and other aspects of ordinary human living. Therefore, we owe the  credit union movement our support in helping it to obtain extended services.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I take heart from the fact that the Department of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment issued a joint consultation paper with the  Treasury on 30 March this year. I welcome that paper and the Minister&rsquo;s  constant support. I hope that we can now, in the new Parliament, achieve the  necessary legislative amendments that will result in an expansion of credit  union services in Northern    Ireland.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>:  Will the Member bring his remarks to a close?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  Yes.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In a period of financial uncertainty, credit unions stand  out as a pillar of stability. It is important that we support them.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I support the motion, and I thank the Members who brought it to the Chamber for  debate. I have spoken on the matter before, sometimes by making full speeches  and sometimes by making interventions. I am very aware of the role that credit  unions play, and by extension, the role that the Department and the Minister  play. I have always been impressed by the Department&rsquo;s work in that regard. It  is very clear that the Minister is keen to support credit unions in whatever  way she can.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The case of the Presbyterian Mutual Society is particularly  important to me because of the number of my constituents who have contacted me  about it. The longer that the situation has gone on, the more that my thoughts  have turned to the absolute necessity of ensuring that the protection that is  available on the mainland be extended to credit unions in the Province. That is  where we are coming from, and that should always have been the case. The last  time that we debated credit unions, we all made it clear how essential they are  to life in the Province. I point to the fact that more than a quarter of the  population are members of a credit union. The credit unions in my constituency  of Strangford play a critical role. Kieran McCarthy spoke about that earlier.  He and I are aware of the important work that they do and of the fact that they  make money available to their members. They give people opportunities.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The credit crunch is still in play, and many families are  struggling to make ends meet to pay for everyday outgoings. When an unexpected  bill arrives, such as one for car or boiler repairs, sometimes the only way in  which to deal with it is to take a loan from a credit union. That is something  that people have done for a great many years. Sometimes the work that credit  unions do is unsolicited or goes unnoticed, but, nonetheless, they play a  critical role.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Credit unions have a long and successful history in Northern Ireland,  where there are approximately 170 of them. That is in contrast to the UK mainland,  where approximately 1% of the population are members. Credit unions on the  mainland are anxious to solidify and to encourage growth in the credit union  sector.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">1.45 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In Northern    Ireland, credit unions play an important and  critical role, so we should do our best to support and to help them. The credit  union movement portrays itself as the people&rsquo;s bank. It is run by ordinary  people for ordinary people, and it does not make a profit. The success of the  credit union movement in Northern    Ireland has been attributed to its promotion  by established community groups and religious organisations and to its by the  community, for all of the community ethos.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Credit unions in Northern Ireland are governed by  one primary and four subordinate pieces of legislation. They receive no  Government funding, whereas credit unions in the rest of the UK have access  to a &pound;36 million growth fund for third-sector lenders. In 2007-08, that fund  was bolstered by a further &pound;6 million, and in its recent paper on financial  inclusion, Her Majesty&rsquo;s Treasury Select Committee recognised the important  role that third-sector lenders play in promoting financial inclusion. The  Treasury Select Committee also made important recommendations designed to  increase the coverage and capacity of third-sector lenders. However, none of  those recommendations applies to credit unions in Northern Ireland. Therefore, the  extent to which they can change and grow is limited, particularly when one  considers that credit unions in the Province receive huge support.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In common with other Members, including Alban Maginness, I  am disappointed that legislation has not been passed, and I thank the proposer  of the motion and other Members for pointing out that it was the Conservative  Party&rsquo;s failure to support an amendment in the House of Lords that led us to  where we are today. I support the motion to bring that support to the fore. The  Minister has not forgotten the importance of such support, and she and her  Department will continue to make representations.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>: I  declare an interest as the treasurer of one of the most successful credit  unions in the North, the Kilrea, Rasharkin and Dunloy Credit Union. In election  times, one has to boast.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As other Members said, the failure to obtain the necessary  legislation is disappointing, because there is an absolute necessity to empower  credit unions, particularly in times of economic decline. I remind Members that  in the late 1950s and early 1960s, during one of the worst economic recessions,  the credit union movement in Ireland  expanded rapidly. Out of that poverty, which bears no relation to circumstances  now, the credit union movement brought hope, leadership and financial stability  to many people who, in those days, were not allowed through the door of a bank.  The current situation is quite different, and, indeed, many banks now exploit  people.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I could talk about the credit union movement&rsquo;s impact on  the third world, particularly, in recent years, on Africa.  Credit unions have given dignity to people who would otherwise have endured  absolute poverty. It is important to make the point that the credit union  movement is an international organisation, with huge potential for rescuing  people from the gombeen men who often exploit their poverty. No matter where  one is, the principles of the credit union movement are the same, and we must  ensure that its potential is not stifled or strangled.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In a material world, we recognise that people&rsquo;s loyalty to  the co-operative movement, of which credit unions are an important element, is,  regrettably, not as strong as it should be. Perhaps that puts even greater  pressure on the Government to ensure that the credit union movement is  supported as it competes against credit card providers, loan sharks, and so  forth.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Compared with when the credit union movement expanded  rapidly in Ireland  &mdash; I pay tribute to John Hume, who was a founder member &mdash; we live in a different  kind of world. People are now being exploited by loan sharks and have different  needs. Therefore, it is critical to expand the range of services that credit  unions can deliver.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The credit union movement is probably at a crossroads. It  can stand still or, in some cases, even decline. Therefore, in our changing  financial world, it is essential that the credit union movement be allowed to  repackage itself, take on the additional responsibilities that clearly exist  and move on.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I pay tribute to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment for its contribution to the credit union movement, for the help that  the Department has provided and for the scrutiny that it has imposed, all of  which have been accepted positively. There is deep regret that the Department  will have a less involved role in the future than the Financial Services  Authority, which, it is worth noting, has no regional presence here. Therefore,  I encourage the Minister to pursue appropriate legislation with the incoming  Chancellor of the Exchequer as a priority. The credit union movement is vital.  Without wishing to show any party political favouritism, I must pay tribute to  Mark Durkan, who has used his position at Westminster  to keep the credit union issue alive and to enable it, I hope, to become a top  priority for the new Government, whoever forms it.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">My local credit union recently received the Investors in  People award, and I thank the Department for its encouragement and guidance in  achieving that.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment (Mrs Foster)</strong>: All  Members are well aware of the important role and contribution of the credit  union movement in all parts of Northern    Ireland, and we have heard Members talk  about some of the people who were involved in its early days. We heard of the  work of former Foyle MP John Hume. For the sake of parity, I also want to pay  tribute to the work of Rev Martin Smyth in the Ulster Federation of Credit  Unions. A lot of good men and true, and indeed women, have driven forward the  credit union movement over the years by sticking with local projects and by  recognising its importance. The role and influence of credit unions are likely  to increase under my Department&rsquo;s policy to extend the range of services that  they can offer.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to update the Assembly on the progress that has been  made and the steps that are under way to expand the services that credit unions  will be able to offer, while enjoying the added assurance that savers will have  the same level of protection as credit union members on the mainland. I have  long recognised that neighbourhood credit unions are the prime source of  affordable credit for many members of the community, particularly those on  those on lower incomes. The long-established and widespread presence of the  credit union movement in Northern    Ireland has been crucial in helping to  engender a strong culture of community self-help, which, as Mr Dallat pointed  out, we should have no difficulty in recognising. Credit unions also help to  promote financial inclusion by, among other things, tackling the serious  problem of loan sharks.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We have also heard that credit unions have long held a  special place in Northern    Ireland society. However, as Members may be  aware, since 2002, when their counterparts in Great Britain were brought under  the regulatory umbrella of the FSA, credit unions here have been limited in the  services that they have been permitted to offer. Credit union members here are  excluded from the financial protection offered by the FSA compensation scheme  and are denied access to the Financial Ombudsman Service. Another key issue  that is often raised with me is that access to child trust schemes would become  available to credit union members here only when regulatory responsibility for  credit unions is transferred from my Department to the FSA.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Dallat&rsquo;s point about the FSA not having a regional  presence here came through strongly in the Committee&rsquo;s report on credit unions.  I know that the Department is concerned about that as well, and we will  continue to keep our eye on it.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee&rsquo;s report was a key document in informing the  Treasury&rsquo;s separate review of the regulatory framework for credit unions and  industrial and provident societies in Northern Ireland, of which mention  has been made and which was published in July 2009. That review noted that,  compared with their counterparts in Great Britain  and the Republic of Ireland, credit unions in Northern Ireland have a limited  opportunity to offer the wide range of services that they seek to provide. On a  more positive note, the review confirmed the robustness of the Northern Ireland credit union movement and  openly acknowledged that in an eight-year period, during which 32 credit unions  in Great Britain failed,  none in Northern Ireland  failed. That is a welcome acknowledgement of the high degree to which our  credit unions are managed and regulated.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is also worth noting that in the context of the current  global financial crisis, the Treasury review reported that there was no  evidence to suggest that the uncertain financial environment had weakened the  credit union structure in Northern    Ireland. That was a heartening endorsement.  Like the Committee for Enterprise,  Trade and Investment&rsquo;s report, the Treasury review rejected the option of  maintaining the status quo. It also recommended that the UK Government,  together with the Assembly, should consult on bringing Northern Ireland  credit unions within the scope of Financial Services Authority regulation and,  in that way, bring certainty on compensation arrangements for all members.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the proposer, Mark Durkan, for the fair way in  which he presented the background to where we find ourselves and, not least,  for the amendment that he tried to get accepted in the House of Commons. I  thank him for his comments. I have made efforts to have the amendment carried  in the House of Lords, and he will know that I contacted the Treasury. I also  had the Economic Secretary to the Treasury, Ian Pearson, agree to the inclusion  of a Government amendment to effect the removal of the exemption from a date to  be determined. Regrettably, we have heard that it was lost in the wash-up, as a  result of the Conservative Party not backing the amendment in the House of  Lords. That is deeply disappointing; it could have been done on the whim of  anybody. It was not going to cause any impact in Great Britain. It was for the  benefit of Northern Ireland  people, and it is something that I will seek to address with the new Secretary  of State, whoever that may be, initially, and, subsequently, with the Economic  Secretary to the Treasury in the Chancellor&rsquo;s office.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In any case, as Members have acknowledged, the inclusion of  the amendment would have been only the first of several legislative steps  required at Westminster  and here. I will continue to try to get that initial stage carried out as  quickly as possible. We are looking at ways of doing that &mdash; not with primary  legislation, but with secondary legislation. There is a commitment in the  Treasury to do that. However, I register the concern that has been acknowledged  by the proposer of the motion in relation to the Conservative Party&rsquo;s policy to  take all regulation back to the Bank of England, because that would, inevitably,  slow down anything that we would wish to do in relation to the credit unions.  We will keep a tight eye on that and watch how it progresses.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I have one point to address in relation to a query that was  raised by Mr McLaughlin on why the consultation had to be UK-wide, when it  affected only Northern Ireland. It had to be a UK consultation, because we were  trying to amend a Bill that applied only to GB.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As I have indicated, I will take up the question of the  implementation of the appropriate legislation with the incoming Administration  at a very early stage. I reassure Members that I will do all that I can to  ensure that it happens as soon as is practicable.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, I pay tribute again to the credit union movement  across Northern Ireland  and to the vital role that it plays in society, which, I must say, is in  support of the Executive and Assembly&rsquo;s policy, particularly on promoting greater  community self-sufficiency, self-confidence and financial inclusion.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">2.00 pm</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr McDonnell</strong>:  It is a privilege to stand here in order to gather together a few thoughts  about a motion on which we are all agreed. It is clear from all the comments  made that change is long overdue. Credit unions do a magnificent job for all of  us, and, in many cases, they have the capacity to do much more. Therefore, we  should create a space for them to do that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Better legislation, allowing a wider role, is essential,  and I compliment the Minister on her past efforts to get that moving.  Unfortunately, it was allowed to slip away in the wash-up of the last  Parliament, but it must be brought into effect quickly. There is a need for Northern Ireland  credit unions to have fuller powers and a much wider role. We are all agreed on  that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">One of the big issues with some of the credit unions was  being allowed to handle the Child Trust Fund. The Minister referred to that,  and I hope that credit unions will be allowed to handle it before the  Conservatives eliminate it altogether. Furthermore, we must avoid at all costs  allowing banks, which have created various problems, to corrupt or to  contaminate the legislation, because credit unions are essential and provide a  vital role in Northern    Ireland for people on low incomes.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I compliment everyone who spoke in the debate and thank  them for their efforts. I will start with Mark Durkan, who outlined the need  for credit unions to be allowed to become bigger and better where appropriate  and where they felt that they were able to do so. He mentioned the Committee  report and the positive Treasury response. He mentioned the Bill and how the  Treasury took a complicated view of the whole thing, creating problems and  shortfalls, and how the Bill slipped on us with the dissolution of Parliament.  He went on to talk about credit unions wanting change, and he fully supported  the Minister in her efforts.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mitchel McLaughlin endorsed Mark&rsquo;s comments. He said that  the case that we were making was unanswerable and fully supported the debate.  Kieran McCarthy threw his weight behind the effort to expand the role of credit  unions and noted that the enhanced role that we were suggesting could have and  should have been implemented a long time ago. Leslie Cree went into a lot of  detail on credit unions and mentioned the need for the law to change. He mentioned  the need for robust protection and said that it was essential that we secure  and protect any vulnerable credit unions. However, other Members mentioned that  none of our credit unions has been insolvent. Alban Maginness mentioned the  urgent need for change and outlined many of the benefits. Jim Shannon, like  others, complimented the credit unions and the work that they do and fully  supported the motion. John Dallat declared his interest and shared some of the  history of credit unions with us. He also reminded us that the FSA does not  really have a local presence.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Minister for her comments, for her kind tribute  to John Hume and Martin Smyth and, generally, for throwing her weight behind  credit unions. We are all very aware of the effort that she has made, and we  urge her to keep up that effort and to find whatever means possible to use  those of us who have been elected to Westminster or wherever to work this  through, because it is one issue that affects people at the grass roots. Every  day, I go out and meet people who are on very low incomes and find that credit  unions help them in their struggle to plan and to budget their finances.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank Kieran McCarthy for his kind compliment to me on my  re-election, and I add my good wishes to Jim Shannon, who escaped from the  Chamber earlier, Mark Durkan and others in the Chamber who have been  re-elected. I thank all Members for supporting the motion. It is a privilege to  deal with a motion that has unanimous support.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly reaffirms its resolution of 17 February  2009 on the report of the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Investment,  unanimously supporting the expansion of credit union services including through  their future regulation by the Financial Services Authority; notes the Treasury  paper of 8 July 2009 which accepted the Assembly&rsquo;s key recommendations on  credit union regulation and service enhancement; regrets that the opportunity  to deliver necessary change in primary legislation through amendment to the  Financial Services Bill in Westminster was lost; welcomes the current  consultation by the Treasury and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment on &ldquo;Proposals for regulatory reform of credit unions in Northern  Ireland&rdquo;; and calls on the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment to  pursue appropriate legislative change with the incoming Chancellor as a matter  of priority.</p>

      <p class="OralAnswers-H2DepartmentHeading">Office of the First Minister and  deputy First Minister</p>
      <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Children and Young People</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">1. <span class="BoldText">Ms Purvis</span> asked the First  Minister and deputy First Minister whether they will seek to establish a  statutory duty to require Departments to co-operate on the planning and  commissioning of services for children and young people.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 1173/10<a name="AQO1173/10" id="AQO1173/10"></a>)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister (Mr M McGuinness)</strong>: With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I  will ask junior Minister Kelly to answer question 1.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister) (Mr G Kelly)</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Although children&rsquo;s services planning  falls within the remit of the Department of Health, Social Services and Public  Safety, the welfare of our children and young people is a cross-cutting issue.  Children and young people remain a priority for Ministers and the Executive.  However, we do not seek to introduce a statutory duty to co-operate on the  planning and commissioning of services for young people. Individual Ministers  need to be able to identify their own priorities and to take appropriate policy  decisions that are relevant to the work of their Department. To achieve that,  they also need to have direct control over their own departmental budgets.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We recognise that many of the issues that relate  specifically to children and young people are cross-cutting, requiring  co-operation across Departments. We re-established the ministerial subcommittee  on children and young people in 2008, with the aim of improving their lives.  Through the subcommittee&rsquo;s workings, children and young people are placed at  the heart of the Government&rsquo;s agenda. Not only does that facilitate better  joined-up working and achieve transparency through timely sharing of  information but it aims to achieve greater integration of policy funding and  service delivery relevant to children and young people. That forum also enables  us to agree joint priorities on identified and emerging issues and to take  those priorities forward collaboratively while continuing to drive forward the  10-year strategy to achieve improved outcomes for all our children and young  people.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">To support the subcommittee, we established champions for  children and young people who act as a senior point of contact in each Department  and help drive forward agreed policies. Champions raise awareness at  departmental board level to encourage Departments to ensure that children and  young people&rsquo;s issues are jointly fostered.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We are committed to ensuring that children and young  people&rsquo;s issues remain high on the Government&rsquo;s agenda and will continue to  drive that work forward through the ministerial subcommittee.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Purvis</strong>: I  thank the junior Minister for his answer. I acknowledge the work that the  ministerial subcommittee on children and young people has done.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Does the Minister agree that, because the issues that  affect children and young people are cross-cutting and the current system  depends on the goodwill of those who come to the table, a statutory duty to  co-operate on the planning and commissioning of children&rsquo;s services is needed?  A statutory duty would ensure the delivery of quality services while addressing  the system&rsquo;s inefficiencies and cutting down on duplication.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Mr G Kelly)</strong>: I understand the Member&rsquo;s viewpoint. However, the  matter was discussed. I do not think that we can interfere with ministerial  budgets or put that type of statutory duty on Ministers. Bearing in mind that  it is a ministerial subcommittee, which is attached to the Executive, the  reason that it was set up was precisely to ensure that Ministers would attend  to the issues and that keen focus would be put on them. For that reason, we  decided against establishing a statutory duty.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  Can the junior Minister provide the Assembly with an update on the child  poverty situation in Northern    Ireland? Can he indicate any updated  timescales for the alleviation, leading to the eradication, of child poverty  here?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Mr G Kelly)</strong>: The ministerial subcommittee on children and young  people has six priorities. It has reported on five of those priorities. The one  on which it has not reported is precisely the one about which the Member asked.  As soon as we have an update, I will send the information to the Member.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. It is good that, for the first time,  there are champions for children and young people in Departments. It is also  good and relevant to hear that children are at the heart of the Government&rsquo;s  agenda. There has been much discussion of the ministerial subcommittee on  children and young people. Can the junior Minister update the House  specifically on the subcommittee&rsquo;s current position?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Mr G Kelly)</strong>: Through the workings of the ministerial subcommittee  on children and young people, the six objectives of the 10-year strategy for  children and young people, which I mentioned in response to Danny Kennedy&rsquo;s  question, are being driven forward. Ministers are members of the ministerial  subcommittee and seek jointly to drive forward cross-cutting issues for  children and young people here.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Six cross-cutting key priorities for action have been  identified. Those are child poverty; early years; vulnerable young people;  safeguarding; provision, including transitions, for children with a disability  or mental health condition; and the provision of school buses. Six subgroups  have also been established to take forward the work on those key priorities,  and five have completed action plans that the Executive formally agreed on 25  March 2010. As I indicated, the action plan of the child poverty subgroup is  still being considered. The next meeting of the ministerial subcommittee is  scheduled for Tuesday 29 June 2010.</p>
      <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Children and Young People&rsquo;s Unit</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">2. <span class="BoldText">Mr McDevitt </span>asked the First  Minister and deputy First Minister if they sought the advice of the Northern  Ireland Children&rsquo;s Commissioner and the United Nations to determine whether the  abolition of a dedicated children and young persons unit within their  Department complies with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 1174/10<a name="AQO1174/10" id="AQO1174/10"></a>)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: A Cheann Comhairle, with your permission, I will ask junior  Minister Kelly to respond to that question as well. He is earning his keep  today.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Mr G Kelly)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat. The work of the children and  young people&rsquo;s unit will continue. It is a priority both in the Programme for  Government and given our commitment to the United Nations Convention on the  Rights of the Child. The restructuring that the Office of the First Minister  and deputy First Minister has undergone has come about for two reasons: first,  to provide a better service for our stakeholders by focusing on our core  priorities; and, secondly, to enable us to do that in a more flexible manner.  In short, we need the Department to be more strategic, effective and efficient  than before. In developing our new structures, discussions took place with a  wide range of stakeholders, including the Commissioner for Children and Young  People.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The concluding observations of the United Nations Committee  on the Rights of the Child in October 2008 recommended that:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;the State party &mdash; in addition to ensuring that each  of the jurisdictions has a well resourced and functioning coordinating body &mdash;  could allocate responsibility for the coordination and evaluation of the  Convention across the State party to a single, high-profile mechanism.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That position has not changed, and we continue to  see the 10-year strategy for children and young people and the associated  action plans as the main vehicles for taking forward the committee&rsquo;s concluding  observations here. We will keep the new structures under review, and, if  changes are needed, our new, more flexible structures will enable us to make  them.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  Do the deputy First Minister, the First Minister and, indeed, the junior  Minister accept that such bodies and dedicated units still exist in Scotland and Wales and that section 4 of the UN  Convention on the Rights of the Child requires the Executive to have a  dedicated and specific team?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I urge the Member to come to his question.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  Therefore, does the junior Minister accept that what happened was in breach of  section 4 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Mr G Kelly)</strong>: I do not accept that. In bringing forward  recommendations on the proposed new organisational structure in the equality  directorate and economic policy unit, consultants from the Department of  Finance and Personnel&rsquo;s delivery and innovation division were asked to meet a  wide range of stakeholders to establish their views on the way in which the  directorate currently operates and on how a combined directorate might best  meet stakeholders&rsquo; needs. The themes that stakeholders identified during the  consultation process centred on various elements, including the purpose of a  combined equality directorate and economic policy unit; the capability and  expertise of staff; resources; the use of stakeholder expertise; strategic  prioritisation; communication and relationships with stakeholders; and comments  on the MATRIX system. As part of that process, delivery and innovation division  consultants met Patricia Lewsley, the Commissioner for Children and Young  People, on 26 October 2009.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Campbell</strong>:  One of the rights of the child is to be free from the threat of sexual abuse.  Does the junior Minister agree that it is essential that those who have been  abused deserve the total support of all politicians in bringing their abusers  to justice?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Mr G Kelly)</strong>: I am very pleased to agree with the Member. I think  that the whole Assembly would agree that they deserve the support of all  elected representatives and of society as a whole.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Anderson</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat. Returning to the junior Minister&rsquo;s previous answer, was  consultation carried out with stakeholders on the proposed organisational  change?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Mr G Kelly)</strong>: In bringing forward recommendations on the proposed  new organisational structure in the equality directorate and economic policy  unit, consultants from the Department of Finance and Personnel&rsquo;s delivery and  innovation division were asked to meet a wide range of stakeholders to  establish their views. Therefore, that consultation was carried out. I detailed  the list of stakeholders who were consulted, so I will not go through it again.</p>
      <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">UK Government</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">3. <span class="BoldText">Mr Easton</span> asked the First  Minister and deputy First Minister when they intend to meet, following the  election, with the Prime Minister and his Administration.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 1175/10<a name="AQO1175/10" id="AQO1175/10"></a>)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: Members can rest assured that, once agreement has been reached on  a new Administration in London,  we will seek a meeting with the new British Prime Minister at the earliest opportunity.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>:  Will the deputy First Minister assure me that, no matter who the Prime Minister  may be, he and the First Minister will do all that they can to protect the  block grant for Northern Ireland, especially if there is a Conservative  Government, who could cut the block grant by &pound;200 million?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: I can give an absolute assurance that the First Minister and I  and all members of the Executive recognise that this is a time of change. As I  came into the Chamber, there appeared to be well-founded speculation in London that the Liberal  Democrats and the Conservatives are coming to an agreement about the future  shape of government. That poses real challenges to us, given that, in  interviews prior to the election, the Conservative Party made it clear that it  intended to target the public sector in the North. The First Minister and I are  very concerned about that. At the earliest opportunity, when the shape of the  next Government in London  becomes clear, the First Minister and I will seek a meeting as a matter of  urgency with the person who enters Number 10.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Ramsey</strong>:  I welcome the deputy First Minister&rsquo;s response on the block grant. Will he go  further by saying whether it is his and the First Minister&rsquo;s intention to raise  with whoever becomes Prime Minister of Britain the proposal to introduce  proportional representation to Westminster  elections?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: To be honest, there have been no discussions between the First  Minister and me on that issue. If it were the wish of the Assembly to address  the issue, we could have a conversation about it and see whether we could reach  agreement on it. I will not express any opinion at this stage for fear that my  opinion might be different even from that of the Member. It is not an issue  that is foremost in our minds.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Foremost in our minds are the financial implications of a  new Government in London and the speed with which they will attempt to move on  the signals that were sent out prior to the election on what many people here would  see as an attack on the public sector. At a time of recession and world  economic downturn, high levels of unemployment exist down South, in England, Scotland  and Wales and in Spain, where  unemployment has reached 20%. We appreciate that the public sector effectively saved  us in the North from those levels. Therefore, it is incumbent on all of us in  the Assembly to unite to oppose any proposed cuts, which would eat into a  sector that has provided so much support for our economy at a difficult time.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. The deputy First Minister has raised  the issue that I planned to raise, which was to call for unity among all the  parties in an effort to oppose and resist cuts and any negative impact on our  public services. I congratulate the deputy First Minister on answering my  question.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>: In  line with what has been said about the importance of Northern Ireland  presenting a united front on such issues, are the First Minister and deputy  First Minister willing to meet all who have been elected as MPs in the hope not  only of having a united front from the 13 of us who will be voting on those  situations but of aligning our priorities with those of the Executive?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: I congratulate Naomi on her success in the election. I reiterate  what Members from different political parties that are represented in the  Assembly have said on a number of occasions: we should work together to put up  a broad front against the prospect that damaging cuts will be inflicted on our  public sector and, furthermore, our economy. In the coming days, the First  Minister and I will be keenly engaged as we see the shape of the Administration  in London. We  will be anxious to work with everyone in the Assembly and with everyone who has  been elected as a Member of Parliament to ensure that we put up a united front  against what could be very damaging economic circumstances.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
      <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">FM/DFM: US Visit</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">4. <span class="BoldText">Mr McGlone </span>asked the First  Minister and deputy First Minister for a breakdown of the cost of their recent  visit to the USA  for St Patrick&rsquo;s Day.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 1176/10<a name="AQO1176/10" id="AQO1176/10"></a>)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: As Members are aware, the First Minister and I undertook a  successful visit to the United    States of America over the St Patrick&rsquo;s Day  period in March. We carried out a joint programme of events in Chicago,  focusing on the business community, before travelling to Washington DC  for a series of engagements, culminating in an exceptionally useful round-table  session at the White House with President Obama, Vice President Biden and  Secretary of State Clinton. The First Minister then travelled to Houston, Texas, where he  met the management of Baker Hughes, while I travelled to New York where I met the city and state  comptrollers. We were each accompanied by one special adviser, one private  secretary and one press officer. A local photographer travelled with us to  record the programme, and the cost of that service was met jointly by a number  of Departments. The cost of the visit was &pound;58,455, which included flights,  hotels, trains, cars, photography and subsistence. That figure also included  the cost of the gifts that we presented to the various dignitaries whom we met,  including President Obama, Secretary of State Clinton and Mayor Daley of Chicago.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that those costs be seen in the overall  context of the purpose of the visit. Few European regions or states enjoy the  access that we do; therefore it is imperative that we use St Patrick&rsquo;s Day to  maximum effect. We had unparalleled access to some of the most senior decision  makers in corporate and political spheres in the United States, many of whom  influence investment decisions here. As I have said before, the sensitive and  commercial-in-confidence nature of our discussions with potential inward investors  means that we cannot provide details of those discussions. However, our  discussions with current investors during previous visits have paid dividends  in the creation of new jobs here and in the development of our economy.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">On a more immediate level, President Obama confirmed his  support for the work that we are doing to lobby Congress for its continued  contribution to the International Fund for Ireland,  and he confirmed his personal support for the planned economic conference in Washington in October.  Members will agree that it is vital to continue to lever in the support that is  available in the United    States on as many levels as possible. I was  pleased to see ministerial colleagues and other Members at a range of events  that we attended, which further underlined the cross-party support for the  political arrangements here.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I thank the deputy First Minister for  that extensive overview of his trip. Are details available of any tangible  benefits with regard to investment or potential investment?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: In the past year alone, some of America&rsquo;s best-known brand names  have invested here. The New York Stock Exchange announced that it would expand  its technologies division in Belfast,  which would create up to 400 new jobs. Universal Pictures completed the filming  of &lsquo;Your Highness&rsquo;, a multimillion dollar feature film at the Paint Hall in  Belfast; that film infused nearly &pound;10 million into the local economy, employing  hundreds of cast and crew from the North. In June, HBO will begin filming &lsquo;Game  of Thrones&rsquo; in the Paint Hall, a nine-part television series that could be  worth &pound;20 million to the local economy. Despite the most economically difficult  year in living memory, we have succeeded in attracting significant inward  investment. We have competed with other regions and have won significant  investment. We are outperforming others because investors recognise that we  have the talent and the expertise to build and grow their business.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Members will be conscious that Secretary of State Clinton  and President Obama are anxious to assist us with inward investment. The  decision to appoint Declan Kelly as the economic envoy to the North is strong  testament to their support for that project. Declan Kelly has, in our view, hit  the ground running. He has built up a huge number of contacts, both in the  United States and here on the island of Ireland. He is keen to succeed in the  task that he was given, and I am confident that future benefits will flow from  his appointment.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Spratt</strong>:  Does the deputy First Minister agree that the amount of money spent &mdash; I think  that he mentioned some &pound;58,000 &mdash; was, in fact, well spent in relation to  Northern Ireland and that such exercises have proved to be very worthwhile for  the Province, not only recently but in the past?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: Yes. As I said in my previous answer, there are few countries in  the world with the level of access that we have in the United States. In fact,  when we were there we were told that the Dutch Government had been trying to  get a meeting with President Obama for the greater part of a year and had not  yet succeeded. That clearly shows that the Administration there understand the  importance of what is happening here and of underpinning the political  developments that have occurred by bringing about economic investment in the  North. I think that it was money well spent, and I believe that the more we  build our contacts in the United States and allow people there to visit here &mdash;  as many are keen to do &mdash; the more it will, ultimately, be to the benefit of the  primary objective of the Programme for Government, which is developing our  economy.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Once again, I remind Members that they must continue to rise in their place if  they wish to ask a supplementary question.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gardiner</strong>:  What cutbacks on travel have the Northern Ireland Executive and Departments  made, and what savings have been made since the Finance Minister announced &pound;370  million in cuts?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: I am not sure that that question is related to the question about  the cost of the visit to the United States of America. However, there can be no  doubt whatsoever that all Departments, including the Department of Finance and  Personnel, are conscious of the need to ensure that public money is used  wisely. There is a responsibility on all Departments to ensure that money used  wisely is accounted for in a way that Assembly Members can access through the  House, and all Departments have their own approach to that.</p>
      <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Commissioner for Older People</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">5. <span class="BoldText">Mr Leonard</span> asked the First  Minister and deputy First Minister for an update on the establishment of a  Commissioner for Older People.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO  1177/10<a name="AQO1177/10" id="AQO1177/10"></a>)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: I will ask junior Minister Kelly to respond to question 5.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Mr G Kelly)</strong>: The Office of the First Minister and deputy First  Minister is committed to establishing a Commissioner for Older People, and the  Executive&rsquo;s Programme for Government gave a commitment to provide a strong,  independent voice for older people. However, before a commissioner can be  appointed, we need to bring legislation to the Assembly. On 1 October 2009,  junior Minister Newton and I launched the public consultation on the proposals  to establish a Commissioner for Older People at an event in the Everglades  Hotel to celebrate the United Nations International Day of Older Persons. The  consultation included the policy proposals and the draft Bill, as well as  commentary on the clauses.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As part of the consultation, in November 2009, our  Department conducted nine public consultation events here. Over 400 people  attended that series of events, and the level of engagement and participation  by older people was very encouraging. The consultation concluded on 7 January  2010, and 80 written responses have been received. The Department will publish  a response to the consultation in due course. The Committee for the Office of  the First Minister and deputy First Minister will consider the draft Bill at  its next meeting on Wednesday 12 May. Following that, the Bill will be sent to  the Executive for their consideration and approval.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Following consideration by the Committee for the Office of  the First Minister and deputy First Minister and Executive clearance, we intend  to introduce the Bill in the Assembly in June. Subject to the consideration of  the Assembly, we are hopeful that the Bill will be passed within the lifetime  of the current Assembly. The commissioner could then, hopefully, be appointed  in early spring or early in 2011.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Leonard</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat. I thank the Minister for his detailed reply and that  indicative timetable. I simply ask him to assure the Assembly that he will do  all in his power and the office&rsquo;s power to stick to that indicative timetable.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Mr G Kelly)</strong>: I can give that commitment. Everyone, particularly  in that sector, is impatient to get that through. It took five years to appoint  an older persons commissioner for Wales, but we are well ahead in comparison  with that time frame.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I call Jimmy Spratt. I am sorry: I call Jim Shannon to ask a supplementary  question.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  Jimmy is right, but the other part is wrong.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">My figures and statistics show that the grey vote will rise  dramatically over the next period of time. Ever mindful of that fact and the  fact that a lot of Members in the Chamber are heading towards that more quickly  than others, I ask what steps are being taken to address those issues with  older people&rsquo;s organisations to ensure that sufficient resources are set aside  to look after them.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Mr G Kelly)</strong>: First, I congratulate Jim Shannon on being elected  MP for Strangford. The Member will be aware that Dame Joan Harbison was  appointed Older People&rsquo;s Advocate in December 2008 to ensure that the sector  has a direct voice in government in the period before the commissioner&rsquo;s  appointment. Dame Joan&rsquo;s role includes providing independent advice to  government, vocalising the issues and concerns of older people and acting as a  liaison between the Government and the sector. As Older People&rsquo;s Advocate, Dame  Joan will remain in post until the appointment of the commissioner. She helped  to launch the consultation on the Commissioner for Older People on 1 October  2009 and chaired the public consultation events in November 2009.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  Will the junior Minister assure the House that the shenanigans that took place  during the appointment of the Commissioner for Victims and Survivors for  Northern Ireland will not be repeated and that we will not end up with four  commissioners rather than one efficient commissioner?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Mr G Kelly)</strong>: I assure the Member.</p>
      <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Parades Working Group</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">6. <span class="BoldText">Mrs D Kelly</span> asked the First  Minister and deputy First Minister for an update on the proposals of the  parades working group.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO  1178/10<a name="AQO1178/10" id="AQO1178/10"></a>)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: The consultation on the draft Public Assemblies, Parades and  Protests Bill began on 20 April and will run for 12 weeks until 14 July. The  draft Bill was informed by the report of the working group on parades and  details the proposals for the future handling of all issues related to public  assemblies, including parades and protests, and the new structures that will be  created.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I thank the deputy First Minister for his answer. Will he outline what  discussions, if any, he, the First Minister or the parades working group has  had with the Northern Ireland Court Service or the judiciary, given the ability  of not only parade organisers but those who wish to protest to seek judicial  review of decisions?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: I cannot give any information on the confidential discussions  that took place during that process. However, I can say that we now have a  consultation process that will last for some time and that, during that time,  Members of the House and the public will have every opportunity to have their  say on any aspect of the outcome of the working party&rsquo;s deliberations.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  Will the Minister give a definition of sectarian harassment? Will he explain  how the clause will operate in practice?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: We are all conscious that sectarian harassment can occur in  nearly any sphere of society. The working group was established to deal with  the issue of sectarian harassment in relation to parades or assemblies. The  fact that the working group successfully concluded its discussions, that its  work went to drafters and that they came forward with legislation that is now  out for consultation are achievements that many people predicted would not be  possible, but we achieved them. We now have an ongoing and real opportunity for  people to contribute to that consultation. It is not my job to stand here today  to deal with individual aspects of the work that we are going to deal with over  the next while. Once the consultation process has concluded, legislation will  be put before the House.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">There will be every opportunity for people to  explore every aspect of that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Given what can be the fractious nature of dealing with  these issues, I appeal to all Members to approach this responsibly and in the  spirit of co-operation and to try to lead by example. We must show the people  on the streets, whether those who wish to march or those who wish others not to  march, that the sensible way forward is through dialogue, through coming  together to have reasonable discussions, and through reaching conclusions that  all sides can live with. Given the tremendous recent progress, none of that is  beyond us.</p>

      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McHugh</strong>:  On a point of order.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I am happy to take your point of order after Question Time.</p>

      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McHugh</strong>: <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member should take his seat.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McHugh</strong>: I  am not going to sit down and listen to this nonsense. We had to listen to &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order, order.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McHugh</strong>: I  am not going to sit down. Can this Assembly do nothing &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I have no choice but to suspend the sitting until we can bring some order to  the House.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The sitting was suspended at 3.01 pm and resumed at  3.02 pm.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Every Member, from all sides of the House, had the opportunity to ask a  supplementary question or to table a question to the Office of the First  Minister and deputy First Minister for oral answer. Obviously that did not  happen.</p>
      <p class="OralAnswers-H2DepartmentHeading"><a name="8"></a>Enterprise, Trade and Investment</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Question 3 has been withdrawn.</p>
      <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">First Trust Bank</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">1. <span class="BoldText">Mr O&rsquo;Dowd </span>asked the Minister  of Enterprise, Trade and Investment what discussions she has had with the  Minister of Finance and Personnel to offset any potential job losses as a  result of the sale of the First Trust Bank.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO  1188/10<a name="AQO1188/10" id="AQO1188/10"></a>)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment (Mrs Foster)</strong>: I look forward to the  &lsquo;Fermanagh Herald&rsquo; this week.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I have not discussed with the Minister of Finance and  Personnel this week&rsquo;s decision of the Allied Irish Bank to put First Trust Bank  up for sale; however, the Finance Minister recently met representatives of the  banking union to discuss the issue. He made it clear that the Executive would  not intervene in commercial decisions taken by the board of Allied Irish Bank.  That said, through Invest Northern Ireland, my Department will seek, as  necessary, to enter into discussions with any prospective buyer to explore  options to safeguard jobs in Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. It is interesting that the Member  pulled his stunt just before the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment  was due to speak. If he wanted to ask a question, she is the person to ask it  of. However, back to business.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There is palpable anger against bankers, but that anger is  not directed at those bank staff who have to work, like everyone else, to  secure their jobs and mortgages. The sale of First Trust Bank has caused major  concerns among bank workers for the future of their jobs. The Minister said  that Invest NI will meet any prospective new owners of the bank, and I welcome  that. However, I ask that she also meet any new owners to ensure that continued  investment is made in First Trust Bank and that we can secure as many jobs as  possible in that system.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment</strong>: I am more than happy to meet the new  buyers when they come on board. The current situation, as the Member is aware,  is that the Republic of Ireland&rsquo;s financial regulator has indicated that the  Allied Irish Bank needs to raise &pound;7&middot;4 billion by the end of the year. First  Trust Bank employs approximately 1,500 people in Northern Ireland and was  recently put up for sale by its Dublin-based parent company in an effort to  rebuild the balance sheet. I will meet the workers and am more than happy to  meet the new owners, who are key for Invest Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>:  Will the Minister outline the Department&rsquo;s work on Quinn Insurance in relation  to the First Trust Bank, other banks and other parts of the financial services  industry? Will she tell us her key targets for wealth creation through  providing jobs in the financial services sector?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment</strong>: It is incredibly disappointing that a  Member sought to raise a point of order before my questions started. We have  been working very hard on the situation with Quinn Insurance, which is a  strategic issue in Fermanagh due to the impact that any job losses would have  on that county. Just last week, I announced that Leslie Ross CB will  co-ordinate the activities of my Department, the Department for Employment and  Learning (DEL), Invest Northern Ireland, InterTradeIreland and local councils  in response to the problems facing Quinn Insurance.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I hope to go to Fermanagh with Leslie on Wednesday  afternoon to meet people affected. I continue to meet with the employees of  Quinn Insurance and the wider business community. Tomorrow, I will meet with  the Irish Financial Regulator to discuss issues that have been brought to me by  the employees, particularly in relation to the loading of insurance policies  that they can now sell. As the Member knows, we wanted to get the UK market  open again to Quinn Insurance, which has happened to all intents and purposes.  However, there has been a certain loading put on insurance policies, and there  are huge issues surrounding that. So, I am meeting the Irish Financial  Regulator tomorrow to bring those issues directly to him.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Obviously, it has been a difficult time for the financial  services sector. Market conditions for the international financial services  sector are likely to remain very challenging, and there is greater pressure on  firms to not only manage their exposure to risk, but to achieve greater  operational efficiency, which is where Northern Ireland comes into its own. We  should continue to put our emphasis on technology. Re-engineering excellence  creates a high demand for highly skilled professionals, which we have in Northern  Ireland. There are still opportunities for us in the financial services sector.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  Should there be new owners of the First Trust Bank, I thank the Minister for  her commitment to seeking a meeting with them to raise the issue of jobs. As she  said, that comes against the backdrop of the situation at Quinn Insurance and  the redeployment of staff from the Enniskillen planning office.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">If she has a meeting with new owners of the First Trust  Bank, I ask the Minister to take up the issue of services to rural communities.  It is not just the banks in the large towns that are very important; throughout  Fermanagh and Tyrone, many services are provided through local outlets of the  First Trust Bank. I would like the Minister to raise that with any new owners  of the bank.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment</strong>: I am more than happy to raise that issue,  because, like other banks, the First Trust Bank has retreated from rural areas.  We had a useful debate earlier about the value of credit unions to communities,  be they rural, urban or otherwise. In many cases, credit unions have taken up  the slack in cases where banks have retreated to more urban centres. Therefore,  I am more than happy to raise that issue with the First Trust Bank or its new  owners, whoever they are.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Neeson</strong>:  I, too, recently met employees of the First Trust Bank who are deeply concerned  about job losses if the sale goes through. Do the Minister of Enterprise, Trade  and Investment and the Finance Minister have any plans to meet their  counterparts in the Republic of Ireland to discuss the issue?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment</strong>: As I have already intimated, the decision  for the Allied Irish Bank is a commercial one. Invest NI will continue to meet,  and work with, the new buyer &mdash; whoever that may be &mdash; so that we can secure the  jobs in Northern Ireland. When there is a change of ownership, there is always  a fear that jobs will be lost, which I can understand. We want to ensure that  those jobs are kept within the financial services sector in Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Obviously, if there is a need to speak to our colleagues in  the Republic of Ireland, we will do so; however, it will be if there is a need  to do so, and not just for the sake of it.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  The Minister will be aware of realignments in the banking industry in Northern  Ireland. Are further bank amalgamations in the best interests of customers,  both savers and borrowers?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment</strong>: Whether I think that it is in the best  interests of customers or not, one could say that it is not really up to me. If  it happens, we will have to deal with whatever shape the banking sector takes.  One of our difficulties when the recession took hold was that we had no  indigenously owned bank in Northern Ireland; they were all owned by outside  interests. That is a difficulty for us. When we seek to meet the people in the  banks who matter, we sometimes have to go quite a distance to find them.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">However, banking and the wider financial services sector  certainly remains a critical sector for us with regard to services and  employment possibilities. The banks continue to tell the First Minister, the  deputy First Minister, the Finance Minister and me that they are open for  business and ready to do business with any sector. However, the Member will  know that the experience for a lot of people is very different, and there needs  to be a meeting of minds on those issues.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Next on the list for a question is Peter Weir.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>:  Question 3.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment</strong>: Question 2, even. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
      <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Foreign Direct Investment</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">2. <span class="BoldText">Mr Weir </span>asked the Minister  of Enterprise, Trade and Investment to outline how her Depart&shy;ment and the  Department for Employment and Learning are working more closely together to  encourage foreign direct investment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO  1189/10<a name="AQO1189/10" id="AQO1189/10"></a>)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment</strong>: On 25 January, I announced to the  Assembly that my Department and the Department for Employment and Learning  (DEL) would be working together to develop a model based on some of the  principles adopted in North Carolina. The responsive education system in North  Carolina was identified in the independent review of economic policy (IREP)  report. A working group of officials from Invest Northern Ireland and DEL is  looking at how those principles may apply to Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Under the banner of assured skills, we hope to have in  place a framework that will give potential investors the confidence that  Northern Ireland can satisfy their specific skills demands during the lifetime  of the investment. That group will also look at how DEL and Invest NI work  together more closely when engaging with companies that are interested in investing  in Northern Ireland, to make sure that we present the most positive business  solution.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  thank the Minister for her reply. What is the timescale for implementing the  working group&rsquo;s model?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment</strong>: Obviously, how we work together will be  an ongoing piece of work. A subgroup has been set up at ministerial level as a  result of an IREP recommendation. That will form part of this work, because we  want to see a more joined-up approach to investment, so that when people come  to invest in Northern Ireland they can be assured that the appropriate skills  are here and we can present an overall package to them. That has always been  the key behind this piece of work.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  Our closest competitor for foreign direct investment is the IDA in the Republic  of Ireland. They say that their strengths are their talent, technology, tax  regime and track record. Is the Minister satisfied that Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  strengths are equally as strong to attract foreign direct investment? What  weaknesses need to be addressed to ensure that additional jobs are created,  real jobs that will be sustainable and stay here in Northern Ireland?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment</strong>: I doubt whether I have enough time to  sell Northern Ireland in the way that I would like to sell Northern Ireland for  the Member. However, the Member clearly has in the back of his mind the  implications of a corporation tax cut for Northern Ireland. There is no doubt  that a reduced rate of corporation tax could act as a significant incentive to  help us to attract high-value-added foreign direct investment to Northern  Ireland. That said, however, it must be recognised that any reduction in  corporation tax would also need to be complemented with the supply of  appropriate skills, and that is what we are concentrating on in our work with  DEL. There also needs to be the telecommunications and roads infrastructure to  attract foreign direct investment.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Obviously, too &mdash; and there has been much talk about this  over the past couple of weeks &mdash; substantive costs are associated with  introducing a lower rate of corporation tax in Northern Ireland. It will not  surprise the Member to know that that issue will come under the attention of  the Executive subcommittee on the economy, and we will be discussing that at  our first meeting, which we hope will take place later this month.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Butler</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for her answer,  particularly what she said about working closely with DEL on the North Carolina  model. Will she also outline what her Department, along with DEL, has done to  implement the recent STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics)  review? As the Minister knows, the whole area of STEM subjects, and trying to create  jobs linked to those subjects, is an important area for the economy.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment</strong>: The Minister of Education sits on that  subgroup, along with me and the Minister for Employment and Learning.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm<span style="font-family:'ITC Franklin Gothic Book'; "> </span></p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The work on the STEM subjects will form part of the  discussions on the new economic strategy for Northern Ireland. Invest Northern  Ireland and DEL have also established formal collaborative groups and are  working together to optimise resources in tightening times, to promote economic  growth and to develop a culture of enterprise and entrepreneurship. There is a  great deal of interaction between Invest Northern Ireland and DEL. I thank the  Minister for Employment and Learning for encouraging that interaction and for  his strategy, which emphasises leadership. Local companies will need to develop  those leadership skills when more foreign direct investment comes into Northern  Ireland. I am sure that the House agrees with that.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Question 3 has been withdrawn.</p>
      <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Universities: Innovation</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">4. <span class="BoldText">Ms Lo </span>asked the Minister of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment what discussions she has had with the Minister  for Employment and Learning on linkages with Queen&rsquo;s University and the  University of Ulster to translate innovation into businesses.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 1191/10<a name="AQO1191/10" id="AQO1191/10"></a>)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment</strong>: The successful commercialisation of  R&amp;D and innovation by our academic institutions is a critical part of the  Programme for Government&rsquo;s aim of increasing private sector productivity to  enhance the wealth of Northern Ireland. Although I have had no direct  discussions with my colleague on that specific issue, my Department and the  Department for Employment and Learning work closely with the two universities  and with businesses on a wide range of initiatives. Many of those initiatives  are set out in the regional innovation strategy action plan and include, for  example, the Northern Ireland Spin-Out fund, which supports start-up,  early-stage businesses and university spin-outs in Northern Ireland and the  work that is being done to implement the recommendations of MATRIX, which is  the science industry panel.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: I  thank the Minister for her response. As she knows, we have some of the  brightest students here in Northern Ireland. Only last month, a group of  students from Queen&rsquo;s University came third in the UK final of an international  competition for young entrepreneurs. Should there be a particular programme to  help our young graduates to become entrepreneurs and turn their innovative  ideas into reality?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment</strong>: A large amount of money has been spent on  encouraging our young graduates, particularly through the universities&rsquo;  spin-out programmes. One of our most successful companies, Andor Technologies,  which was a spin-out organisation, has recently been floated on the stock  market and has been a huge success. We also have an innovation fund, of which  the Member may or may not be aware. The Executive allocated almost &pound;90 million  to that fund for a three-year period that began in 2008. It is designed to  encourage Northern Ireland businesses to spend more on research and development  and innovation. One may ask how that is linked to our university graduates. The  answer is that key projects supported by that fund sponsor 300 PhDs and  studentships in areas of economic relevance. The Member is absolutely right  about the calibre of our students, and we are concentrating on using the  abilities of our brightest students to grow the economy of Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Much more is happening, particularly as a result of the  work of the MATRIX panel, which links university research to markets. We do not  want just to become bogged down in academia, and we are focusing the research  on markets, rather than on technology, to determine the worth of that approach  to the economy. I support the ongoing work because it is the key to the growth  of our economy in the next 25 years.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr McDonnell</strong>:  I thank the Minister and urge her to do all in her power to move along  opportunities for bright young graduates. My attention was drawn recently to  the efforts of the Northern Ireland Economic Reform Group to address the issue  of corporation tax. It struck me that, perhaps, the Minister might be able to  give us some information about that. We have talked before about an Ulster  business school. Have there any discussions about, or progress on, the joint  establishment of such a school by the two universities? I was concerned that  the Northern Ireland Economic Reform Group was a voluntary body and that we  needed something substantial and sustainable.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment</strong>: We have not had any further discussions  about that issue. I am happy to discuss the Member&rsquo;s ideas with him, because we  did not follow up the matter after he last raised it with me. It would be  helpful to do that in the near future.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gardiner</strong>:  Has the Minister any specific plans to attract innovators in the green economy  to set up operations for research, development, innovation and high-value  manufacturing?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment</strong>: One of our commercialisations, if you  like, of research and development in the green energy area is QUESTOR. A huge  amount of work has been carried out in relation to the green economy, not least  by my own interdepartmental working group on energy, which is focusing one of  its subgroups on jobs in the green economy. During the recent election  campaign, a lot of Members raised the issue of the green economy being the way  forward and the answer to finding jobs; I agree with that. A lot of good work  is going on in Invest Northern Ireland and I am quite happy to share specifics  of that with any Members if they so require it.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I thank the Minister for that detailed response. Following on from the points  that she already made, what specific measures or programmes have been put in  place to encourage technology or knowledge transfer?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment</strong>: As I said, a range of measures and  support programmes are directed at encouraging greater linkages between  businesses and the universities, not least because of the work that has been  carried out by the MATRIX panel. I do not have time to list them all, but some  examples are the knowledge transfer partnerships and the proof of concept  schemes. Since 2002, through the knowledge transfer partnerships, Invest NI has  contributed more than &pound;10 million to 220 projects.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">At a lower level, if you like, there is also the innovation  voucher scheme. That is a very interesting scheme whereby companies can use  their vouchers to buy-in university help for an idea that they may have for  growth or innovation in their business. Some of the smallest companies in  Northern Ireland have used that innovation voucher scheme to great success, and  it just shows how little things can make such a big difference to small  companies.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Maskey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Will the Minister detail the amount of  money that her Department has spent on research and development in the further  education sector?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment</strong>: Is that specifically for the education  sector?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Maskey</strong>:  Yes.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment</strong>: I will have to write to the Member about  that because I do not have the specific details here.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Question 5 has been withdrawn.</p>
      <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Oil Prices</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">6. <span class="BoldText">Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n </span>asked the  Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment to outline any discussions her  Department, or any of its agencies, has had with the major oil companies to  ensure more transparency in their pricing system.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 1193/10<a name="AQO1193/10" id="AQO1193/10"></a>)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment</strong>: Northern Ireland fuel prices respond to  fluctuating wholesale prices that are set internationally and are outside the  control of my Department. Additionally, fuel duty and tax, which accounts for  around 62% of the final pump price of petrol, is set by Her Majesty&rsquo;s Treasury.  Although my Department has not been in discussion with the major oil companies  on their pricing systems, the Consumer Council for Northern Ireland has called  on oil companies operating in Northern Ireland to provide consumers with the  necessary price transparency so that they can decide whether they are paying a  fair price for their heating oil. I strongly support that call.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her answer. Could the Minister use her influence to  ensure that the rising cost of fuel does not affect any of our sectors,  particularly the transport sector? If the cost of fuel continues to rise, it  will have an impact on that sector, certainly through job losses.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment</strong>: I noted at the last North/South  Ministerial Council meeting on transport that a North/South freight forum has  been set up to look at a whole range of issues, including regulation. I am sure  that that group will want to look at the issue of the price of fuel for  hauliers. I accept that that is one of the issues that is really hampering the  development of some of our companies, in so far as the amount of money that it  takes to get their goods to places is increasing exponentially because of the  cost of fuel. I recognise that and I am more than happy to work on that issue  with either the Consumer Council or colleagues.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>: I  thank the Minister for outlining the issues about that particular matter. Could  she give some more information on what her Department has been doing,  particularly around the issue of fuel poverty, given the impact that all such  matters, particularly the rise in fuel costs, have on many families on a  day-to-day basis?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment</strong>: The Member and the House are aware that,  as economy Minister, my primary focus is on business competitiveness and that  the Minister for Social Development leads on fuel poverty. However, we stand  ready to assist in any way, particularly on energy consumption and energy  efficiency measures. We give that much attention.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Utility Regulator has undertaken a policy and option  analysis on the implementation of social tariffs in Northern Ireland as a means  of easing fuel poverty. Public consultation closed recently on a paper  concerning assistance with affordability concerns for vulnerable energy  consumers. However &mdash; I have made this point in the past &mdash; the impact of social  tariff changes would need to be considered carefully and, indeed, receive  political endorsement.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The rationale behind social tariffs is that those in fuel  poverty pay less, but the cost of that is borne by the rest of the domestic  customers and business customers. We know how much pressure some of our large  energy users were under at the end of 2009 and at the beginning of 2010 because  of their energy bills. Although it may look attractive to go down that road, we  need to consider all the elements carefully before making any quick decision.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>: The  Minister referred to the Consumer Council&rsquo;s report on road fuels, which was  published in the past couple of days. Will she advise the House whether her  Department or any of its agencies have undertaken any studies on different fuel  pricing across Northern Ireland? I am thinking of fuels other than road fuels.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment</strong>: If the Member is referring to home fuels,  the Consumer Council has an oil price watch on its website. It checks oil  suppliers&rsquo; prices three times a week to find out the cheapest and then alerts  people to where they can get the cheapest oil price. The oil industries in the  UK and in the Republic of Ireland are unregulated. The reasons for that are the  competitive nature of the industry and the fact that wholesale prices are set  internationally and are, therefore, outside our scope in Northern Ireland.  Further&shy;more, regulation would create additional costs for the consumer, which  I want to avoid at this time. The Consumer Council will continue its good work,  for which I commend it. However, no regulation will come into the market any  time soon.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  Does the Minister agree that, in addition to considering prices, we must examine  the energy efficiency of homes and businesses to combat the cost of heating  oil? Does she also agree that we should consider the balance of our transport  investment and increase investment in public transport in particular?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment</strong>: The second question is for another  Minister, so I will steer clear of it.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I commend the work that the Carbon Trust does with the  business community on energy efficiency. Some businesses have benefited greatly  from the advice of the Carbon Trust. Indeed, I know of a Ballymena company that  now knows the efficiency of each machine as it operates during the day. The  Carbon Trust does a good job with the business community, and it is the  business community that I am most concerned about. More can always be done on  energy efficiency. I encourage businesses to consider the option of renewable  energy when they are seeking to change. Some businesses have done that because  of high oil prices over the past while.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member who was due to ask question 7 is not in her place.</p>
      <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Invest NI: Agrifood</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">8. <span class="BoldText">Mr Hamilton </span>asked the  Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment what Invest NI is doing to  capitalise on the strengths of the agrifood industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 1195/10<a name="AQO1195/10" id="AQO1195/10"></a>)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment</strong>: Since 2002, Invest Northern Ireland has  offered almost &pound;73 million of assistance to the Northern Ireland food and drink  sector. In the past year alone, Invest NI leveraged total investment of more  than &pound;95 million in the sector, which created an additional &pound;25 million of  wages and salaries for our economy. Under arrangements that were agreed by the  Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment (DETI) and the Department of  Agriculture and Rural Development (DARD) in 2008, an interdepartmental group of  senior officials from DETI, Invest Northern Ireland, DARD and DEL were tasked  with liaising with an agrifood industry advisory panel. The food strategy that  was developed as part of the process is a prime example of how we are  capitalising on the strengths of the sector.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">3.30 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Invest Northern Ireland continues to engage actively with  the sector. In the past 18 months, one-to-one buying sessions have been held  for local companies with all the biggest food retailers in the British Isles  and Europe. More than 800 face to face meetings have been arranged in the past  12 months, and 80 local companies have achieved 275 product listings with  multiples such as Marks and Spencer, Sainsbury&rsquo;s, Tesco and Asda. The new  business achieved as a result totals &pound;50 million, and that figure is growing.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her reply. She has outlined how critical the agrifood  industry is to the Northern Ireland economy, much of which is export driven.  Will the Minister comment on a campaign launched recently by Bord Bia in the  Irish Republic that seems to be aimed at preventing Northern Ireland companies  from doing business in that very important market?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment</strong>: The agrifood sector contributes 14% of  manu&shy;facturing gross value added and 15<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; ">&middot;</span>2%  of our exported manufactured goods. That is why I am concerned about the  campaign in the Republic of Ireland, particularly against our milk and poultry.  I wrote today to Brendan Smith, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and  Food, about what I perceive as protectionism in the Republic of Ireland market.  I am disappointed that the Republic has taken that action, which has  ramifications for its access to the mainland market. The Government in the  Republic must reconsider; if they close off the Republic&rsquo;s market to goods from  Northern Ireland, there may well be consequences.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P J Bradley</strong>:  What level of exchange does the Minister have with her Executive colleague the  Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development on matters pertaining to the  agrifood industry?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment</strong>: Together with the Agriculture Minister, I  set up the industry panel in 2008 to look at the strategy for agrifood and to  drive it forward. My officials have a particularly good working relationship  with DARD officials in that area because of the importance of the agrifood sector.  Not that long ago, people had written off that sector and said that it would  not grow. However, during the recession, it has proven to be one of our  strongest sectors.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I was delighted to be able to make a huge investment  recently in Dale Farm. That was a sign of confidence in the future of the  sector. I hope that the agrifood sector goes from strength to strength.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  That concludes Question Time.</p>
